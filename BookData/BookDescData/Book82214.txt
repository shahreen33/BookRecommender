Meet the penguins! They really want to make some new friends. But does anyone want to play? When two penguins arrive from a faraway place and want to make friends, the other animals do not want to play with them. If only they would give the penguins a chance, they might discover how wonderful they really are! A funny story about welcoming others - brilliantly written and illustrated by best-selling author of Ten Little Superheroes, Mike Brownlow.
