I protect what’s mine. The ranch, my family, our buried secrets.  Nothing will stop me from reassembling the life that went terribly wrong. Not the law. Not our enemies. Not even Maybe Quinn.  The gorgeous, quarrelsome journalist shouldn’t have meddled. I shouldn’t have let her stay. But she’s hiding something in those deceptive blue eyes. Something deeper than her thirst for a news story.  I make a deal with her to buy time. To unravel her lies. To play with her. To satisfy my darker appetites. When she buckles beneath my belt, I’ll send her away. Unless I buckle first.
