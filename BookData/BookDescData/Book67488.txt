  
    Where no hope is left, is left no fear
  
My familiar brings us word. Another one of my mates has their life on the line with this deadly game with the Hellhounds and the mysterious Prince of Hell. They don’t seem to know Lilith is on our side. We have our secrets too. The game strikes a little too close to home and I’m in a fighting mood. It’s time to fight back. I have this idea I can play the Hellhounds like they’ve been trying to play me. My little game goes a little too far as my angel gifts start appearing when I’m not trying to call them.My list of allies is growing. The Warlock Council is on our side and Lilith has brought in the Lust Demon Council. We have more Hellhound allies now too. We know who is behind trying to kill my mates. Lilith is not taking the attempt on Keane’s life lightly. She has a plan and all I know about Lilith’s plots is that they are devious and they always work.
  
    We were warned something big was in the works. We all should have taken that a lot more seriously because the Prince has made his move and the people I love are in danger.
