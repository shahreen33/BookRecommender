Amelia Green is relocating across the country to be the new physical therapist for her dad’s NFL team. She’s ready for the change of scenery, but she’s unprepared for the two hulking football players who want to make her theirs.  Wes and Dean have been inseparable since the day they met. They even went to the same college and were drafted to the same team. They’ve known their whole lives that they wanted one woman to share. And the day they lay eyes on Amelia they know she’s the one.  Warning: These guys are over the top but head over heels for the one they love. This ménage is filled with double the alphas, double the possession, and double the ache. Come play with us!
