But when shattered promises and dark magic collide, no one is safe...For six hundred years, Fenear, a land where humans can take wolf form, has warred with Maenor, its neighboring kingdom ruled by a ruthless dynasty.

Yet, when Rhael proposes to her to strengthen the alliance, she agrees for the sake of her country, despite her family's objections and a blossoming romance with her best friend. Suspicion of treachery changes Rayna's decision, but before she can annul the agreement, powerful forces subdue her with a sinister hex. Separated from her pack with Fenear and everyone she loves in danger, Rayna must escape and travel to a distant realm to break the hex. Only then can she save her best friend and her homeland.Lines blur between heroism and recklessness, dreams and reality, even life and death, and Rayna risks losing herself along the way.
