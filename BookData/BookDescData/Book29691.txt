Five footprints are the only sign that Daniel Buck was ever here. And now they are all his mother has left.Every day, Anna Buck guards the little prints in the cement. Polishing them to a shine. Keeping them safe. Spiralling towards insanity. When a psychic offers hope, Anna grasps it. Who wouldn't? Maybe he can tell her what happened to her son ...But is this man what he claims to be?
