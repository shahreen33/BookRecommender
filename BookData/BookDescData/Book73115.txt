This book explores the ways in which the organization of interior space can be developed from the initial concept through to the planning of a project. The straightforward text explains strategies, processes, and methods that can be employed to transform an initial brief into an interior that provides an appropriate response to the project's demands. This is backed up with a wealth of visual material including photographs and specially created diagrams and models. Case studies and step-by-step exercises further illustrate the application of the principles and approaches introduced in the text. This is an invaluable practical and inspirational guide to a subject that all students of spatial design must master.
