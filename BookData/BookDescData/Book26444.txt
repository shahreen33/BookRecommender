We came from nothing and were given a second chance at life, and life was pretty good until it tipped on its axis and my world came tumbling down around me. My Baby Sister is missing…Stolen…Lost… I’ve never felt this helpless before now, the vacant hole inside me expanding with each passing second of not knowing where she is. What’s she going through? Is she hurt?Suffering?Alive? The more I learn of her disappearance the more fear implants itself inside my heart, hardening - darkening. The world is a depraved place, full of evil lurking behind normality.Behind smiles. Behind deception and facades. She needs me and I will do whatever it takes to find her. Whatever. Whatever.
