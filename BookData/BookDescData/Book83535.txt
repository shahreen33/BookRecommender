Aging is universally dreaded by men and women alike, but it is the very subject author and humorist Ruth Yunker tackles in Baby, I'm The Boss Of Me. Filled with elegant and humorous essays taken from her own life, it is an exuberant appeal to fearlessly embrace the grace of growing older using the powerful forces of humor and optimism. Yunker's vignettes provide enlightening and quixotic examples as to how to tackle what promises to be a rich, wonderful and indeed amazing experience, if allowed.
