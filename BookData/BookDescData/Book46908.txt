Thomas hears voices, the most prominent of which is that of a demon called Dinn. The demon re-frames Thomas' declining mental health as a kind of nightmarish adventure, an opportunity to leave behind the world that he has known and join the forces of hell.When Thomas takes the demon at his word, applying himself to his so-called training, he finds himself being called upon to perform unspeakable acts. But Dinn has painted the world in such dark, forbidding colours that soon Thomas lacks both the will and the means to seek the help he so desperately needs.
