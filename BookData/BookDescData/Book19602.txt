We each are but a grain of sand on a beach, a cog in a great time piece. We are surrounded, yet solitary, wanting to be part of the whole while aching to be individual. We search for those special connections, reaching out with hope but holding back with trepidation, our hearts wanting one thing when our minds are saying something different. Yet within this battle, despite the scars, we somehow manage to find love, hope, companionship, and purpose, ultimately without surrendering our ability to find that necessary peace within ourselves. We Walk Alone examines the journeys we take in our head. It's about the struggle to connect with people and the world around us.
