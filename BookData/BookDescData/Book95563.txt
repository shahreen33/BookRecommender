This bilingual collection contains some of the best work of Chilean master poet Nicanor Parra, translated by the luminaries he inspired, including W. S. Merwin, Allen Ginsberg, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. In work spanning 30 years (1955-1985), Parra, the pioneer of "antipoetry," remains fresh, bold, and inventive, deftly and humorously subverting convention. Editor David Unger brings together poems from Parra's groundbreaking collection Poemas y antipoemas, the witty aphorisms of Artefactos, and his original and uncompromising later work.
