She was my princess.I was her psycho.Two worlds colliding with a BOOM.There was a sh*tstorm brewing. Whispers. Rumbles. A rot—fueled by greed and protected by corruption—that’d seeped like sewage, eating away at everything it touched. The only people I trusted were my brother by blood, my brothers by patch, and the crazy Irish-Scottish bastard I did jobs for.That was why, when the hot-as-hell blonde started trailing my brothers and me, I had to act.Maybe Ophelia Kline was working with the enemy—playing me with lies from that damn mouth. Or maybe she was innocent—caught in the spread of toxic rot.Either way, she was mine. And when push came to glock-in-the-face, I wouldn’t let her go.Because all good relationships start with a BOOM and a little kidnapping… right?~~~~This is a Happily Ever Alpha novel featuring crossover from the Hyde Series and Aurora Rose Reynolds' Until Series. It can be read as a standalone, but it's recommended you read Until Nox first since a certain accented someone shows up often.Warning: Not recommended for readers under the age of 18 due to alllll the good things: Adult language. Adult situations. Biker hotties who work in the gray. And an OTT hero who knows what he wants when he gets hit by the BOOM.
