For Jake, a perilous journey of survival will soon turn into a quest for redemption...A terrible virus has struck and the world has deteriorated into chaos. And with the infected now outnumbering their human counterparts, chances for survival lessen with each passing day. After running out of food in his condo, Jake must make his way across the Salt Lake Valley to reach the safety of the mountains, and he must use his wiles to avoid the packs of infected roaming the streets. But Jake is haunted by a devastating personal tragedy he can't let go of, and his journey of survival quickly turns into a quest for redemption.Just as heâ€™s about to reach the safety of the mountains, a phone call changes everything. A woman and her child need help and Jake finally sees an opportunity to redeem himself. But will his helping them put them in harm's way? Jake is being stalked by a brutal and sadistic alpha (by far the most dangerous of the infected). In the end, Jake will have to decide how far he's willing to go to keep them safe and earn the redemption he seeks.
