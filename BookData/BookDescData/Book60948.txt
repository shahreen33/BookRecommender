Escape with Leo and Zak in outback Australia as they discover it sometimes takes time, distance, and interfering family to amalgamate.After five years of living in the UK, it's time for Leo to return home to his dad's stud farm in outback Australia. He has no idea what to expect when he arrives. He didn't exactly leave with balloons and banners. Nope. His farewell involved destruction and his own heart split in two. He knows seeing the man who's always held his heart, Zak, is going to be awkward. The older farm manager made his feelings pretty damn clear when Leo hightailed it out of there. Leo quickly figures out life is going to get complicated and a whole heap more exciting as his trip home becomes so much more. Amalgamated is a fun and steamy M/M short story in Becca Seymour's Coming Home series. Stand-alone romances complete with heat, wit, and happily ever afters.
