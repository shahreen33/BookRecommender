Global Issues and Adult Educationbrings together seven years of cutting-edge research and analysis from the Cyril O. Houle Scholars in Adult and Continuing Education. These emerging leaders in the field investigate the importance of adult education in responding to the challenges of global issues. The book is divided into five sections, each of which examines one overarching topic--globalization and the market economy, marginalized populations, environment and health, community empowerment, and lifelong learning and educational systems. Each section begins with an introduction that provides a framework for understanding the overarching issues and summarizes the chapters in the section.
