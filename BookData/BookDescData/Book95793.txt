Carter Montgomery knows exactly what he wants and needs in life. A wife. A home.A family. And lastly, a career. Just when he thought he had it all and would soon be checking off each of those boxes, everything changed. A girl can only take so much before she loses hope and resigns herself to a life that is nothing like the one she’d dreamed of, but everything can change in a moment, for better or worse. One call is all it takes for me. One call to help someone and I’m staring face-to-face with the picture of a life my heart desperately yearns for. A life I wasn’t sure was in the cards for me, but could I be wrong? Maybe there is that “someone special” for everyone. The question is, how do you actually know they’re the one when you’ve been wrong before and have the scars to prove it?Everything can change in a moment and holding on is the only option.
