Logan Wilmont dreams of freedom, but he’s trapped in a mental institution where he doesn’t belong, by a mother who wants to keep him quiet. He knows he quirky, but not insane—except for when he sees the other boy who looks just like him.  His only hope is Rox MacFarlane, an ex-CIA agent who specializes in extractions. Hired by Logan’s aunt, Rox and her partner Marty agree to take on their most difficult case. Penetrating a locked facility is challenging enough, but Logan’s hallucinations work against them, and at times, they’re not even sure they can trust their client.  Yet Rox’s own autism makes her empathize with the teenager, and she’s determined to break him out. As she and Marty plan a rescue, a reporter who’s investigating the psychiatric hospital is brutally murdered, and the clock starts ticking for Logan. Can the Extractors free the boy before his mother silences his secrets once and for all?
