You're a 15-year-old schoolgirl who has big dreams of becoming a pop star, and then one day you get your lucky break. Polydor records sends you to Copenhagen to make pop music - to make you a recording artist. You get back home and your future is looking brighter than ever - until the High Court writ hits the door mat - you've fallen out with your management and they have decided to sue. No, this isn't a dream, this is now Vicky Nolan's reality and fast becoming a nightmare, and all while still at school at the sweet age of sixteen.Read about the trial, the family, Hollywood, London town, the glamour, the dog (eh?) and most importantly, the music. Curiouser and curiouser?We always talk about 'making it' and fulfilling your dreams. The question is, what if you don't? What happens next? Ultimately, this book speaks about life and family; its hopes and disappointments, its ups and downs. Scrapbook of an Unfound Songstress is in some way a story that speaks to us all, because in the end, the best stories are always true."I'm living my life as consequence of yesterday.And all of my choices compliment my life today.There may have been times I could have gone and lost my way, I could have, I would have, I should have, I don't care - I'm here now."See the stories and hear the music@YouTube 'Scrapbook of an Unfound Songstress'
