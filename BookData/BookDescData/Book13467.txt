In Captured Bride, Book 2 of The Bride Series, billionaire Blake Harper would do anything in his power to capture the heart of the delectable Michelin Chef, Amber Summers.  “I don’t have time for, nor am I interested in a fling."  Amber Summers was having a hard enough time dealing with a food critic who was doing their best to destroy her reputation and, in the process, close her restaurant doors ... for good. But also dealing with the magnetic attraction of the first man who managed to make her forget her inhibitions was more than she could handle. Until she realized her one moment of weakness had come with a very hefty price.  “Say yes, Blondie. You know you want to.”  Blake Harper was after one thing: capturing the enticing little chef's heart. He had no interest in a short-term love affair. He'd been there, done that. Now, he was ready to settle down. He would have what he was after, no matter what, until a favor for a friend backfired and threatened the future he coveted.  Love doesn't always come easy, especially if there's a determined third party intent on creating chaos.  Sparks fly as Amber and Blake try to weave their way through a white-hot maze of lies and deceit. Will their love survive the flames?  Editor’s note: Mouth-watering in more ways than one: have your wine, your favorite dessert, and any other fun items you'd like at your near disposal as you traverse this landscape of mental man-candy, scrumptious food, and sizzzzzling sparks.
