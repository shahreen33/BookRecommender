A new standalone romantic comedy from USA Today bestselling author JJ Knight Girlfriends, grab a margarita and pull up a chair. I CAN call you girlfriend, right?  Where I come from, girlfriends are the ones who know about that time you used rolled up toilet paper as a tampon.  And how you once wired your bra closed with a binder clip at work when the hook broke and your boobs made a run for the border.  And ALL about that walk of shame when your panties fell out of your purse in the Uber ride.  So come on now, plunk your cute little booty in a chair. (Do you do Pilates for that booty? I tried Pilates and sprained my girl parts.) Get that drink in your hand and listen up.  Because I met four hot men and somehow ended up on a cruise with all of them. Girlfriends, I have a STORY to tell. ________ Full-length standalone HEA reverse harem comedy. Love without limits. #whychoose
