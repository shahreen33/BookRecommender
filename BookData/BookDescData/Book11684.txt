I loved him at fifteen. I thought we’d stand the test of time. He was my forever but maybe I fell too fast or loved him too much. Maybe I came on too strong or maybe I did something wrong. He still left. Turned his back on me without a word. I never thought I’d see him again and to be honest, I didn’t want to. I began to hate him even though he would never know it. But then, I did see him again and with him came the secrets that would forever change all of our lives. She was only a recurring dream in my foggy unconscious. A voice. A face. We weren’t supposed to dream. We weren’t supposed to remember. They said it was impossible and the before would never come into the now. None of the others remember, at least not that I know of. What I do know is that she was my everything, my every waking breath. Now that I’ve found her I will not be losing her a second time. She will be mine again, no matter what the cost.
