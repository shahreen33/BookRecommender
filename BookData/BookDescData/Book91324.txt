One treasure down, two to go …  Three months ago, I nearly lost my best friend while retrieving the first instrument of assassination. I also inadvertently released a rival who was definitely unhinged, way more powerful than me, and obsessed with harnessing the deadly power of the artifacts I’d been tasked by the guardian dragons to collect.  Add a sexy sentinel and a nearly immortal vampire to the mix, and what could possibly go wrong?  Knowing my luck, I was about to find out.  -------------------- This 74k word urban fantasy by Meghan Ciana Doidge is the fifth book in the Dowser series.  WARNING: ADULT 18+ CONTENT
