Branna Murphy is broken. For months now she has been a part of a one-sided relationship to a man she loves more than life itself. She prayed for a miracle, and hoped something would change, but found that was wishful thinking. Talking didn’t work. Shouting didn’t work. Crying didn’t work. Nothing bloody worked. Ryder Slater is furious. For months now he has been lying to a woman he would take a bullet for in order to protect her. He is involved in something that goes deeper than his old past, and if he strays off target, people will start to die. People he loves. He couldn’t talk. He couldn’t slip up. He couldn’t lose focus. He couldn’t do a damn thing. Things between Ryder and Branna are at rock bottom, and Ryder knows it. Not only will he be taking on a force that could destroy his whole family, but he will be battling tooth and nail to save his relationship and keep the love of his life by his side. Ryder targeted Branna from the first moment he saw her, and what Ryder targets, Ryder dominates.
