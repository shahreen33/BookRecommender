Toast on Toast is the must-have book for all budding actorsâ€”and non-actors too. In this part memoir, part "how to act" manual, Steven Toast draws on his vast and varied experiences, providing the reader with an invaluable insight into his journey from school plays to RADA, and from "It's a Right Royal Knockout" to the Colony Club. Toast on Toast contains all the surreal humor of the TV show.
