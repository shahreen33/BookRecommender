Joe Gunther and the VBI team are investigating a murder and an arson case--both potentially related to an outbreak of ebola.When the body of a young woman is found near a trail at a popular ski mountain, the case falls to Joe Gunther and his team at the Vermont Bureau of Investigation (VBI). They quickly have a suspect, Mick Durocher, and a confession, but not everyone on the team is convinced. Despite Mick's ready admission, investigators quickly sense there might be more going on than is immediately apparent.At the same time, a large local business is being targeted with escalating acts of vandalism--a warehouse fire, a vandalized truck, a massive cooling system destroyed--resulting in loss of life. And either by coincidence, or not, Mick Durocher, the self-confessed murderer, was once employed by this very company.These two puzzling cases--now possibly connected--are further complicated by the sidelining of a key member of VBI, Willy Kunkle, who undergoes surgery at a hospital that appears to be having an unlikely--and suspiciously timed--outbreak of Ebola.Joe and his team pursue these cases, uncovering motives that might link them, while proving that trust betrayed can be a toxic virus, turning love into murderous loathing. Indeed, behind the mayhem and murder, Joe must uncover a tragic history before another victim dies.
