Chronic loser Rebecca Alton is penniless, homeless, and sleeping on her sister’s couch. She needs a job, fast, but in this economy finding one is easier said than done. When she accidentally walks into the wrong office and finds herself auditioning for the role of babysitter to the out-of-control members of the up and coming rock band The Lonely Kings of Lifeless Things, can she pull it off? And considering who her boss would be–the band’s bassist, manager, and undisputed king of bad attitudes Kent Hudson–would she even want the job? Rebecca isn’t sure. In fact, she’s not sure of much in her life, except one thing: Kent wants her, she wants him back, and the underlying animal attraction between them makes her interview rough, in more ways than one!Exclusive Interview is a 19,200 word novelette, and is the first in the Rock Arrangement series.
