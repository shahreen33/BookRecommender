Fleeing the humiliation and pain of a cancelled society wedding, Elspeth resolves to leave everything behind while she restores an ancient but beautiful mill in the depths of rural France. The last thing she needs is an arrogant, but incredibly handsome neighbour upsetting her days. Desperate to escape from the endless worry of an arranged marriage and hoping for nothing more than a friendly chat to someone who doesn't fawn over his title and money, Leo goes to welcome a new neighbour. The perfect view of Elspeth’s deliciously shapely rear, as she taps tiles into place on the ancient mill roof, is the last thing he expects to see. A short romance to idle the few weeks before his impending doom is one thing, but falling madly and hopelessly in love hadn't been on his agenda. Having it whack him right between the eyes is an unexpected bolt out of the blue. His life will never be the same again. Can Leo save his sanity, his inheritance and his fabulous Château in France while keeping his identity secret from the lovely woman he wants? And after discovering his deceit, can Elspeth live without the love of the charming French gardener who has stolen far more than her heart and soul? This book is suitable for New Adult upwards due to adult content.
