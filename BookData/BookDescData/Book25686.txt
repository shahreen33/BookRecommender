Alternate cover edition of ASIN B0749GQT4KThe gripping conclusion of the bestselling Fire and Ice Trilogy! I'd thought the threat from Seattle was finished. That we showed up in time and took care of business.  I hate being wrong. It really ruins my day.  When Roger, the alpha of the North American pack, shows up at my door with the news that a demon has made it to the Underworld with knowledge of me, some hard decisions have to be made.  Do I stay above ground, with all my magical friends, and wait for the battle to come to me? Or do I seek the demon out, and pluck the threat out by the root?  I don’t want my friends to die on my behalf. I could never life with myself. But if I venture into the Underworld, it’ll be the most perilous journey of my life.  This time, it isn’t just my life hanging in the balance, it is my eternity.
