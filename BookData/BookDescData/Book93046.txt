Anyone who wants to experience all of God's blessings must forgive others--totally forgive them. This best-selling author of the United Kingdom explains that forgiveness is as spectacular as any miracle. It may even be a feat greater than climbing Mount Everest, but when you discover what forgiveness is truly all about, there is incredible joy and freedom! Written with clarity and biblical principles, Kendall helps readers understand the consequences that happen when your heart harbors grudges and when you choose not to forgive.
