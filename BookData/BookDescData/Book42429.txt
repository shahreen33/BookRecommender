Previously published as I, Porn Star. People call me many things: CEO, billionaire, bastard. Q.I love women. I love sex. I love money. I love hot, wild nights with no promise of a future, because a future is one thing I don't have. I'm twenty-eight years old. I won't live to see thirty, and I don't care. Or I didn't, until her. Nobody plans for a life like this. Some of us just end up here. They call me Lucky, though luck has never been on my side. Before I met Q, my life was a big, twisted mess. Never enough money, never anyone to trust. No way out. With Q, the shame and fear disappear. Instead I feel pure pleasure, and that's something I've never had before. But if what I've just learned is true, we'd better enjoy every second together while we can...before our time runs out.
