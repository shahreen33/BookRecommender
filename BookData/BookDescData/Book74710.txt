From Serj Tankian, lead vocalist for critically acclaimed band System of a Down, comes a striking debut poetry collection highlighting his best work of the past eight years.  Like System of a Down's platinum-selling second album, Toxicity -- hailed by Rolling Stone as "a bouquet of smart rock and ardent social argument" and by SPIN as "the sound of now" -- Tankian's poetic style is willfully eclectic. Sometimes introspective, sometimes direct and cutting, these poems deal with subjects as wide-ranging as euthanasia and the nature of time itself.  Featuring original artwork created by Sako Shahinian, a young Los AngelesÂ­based artist, Cool Gardens is honest, heartfelt, and humorous -- a talented artist at his uncompromising best.
