A guarded heart is a lonely heart . . .  Piper Davies is a leading researcher in the fields of viruses and nanotechnology. All she ever wanted was to help save lives. But her newest creation has the potential to be manipulated to kill a single person, as well as launch a global pandemic if it ever landed in the wrong hands. And unfortunately, someone knows what she’s created and will stop at nothing to get it. Piper's family hires someone to protect her when the threats become dangerous.  Security specialist Aiden Creed knew all too well what someone would do to get their hands on Piper’s viral nanotech creation. His time in the British Army’s Special Air Service exposed him to the true evil that hid throughout the world. What he didn’t count on when he accepted this assignment was the danger Piper posed to his heart.
