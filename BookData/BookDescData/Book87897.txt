Kaden Hansen was my whole world. I fell head over heels. And then he cheated on me. Or so I thought. I’m pretty sure, okay? Anyway, I ran away and refused to talk to him again. But what if I was wrong?  I don’t trust men. My ex cheated on me with my cousin. In our bed. And Kaden, my boyfriend, well… I think he cheated on me, too. Confidence is a fragile thing, and mine is already shattered. So I flew back to Chicago, putting distance between us before Kaden could hurt me more. I’ve sworn off men for good, focusing on my work and waiting for the pain to fade. I’m over Kaden. Really, I swear. I don’t love him anymore. It’s over. Only a miracle could throw us back together at this point… and who believes in those, right?  ***This is a standalone, novella-length romance with a HEA and no cliffhanger or cheating. It can however be read as the sequel to CAVEMAN as it is about Matt Hansen's brother and his second chance at love. It contains the prequel to UNDONE (Troublemaker) and the wedding of Matt and Octavia (from CAVEMAN). ***
