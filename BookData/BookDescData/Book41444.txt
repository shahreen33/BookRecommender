Synopsis: Much of modern life is based on the assumption that happiness comes from economic prosperity. Many -- politicians, media and citizens alike -- seem to assume the goal of government is to keep the economy moving. Here, Nic Marks argues that the blind pursuit of economic growth has created an environment that actually undermines our happiness. He offers some bold suggestions on how nations and people can return to a shared common purpose: nurturing well-being.About the author: Nic Marks is the founder of the Centre for Well-Being, an independent think tank at the New Economics Foundation in London.
