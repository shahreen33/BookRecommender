Because of unfortunate circumstances, Russel has to live with a frog. A slimy disgusting frog. So gross! Considering he hates frogs the most (What was his name...Varen? Whatever, it's not important). Yet Russel can't move on from the past. Its probably up to Varen to pull him out of his funk. That is if Russel will let this gross, disgusting frog do it.complete webcomic can be read here: http://iafs.smackjeeves.com/comics/16... Available in print with its prequel.
