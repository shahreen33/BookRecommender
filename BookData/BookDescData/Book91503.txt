Nurse, Lizzi Yates, is assigned to provide end-of-life care to Charlie Maidley, one of Britain's footballing legends, on the condition she keeps his identity a secret.

Deciding he is being sedated without just cause, she makes the call to wake him up. However, a string of events and the discovery of a girl's body at the bottom of the garden lead her to wonder if she’s made the right decision.  Who is the killer?  Could Lizzi be his next victim?
