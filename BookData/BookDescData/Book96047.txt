A rollicking, rhyming read-aloud that will knock your socks off! Warm-up, wiggle, stretch your beak. Duck Sock Hop comes once a week! The mood is high, the sun is low, the music starts, get ready, go! In this tongue-twisting, toe-tapping picture book, ducks grab socks from a big sock box and head on down to the duck sock hop. In socks with stripes and socks with spots, socks with squares and socks with dots, these brightly, boldly illustrated ducks dance until their socks go rip; and ducks teeter, tumble, twist, and trip. But not to worry; in this preschool-perfect read-aloud, when one sock hop ends, the countdown to the next one begins. So, prepare for a feel-good, giggle-inducing read.
