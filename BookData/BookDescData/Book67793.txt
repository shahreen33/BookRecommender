Author of the popular Blackbird Sisters mystery series Nancy Martin introduces a brand-new heroine: the incorrigible canine Miss Ruffles. When flamboyant Texas millionaire Honeybelle Hensley dies a suspicious death, everybody in town is shocked to learn that the sole beneficiary of her worldly fortune is none other than Miss Ruffles—her dog. Miss Ruffles liked nothing better than terrorizing Honeybelle’s many gentleman callers who came knocking at cocktail hour, to say nothing of digging up her famous rose garden after breakfast. And chasing the UPS man. And causing commotion, generally, in Mule Stop, Texas. So what gives? “Martin’s got a knack for gritty and funny characters…and piling on the complications to keep pages spinning.”—RT Book Reviews This is the question that Sunny McKillip, Miss Ruffles’ unwilling dogsitter, is trying to answer. Suddenly Miss Ruffles is in grave danger, and it’s up to Sunny to protect her—at all costs. But Sunny, still new to town, can’t make heads or tails of the town’s colorful characters, from the sweet-talking yet ruthless ladies of the garden club to the tobacco-spitting curmudgeon at Critter Control. With a killer on the prowl—and a handsome cowboy lawyer with an eye on her every move—there’s clearly more to Honeybelle’s death than Sunny could have imagined. If she’s not careful she might just get killed…or her heart lassoed...in Miss Ruffles Inherits Everything. “As Texas true as Tanya Tucker and boot-scootin’ fun. Miss Ruffles will capture hearts. I LOVE this book.” — Carolyn Hart, New York Times bestselling author
