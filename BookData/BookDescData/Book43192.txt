This story and its alternate ending are no longer available via FanFiction.When Bingley brings Darcy's amiable younger brother George to Netherfield, Elizabeth soon finds herself at first compromised into getting engaged to George Darcy and then tricked into marrying Fitzwilliam Darcy. Will she submit to the demands of a prejudiced husband or will her pride take her on a journey away from everyone she holds dear?Disclaimer: I do not own most of the characters and some of the plot lines, used in this story. The basic idea and character sketches of the leads are from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.WARNING: For all the readers who are just starting to read this story, I am duty bound to tell you that it is going to be VERY long and drawn out. Some of you might object to Elizabeth's characterization. In Part-II you will often be left frustrated because of the characters beating about the bush and not coming to the point. Sometimes you would be screaming to the screen of your PC or phone, for Elizabeth and Darcy to just get together already.There will be an EXTREME angst overload throughout Part-III. Please DO NOT READ if you don't have the stomach for just one thing after another that keeps E&amp;D apart until all limits of imagination have been stretched. And after all that I have said to warn you, you still decide to read this lengthy narrative and become frustrated eventually...then...its your choice, and who am I to complain to more people reading my story ;) Oh, and my apologies to those who already started before I could add the warning. Sorry guys...my bad. But if its any consolation...the ending is very very happy.
