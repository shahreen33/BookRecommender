Something big, weird and hungry is out on the bayou, and as one after another of the locals start disappearing, deputy sheriff Lexie Smith is on the case. Helping her are her old high-school buddies: Cam DeSelle, local vet and bait-store owner; Troy Pitre, the town's mechanic; sex-toy saleslady Carla Fontanelli; and young Father Mike and Sister Joanie, Alcide's source of spiritual strength and juicy gossip. Adding to Lexie's worries are some meth-dealing gangbangers in town for a big drug deal and a category 3 hurricane bearing down on all of them. As one horror unfolds, another plays out to its deadly conclusion at Fort St. Jesus Bait and Tackle.
