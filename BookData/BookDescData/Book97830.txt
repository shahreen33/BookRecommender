Listening Length: 7 hours and 31 minutes. Former helicopter pilot Maverick Delgardo's injuries ended his Air Force career, leaving him bitter and one drink away from becoming an alcoholic. When his sister asks for his help on a private protection case to babysit a disgraced pop star, Mav reluctantly agrees. Deacon Daniels, onetime lead singer and idol to his teenage fans, saw his career and reputation ruined when a reporter's expos√© led to a devastating scandal. Without money or a job, a heartbroken Deacon has lost custody of his baby niece. And just when Deacon thinks his life can't get any worse, a stalker's threatening messages escalate to murder. Mav only agreed to one meeting, but his protective instincts kick in, along with an attraction to Deacon. When the body count increases, however, Mav is unsure he is up to the task of protecting Deacon from a killer. But it is too late for Mav to step away, now that he's lost his heart, and he must find the strength to reassure Deacon and his niece that they are in safe hands no matter the cost.
