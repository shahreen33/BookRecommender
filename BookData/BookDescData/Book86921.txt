Dita Silvers is not the typical female werewolf.   She’s ambitious and ruthless, and has now become the alpha of one of the largest packs on the continent—a feat unheard of for most female wolves.  But this power has come with great costs, and the more Dita gains, the more others want to take it from her.  Will she be able to hold onto this new power and still protect the ones she loves, or will she have to choose between family and authority?   From the author of The Wolf Wars Series, The Alexa Montgomery Saga, The Aria Fae Series, and The Heiress of Magic Trilogy comes the final book in The Blood Pack Trilogy.
