  Abducted by a space pirate, she fights the temptation to let him plunder her goods.
A boyfriend's attempted murder leaves Megan floundering in the ocean. Sinking without hope, the bright light she sees in the night sky isn't her doorway to heaven, but rather the beginning of her accidental abduction by a space pirate. While thankful of his rescue, Megan stays true to form and just can't keep her mouth shut, even when he keeps threatening to kill her — or auction her off to the highest bidder. Even odder, despite her decision to not get involved with her wickedly hot captor, she can't help craving his touch. Tren retired from his job as a mercenary so he could enjoy life, but he never counted on the boredom of normalcy. The acquisition of rare items has somewhat filled the void, but his accidental abduction of an outspoken earthling, who doesn't know when to shut up, turns his life upside. Her fiery spirit draws him while at the same time drives him insane. Struggling with his urges, he must decide — throttle her barbarian neck or ravish her delectably lush body? Despite what his heart tries to tell him, he's determined to sell her to the highest bidder even as he seduces her body. However, despite his best intentions, he discovers he can't let her go. And when a foe from his past thinks to steal her, he'll do anything to get her back. Warning: This is an erotic, galactic romance with heavy emphasis on the romance. It is meant for open minded adults only who enjoy a sci-fi romance, explicit bedroom details and humor.
