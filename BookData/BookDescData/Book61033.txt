  "I never thought I'd want to get screwed by a mechanic ..."
 The latest assignment for Miami 8 News intern Liam sounds easy enough: catch the crooked crew at Scud's Auto on camera. Liam almost feels guilty setting up hunky mechanic Paul Parisi -- but then he's always been a sucker for a tall, muscular stud in an oil-stained jumpsuit. There's only one problem: straight guy Paul seems more interested in screwing Liam some other way. With a promotion on the line, can Liam resist Paul's curious flirting and obtain the footage he needs? 
  "Thanks to my past, I'm stuck here."
 For a guy who stands behind quality service, cutting corners is causing all sorts of stressors in Paul's life -- including an embarrassing failure to ignite with women. But when Paul takes a private test drive with a handsome customer, his engine doesn't just fire right up ... he throws a rod. And he's pretty sure Liam saw it, too. If anyone at the shop found out what they were up to, Paul knows he'd be out of a job. But Liam won't take his car elsewhere -- it's almost like the guy wants to get ripped off. What's his deal, anyway?   
  Screwed is a 45,000 word first time gay romance! A light-hearted novel featuring a jacked and bi-curious mechanic, a terrible disguise, two men playing doctor, sex on Miami beach, and more! No cliffhanger, no cheating, but the HEA is guaranteed.
