The Beach House Hotel, the seaside mansion Ann Rutherford and Rhonda DelMonte converted to an upscale boutique hotel, continues to be a success. Not only is it the spot for breakfast and lunch, it’s become the “IN place” for dinner. The sudden, unexpected deaths of Ann’s ex and his wife, leave the care of their son, Robbie, to Ann’s daughter, Liz, while she is still in college. Ann and Vaughn decide to relieve Liz of this responsibility by adopting Robbie as Rhonda becomes both a mother and grandmother. Vaughn’s plane disappears on a fishing trip in Alaska at the same time they learn investors want to buy the hotel. Ann and Rhonda are faced with one of the biggest decisions of their lives. The hotel is their baby too—their pride and joy. But they know no matter what the future holds, their love and friendship for each other will endure.
