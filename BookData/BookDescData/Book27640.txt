Relaxation and romance were the plan for Steve and Cherie at the out-of-the-way hot springs. Something's not quite right about the staff at Serenity Sanctum, the place has a vibe…In no time, old traumas and relationship problems resurface, turning what they thought would be a good time into a nightmare. That's only the tip of the deep-seeping terror. Something unspeakable and terrifying is happening at this little getaway, more than the drinking and the oddity, a trouble lurks.The ritualistic event, a strange and inconceivable gathering, taking place at the hot springs upends Steve’s life. Women gather, congregating, engaged in the ancient primitive rite to appease an unholy Goddess.Once a year these acolytes tend to her needs, to perform the sacraments of the Festival.
