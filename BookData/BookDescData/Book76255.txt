A Harris Brother Scottish Wedding! This short story was first published in the Cocktales Anthology. It reads well as a standalone but will be enjoyed better if you read Challenge first. Only professional footballer, Camden Harris, is cocky enough to elope to Scotland with his fianc√© and leave the Harris Family behind.
