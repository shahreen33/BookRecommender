England, 1935. In the village of Blacknowle on the Dorset coast, thirteen-year-old Mitzy Hatcher has endured a wild and lonely upbringing. Shunned by her neighbours, the arrival of renowned artist Charles Aubrey, along with his exotic mistress and their two daughters, is like a breath of fresh air for Mitzy. Over the course of three summers, Mitzy develops a deep and abiding bond with the Aubrey household, gradually becoming Charles's muse. Slowly, Mitzy begins to perceive a future she had never thought possible - and a powerful love is kindled in her. A love that will grow as she does: from innocence to obsession; from childish infatuation to something far more dangerous. Moving from the wilds of the Dorset coast to the intoxicating heat of a Moroccan summer, A HALF-FORGOTTEN SONG explores the quixotic nature of memory - and the perils of obsessive love. A sweeping and powerful tale that will leave you captivated.
