From Britain's acclaimed master of dark fantasy comes this terrifying new novel of an epic struggle against evil in the midst of environmental catastrophe.Around the world, forces of unimaginable violence are being unleashed -- earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, deadly hailstorms -- all signs of a coming titanic struggle between the forces of darkness and light. This is the story of two very special children who unknowingly hold the future of the planet in their hands... and the grotesque matriarch of a bizarre New Orleans cult who is determined to destroy them."Delivers a breathtaking finish, its dazzling special effects conveyed with the panache of a literary Steven Spielberg." --London Sunday Times
