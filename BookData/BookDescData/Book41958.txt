Librarian's note: Alternate cover edition of ASIN B01JEUUCC2.The moment everything changed didn’t happen in that cliché rockets-red-glare kind of way, it happened in the form of a waking nightmare. I caught my husband, my high-school sweetheart, the father of my children, balls deep in a sordid affair. That was when I gave up on men and love. I didn’t count on the NHL’s golden boy, the beautiful, arrogant Cooper Stone turning my life and my hockey rink upside down.  My kids are why I wake up in the morning.  Hockey is what Cooper breathes for.  We’re from different worlds and places in our lives but when our hearts collided something so wrong and different turned into something so right.
