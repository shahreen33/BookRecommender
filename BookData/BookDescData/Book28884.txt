This third board book from Maine artist Dahlov Ipcar contains one original illustration done especially for this edition, her first new children's book illustration in more than twenty years. The other images are taken from earlier children's books. The Maine wildlife and coastal scenes are near and dear to her heart, and this new book serves as a kind of love letter to her home state where she has lived and worked for almost seventy-five years, where, as she writes, "A is for animals, wild and free," and W is for "woodlands of wonder for you and for me."
