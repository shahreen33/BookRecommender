  Beautiful, perfect and everything he needs. 
 Caitie Russell's big brother is getting married. As the proud owner of Holiday Magic, Caitie is the obvious choice to organise the perfect Christmas wedding. Piece of cake, right?If it weren't for one gorgeous man-shaped problem...Her brother's best friend, Brecken Miller.He was her first crush.Her first kiss.And he doesn’t even remember it.Construction worker Brecken Miller is a modern-day Scrooge. The confirmed bachelor would rather pull his nails out than celebrate Christmas, until he sees Caitie again. Like a moth to a flame he’s drawn to her.But there’s a problem with fire. It always leaves a scar.
