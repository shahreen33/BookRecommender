"Season Two" of Moon Knight begins with a new creative team...and a blackout! When the entire city is thrust into darkness by a strange new threat, Moon Knight must use all of his weapons (and personalities) to defeat a very different foe! Then, it's a hostage situation in a high-rise, and Moon Knight must come to the rescue. But in this cell-phone camera society, he's doing it on the world stage! What does this sudden exposure mean for the famously secretive hero? Brian Wood (X-Men, DMZ) takes the writing reins - picking up from where Warren Ellis left off , pushing questions from Moon Knight #1 back to the fore, and amplifying them a hundred-fold! Buckle up as the stakes get higher, the Moon gets fuller, and the Knight gets darker!Collecting: Moon Knight 7-12
