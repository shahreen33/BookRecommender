What happens when a successful entrepreneur, who built and managed the world's largest independent payphone company when he was still in his early thirties, begins questioning his identity as a value-creator? What happens when he pauses and reflects on the nature of consciousness, value and personal identityâ€”only to redefine, for himself, the relationship between the entrepreneur and society? Triggered off by a heart attack at thirty-eight, Ravi Kailas's search takes us through the challenging, yet ultimately rewarding process of shedding the self to discover service. His story is set against the backdrop of inspirations that are deep and varied: from Vipassana meditation to Alexander the Great, from Ashoka to Chuck Feeney, from the pioneers of trusteeship like Jamsetji Tata to a deep analysis of the relevance of trusteeship to modern-day inequality across the globe. Myth of the Entrepreneur is an intimate exploration of Kailas's journey to understand what constitutes true value, and how each of us can interrogate this concept of 'value' to lead more fruitful, connected and liberated lives. For today's young executives, this book will be an indispensable guide as they search for satisfaction in an ambitious, sometimes ruthless, world.
