Trent Cooper, the former newspaper man-turned aspiring novelist, and his genius sidekick, Horatio, must, once again, delve into the past. Thanks to a misprinted ad, Trent and Horatio are now on the case of a failed assassination attempt on former President Calvin Coolidge, who once vacationed in Mount Dora. For better or worse, Trent must also prove that notorious gangster Al Capone was framed in the plot. All of this leads to the answer of a present day homicide and an attempt on his own life. Interweaving stories from the past and present, Mobsters blends fact and fiction in a who-dun-it of historic proportions.
