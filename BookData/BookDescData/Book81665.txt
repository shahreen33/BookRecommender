Editorial ReviewsProduct DescriptionIn her critically acclaimed, bestselling memoir, BALD IN THE LAND OF BIG HAIR (HarperCollins 2001), Joni Rodgers invited readers along on her family's harrowing (but hilarious) journey through the Badlands of cancer and self-discovery. In this short Kindle exclusive published live from the London Book Fair in 2012 to celebrate the launch of the Alliance of Independent Authors, Rodgers expands on how events before, during and after her stint in chemo led to her becoming a New York Times bestselling author and celebrity ghostwriter -- and why she is now choosing to publish some of her own books independently. Peppered with laughter and enriched with wisdom from friends and mentors, FIRST YOU WRITE challenges aspiring writers to reflect on what compels us to create and shares an optimistic but controversial take on where the publishing industry is headed. ("When your sugar daddy's out of money, honey, you're just getting f**cked.")"A lot of people ask me why a New York Times bestselling author repped by William Morris Endeavor would choose to indie publish," says Rodgers. "This is the answer. It isn’t perfect, but I tried to be true. And it's a quick read. I kept it short, because the best piece of writing advice I ever received was delivered to me by the late, great Rue McClanahan: Stop kvelling and get back to work."KUDOS FOR AUTHOR JONI RODGERS"Rodgers is a pure storyteller. She writes with a wit, lyricism, humanity and joy that make her books impossible to put down." Oscar-winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin"Alternately wrenching and humorous...Rodgers' strength is a womanly wise, laugh-through-tears appreciation of life."Publishers Weekly“Rodgers lives, loves and writes without a safety net… managing the rare literary feat of being painful and funny in one urgent breath.”Entertainment Weekly
