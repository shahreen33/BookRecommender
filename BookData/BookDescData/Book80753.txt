Elmo, Big Bird, and all the rest of the Sesame Street friends invite readers into their world, providing a uniquely personal experience that teaches kids how special they truly are.You don't need to be an avid reader, a performer or an expert with children to relax and enjoy new fun ways to engage with the little ones during story time.

My First Big Storybook has subtle prompts, questions and guides to make sure that story time and that precious bonding experience is magical.Example of prompts:Elmo and his friends are hiding.
