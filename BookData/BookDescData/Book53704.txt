  Everyone wants to get close to a rock star.
The bright lights.The music.Those talented fingers strumming… a guitar.Everyone wants to bang a rock star.So why do I keep running from the one who wants me?I’m America’s Sweetheart.I have a reputation.He’s a boy-band icon turned rock god.I’m vanilla.He’s every flavor of bad.And he’s much, much too young for me.If I end up in Nick Ryder’s bed, my career and I will both be screwed....but that’s only if I’m caught.
