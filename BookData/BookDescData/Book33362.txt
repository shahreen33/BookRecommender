Outdoorsman, politician, patriot, soldier, bestselling author, naturalist, winner of the Medal of Honor and the Nobel Peace Prize, Theodore Roosevelt was both a consummate man of action and a prolific author. A Passion to Lead is a collection of excerpts from his writings--his autobiography, memoirs such as Rough Riders, speeches, articles, and letters--that bring the man to life in his own eloquent words. Along with the text are images (some never before published) that give added dimension to the man and his era.
