Voted #1 Surprising Good Books by Goodreads readersVoted #27 Romantic ebook Must Reads by Goodreads readersIn 1855 New York, Ginger Fitzpatrick has absolutely no interest in taking part in the newest rage in America-the Cotillion Ball. Instead, Ginger would rather be rallying for women's rights-at least until she meets her brother's best friend from St. Louis, a dark mysterious man named Joseph Lafontaine, who ignites her passion and makes her question if love and marriage is such a ridiculous notion after all.What she and the rest of New York's high society don't realize is that Joseph is half Ojibwa Indian, and therefore, totally unsuitable for marriage to a fine, cultured young lady."Sensuality Level: Sensual"
