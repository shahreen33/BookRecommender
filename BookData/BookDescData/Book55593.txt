Nominating you to run for class president – against the most popular kid in your grade?     3. In charge of your campaign posters . . . all blue, of course, including your face!?     4. Planning a magical secret weapon to help you win (not fair and square, right?)?     5. Driving you crazy?!?!Now you have an idea of what Willie Ryan’s life is like as his adventures with Dodger continue. The last thing Willie wants to do is run for class president, but both his running mate, Lizzie, and Dodger won’t let him quit – and have their own ideas of how to run a campaign, especially against James Beeks, Mr. Popularity. In this second installment of the Dodger and Me series, the humor runs high, the friendships run deep, and Dodger continues to run on French fries and good intentions.
