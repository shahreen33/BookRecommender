LIGHTSPEED is an online science fiction and fantasy magazine. In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF--and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales.  This month's cover art is by Galen Dara, illustrating the original fantasy short "Godmeat," by Martin Cahill. We also have an original fantasy short story from Kodiak Julian ("Our Side of the Door"), and fantasy reprints by Xia Jia ("Night Journey of the Dragon-Horse") and John Grant ("His Artist Wife"). Our science fiction originals include work by Carolyn Ives Gilman ("We Will Be All Right") and Jane Lindskold ("A Green Moon Problem"), plus we have SF reprints by Tobias S. Buckell ("Sunset") and David Brin ("The Crystal Spheres"). All that, and of course we also have our usual assortment of author spotlights, an interview with author (and frequent LIGHTSPEED contributor) Sam J. Miller, along with our book and media review columns. For our ebook readers, we also have an ebook-exclusive novella reprint ("Great Work of Time" by John Crowley), an excerpt from Emily Devenport's new novel MEDUSA UPLOADED, and bonus excerpt from NOW WE CAN SEE THE MOON by Berit Ellingsen.
