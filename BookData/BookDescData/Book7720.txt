Sardonic and menopausal Donna Leigh owns an Omaha ad agency. When a former colleague is murdered, Donna becomes the chief amateur sleuth so her toxic relationship with the victim doesn't land her at the top of the suspect list. As Donna and her colorful colleagues work feverishly to solve the case, they leave a trail of unintentional destruction in their wake; from injured police officers to collapsed buildings. Donna and her team stir things up enough to make the murderer nervous. After Donna receives a threat to "back off" things take on a more serious turn for her, but not for her ever vigilant colleagues who continue to animatedly bungle their way through the investigation until the murderer is behind bars.
