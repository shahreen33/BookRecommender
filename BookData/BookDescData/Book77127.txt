‘The Lost Boy’ started life as a story written for an anthology of urban faery tales. The anthology was eventually cancelled (although I’d withdrawn my story long before that happened) leaving me with a homeless story. It’s about half-fey Xan from The Iron Witch, and is set several months before that novel – before Donna even meets him – so there are no major spoilers for the trilogy. But the story does of course give some insight into Xan himself, as it’s written from his POV and we’re in his head for the duration.
