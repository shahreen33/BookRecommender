In the town square of Coronel Pringles stands a lime tree from which the author’s father used to brew a sedative tea. This Proustian infusion evokes dark memories of the 1955 anti-Perónist revolution, which dashed the family’s middle-class dreams. The Lime Tree is a portrait of the artist as a child and a lucid analysis of a family's social trajectory.
