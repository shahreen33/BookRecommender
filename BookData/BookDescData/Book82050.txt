Three years to the day after her beloved papa died, Odella Jumaane discovers the past nineteen years of her life have been a lie. She is not who she thought she was. A young man, Luc Sweetwater, has come to Reedy Creek to fulfill a promise he made to his mother-who had recently passed away-by safeguarding Yesu Jumaane's beautiful daughter. When he was a young child, Yesu had helped him and his mother when no one else would. Luc finds that the young child of his memories has grown up to be a lovely young woman. He brings letters that were written by Yesu to his mother and to him, also a letter she'd written and never mailed. Odella is given the letters to read, and they distance her farther from who she thought she was. When at Lincoln Bank in Reedy Creek, she is given access to a safe deposit box that holds items and records, and a croker sack of money. She asks herself who is she...really? Her ultimate challenge surfaces when she comes face to face with a man who claims to be her father.
