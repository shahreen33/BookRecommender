Love &amp; Sequins is my handbook on being a love letter to the universe. Itâ€™s about living magically &amp; celebrating ourselves &amp; it is delivered right to your inbox!Each chapter is a whopping 10,000 words (or more!) long, &amp; you also get an MP3 of me reading it aloud to you, which is brilliant for boring subway rides or as a kind of modern bedtime story!
