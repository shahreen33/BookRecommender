He has done well to keep hidden all these years, but Damon Daye has finally come to collect on the blood debt of Kane’s father. Damon has sent a great Bloodrunner Dragon after him, and Kane can see his death coming. But his huntress is beguiling and sweet, and Kane is drawn to her in ways he can’t explain. And as he gets to know the sassy beauty, she feels less like the death of him, and more like his destiny. Too bad she’s a Bloodrunner, the mortal enemy of his ancient clan, and on a collision course to end his life.

Dark Kane’s eyes are terrifying, he feels like a beast, and he looks at her like he could just as easily kill her as kiss her, but there is something about him that Rowan can’t resist. Something that’s calling to her dragon and putting them both on a path of mass destruction.  And now Rowan will have to figure out how to protect the world from the last Blackwing Dragon, while protecting the man she loves from himself.
