What do you get when you combine magic and teenage attitude? A witch stuck in a snow globe, that’s what. Shelby Flynn’s tired of being treated like a kid and when she finds herself in trouble for yet another simple mistake, she wishes for a perfect life.  Unfortunately, she has a lot to learn about perfection and finds out the hard way that growing up has nothing to do with age, and being independent doesn’t mean that you don’t occasionally need a little help. Now it’s going to take a miracle to get her home to the ones she loves so she can prove she’s the witch they know she can be. Lucky for her, that’s what Christmas is all about.
