"A swicked adventure that will leave you smiling and wanting more." -HM Ward, New York Times Bestselling Author  There are no minor gods.  Lilah Jones is officially thirteen. Unfortunately, the day comes with a few twists she didn't expect. For example, her hair turned into a living rainbow and she was gifted with a golden necklace that randomly goes from being room temperature to as hot a supernova. On top of that, she has a dream that she remembers line by the line when she wakes up.  Seeking answers, Lilah meets two boys, named Cole and Adrian, who gladly clear things up. Remember the Greek myths you assumed were fiction? The old gods that you assumed were just someone's imagination? You were wrong. They've been with us the whole time, fighting battles we didn't even know existed, and they've returned. The Olympians are reuniting, preparing to fight the most dangerous battle they've ever faced.  The Father of Monsters is rising.  Genre: MG/YA Paranormal Contemporary Greek Mythology Adventure Type: Novella, 1 of 3 Length: Approx. 100 pgs ea.
