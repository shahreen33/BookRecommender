Finding a body facedown in a chocolate fountain isn’t exactly the way earth witch Zola Meadows wanted to start her day. Even worse, her sweet old lady neighbor, Lilly Martinelli, is arrested for the crime. The evidence against Lilly is flimsy at best, and Zola vows to clear her name. Not only to make sure justice is served, but also to get rid of the trouble making cat that Lilly has entrusted to her care while she’s in jail.     Luck is on her side. Lilly’s hotter-than-heck pie-making nephew wants to help. Then again, maybe that’s not such a good idea. Not just because Zola has a romantic past with him, but also because he soon bubbles up to the top of her suspect list.     Zola finds herself wading through a maze of clues and suspects: cheating husbands, purse-grabbing friends, shopping-obsessed daughters, not to mention a little creature running around town tormenting tourists with bad breath and sticky brown goo. With pressure from the coven elders and a sheriff itching to close the case, Zola must put her magical skills to the test in order to discover the true identity of the killer before Lilly’s time runs out.
