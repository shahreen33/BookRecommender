Crammed full of exquisite art from around the world, with fascinating background stories about the artists, editors and publishers, Erotic Comics: A Graphic History examines how this much maligned artform developed into a publishing phenomenon that spans the globe. Volume 1 delves deep into comic history, from the bawdy English cartoons of the 17th century, through the magazines impacted by the two World Wars, up to contemporary magazine titles such as Penthouse and Hustler. The book bulges with sassy postcards, provocative Tijuana Bibles, salacious pin-ups, shocking '50s bondage comics, cheeky cartoons and liberated '60s underground comix. Erotic Comics: A Graphic History is perfect for fans of adult comics, art history and erotic illustrations
