Morning sickness, cravings and that constant need to pee are what Ashton has to look forward to, knowing that numbered are her days of being just one. Fifteen years, eight days. An eternity ago were those unforgettable moments spent crushing on her brother’s best friend, yet her mind constantly turns to him—the one who got away. The one who might yet be her one. 
  It’s probably about time she found out . . .
