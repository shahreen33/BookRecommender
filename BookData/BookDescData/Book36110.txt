This Top Five Classics edition of THE MEMOIRS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES includes:  • More than 60 original illustrations by Sidney Paget • An Introduction • Author biography and bibliography  Could it be that Sherlock Holmes has finally met his match in the villainous Professor Moriarty? Quite possibly. The only way to know for certain is to read the climactic story “The Final Problem” from this collection of Sherlock Holmes tales.  In this second compilation of stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (following The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes), we learn about Holmes’ first-ever investigation in “The Gloria Scott”; meet his older, smarter (and fatter and lazier) brother, Mycroft; and are introduced to the most evil criminal mastermind in English literature, Professor Moriarty.  Including all twelve stories that originally appeared in the Strand Magazine, THE MEMOIRS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES contains some of the greatest mysteries the world’s greatest detective and Dr. Watson ever encountered.
