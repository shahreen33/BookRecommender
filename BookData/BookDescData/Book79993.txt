Nothing ruins a rehearsal dinner quite like a passive-aggressive toast from the unhappy mother of the groom. Things go from bad to yikes when she’s found reduced to a pile of ashes and couture and the bride is pegged as the one wielding the wooden stake.  When a vampire marries a human, things are bound to get messy…  After years spent working the birthday party and baby shower circuit, Anastasia Winters finally has a corner office and a host of supernatural clients all begging her to plan their special day. But following a brush of bad luck, she finds herself on the brink of losing it all. With an ultimatum from her boss on the table, her next wedding has to be perfect.  When the vampy mother of the groom is found dead, the bride goes on the run, and Anastasia is forced head-first into the murder investigation if she has any chance of getting the wedding back on track and keeping her job.  Unfortunately, this is one wedding crisis that requires more than a strategically placed bobby pin or double-sided sticky tape.  Can there be a fairy tale ending, or will it be Happily Ever Never?  ***  Newly Wed and Slightly Dead is the first novel in a new series of paranormal mysteries by Danielle Garrett.
