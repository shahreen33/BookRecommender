Ice is the 9th book in the Reed Security Series and should be read in order.  Ice. Lady Killer. Perpetual bachelor. Until Lindsey stepped into his life, Ice had never considered having a relationship ever again. He liked his life the way it was and that was the end of that conversation. But when Ice kidnaps Lindsey to protect her, he has no choice but to bring her home with him. And that's where the problems begin. There's a very fine line between love and hate, but which side will they land on?  “What the hell is that?” I shouted. “My feet are cold. You keep it like an ice box in here.” “So, put on some damn socks, woman!” “No, I can’t sleep with socks on. My feet sweat and then I get uncomfortable.” “So, it’s okay for you to sleep how you’re comfortable, but not me?” “You’re sleeping naked. There’s a difference between being completely naked and sleeping without socks on.” “For all I know, you could have some toe fungus and I could catch if from you because you don’t have socks on.” “Really? A toe fungus?” “People get them. I don’t know you. You could be one of those people that only changes their socks once a week.” “This coming from the man that couldn’t remember the last time he washed his sheets,” she snorted. “Hey, I work out of town a lot. It’s not like I sleep in my bed every night. And I always shower before I get in bed. It’s not like I’m dirty.” “Sheets that aren’t washed regularly can cause acne. All that bacteria that lives in your bed can clog your hair follicles and your skin could break out.” “I have flawless skin. I’m not worried,” I said in irritation. “Do you know how many skin cells you leave behind in your bed?” She sat up and turned to me with a sneer. “You lose about 30,000 to 40,000 skin cells every minute. So, in an eight hour night of sleep, you would lose at least 14,400,000 skin cells that are just hanging out on your sheets.” “You have way too much time on your hands if you figured that out and remembered it.”
