An affair of convenience! Gwyn Ellis is in big trouble. Scandalous photos of her have been released online, slandering her as an adulteress and threatening her hard-earned job with Donatelli International Bank. No one wants to hear how she's been framed…no one except her boss, the darkly sexy Vittorio Donatelli! Vittorio will do anything to protect his company from scandal—he's kept the secret of his true parentage hidden for years. So if it means making stunning Gwyn his mistress to combat the vicious rumors, then he'll do it…with pleasure!
