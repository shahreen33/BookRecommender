One sister born of pain. One sister born of blood. One sister born of death.  Three sisters bound, Wiccan and nightwalker. Three sisters found, To join an empire. A prophecy of three, So let it be.  Ebony’s life varied from minor inconvenience to total disaster. She could never catch a break. From a young age, she had been sent to live with many foster families, each one rejecting her after a short amount of time, none of them wanting to take on her unusual health issues. She couldn't blame them—she didn't know what the hell was wrong with her, either.  Now, living day to day, struggling to buy the medicine she needs and with no home to call her own, Ebony battles for the hope that she won’t always be so alone. However, just when Ebony thinks her life couldn’t possibly get any worse, it does, and the darkness calls to her.  Yet salvation arrives in the unlikely form of two beautiful, mysterious women and a man willing to fight to be her saviour.  As a new world is suddenly and unexpectedly thrust upon her, Ebony, whether she’s ready or not, is about to find out who she really is and exactly what she’s made of.
