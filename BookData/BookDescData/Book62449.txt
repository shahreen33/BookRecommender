“An enchanting book—please read.” —Dr. Jane Goodall, DBE; Founder of the Jane Goodall Institute &amp; UN Messenger of PeaceIn this touching memoir about the relationship between father, daughter, and animals, Carole explores life after adopting thirteen pet Karakul lambs. Throughout her years with the lambs and her aging father, she comes to realize the distinct personality of each creature, and to understand more fully the almost spiritual bond between man and animals.This is a beautiful book in every way that will touch the hearts of readers everywhere.“In her new book, The Lambs, Carole George shares the fulfillment she has experienced over years tending a flock of sheep. I hope that this book will inspire readers to become more compassionate toward the living beings deprived of the many privileges we humans enjoy.” —His Holiness The Dalai Lama“The Lambs is beautifully written, and right on target as an example of the natural—pastoral—world where we may achieve the fullness of human experience. Our descendants may gravitate toward the equivalent of [Carole’s] Virginia farm.” —Edward O. Wilson, University Research Professor Emeritus, Harvard University
