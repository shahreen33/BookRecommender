A MAN WITH NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE  I sold my soul a long time ago to pay my father’s debts. Now my life is a prison: no friends. No family. Nothing it would hurt to lose.  I never should’ve touched Abby. I tried not to, but she is beautiful, magnetic, sexy. Everything I want but can't let myself have.  UNTIL HE MET HER  She seduced me not knowing who I was or what I really do in the shadows. I should have resisted her, but I wanted to be the man Abby thought I was for as long as I could.  But all debts must be paid, sooner or later. And mine are paid with blood.  Now Abby knows who I am, what I am, and she’s run from me.  I would have let her go for her own good. But when I find out she’s carrying my baby — there’s nowhere she can hide…  ***************************  Baby, Come Back is a full-length contemporary romance and the sequel to Bad Neighbor.
