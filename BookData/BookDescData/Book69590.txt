The dragon in the closet is such a con: one minute he's dancing like a goof under sheets and leaving get well notes and peppermints when little ones are sick, and the next he's tracking dirty footprints all over the carpet and eating all the snickerdoodles out of the cookie jar. With him around, there's always lots of fun and a whole heap of trouble, especially when he goes invisible, leaving Gabriel to answer for his bad behavior. No matter the circumstances, Gabriel's always got a good reason and excuse for why it happened. And no matter what goes wrong, it's never, ever his fault much to his parents' chagrin. Colorful illustrations bring to life this adorable tale of a little boy who blames sweet surprises and mischievous behavior on an invisible, mysterious guest only he knows exists: the friendly, goofy, troublemaking dragon in his closet. But did the dragon really do it? There s a Dragon in My Closet is a funny, engaging salute to mischievous little boys and the imaginary friends that sprinkle giggles and create a few pickles on even the most ordinary days.
