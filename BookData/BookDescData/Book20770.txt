Stunned, Patty Danville chastises herself for falling hard and fast for the billionaire playboy. Their connection had been immediate, smoldering, and out of control, but finding out about his wife has cast a shadow over the budding romance.  His marriage is over, but Alex has to prove this to Patty, knowing he cannot risk losing her. He will do anything to win her over, even if it means conquering her, one kiss at a time.
