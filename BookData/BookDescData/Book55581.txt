MYSTERY, DISGUISES, AND A FIGHT FOR FREEDOM.Welcome back to the seedy underbelly of London, in 1790. Cat Royal and her friends at the Theater Royal are getting ready for their next performance. But the star of the show may not make it to opening night. Pedro has proved to all of London that he is a brilliant musician and a gifted actor, but, according to Mr. Kingston Hawkins, Pedro is nothing more than a slave. When Cat attempts to secure Pedro's freedom, she ends up risking her own and has to go into hiding. Go undercover with Cat as she infiltrates aristocratic society one moment and Billy Shepherd's gang hideaway the next. The irrepressible Cat Royal never fails to stir up trouble—and save the day—wherever she goes.
