LIGHTSPEED is an online science fiction and fantasy magazine. In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF--and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales.Our cover art this month comes from Reiko Murakami, illustrating an original science fiction short by Bryan Camp ("The Independence Patch"). We also have fresh new work from Ken Liu ("Cosmic Spring"), along with SF reprints by A. Merc Rustad ("Brightened Star, Ascending Dawn") and N.K. Jemisin ("The Effluent Engine"). Plus, we have original fantasy by Beesan Odeh ("Al-Kahf") and Cassandra Khaw and A. Maus ("You Do Nothing But Freefall"), and fantasy reprints by Jeremiah Tolbert ("The Dreamers of Alamoi") and Seanan McGuire ("And Men Will Mine the Mountain for Our Souls"). All that, and of course we also have our usual assortment of author spotlights, along with our book and media review columns. We'll also be interviewing Na'amen Golbert Tilahun. For our ebook readers, we also have our usual ebook-exclusive novella reprint ("The Proving Ground," by Alec Nevala-Lee) and an excerpt from Tessa Gratton's debut fantasy novel, THE QUEENS OF INNIS LEAR.
