Boo! Turn up the lights and sit down to read more true ghost tales from the extensive collection of diaries T. M. Simmons kept over the years of her paranormal investigative career. Things do seem to go bump in the night when Simmons and her aunt prowl a haunted house or cemeteries during both dark and full moons. It's a scary Halloween all year round for this ghost hunter and her readers.In "St. James Jeepers Creepers" Simmons takes us to the extremely haunted St. James Hotel in Cimarron, New Mexico, where she and her aunt were given free access for two full nights of haunted chills and fun. "The Making of Barney the Believer" tells how her staid engineer husband grew to believe in the paranormal. Readers who follow Simmons will recall the problematic portal in a friend's house. "That Pesky Portal" is, hopefully, the conclusion of this saga. In the spring of 2012, she and her aunt finally managed to tour the haunted Prospect Place in the tiny village of Trinway, Ohio. "Possibilities of Prospect Place" relates their experiences there. Simmons always includes a scary tale, and "Hot Springs Heart Attack (Almost) won't fail in that regard. One day maybe Simmons will find out what evil entity tried to share her bed, but it's not high on her priority list.Readers ask questions and the two articles included in this volume of true ghost stories attempts to respond to some of those. "Four Psychic Reception Areas" explains the various areas of that enjoyable but illusive Sixth Sense. "How to Tell if You Have a Haunting, and What to Do" isn't a complete guide to understanding whether or not a ghost is haunting you. The reason for that is because no one understands everything about the paranormal. However, it might give you a start and point you to further assistance.This volume of diaries is being released at the same point in time as Simmons new paranormal mystery, Dead Man Hand. Both are available for numerous e-reading devices.
