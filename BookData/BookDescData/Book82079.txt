Sophia Stanton is a confident billionaire bear shifter who enjoys the finer things in life — especially fine men. Unlike her twin brother, Derry, she has no plans to settle down with just one mate. Why limit yourself to a single taste when you can have a little lick of everything?  She's rich. Powerful. Well-educated. A statuesque, sexually liberated woman who towers over most men and who turns into one of the most fearsome beasts in North America.  What man — or shifter — could give her what she truly needs?  Zach Hayden was an ordinary guy until an accident in Sophia’s brother’s research lab left him howling at the moon. Turned into a werewolf by the same serum he helped to create, biochemist Zach is now seven inches taller, has seventy pounds of new muscle, and, well — everything got bigger.   Unconvinced he’s adjusted to his transformation, the Stantons confine Zach at their family compound in Montana, where Sophia offers to teach him how to manage his new powers — and libido. But when they both hear The Beat, an old shifter legend that guarantees they are made for each other, is falling in love their fate — or is it just wishful thinking?  When her powerful family questions his motives and powers, can Zach rise to the occasion —  And become Sophia’s true alpha?
