  The presence of approaching death always leaves you in a contemplating space. Reliving those exact moments pushes me to find the very culprit who changed my life. It also makes sitting in a classroom a pain in the ass.    Having survived my first year at Tracker Hive Academy, I'm left with wondering what's next for me, the eight elements, Junior Tracker with no professional filter. We have to face the culprit who is clearly out to get me, but there has to be more to this, especially with certain allies involved.  Things only get complicated when my sexy Troubled Four start having imbalance problems, making it difficult for the rest of the world to know who is who - except me, of course. My Shadow only wants to add to the chaos by attacking the very students weâ€™re attempting to protect.  My life is definitely a shit storm, and when Alaric himself goes missing during an assignment, all bets are off.  I am a Queen in my element and won't be told how to get what belongs to me. With Zeke, Zion, Zackery, and Zeus on my side, there's nothing I need to fear - and with Calvin as our joker card.   We're a dangerous threat together, and this Hive goes by one thing: Breaking all the rules.     Game On.
