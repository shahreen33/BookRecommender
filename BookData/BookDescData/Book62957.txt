A hidden evil stalks the city... Ari Calin refuses to believe her human friend Eddie murdered a vampire--in spite of his confession. Her human partner Ryan thinks the case is a slam dunk, even though there's no weapon and no witnesses, but Ari's not about to let her friend take the rap without finding out more. When Ari attends a charity event on the arm of a handsome werewolf, she finds someone she never expected to see again--Andreas De Luca, the charismatic vampire she used to date. When their eyes meet across the room, memories come rushing back. His kiss, his touch, a savage death...and a terrifying magical bond. A reconnection is the last thing she wants. Only by staying away and forgetting Andreas can she hope to avoid the Legend of Ramora. But when vampires keep dying, one thing becomes clear: Riverdale has a serial killer on its hands, and Andreas could be next. Ari begins to fear something truly evil is stalking the city, waiting to take control...
