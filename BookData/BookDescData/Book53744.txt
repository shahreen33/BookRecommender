Irresistible attraction. Unimaginable danger. I knew from the moment Noah Williamson walked into the diner that he was haunted—deeply haunted—but I couldn’t resist the lure of him. He was gorgeous and fascinating and mysterious, and like a delicate moth to a brilliant blue flame, I was drawn to him. Drawn to his fire.But if I’d known about his job, about what happened to his wife, I’d have run the other way. Before I got caught up in the red-hot blaze of his life. Before everything in my world got burned to the ground.  It’s too late to run now. I hesitated and that was it. I fell. I fell for him before I knew there was danger in loving him. Noah once told me that this is the way we burn—together or not at all. At the time, I didn’t know what that meant.Now I do.
