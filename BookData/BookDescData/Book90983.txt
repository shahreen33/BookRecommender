Wallace Stevens did not publish his first book of poetry until the age of 44 and did not issue his second book, Ideas of Order, for over a decade. This rare signed limited edition of that crucial work features his illuminating meditation on art—“The Idea of Order at Key West”—along with 32 additional poems, each the sublime expression of a body of work praised by critics as “drenched with the life of his senses. This vibrant fact forms the core of his exploration of the interplay between the mind and reality… What gives his best work its astonishing power and vitality is the way in which a fixed point of view, maturing naturally, eventually takes in more than a constantly shifting point of view could get at” (New York Times). Awarded the 1955 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, “no poet gives us more to think about or greater reward for thinking” (Chiasson, New York Review of Books).
