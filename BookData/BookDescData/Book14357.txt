This is an updated cover edition of ISBN13: 9781499215359.Three years after their breakup because of another girl, D and Joe are forced to deal with each other again during a weekend reunion of their group of friends from college. And while Sarah, Joe’s sister and D’s best friend, is still trying to decide how to handle a weekend caught between the two, things already take some unexpected turns. Although Joe thinks that all he needs is peace and quiet and time to recuperate from the relationship of hell he just walked out of, and despite the fact that D has her hands and her mind full with things such as applying for a job in London to get some distance between herself and a clingy ex-boyfriend, seeing each other again has quite an impact. And even if that impact is neither welcome nor desired, it is still impossible to ignore. Suddenly Joe, D and even Sarah find themselves on an emotional roller-coaster ride. A roller-coaster ride that everyone, who’s ever been in love, will be able to relate to.
