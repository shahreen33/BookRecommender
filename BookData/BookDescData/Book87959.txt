Confess your sin.People call me Father, but I prefer Frank because I’m the worst preacher you’ll ever meet.Days spent completely wasted pull a number on you, especially when you’ve got a truckload of baggage that comes with it.Until this beautiful girl in the back of the church takes my breath away.…And we end up committing sacrilege in the confessional.Did I mention I’m filthy?Bad doesn’t even begin to describe me, and after one taste of what she’s got to offer, I want more.Too bad having a dirty mind isn’t the only thing we’ve got in common…Our past is laced with sin.Author’s Note: This book is not for everyone. It’s raw. It’s vulgar. It’s downright offensive. But it’s oh so damn delicious with a capital D. If you are easily offended or prudish, please don’t read this book. But if you like a bit of humor mixed in with raunchiness and brawling, you’ll love this book.Contains disturbing situations, strong language, and graphic violence.
