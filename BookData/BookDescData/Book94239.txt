Rachel Manley, granddaughter and daughter of two of Jamaica's national leaders, tells the story of the brilliant, artistic Manleys - Jamaica's most prominent and glamorous political family - and the house that nurtured them: Drumblair. This is a world vividly recreated, and an intimate memoir of the people who changed Jamaica's intellectual, social and cultural landscape for all time.
