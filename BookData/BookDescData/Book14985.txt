The perfect addition to any Vampire fan's collection.  From the Author of 'The Portal Prophecies' books, comes the anticipated new series: 'Tomoiya's Story', beginning with 'Escape To Darkness', the prequel to the main storyline.   Although the main character of the series is Tomoiya, this book tells the tale of another vampire princess, Allaynie. Taken captive on her wedding day by poachers, she is subjected to abuse by their leader, Woden. Greed is merely good business to the man and hunting is his trade. He'll do anything to collect her unique tears for profit, even chase her into darkness.  This novella explores an alternate explanation for the myths and legends that surround modern day Vampires and can be read as a stand alone story.
