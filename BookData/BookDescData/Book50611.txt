Two warring horror filmmakers are haunted by each other's work in this tense, chilling tale of dark artistic vision set in 1960s Hollywood. Gordon Ghastle and Allan Yule are promising young directors who help reshape the genre. But as their careers take off, will their need to outdo each other bring them to commit acts more macabre than what they commit to film? Told in intimate detail by their mutual cinematographer, Ghastle and Yule chronicles the rise and fall of two geniuses at the stormy height of their powersâ€”and what happens when obsessions go too far.  Josh Malerman is the author of Bird Box and the songwriter for the band the High Strung. He lives in Ferndale, Michigan with his fiancee Allison Laakko.  Praise for Bird Box:  "This completely compelling novel contains a thousand subtle touches but no mere flourishes- it so well, so efficiently, so directly written I read it with real admiration. Josh Malerman does the job like a fast-talking, wised-up angel." -Peter Straub  "Immersive, mesmerizing, and deliciously dark- this the best kind of horror, where your imagination becomes your own worst enemy." -Jamie Ford  "Chilling and beautifully told. A must-read." -Hugh Howey, bestselling author of WOOL.  "Hitchcockian. A notably strong study of modern psychological terror." -USA Today  "Startlingly fresh and potent." -Rue Morgue Magazine  Cover design by: Adil Dara
