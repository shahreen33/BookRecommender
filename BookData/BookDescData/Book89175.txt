  The Maiden
  
Books are Lady Juliette Hallington’s escape from her sheltered life. Tales of romance are her favorite, and they’ve convinced her there’s only one reason to marry: love. When her protective father agrees to send her to the tournament with no guardian other than her married best friend, she recognizes her chance to avoid an arranged marriage. But after meeting Toren, Juliette begins to realize real life is more complicated than tales of love—and the very thing she wants most might consume everything she holds dear.The Chief’s Maiden is the third book in a historical romance series set in 13th century Northumbria along the Anglo-Scottish border. If you like strong female heroines, alpha male heroes, and sizzling romance, you’ll love the third installment of the Border Series.
