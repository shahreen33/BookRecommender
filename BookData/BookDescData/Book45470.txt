Hunter, Morgan, and Alisa. All three are witches, and each is in turmoil. Hunter feels stifled by the small town world of Widow's Vale. Morgan is terrified of the possibility of life without him. And Alisa is still coping with the knowledge that she is a witch--by blood. Together, the three worked together to defeat the most unspeakable evil known to witches. Now, the danger they face is just as deadly. But to vanquish their new foe, they must first defeat the weaknesses within themselves.
