This monograph represents the results of collective research carried out by a team of analysts under the guidance of Sergey Kurginyan. The socio-economic, political and conceptual roots of the unprecedented wave of “revolutionary excesses” of 2011 in Northern Africa and the Middle East, as well as external influence on the process are dealt with on the basis of a wide range of factual evidence and in a broad historical context. An analysis of internal and external “fault lines” and other latent “driving forces” of these “revolutionary excesses” is provided, as well as an assessment of the possible impact of developing processes on specific countries, the region as a whole and the future world order.
