'It wasn't even a proper diary...no dates or days or even 365 pages. But after this morning I'd be surprised to make it to the end of the week - so seven pages would be plenty. As we sat in the little courtyard listening to the gunfire in the streets below us, I started to write...In the summer of 2014 a black plague swept across Syria, a killer cult spreading misery and murder. Sitting in the shade of the Pomegranate Tree, we meet Dilvan, a young Kurdish girl. Through the pages of her diary, we follow her quest to find her family with a determination to fight, maybe even to die - but never to surrender.
