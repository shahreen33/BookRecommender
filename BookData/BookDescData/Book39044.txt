In this, the third Aaron Tucker mystery, Aaron, fresh from a trip to Hollywood to "take meetings" on his screenplay, finds himself dragged kicking and screaming once again into investigating a murder, this time of a man in a nearby town shot while walking his dog at night. The young man accused of the crime has Asperger’s Syndrome, the same autism-related disorder that Aaron's son Ethan has had since birth. Aaron is hip-deep in the investigation when he’s assaulted by visiting Visigoths—-no, wait, that's just his wife Abby's brother and his family, come to visit for a week. But then a local mobster becomes aware of Aaron's poking around in the killing, and wants him to stop. It's going to be an especially interesting holiday season for New Jersey's funniest height-challenged amateur sleuth.
