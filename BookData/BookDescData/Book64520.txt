A world-renowned women’s health expert reveals a bold, practical, and data-driven handbook for menstrual periods that provides an easy-to-navigate roadmap for improving your reproductive health—and your everyday quality of life.We’ve been lied to about periods. PMS, cramping, bloating, migraines, irritability, and anxiety may be extremely common, but contrary to popular belief, they aren’t normal. And they certainly aren’t “just part of being a woman,” despite the fact that this is what we’ve been told time and time again—by friends, family, and even doctors. After dedicating her entire clinical career to deconstructing the menstrual cycle, women’s health expert Kirsten Karchmer knows better.During her more than twenty years of research and treating thousands of patients, Karchmer found that most period problems women experience—even the most painful ones—are totally correctable and more surprisingly reflective of overall health and fertility. In this forthright, spirited, and all-encompassing guide, Karchmer draws on her decades’ worth of experience as a women’s health expert to break down the myths so many women have been led to believe about their periods. For the more than 82 million women in the world who suffer from menstrual conditions, Seeing Red explains the importance of a healthy menstrual cycle (and how to achieve it) and why it is important to the women’s movement. Menstrual cycles are not a curse, but an instrument providing women with one of the most valuable, regularly occurring, and free diagnostic tools they have, giving them access to unprecedented health and power.
