This is intentional. I chose some of my favorite elements from previous releases and interjected them into Hutch and Lou’s story. Let’s call it a “story fusion” between our old favorites and new material.(This title was very briefly released as The Girlfriend Experience under a pen name. This edition contains new and updated material different from that of the original release.)
