The world is slowly rebuilding. Bill Arthur is determined to create a society that’s better than the one that died — a society based on liberty and respect for the individual. Not everyone, however, shares Bill’s vision.  Roving gangs wander the countryside raping and pillaging the weak. The remnants of state and federal authority strive to impose martial law on all survivors they meet. In the midst of this sea of violence and despotism, the little town of Rocheport is an island of freedom and enlightenment.  But Rocheport’s position is precarious and the last thing Bill needs is the obstructionism still being waged by those who want to see the city take a different path. Facing the pressures from those around him and his own growing desire to step away from the responsibilities of leadership, will Bill let Rocheport fall like so many others? Or will he see his dream take off by leaps and bounds?
