Things go mysteriously awry when the young man meets Clarisse; he finds himself separated from his parents and on a different sort of holiday.  Caught up in a strange adventure with the slender blonde, Charlie learns right away that things are not what they seem. She easily convinces him that her magical powers are real, and introduces him to a world mankind has only dreamt of.
