The alien Chasta put their war machine into gear and humankind was suddenly in the worst fight it had ever known - and lost. The solar system will be annexed by the Chasta within the next thirty days. If humankind can't be the U.S. Army anymore, then it will have to be the Viet Cong. Disgraced Captain John Ryder gets a ship and crew and leads them into space as guerrilla fighters. Once clear of the system, they locate a place to hide between sorties and begin fighting. They strike from behind and shoot from cover. If they can't give them hell, Ryder and crew at least give them a hard time. The Chasta throw a ring of steel around the system as they close in on Earth, so Ryder pokes holes in it. They're on their own. No support. Naval vessels won't even recognize their callsign. They don't exist... but they're mankind's last hope.
