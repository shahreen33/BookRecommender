Melanie Holstein is the woman I let slip right through my fingertips.One night in Vegas with the fiery woman that gave as good as she got was enough for me to know that she’s the one.Except for a few small problems.I’m Aiden Shaw, the star quarterback for a team that’s nine hundred miles away from her home in Atlanta.She doesn’t want kids and I have three rowdy boys that take up all of my free time.The timing for us just never seems right and after so many missed connections, I’ve nearly given up on us.Until my career takes a devastating turn. Mel’s the first one by my side, determined to put me back together.Ignoring my bitterness and pain, she heals more than just my injured leg and finally, there seems to be a future for us. But, Lady Luck has never been on our side.And the next tragedy that blindsides us may just be the hardest hit of all.
