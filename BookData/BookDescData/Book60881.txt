  Friendship, sharing, generosity. These morals are all about to be tested as Rexy meets his neighbor Trixie. 
  Rexy is a dinosaur who’s very friendly and easily gets excited. His excitement reached an all-time high after his parents bought him a new gift – a shiny red bicycle. Eager to try it out, Rexy put on his helmet and rode around his yard enjoying himself to the fullest. While riding, Rexy encountered his neighbor Trixie. Rexy’s shiny bike immediately caught Trixie’s attention and wanted to ride it for herself. Overly protective with his brand new bike, Rexy refused. He didn’t want to share!
