The evil Count uses his dark powers to transform a defeated guard captain into an inhuman horror to combat Guts, the Black Swordsman. Meanwhile, Guts' pint-sized elf sidekick, Puck, is captured and given as a gift to the Count's daughter, a sweet girl in a gilded cage, imprisoned by her father in her own room. Guts, determined to make mincemeat of the Count - and maybe bail out his companion, if he gets around to it - assaults the castle and takes on the nearly indestructible demon/guard in a blood-soaked battle royal! But then, face-to-face with the Black Swordsman at last, the unholy Count reveals his own true form, and even Guts' super-sized sword may not be big enough to contend with this demonic monstrosity!
