It is the week before Bekki’s wedding to the love of her life, handsome Detective Nick Malonie. She is flat out planning the wedding and packing up her stuff, but she could not be happier. She has left everything until the very last minute but with the help of her mom, Marie, and her best friend, Sammy, everything is starting to fall into place.  That is until everything is turned upside down when she goes to pick up the wedding rings in the city and finds the jeweler dead. When Bekki is found bending over the dead body a local cop immediately accuses her of the murder. With only three days until the wedding and Nick not able to help her because the murder hasn’t taken place in his jurisdiction, she must do whatever she can to clear her name before time runs out.  Will Bekki be arrested for murder? Will she be able to clear her name and find the real murderer? Or will she land up behind bars instead of at the altar? Will Nick be able to save her or will she be read her rights instead of reading her wedding vows?  **This is book 8 in the Bekki the Beautician Cozy Mystery Series but they do not have to be read in order**
