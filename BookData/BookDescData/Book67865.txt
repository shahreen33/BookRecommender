Finding his very own Daddy is harder than finding Prince Charming.Noah Lavoie isn't anyone special, an average guy working as a veterinarian with a few kinks and fetishes. For too many years he explored the BDSM lifestyle, but consistently felt something remained missing. In a world of black and white, Noah struggles to understand where to find the gray. Then…A mysterious contract. No strings attached. Never to know the Dominant’s identity. Noah clings onto his only hope, a man he can call Daddy. Cold, ruthless, charismatic. Bane Rozek believes himself impenetrable. He built his empire, fabricated from lies, blackmail, and extortion. Dark secrets he holds in his palm could cripple the most powerful of people and organizations. It's all a lie, a simple illusion to hide his truth. He did it all, built his fortress and claimed his power and sovereignty, for her. But Bane knows Death’s chaste kiss intimately. What Bane wants is a connection. This time on his terms… An innocent boy offering the purest submission. A contract holding them both at a distance. A boy that tugs fiercely at Bane’s dark heart.If only Bane could believe himself worthy to be the Daddy Noah proclaims to love.
