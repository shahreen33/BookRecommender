The New York Times-bestselling duo behind 
  Wolfie the Bunny
 presents a hilarious read-aloud about accidents, outbursts, manners...and the power of saying "I'm sorry."Bear didn't mean to break a little girl's kite, but she's upset anyway--upset enough to shout "HORRIBLE BEAR!" Bear is indignant. He doesn't think he's horrible! Then Bear gets a truly Horrible Bear idea. What will he do next? As Bear prepares to live up to his formerly undeserved reputation, the girl makes a mistake of her own, and realizes that maybe--just maybe--Bear isn't as horrible as she had thought.
