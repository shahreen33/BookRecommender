You’d have to be crazy to want a killer. I was nobody. A deranged widow. He was a psychopath with me as his next target.  When he took me from my home, he planned to kill me. The creepy room I woke up in with fluorescent lighting and an assortment of knives was evidence enough. Then he saw my scars, and something changed. Instead of killing me, he wants to fix me. I might be crazy, but he’s completely Unhinged.
