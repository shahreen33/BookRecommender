What will happen when Daphne realises she has sacrificed her happiness to a loveless marriage? What will happen when the artist realises he has lost his most cherished source of inspiration? And how will they negotiate the ever-increasing frequency of strange and bizarre events that seem to be driving them relentlessly towards self-destruction. Here, amid the extravagant Neo-Gothic culture of Victorian England, the iconic poem 'The Lady of Shalott' blends with mysterious and ghostly glimpses of Tudor history. Romantic, atmospheric and deeply dark.Video TrailerAlthough it is set in Victorian England the characters are "haunted" by the story of Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn, the queen who was executed on false charges of adultery. It is almost as if events are repeating themselves, but how will this story end? Will it be as tragic as Anne Boleyn's? Claire Ridgeway, theanneboleynfiles.com
