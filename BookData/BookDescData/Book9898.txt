This is the third edition to the Heal With Me series. It started as Inspiration Neededâ€¦A Book of Poems in 1997; to Heal With Me, and Our Journey Goes On in 1999, and 2001. These books have been a source of inspiration in various schools, organizations, and societies across Canada, and as well as in different households; I hope they will generate the same feelings this time around.
