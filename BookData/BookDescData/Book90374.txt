Private military contractors. They’re not just for foreign wars anymore.Jon Cantrell, a disgraced ex-cop, works for one such company. He’s a DEA agent paid on a commission basis, patrolling one of the busiest drug-hubs in the country: Dallas, Texas.When Cantrell confiscates the wrong shipment of drugs, he finds himself in possession of a star witness in a cartel trial that could destroy the largest criminal organization in the hemisphere.To turn a profit, all he has to do is deliver the witness to the US Attorney in a tiny town called Marfa on the other side of the state. An easy trip, except a group of competing DEA contractors and a corrupt Dallas cop want everybody involved dead.
