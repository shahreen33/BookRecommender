The inside story of how serial predator Larry Nassar got away with abusing hundreds of gymnasts for decades--and how a team of brave women banded together to bring him down.We think of Larry Nassar as the despicable sexual predator of Olympic gymnasts--but there is an astonishing, untold story. For decades, in a small-town gym in Michigan, he honed his manipulations on generations of aspiring gymnasts: kids from the neighborhood, girls with hopes of a college scholarship, athletes and parents with a dream. In The Girls, these brave women for the first time describe Nassar's increasingly bold predations through the years, recount their warning calls unheeded, and demonstrate their resiliency in the face of a nightmare.The Girls is a profound exploration of trust, ambition, betrayal, and self-discovery. Award-winning journalist Abigail Pesta unveils this deeply reported narrative at a time when the nation is wrestling with the implications of the #MeToo movement. How do the women who grew up with Nassar reconcile the monster in the news with the man they once trusted? We learn that their answers to that wrenching question are as rich, insightful, and varied as the human experience itself.
