They wanted a girl quickly so they chose an orphanage where no one would ask questions. They planned to use her until she was pregnant…Instead they got twenty-one-year-old American Starla Anderson.When the Russian Mafia invades the orphanage where she lives, in the middle of the night, throwing the nuns who raised her, into a petrified frenzy, it’s Starla who is chosen as the only one who could possibly survive the Bratva and their demands.But in spite of her own fear of the three massive, glowering and scary men, Starla has to think and act fast…With her heart thundering in her chest, her body on fire at their presence alone, she sees an opportunity, something that might help the other girls at the impoverished orphanage at a chance of a better life. She lays out her only condition.Her body for a fee…Except…No one says no to the Bratva.
