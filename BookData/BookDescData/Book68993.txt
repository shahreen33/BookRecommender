This picture book debut puts a fresh spin on playground dynamics, conflict resolution, relative size, and most important, dinosaurs! With an engaging concept, educational back matter, and a dinosaur growth chart, this engaging playground tale is perfect for curious children and fans of Byron Barton’s Dinosaurs, Dinosaurs and Jane Yolen’s How Do Dinosaurs Say Good Night?“I’m bigger than you!” announces the Iguanodon.“I’m bigger than you!” argues the Triceratops.“I’m MORE TERRIBLE than you!” yells the Tyrannosaurus.Playground antics have never been as much fun—and never visually depicted so much about relative size and weight—as in Hyewon Kyung’s picture book debut. A group of young dinosaurs builds a makeshift seesaw and then takes turns playing on it until the bossy, big, and TERRIBLE Tyrannosaurus goes too far, and Mom steps in to deflate the situation and encourage a peaceful and productive new game. Kyung’s detailed and humorous illustrations will capture the attention of all young dinosaur fans, the short text is ideal for new readers, and the size chart, dinosaur facts, and information about simple machines keep adding to the fun. Promotes cooperation and curiosity—the perfect choice for family and story time sharing.
