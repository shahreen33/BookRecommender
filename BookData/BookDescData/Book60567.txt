One night as the moon gleams through the clouds, a young mother otter gives birth to three cubs in a hollow oak tree. The eldest of the litter is a dog-pup called Tarka. This is the story of his growth to adulthood in the country of Two Rivers, the Taw and the Torridge; of his life in the wild; and the encounters with his enemy, the great hound Deadlock. Henry Williamson's love for nature is intimately bound up with the fascinating story he tells.
