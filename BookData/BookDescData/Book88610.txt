Rose gives her heart and lifetime of service to the House of York. Born to a peasant herbalist, she is taken to nearby Middleham Castle by the Countess of Warwick, in the same way we might adopt a puppy. Here she serves as poppet and companion to the Earl of Warwick's second daughter, Anne. Here she also meets Duke Richard, Edward IV's youngest brother, who is undergoing knightly training. The children form a long lasting relationship which caries them into adulthood."Roan Rose" illuminates a lively, brutal medieval world. The painful pushes and pulls of a friendship unequal in rank, the balancing of the needs of those whom she serves against the claims of her family are Rose's tragic dilemma.
