Cuba Knight came into my life with a wicked smirk, bedroom eyes and a chip on his shoulder.I was warned to stay away from him. Hell, he warned me himself.So,I made it my mission to break his walls down and kill his demons.Loving him had consequences. I just didn't know the extent until he stabbed me with the arrow I willingly gave him.
