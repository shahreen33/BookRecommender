Forgiveness is not Gabriel D’Ange’s strong suit.A self-appointed soldier of God with a penchant for ruthlessly punishing his enemies, he vanished after Anne Lawrence stabbed him with his own dagger.The smart thing would be to let him go.Unfortunately, Anne’s life isn’t just lonely without Gabriel. It’s insufferably boring.Determined to heal the rift between them, she goes in search of her tempestuous former lover, black parasol in hand and daeva magic crackling at her fingertips. But Gabriel has his own plans afoot and Anne finds herself drawn into one of his tangled webs, much against her better judgment.Gabriel’s nemesis has reappeared in Brussels, a vile slaver who’s plundering the Congo Free State with the blessing of King Leopold. Gabriel might be willing to give Anne a second chance, but not until Jorin Bekker’s head is lying at his feet.Back in London, the quasi-reformed necromancer Balthazar sets his sights on the same quarry. He holds a very personal grudge against Bekker — and killing him might be the only way to keep Gabriel D’Ange from Balthazar’s own throat.When the hunters collide at a lavish gala thrown by the king, Anne learns just how far she’ll go to save the man she loves.Note: The Necromancer’s Bride is the sequel to A Bad Breed, which should be read first.
