 There’s three things I love: my crew, my ship, and sinking my torpedo.   I wanted to serve my country for life, but then my ship blew up. Now I’m stuck on indefinite shore leave, holed up in my hometown with no crew, no ship, and definitely no women.  Until, after five years, she walks back into my life .  Tabitha Peterson.  Shabby Tabby, the beautiful girl from the wrong side of the tracks. She didn't have money for fancy clothes, but Tabitha still caught every eye in a hundred mile radius - especially mine. Back then, I’d have done anything to catch her - with zero luck.  I'd always wondered where she ended up.  Now I know - because she’s in my house, the caregiver sent to tend to me. I’m broken, maybe forever, but she’s more tempting than ever, with her crazy curves and big, beautiful eyes.  I go from being bored stiff to having the challenge of my life.  I have two missions: learn to walk again, and get Tabby where I've wanted her all this time. In my arms and in my bed.  We can do it lying, sitting, or standing on one leg - I don’t need both legs to show her a good time. I just want to tear her walls down as I tear her clothes off.  When they fall, I’m not prepared for what comes next. How badly she's been hurt… or how badly I want to protect her.  But I'll risk everything to make her mine, for good.  *Torpedo is a stand-alone novel with a guaranteed HEA and no cheating!*
