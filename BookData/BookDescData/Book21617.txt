People have a nasty habit of dying when he's around. More often than not, people of the female persuasion, although women certainly don't hold the monopoly on pissing him off. But trouble is looming as this time she was a feisty one and managed to gouge a good chunk of skin off his ass with her fingernails, which was a major inconvenience (and quite sore, too)Still, being a resourceful and intrepid sort, a little setback like this is just the kind of challenge his character thrives on. He decides it may be time for a sabbatical, somewhere remote, somewhere where the populations is sparse enough that he will be able to keep himself out of mischief, perhaps even somewhere where he could make a bit of cash. Somewhere like Alaska, obviously.Darla, the frustrated lead detective in charge of finding him is perplexed when the killings suddenly stop. As relieved as she is that the streets seem to be a little safer, she realizes that he pulled out in the nick of time - one more murder and they would have had him. He certainly knows about practising safe killing.Fate, however is a whimsical beast, and neither our intrepid, bear-framing psychopath nor the sexy Darla could possibly foresee that a simple series of coincidences, and one very pissed off lady, would tie the whole thing up with a neat little bow. Or at least, a roll of wire.Things are not going to end well. But for whom?
