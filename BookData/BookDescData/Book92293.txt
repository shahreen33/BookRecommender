 “Apparently, black market werewolf pheromones were readily available if one knew who to ask.”   Two years on from his first assignment, Jack Addison is a seasoned monster hunter, as hungry for fame and glory as he’d been when he first saw his rival, Roux Chat-Bonnes. They meet again when Jack is trapped by seven polyamorous gnomes, but what Roux doesn’t know is that Jack has developed a taste for unusual creatures and got himself captured on purpose.  Roux himself, with his furry body and graceful tail, is just the kind of man Jack would like to get to know intimately, if he only wasn’t so uncertain about flirting.  Opportunity for time together comes when the two of them are asked to hunt down a rogue werewolf pack. But with Roux being his usual uptight self, Jack turns his attention to the possibility of charming a werewolf. To increase his chances, he purchases a vial of pheromones, but once Jack and Roux are alone in the woods during the full moon, the line between hunter and hunted gets blurry.
