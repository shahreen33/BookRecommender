Shortly after retrieving a survivor from the ill-fated research vessel La Magia, cruise ship Emerald Rose mysteriously disappears. But evil isn’t content to stay lost forever. The ship reemerges a week later transmitting a single word—Pandora—prompting business tycoon Patrick Carver to send out a team to investigate. He seeks out Aubrey Pittenger for reasons beyond her. She’s not a soldier or a rescuer, just a doctor who spent the last year suffering from the loss of her little girl. Yet when Carver makes her an offer she can’t refuse, she finds herself hurtling toward the crumbling ship and the dark things that flit through its once elegant hallways. Mercenary Julian Eduardo receives a similar offer. Having lived most of his life on one battlefield or another, he now fights to ensure his little brother Ricardo won’t have to follow in his blood soaked footsteps. But all is not as it seems aboard the Emerald Rose, and evil comes in many forms. Carver’s cutthroat team will have to band together if they hope to survive the night and find the essence of hope, the hope they’ve all been searching for, the distant promise at the bottom of Pandora’s Box.
