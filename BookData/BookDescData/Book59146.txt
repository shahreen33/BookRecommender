Reeling from recent events, even Hawkeye wants to know his new status quo. Who’s with him? Who’s against him? Who’s trying to kill him, and why? And just when Clint’s rock bottom couldn’t arrive fast enough, his brother shows up. After a lifetime of bad decisions, Clint and Barney Barton have to realize they have to save one another — If they don’t kill each other first. But when Clown and the Tracksuit Draculas lay siege to their building, round one doesn't go well. Deafened and bloodied, will the Bartons make easy pickings for the Tracksuits? Ever seen Rio Bravo? The brothers Barton double down in a new kind of shoot 'em up! Don't miss it bro.Collecting: Hawkeye #12-13, 15, 17, 19, 21-22
