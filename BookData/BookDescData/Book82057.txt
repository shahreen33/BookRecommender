Two men...one an honorable but poor soldier...the other an aging Lord looking for a wife.  Society demands that money marry money, but when the heart demands something, or someone, different, it takes courage to run with your passions and not the pretenses of tradition.  These are the dilemmas that Sophia Burton and Linda Hawkes must face as they consider their future, and the men who will stand by their side. Neither are ready to concede to an arranged marriage that chains them to convention and misery.  Neither wants to be ...the wrong bride ...for the wrong man ...for the wrong reasons.  Can they step beyond their fears and find a way to true love and lasting happiness?
