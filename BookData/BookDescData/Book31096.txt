Kill or Cure is a YA romance-infused sci-fi novel. It focuses on human relationships in an undead, apocalyptic world. A girl who will stop at nothing to protect her brother.   In a dystopian world ravaged by infection, society as we know it has fallen to the mouths of the dead. The remaining fragments of civilisation survive in walled compounds, scattered in the depths of the countryside. When her little brother becomes sick with a suspected flu virus, Alyx Silverthorne will do anything to keep Tommy alive.  With limited medical supplies and only herbal alternatives, his prospects of surviving this mystery illness are bleak. But saving Tommy is just the beginning. The infected are not the only monsters that exist in this new world, and human nature can be more destructive than the dead.  In a race against time, Alyx and her best friend Will stop at nothing to protect him, even from the same people that swore to protect them all.  Kill or Cure is a dynamic, multifaceted story of teenage love and gut wrenching loss in a dystopian world.
