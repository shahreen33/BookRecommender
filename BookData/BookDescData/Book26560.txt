The history of Christianity over the past 500 years is a dramatic story. Within our cultures, our politics, and our very relationship to the world at large, Christianity has been at the center of momentous transformations around the globe and is now the largest religion in the world. The History of Christianity II: From the Reformation to the Modern Megachurch is your chance to explore one of the most powerful stories in world history. Over 36 fascinating lectures, Professor Molly Worthen of the University of North Carolina traces the story of Christianity as it transformed from a relatively homogenous entity at the end of the Middle Ages through the diverse global religion of today. While Professor Worthen gives you plenty of insight into theology, her primary focus is to place Christianity in its historical context—the how and why of history as much as the who, what, and when. She personalizes history with stories of individual players and blends their narratives with larger trends give you the full history of momentous events, from Martin Luther’s 95 Theses to the Scientific Revolution to Latin American liberation theology. Professor Worthen is a marvelous storyteller, and brings history to life through the stories of people across history—scientists and theologians, revolutionaries and social justice warriors, commentators and ordinary people living out the great drama of Christian history. This is a magisterial course, and a must-have for students of history and religion.
