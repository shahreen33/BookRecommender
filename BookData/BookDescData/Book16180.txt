The Lucienne Twins is my first journal entry concerning events of both a supernatural and sinister nature. This haunting tale involves a young teacher, Mary Watkins, and her struggle to help Abigail, one of her students, cope with her twin sister's tragic death. But when mysterious occurrences plague Abigail's life, Mary discovers that perhaps the twin sister is not entirely dead and has not left this world.  9,300 words, or approximately 37 pages.
