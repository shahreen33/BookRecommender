Tequila: a distilled beverage made from the blue agave plant and, in Mary’s case, a truth serum.  It took one night. No, it took one dinner, a bevy of cocktails, and a woman who’s been skirting me for months. Then, everything changed. Because the tequila did what it does best, Mary’s words flowed faster than the magic liquid she was shooting with salt and lime. Mary had demons—ones she thought were buried. She thought wrong. She can’t hide from her past or from me. Not anymore. I’m Evan Hargrove and I’ll turn the world red before I let anything happen to her.  This is a Killers Series Crossover Novella written for the Happily Ever Alpha World of NYT Bestselling Author, Aurora Rose Reynolds.  Warning: This book contains naughty words and sexy bits.
