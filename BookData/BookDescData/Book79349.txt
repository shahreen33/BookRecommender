The first all-new collection of poems since 2011's Snowflake/different streets--and following the critically acclaimed Afterglow (a dog memoir), as well as the volume of selected poems, I Must Be Living Twice--here, in Evolution, we find the eminent, exuberant writer at the forefront of American literature, upending genre in a new vernacular that enacts--like nobody else--the way we speak (inside and out) today. Evolution, with its channeling of Quakers, Fresca, and cell phones, radiates vital insight, purpose, and risk, like in these opening lines of the title poem:Something unearthly about today so I buy a Diet Coke &amp; a newspaper a version of "me"  something about me on the earth &amp; its sneakers &amp; feeling like the earth's furniture but that can't be true or like the coke &amp; the Times it's true for a little while.
