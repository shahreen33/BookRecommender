I may have saved her ass. But can she salvage my heart?It’s funny how life can change in the blink of an eye. One moment I have gorgeous wife and a job that won me the nickname ‘King of Wall Street’, next I find myself raising my kid single-handedly on a remote ranch in Colorado. The only thing that keeps me going is my son, inside I’m frozen. Devastated by the loss of my wife. Incapable of loving again.Until I see her. Cuddled up under a tree, cold and wet, and on the brink of the death. And I know I’m not going to watch another woman die in my arms.
