There was a time when I was a princess with no power. I had no choice but to run, because I wanted control over my own life. However, when you spend your life planning your next escape, you forget to do the living stuff.  At least until the past comes back to remind you why you ran in the first place.  Aside from my brother, there's only one other person from my past who could hold any power over me now.  I...just wasn't expecting him to have gotten so batshit crazy.  Rush...  The boy prospect who grew up into a scary killer with very little morality left inside him.  I should be a little more terrified about how obsessed he seems to be with me, but...I'm just warped enough to overlook the crazy. Mostly.  It's not a real romance unless it starts with a kidnapping, right?  Yeah, my life has always been a crazy house. The more things change, the more they stay the same...    ***Warning: This is a dark romance and not a healthy, wholesome relationship.  **Violence warning **Language warning **Can be read as a stand-alone.
