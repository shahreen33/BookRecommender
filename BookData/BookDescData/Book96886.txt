Four guys. Constant moaning. And a revolving door across the college suite I somehow ended up in because my first name is Shawn. They don't discriminate. Girls. Guys. Grandmas. Plants (okay maybe not plants) all walks of life stroll in stressed to the brim, and leave so satisfied I'm wondering what sort of talents lie behind that door. My roommate calls them the pleasure ponies. But the rest of the college campus? They just call them the new face of Wingmen Inc. A paid for relationship service that makes big promises. Breakup? They'll glue you back together again. Depressed? They have the magic pill. Lonely? Just spend a few minutes while they rub you down and you'll forget all about it. And broken hearts? Well, that's their specialty. They'll fix you.For a price…I swore I wouldn't get involved. But apparently they like a challenge, and a girl who doesn't put up with their BS is basically like waving a red flag in front of a bull. They. All. Charged. But one holds my attention above the rest. Knox Tate looks like a Viking — and getting pillaged is starting to look more appealing by the day. Though he's hiding something — all of them are. And the closer I get. The more I realize that some things are left better in the past.You've read reverse harem books before — but you've never read one like this. It's not what you think, or is it? Dive in and find out…Knox, Leo, Finn, and Slater are waiting, and they aren't patient men. Welcome to the new face of Wingmen Inc — You're welcome.
