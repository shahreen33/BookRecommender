    A pocket-sized collection of food-themed Simon's Cat cartoons, these adorable snapshots of life with a very demanding cat are selected from the first two Simon's Cat books, with 10 brand new cartoons. In full color for the very first time, the YouTube sensation is back on the page—only smaller and cuter. This cat will do anything to be fed.
