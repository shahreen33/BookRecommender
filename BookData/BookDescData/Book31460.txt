Cold Case Detective, Ronan O’Mara is stunned to see the breaking news that a well-known mobster he helped to put behind bars, Vito “The Dragon” Dragonni, has been released from prison after his life sentence is overturned on a technicality. When prominent members involved in the original case against The Dragon start turning up dead, Ronan starts to wonder if he’s next.  Psychic, Tennyson Grimm starts having visions of dead men with The Dragon’s signature kill shot: two bullet holes to the forehead. The men in the visions are strangers, but when he learns from an undercover agent that Dragonni has compiled a hit list with Ronan and his ex-partner, Tony, at the top, he fears a day will come when he recognizes the murder victim in his vision.  Tony Abruzzi has been a broken man since the tragic death of his adopted son, Mark. Refusing the offer of protective custody until Dragonni and his hit squad are off the streets, he seems to be daring the mobster to come after him. Despite the fact that they’ve been estranged since the case that cost Tony’s son his life, Ronan decides to stick to his former partner’s side as his personal bodyguard, whether Tony wants his help or not.  Can Ronan and Tony find a way to work together to stop The Dragon before he can cross more names off his hit list or are both detectives dead men walking?
