What if it turns out that YOU'RE the bully - and you didn't know it? Things aren't going very well for 13-year-old Luke Mitchell. He's been kicked out of his posh private school, Heyworth Academy; his best friend Jon has just dumped him; and the tough guys at his new school have just picked him as their new target. So what's a guy who used to be on the top of the heap supposed to do? The upside-down world that Luke finds himself in at Carlyle gives him a whole new way of looking at things. Can he recover from losing his school, and his best friend, and find new friends and a way to fit in at Carlyle?
