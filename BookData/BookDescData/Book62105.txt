Lieutenant William Bligh's account of the fatal voyage of the bounty, and his subsequent 3,600-mile trip to Timor in an open boat. This Narrative was Bligh's first publication upon his return to Britain, and begins the tale from the mutiny itself; subsequently he published the story of the first half of the voyage, and later both tales were packaged, sometimes including ship's logs or other supplemental material, under various titles, most famously as The Mutiny on the H.M.S. Bounty.
