An alternative cover edition for this ASIN can be found here.Dante Lovelace is not accustomed to waking up in unfamiliar beds... and he’s even less accustomed to working with witches.  Imagine his displeasure when both happen consecutively.  After being spirited away—i.e. kidnapped—Dante finds himself at the mercy of Miss Beatrice Dickens, a witch and spiritualist who has placed a binding spell upon him to strengthen her own powers. As demons must, Dante begrudgingly surrenders to his fate but soon discovers the witch needs him for protection. Zero Bancroft, an uncommonly dangerous man, wants to release an uncommonly dangerous beast in Beatrice’s keeping: a soul-eater. It’s up to Dante and Beatrice to stop him.  If that weren’t enough, Dante must also contend with his partner, Iago Wick, who longs to defect and abandon his Hellish duties—and he wants Dante to follow. What’s a demon to do?  With some new companions (and a certain inventor) on their side, Mr. Lovelace and Mr. Wick must contend with magic, hunters, automatons, and even uncomfortable family reunions. Can they protect the world from Bancroft’s mad scheme, or is the Apocalypse just around the bend?
