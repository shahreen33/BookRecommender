High-horsepower power blenders are revolutionizing the kitchen habits of millions of people. These fast and convenient devices have many of the functions of the food processor, the juicer, and, of course, the old-fashioned, low-horsepower blender. Vanessa Simkins' Power Blender Revolution is the first general cookbook for power-blender owners who want to get the most use and pleasure from their purchase. Power blenders make juices without sacrificing the nutritious fiber that juicing machines can't handle; they make purees (including baby foods), soups that are silky smooth and light; and they excel with hummus, guacamole, and other dips and spreads. With a little instruction, you’ll be making healthy smoothies for breakfast. When dinner comes rolling around, you’ll know how to make every kind of sauce imaginable, for topping pastas, meats, potatoes, vegetables, and more. Time for dessert? You can't mix up a faster mousse, or a faster blend of ice-cream ingredients, in any other kind of machine. With expert tips and tricks that help you choose, use, clean, and maintain your machine, and a bounty of more than 300 creative and tasty recipes, this book is an essential companion for anyone who has invested in a power blender.    "Power Blender Revolution is packed full of healthy, vibrant recipes and creative ways to use your blender. Vanessa Simkins proves that your blender isn't just for smoothies. These are recipes you will come back to time and time again.". --Tieghan Gerard, author of Half Baked Harvest
