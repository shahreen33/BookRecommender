Marie is a girl with the gift of understanding, who is often misunderstood, both at home and in her Catholic school, where she confounds her fellow pupils and teachers as she tries to understand and love those few special people who need her help to be themselves. But understanding and loving people is harder than it sounds, and Marie soon realizes that having faith and living in 1960s Britain doesn’t leave much room for those who are different from the norm. They only really leave room for shame, prejudice, and, oh yeah, more shame. So Marie decides to do as she sees fit—with some hilarious, moving, and unexpected results. As we follow Marie from the sixties to the nineties, we find out what it means to be a spirited young woman from a religious household who believes that maybe, just maybe, God doesn’t care WHAT you do with your body as long as it makes you happy. Because really, what harm can come from loving people?
