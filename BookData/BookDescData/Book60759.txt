In the not too distant future, most of the solar system has been colonized in a tremendous expansion known as the Great Solar Diaspora. Massive space habitats house anywhere from hundreds of thousands to billions of people. The colonies vary greatly in size and design, in politics, in technology, and in religion and faith. You might think that people who live in space and depend on technology all day, every day, would be above superstition, but you would be wrong. Even on Harkon Colony - one of the largest, most advanced space habitats in the solar system - there are plenty of people who believe in all kinds of strange mystical things.Things like what Will Ozwald sells at his shop, “Master Wu’s Spells and Spare-Ribs.” There, you can buy anything you want: from a necklace for hiding skin blemishes, to a ring that suppresses teenage libido. Except, don’t ask for a love potion. “Master Wu say can not do.” There is even a sign. You see, Will can illegally exploit the tech every Harkonite has in his head to create many illusions. But love is no illusion! Will believes that all he could manage would be a kind of lust-slave spell, and even a con-artist has to draw the line somewhere. Yet, despite the sign, citizens keep on asking. Why can’t his customers accept his one rule? Why do they keep asking for love? And, what happens when one particular customer won’t take “no” for an answer?“Cyborg Spell Shop” is a short story (6,000 words) set in a shared fictional universe with author James Chalk’s “Jonathan Harkon Adventure” series.
