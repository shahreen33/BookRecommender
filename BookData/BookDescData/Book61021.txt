Finn thinks he's not worthy of love. Luke thinks he's destined to be a lone wolf. But once they find each other, their lives will never be the same.  Fresh out of the institution after a failed suicide attempt, Finn's ready to crawl back up and reclaim life. He'll stick to his plan, take the tests, kiss all the butts and get back into grad school. That’s all he thinks about until he meets his new roommate the older, intimidating Luke.  Kicked out of his pack for being gay, alpha wolf Luke sees no way out of the solitary life he leads. That is, until he sees Finn, bent over the kitchen island, and the need to claim him, take him, becomes too much to bear. He'll do whatever it takes to bring Finn out of his shell and convince him they're mates.  But Luke’s alpha essence begins to change Finn in ways he never could have imagined. While the possibility of starting a family fills him with pride, the fear of the unknown, of what it could do to Finn, fills him with dread.  One thing Luke knows for sure--there is no going back, not after finding Finn.
