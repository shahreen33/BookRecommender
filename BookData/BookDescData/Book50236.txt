They call him the second coming. Of honor for British football. Of God in an athlete’s body. Of every English woman’s fantasy.  Jude Davies is my country’s prodigy on the pitch. More famous than the nobility in Buckingham Palace, he and his merry band of scoundrels rule the Rogue Football Academy and the London nightlife scene alike.  And now, he’s aiming his well-honed set of skills directly at me. His devilish charm is lethal, but with the tragic hand life has dealt me, distractions like him aren’t an option.  Plus, we’re only playing a game. One of convenience, where he needs me to save his reputation, and I need his money to save the one person I love.  Until he wraps me around that immoral finger. Until I crave that reckless, wild high he provides. Until I hope for a future that will never happen.  That’s the thing about going toe-to-toe with the next football legend. He’s faster, stronger, and will destroy me every time.
