The Red Event occurred a year ago, a cloud of subatomic particles blanketing the Earth for three days. The first sign that it had created a lasting effect happened two months later with the financial ruining of every casino in Las Vegas. The people responsible became known as 'lucky ones', members of the lucky one percent of humanity whom the Red Event had transformed into something more.  In the intervening year, the lucky ones have proven to be a plague upon the other 99% of humanity, as the majority of them take what they wish and leave trails of bodies and rubble in their wake. If there are any heroes among them, they are few and in hiding.  Jill Hammond is a teenage girl, one whom the Red Event didn't touch. She is also a terminally ill cancer patient who's been given a chance at becoming something much more for the last four to six months of her life - The injection of a mutagenic compound will transform her cancer, giving her superpowers. All she has to do is join the U.S. Army and become part of a top secret special forces team made up of other terminal cancer patients.  As Terminals, they are stronger than most lucky ones. They'll take the fight to the lucky ones, but the mutagen hasn't cured their cancer, the transformed tumors are still lethal to their hosts.
