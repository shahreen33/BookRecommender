I was a loner for a reason. I had too many secrets, too much to hide, and way too much at stake. So, when a stranger showed up at my door, with her talk of saving the world, I should have sent her away. I didnâ€™t. I had to have her, even if I was a criminal...and a virgin. So, I let her in, made her mine. Then everything went to hell. And I had to decide, just how far would I go to keep my woman?  Loving the Secret Billionaire is a sexy standalone novella, in the Love at Last series.  Originally published in the Rogue Affair anthology, this edition has been expanded with new material.
