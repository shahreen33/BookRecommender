We are in a major shift in a fundamental aspect of how businesses grow, how buyers purchase, and how businesses build meaningful conversations and customer relationships. Companies who align their vision, philosophy, process, systems, and tools with the way buyers think, learn, discover, and purchase will have a huge competitive advantage. Organizations need to adjust their mindset and build a strategic foundation to deal with these facts and not just update a business plan. Inbound Organization will show leaders how to build their company's future around Inbound principles and strengthen the structural foundations necessary to deal with the changes in buyer behavior. It will show readers why and how the inbound customer experience conversation belongs in the boardrooms and on the desks of founders, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and anyone that has a responsibility to leader their organizations into the future.
