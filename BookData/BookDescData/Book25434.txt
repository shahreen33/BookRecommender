Although she claims to have been an outsider in her native land -- "I never fit in anywhere, not into my family, my social class, or the religion fate bestowed on me" -- Isabel Allende carries with her even today the mark of the politics, myth, and magic of her homeland, Chile. In My Invented Country she explores the role of memory and nostalgia in shaping her life, her books, and that most intimate connection to her place of origin.The military coup and violent death of her uncle, Salvador Allende Gossens, on September 11, 1973, sent her into exile and transformed her into a writer. The terrorist attack of September 11, 2001 on her newly adopted homeland, the U.S., brought fourth from Allende an overdue acknowledgment that she had indeed left home. My Invented Country speaks compellingly to all of us who try to retain a coherent inner life and a sense of humor in a world full of contradictions.
