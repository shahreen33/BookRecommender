We’ve all made a wish we’ve regretted, but what if you’ve asked an archdemon like Belphegor to grant it? When Ella agrees to help fellow student Jonathan Trent with his audition into a mysterious magic, she never thought she’d fall in love with him. Nor did she ever conceived the three freakish judges named Hellmouth, Brimstone and Blackheart were actual demons, sent by Belphegor to recruit Jonathan. Seduced by the lure of riches, his own Vegas show and not having to care for his aged grandparents, Jonathan enters into Belphegor’s service, and despite her own reservations Ella goes with him, in return for Belphegor making her disabled sister walk. Then when Jonathan starts to behave like the ‘The Demon Magician’ offstage and Ella learns the true price of his gruesome magic tricks, she knows she has to stop him, but what can she do? Jonathan, has the power of Hell on his side and all she has is Matthew, her mum’s hunk of a gardener, who has no idea the demon world exists.
