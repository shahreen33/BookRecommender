Fire, blood &amp; Vikings! Set in a time when kingdoms were won and lost by the sword, when power was measured by how many men would fight and die for you. When the old gods were still followed, before the Crusades brought the power of the church to all of Europe. Ben hopes this to be a multi-volume anthology series of dark ages viking stories.
