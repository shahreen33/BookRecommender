This bonus e-novella is set during the years between Ring of Secrets and Whispers from the Shadows. In 1789, General Isaac Fairchild crosses the Channel on a very special assignment. After surviving the American Revolution, he is now gathering information on life at King Louis XVI’s court at Versailles. But he must also find a countess and her grown daughter, then escort them back to England before revolution explodes in France. He knows the task before him is dangerous, but when he meets the beautiful Julienne, a new peril beckons—of even deeper intrigue than Versailles.
