HARLOWDarkness surrounds me. Who am I? I don’t remember anything. Every memory of my life gone. I wake in a hospital not knowing my own name. I don’t know these people who claim to be are my parents, but they take care of me, they show me pictures… and introduce me to my fiancé?I guess I was living a perfect life before my accident. I had it all, so I try to remember. I try to keep living my life, but I can’t shake the feeling that something is off. I’m noticing things are not adding up. I’m catching people around me lying and I know something is terribly wrong. It seems like my memory is not the only thing missing… SULLIVAN How could I have been so stupid? How could I’ve let them play me like this? This is all my fault. I hurt her, I let this happen, and now she is in her parents clutches again. Even worse, she doesn’t remember anything… she doesn’t remember us.I hate my parents for playing their part in this and my brothers hate me for playing mine. I need to fix this. I need to make my brothers forgive me so we can save her, we need to make her remember what kind of people her parents really are… before it’s too late.Now the only question is if she remembers… will she ever forgive me?
