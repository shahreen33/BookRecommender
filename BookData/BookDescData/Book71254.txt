Like the reading of Tarot cards, the spreading of the runes, or the touch of a Ouija board, The Oracle Book offers immediate responses to seekers' questions. Written by In Style magazine's savvy astrologer Georgia Routsis Savas, this immediate form of divination is called bibliomancy--the art of foretelling the future using books. The idea is for readers to first ask a yes-or-no question (the clearer the question, the clearer the response). Then readers run their thumbs over the edge of the pages of the Oracle Book until they sense their thumb has landed on the right spot. Finally, they open the page. The answer appears in a two-page spread and could come from any number of divination sources, including Tarot, astrology, dice, and even tea leaves. For example, it might read, "Libra, the sign of the scales, or balance, counsels you to consider another's feelings. Or, "The Crystal ball depicts an empty purse; don't be greedy." Or, "The tea leaves are in the shape of a shell: whatever you desire will be yours." The attractive typeface and illustrations make this an enticing tool to work with. As with all oracles, it's the reader's open-mindedness and intuitive skills that will determine how lasting and helpful of a resource this can be. --Gail Hudson
