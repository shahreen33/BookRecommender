Florand takes us to a snow-kissed Christmas cabin for this heart-wrenching tale of love, loss, forgivenessâ€”and hope. After the utter destruction of her marriage and her happiness, Kai knew it was better to shut herself away from the world than to hurt and be hurt. Holed up in her mountain cabin, she planned to spend her Christmas alone. Until her not-quite-ex-husband shows up as the first flakes start to fall. Now should she send him back out into the cold? Or can she be brave enough to let this winter snow bind them back together?(A novella of 34,000 words. Approx. 130 pages.)
