This marriage is strictly business... until the temptation gets way too real.
  Corbin:
 I loved my grandma, but I don’t need her money. All I care about is keeping the house — the only place that’s ever felt like home. That, and screwing over my dad, who wants to turn the property into a mall. There’s only one catch: To receive my inheritance, I have to get married within six months. Me, the guy who’s never dated a girl for more than six minutes. Now I need to find a woman I can trust. So when I’m rear-ended by a Prius, I figure it’s a sign that I’m supposed to meet gorgeous, down-to-earth Teagan Monroe.
  Teagan:
 First I lose my job. Then I come home and find out — in the most graphic way possible... yeah, that way — that my boyfriend is a cheating jerk. And then I speed off and nearly kill Portland’s sexiest bachelor. Corbin Lane should be pissed. Instead, he offers me more money than I’ve ever seen in my life to marry him and live together in a mansion for two years. No sex. No feelings. Just cash — enough to make all my dreams come true. Then we go and break all our rules... and I realize I’m falling in love with my fake fiancé.
