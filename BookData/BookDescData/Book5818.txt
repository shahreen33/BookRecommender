Time can neither be called a Hero, nor a Villain – because it is both. Almost all the people in this World might have had a bad experience with Time. Well, at least my experience was a bit more Exciting and Adventurous than I expected it would be. To all those people who wonder about Time Travel and its Science, I present my Exciting & Wonderful Experience with Time and Time Travel: TIME TRAVEL EXPERIENCES……. This Book is actually a Combination of 3 Different Topics: Life, Mathematics and Time Travel. The reason that I grouped 3 different Subjects into One Book is that I will be able to share my Knowledge with more people and I will also be able to demonstrate the Relation between these Topics. This Book is divided into 3 Sections. The First Section is about the INVISIBLE DIMENSIONS OF LIFE and it criticizes various Aspects of the Life of a Modern Human. The Second Section is purely Mathematical and will help you to interpret Numbers in a Novel and Fascinating manner. The Third section synchronizes with the Title of this Book and is especially for all those people who wonder about the Concepts of Time and Time Travel....... The whole Book is written in Simple Language and is suitable not only for Science Enthusiasts, Scientists, Mathematicians... but also for those People who always wanted to know about the different Aspects of Time Travel, Mathematics and Life.......
