As a newcomer to the alien tribe, I've struggled to find my place. It might be because I'm a tad headstrong at times. And yes, I might have thrown a few things at people's heads. But I had a good reason to pitch a fit - my shy sister was stolen away right under my nose. Of course, now she's back and mated. Everyone's happy... except me.  I need... affection. Attention. Okay, I'm lonely. Really lonely.  Strangely enough, the only person that I think understands what I'm going through is the same blue-skinned brute that stole my sister. It's wrong to hook up with him, even as a mindless fling.  Except... I'm not so good with the whole 'rules' thing. And he's not so great with the 'fling' thing.
