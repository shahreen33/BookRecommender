Yara lives with her Mama in the lush Amazon rainforest gathering berries and mushrooms and happily sharing her love with friendly animals and plants. One day when Yara falls seriously ill, the forest finds a way to return the love and save Yaraâ€™s life. Written in rhyme and stunningly illustrated by Joanna Pasek, this is the introductory book to a new picture-book series showing children how all living things on our beautiful planet depend on one another.
