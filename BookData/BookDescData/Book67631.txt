The Billionaire Book Club Questionnaire  
  #1: Who is your least favorite character in the book?
 Me—Caplin Hawkins. I am an absolute idiot.  
  #2: Who is your favorite character?
 Gorgeous, addictive, insanely challenging Ruby. She’s smart, driven, self-confident, and so beautiful, she makes my chest ache.  
  #3 What is your biggest takeaway from the story?
 Ruby Rockford and I are meant to be. I just have to prove it to her.  For the entirety of my adult life, I’ve been content. Content in my single lifestyle, content in my stressful-but-extremely-successful job as the main corporate counsel for almost every Fortune 500 company in North America, and content in my playful, spontaneous ways.  I had no idea it was possible for someone to change my mind.  The endless women and work are no longer enough, and just as Ruby Rockford told me—it’s about time I grow up.  It’s going to take a strategic attack from more than a couple brilliant minds to win her affection, but luckily, I know exactly where to find the right guys for the job…
