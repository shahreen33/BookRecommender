A puzzling murder takes place in a small southern Minnesota town during the coldest spell of winter. It's January, and Beth Reddy, newly certified private investigator, is hired by members of her book club to help solve the killing of one of their own. Beth and her partner, Damien George, are supposed to be cooperating with the local authorities, but after deciding there's more to this than meets the eye, strike out on their own. The reader is taken on a psychological journey into the minds of several suspects after the murder of another book club member occurs in a neighboring town. Although one individual, a local odd fellow, emerges in the eyes of Beth and Damien as the main person of interest, local officials seem to be perplexed. The odd fellow possesses a mysterious past and a curious connection to the murder victims, but the logistics and motives just don't seem to add up. The murders continue to pile up, further complicating the investigation and confirming the suspicions of some in the law enforcement community. Nothing is as it seems as Beth and Damien stretch the legal boundaries while desperately seeking the identity of the person eliminating members of the book club.
