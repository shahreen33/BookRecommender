HIGHLY COMMENDED in the Soul&amp;Spirit Book Awards 2019 for Best Spiritual Real Life Story this is a book you are going to want to read. Providing really simple ways to manage stressful situations that occur in your life.Divorce, bereavement, house move, job loss, marriage, pregnancy, new businessThese are all major life events that happen to most of us. Some of us may have loved ones around us, but they might not truly understand the stress it causes you. Whilst there are lots of practical solutions for these events, finding something to help us through these emotionally are rarer. This is why I wrote this book. I went through a bereavement, followed by a divorce and then a house-move in the space of 12 months. It was challenging. I was lucky that I had my spiritual toolbox that I had spent 10 years building. I want to share these tools with you TODAY.
