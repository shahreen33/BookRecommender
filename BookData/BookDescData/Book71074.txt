An MM Mpreg Romance. Team: A.L.P.H.A.:Six battle-hardened alphas with one goal—to save any omega in peril   Jonah McKiernan has a phobia of germs, dirt, and the government, so naturally his mate turned out to be an FBI agent who he found near death at the back of a shipping container under piles of filth.  Matthew Hutchins had been working undercover for years, until a fellow agent--and former friend--exposed him to cover up his own dirty dealings.  Matthew is determined to bring his betrayer to justice, and Team ALPHA finds out that maybe their loose ends aren’t completely tied up. But while Jonah wants to go full shifter justice on their remaining enemies, Matthew is a man of the law and will not budge.  But sometimes, you have to fight dirty to get clean, and both men’s core beliefs will be challenged as they approach the final showdown.  This is the sixth book in this exciting series, but can definitely be read as a stand-alone novel. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and occasional violence. Be prepared for copious and inappropriate uses of sanitizer, the return of STAHP, and all your favorite characters. Trigger warnings: graphic violence and mention of human trafficking. HEA definitely included, intended for 18+ readers only. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown?
