Lots of the kids in Mr Speed's class have something to worry about. From a new stepmum to coping with Maths, everyone has their own private concerns and it's sometimes difficult to discuss them - even when you need advice. So Mr Speed sets up the Worry Website on the classroom computer. Anybody in the class can anonymously enter their worry and anyone else can type in advice to help out. A unique production for Jacqueline Wilson, coming from a story originally published in electronic form on the Internet, and also containing a brilliant story by a 12-year-old fan, who entered a competition to write a companion story to Jacqueline's.
