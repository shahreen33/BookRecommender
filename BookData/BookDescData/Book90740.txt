It would take a Christmas miracle to get these two togetherVeterinarian Janice Sullivan has been horse-crazy all her life and only wanted to work on her family’s cattle farm, the Three Sisters Ranch, but her father’s constant criticisms drove her away, forcing her to choose a new career in dressage and leaving her secret crush behind. With the ranch facing possible bankruptcy, Janice has an idea to save it – a woman’s retreat. With Christmas around the corner, Janice is not only hoping for a chance under the mistletoe with the one man she’s been unable to forget, but also to give a few cowgirl wannabes a chance in the saddle.Bah humbug! The last thing ranch foreman Nate Pierson needs is a bunch of weepy or giggly eggnog-swilling city chicks getting in his way and distracting his men while they’re busting their tails wrangling long horns. His short temper and lack of patience often push people away except the one woman he needs to leave alone. As tempting as she is, Janice, the boss’ daughter, can never be anything more than a fantasy. The only Christmas spirit he wants is 100 proof, especially when he has to matchmake Janice with the ranch’s vet.Nate knows from experience that Christmas miracles are for suckers, but it doesn’t stop his heart from wishing Janice could wind up under his tree instead of with the man her Daddy wants her to marry.
