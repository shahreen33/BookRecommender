In this tale of redemption and revenge, Edgar-nominated author Paul Levine delivers his most powerful thriller yet. Jake Lassiter, second-string linebacker turned low-rent lawyer, is cynical about the law, but if you hire him, he’ll take a punch for you . . . and maybe a swing at the prosecutor, too.Amy Larkin—beautiful, angry, and mysterious—accuses Lassiter of involvement in the disappearance of her sister eighteen years earlier.

But before Lassiter can nail the truth, a gun goes off, a suspect falls dead, and Amy is charged with murder.The state has an eyewitness and a slam-dunk case. Lassiter has a client he doesn’t trust and a case he can’t win. Did Amy shoot the man who killed her sister? Or the wrong man? And what really happened to Krista?
