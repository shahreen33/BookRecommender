Bestselling award-winning author Constance O'Day-Flannery is the one true Queen of Time Travel Romance. Join her now in a story of a disillusioned young widow who returns to the past, caught, to her horror, in an unflattering lime green bridesmaid's dress when she meets the man whose love is destined to be hers.

  Time After Time
After existing in a fog since the death of her beloved husband, Kelly Brennan is suddenly ready to take control of her life. Only she didn't expect her new life to begin in post-Civil War New Orleans.Â  Kelly isn't sure if she's losing her mind or just enjoying a really good dream ... one chat comes complete with a man who looks strikingly similar to her late husband. Widower Daniel Gilmore is the epitome of the Southern gentleman: charming, handsome and with a devilish glint in his eye that calls to the dormant heart she's locked away.In the years since Daniel's wife passed away he has shuttered himself off from those dearest to him, and not even his precocious daughter Lizzie has been able to draw him out of his misery.But then Lizzie brings home a strange woman in a dreadful gown who speaks about odd things called "automobiles" and "telephones" -- a woman who bears a remarkable resemblance to his wife. With a daughter in need of a mother and a heart in need of love Daniel yearns to keep Kelly by his side ... provided he can let go of the past long, enough to live in the present and convince Kelly that his present is where she belongs...
