  Las Vegas is getting rampaged by ubernaturals, and only one team has the guts to step in.
Ian Dex is the captain of the Las Vegas Paranormal Police Department (PPD), the crew responsible for kicking the crap out of any supernatural stupid enough to mess with the Strip. He's a cop, a millionaire, an amalgamite, and a horndog. Sin City is always running amok with disturbances and glitter, but sometimes those two items merge and the nightlife gets out of hand. Kind of like mixing Hell and...well, more Hell.When an ubermage appears on the Strip, strutting around in his Chippendales-style outfit and sending out other ubernaturals to kick up dust and unleash destruction, it's up to Ian Dex and his team to do what they do best: bust heads and shred souls. Casinos are clamoring for help, cops are fighting tooth and nail just to survive, and tourists think it's all part of the Vegas experience. The weather forecast for tonight on the Strip is dark. Very damn dark...and bloody.
