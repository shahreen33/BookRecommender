From Amazon Bestselling Author, Perri Forrest. A man's job is never done. It holds especially true when you're Rush Cambridge. The story is back and with something of a vengeance. In RAPTURE, new couple Alika and Rush were brought together under severe circumstances. Alika literally crashed into Rush's life and created a need that he didn't realize existed until she was there to awaken it. By RAPTURE 2, the couple had already been faced with the first of many obstacles: Rush's father was murdered, his mother's return after years of absence, and the arrival of a daughter that Rush never knew existed. RAPTURE 3 promises to keep the momentum going. Rush wrote off his sister, Jamie, when he realized that she knew about his daughter. Will they mend their relationship? Or will they remain siblings in name, only? What will happen when tragedy strikes and the traumatic event touches several of the lives that Rush holds dear? And what about Siobhan, Rush's mother, who was being sought for his father's murder? Somebody doesn't want to let it go, and wants to make sure that Siobhan pays for her crime. It's just too much, isn't it? Well, it's happening all while Rush and Alika await the birth of their first child. We know this couple can overcome just about anything, but will it still hold true in the end?
