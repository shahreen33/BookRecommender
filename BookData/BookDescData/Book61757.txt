When love turns to hate—that’s where I come in. I’m Halton Andrew Smithers, attorney. Hal to my clients and friends. Messy divorces, deadbeat dads, runaway wives, cheating partners—I handle them all.I know the seedy side of love, and it isn’t pretty. I avoid emotional attachments—I’ve seen all too often when hot passion turns to frozen tundra.I satisfy myself with helping people behind the scenes. It gives me a sense of satisfaction that completes my life. Until she enters it and everything I believe is turned upside down.She fills a void I never knew existed, and I know without her, my life will never be the same again.For the first time, I want to try.For her. But am I strong enough?
