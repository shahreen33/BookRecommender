Lydia's new boss stole the job she wanted and he thinks he owns the place already on Day One.Turns out -- he actually does.She can't control her attraction to Matt, the man with stormy eyes and a penchant for kissing her in the supply closet, the elevator, and in her increasingly intense dreams. Dreams that sometimes include his friend Jeremy...But Matt has a secret -- he's really Michael Bournham, playboy extraordinaire and the CEO of the company, and he's doing a reality television stunt. For six weeks he's pretending to be a middle manager while producers video tape everything.Everything.Including the moment he and Lydia give in and break every rule.And, perhaps, their hearts.
