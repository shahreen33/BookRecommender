Set in a sprawling Victorian manor, aÂ classic ghost story with a stunning twistI look up at the dark, unblinking eyes of the house and I get the weirdest feeling . . . It's the feeling of being pulled into something and being unable to stop it happening . . .Tabitha is used to changing schools and moving to different houses. But when her family moves into Weston Manor, something is different. It's as if the house has been waiting for her. There are lavender smells which come from nowhere, the old servants' bells ring in the night, and she can hear crying in empty rooms. Tabitha's always been imaginative. Even her best friend Gemma knows that. But this time, could she actually be telling the truth?
