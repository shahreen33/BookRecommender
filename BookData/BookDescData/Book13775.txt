When your world, your life and all of your hopes and dreams for the future are ripped out from under you, how do you go on? Death without dying is not only the most painful kind of death, it's also the most painful kind of life and I don't know if I'm strong enough to live it. I spend my lonely days and nights trying to make sense of what my life has become. Do I have the strength to move forward into the light, or should I just let the darkness take me? I'm Georgia Rae Layton McCarthy and this is the story of me, just me.I'm no longer a part of an us, it's just me.Alone. By myself.
