I'll do anything to save her.  A woman I’ve never met, whose name I don’t even know, gambled her own life to protect my child. In return, she was taken by a mad man.  I’ll put my career, my security, and my life on the line to get her back, even if it means facing the truth about my own mistakes.  The only thing she can't trust me with... is her heart.  This is a FULL LENGTH, STANDALONE with a HEA and NO CLIFFHANGER.
