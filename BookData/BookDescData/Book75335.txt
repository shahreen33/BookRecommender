No Halloween means no Halloween candy. No Halloween jack-o’-lanterns. No Halloween trick-or-treating. No Halloween holiday parties. And worst of all, no Halloween costumes. Pinkalicious has the perfect Pinkagirl costume and she absolutely has to wear it.Superhero Pinkagirl would find a way to save Halloween, and Pinkalicious decides she will too. All she needs to do is figure out a way to get the town’s lights back on. The lights don’t come on—here’s what happens: Pinkalicious persuades the Mayor to have a Halloween party in the park in front of City Hall—from all over town, folks come with their flashlights, their pink pumpkins, and goodies to share.Pinkalicious: Pink or Treat! comes with a sheet of stickers kids can use to decorate Pinkalicious’s town for Halloween.
