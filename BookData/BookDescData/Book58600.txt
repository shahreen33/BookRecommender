Bat Sitru and her merry band of fae are officially on the run...  Or are they on the hunt? It's hard to tell. Separated from Dub and Shar, Bat can only concentrate on getting through the next steps of their piece-meal plan to defeat Balor. They have all the tools to defeat the would-be god, now they just have to pull it all together. With new and unexpected allies, as well as a horde of sluagh on their heels, Bat and her boys race to find Tir Hudi and the cauldron before their enemies know they're there. In the end, it will be up to her, that forgotten goddess, to restore the balance and prevent the world from descending into chaos...  Note: Yes, for those who have not read the first two books yet, this is a "why choose" type romance.
