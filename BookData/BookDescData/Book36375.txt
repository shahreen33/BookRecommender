To some, having the attention of four princes might be a dream come true, but for Corina, it means four times the trouble.Escaping burning buildings, living off scraps, being hunted by vamps--those are storms she knows how to weather. It's having the entire world observe as she and the Dynasty's golden boys engage in a blood bond that has her shaken. For all she knows, it won't even produce a cure for the mysterious blood sickness like they're hoping, which could mean she'll be put to death anyway.And to make matters worse, as a side-effect of the bond, she finds herself falling for the very beasts she once pledged to remove from power by any means necessary.Talk about a conflict of interest.In the second installment of THE VAMPIRE'S MARK, will it be Corina's mission or her emotions that prevail?***This is BOOK TWO in THE VAMPIRE'S MARK series.Series order is as follows:The Vampire's Mark 1: Dark ReignThe Vampire's Mark 2: Hell StormThe Vampire's Mark 3: Cold HeirThe Vampire's Mark 4: Crimson Mist
