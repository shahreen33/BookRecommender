  Praise for the author
  This Author is a fantastic story teller. She just keeps on delivering the great stuff. I didn't think she could top the other books I read by her but she has out done herself again.   I have now read all of this author's books and they seem to get better and better. Can't wait for the next book, what a talented writer. You have quickly become my favorite!! Great job.   Netta Newbound knows how to make her characters real, and weaves an engaging tale that will keep readers absorbed through to the end.Perfect for fans of Rachel Abbott
