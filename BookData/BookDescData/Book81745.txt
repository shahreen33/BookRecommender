Hank is stricken with Eye-Crosserosis. To make matters worse, Beulah, the collie of his dreams, shows up on the ranch with Plato (at least Hank thinks it's Plato). Although he can't see very well, Hank approaches the visiting dogs with the idea of winning his lady love and dusting Plato's spots once and for all.
