Just as the day becomes night, summer becomes fall, and breakfast becomes lunch (with ample time for snacks in between!), Garfield becomes plumper and funnier with every meal he devours, and every practical joke he performs. So whether he's nudging Odie off the coffee table or "doing" lunch with Jon's goldfish, Garfield is in it for the fun--and so are we!
