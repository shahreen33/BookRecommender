Revisiting classic adventures has been extremely successful. "Queen of the Demonweb Pits" was one of the most popular adventures ever created for the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. This novelization appeals to those who have played through the adventure, as well as to those who have an interest in drow elves--one of the most popular races in the game.
