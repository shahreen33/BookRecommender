I know what others believe about me. I've heard the whispers for years. My red hair. My curves. My wicked ideas. But I have a confession. I'm pure. I've never known the touch of a man. While I've dreamed about the things the right man could do to me, I never met him. Then Ryan and Paul show up expecting me to give them everything. They want it all and aren't going to settle for anything less than. I don't know how to do this. I don't know where to start. What if when I finally stop fighting what we could be, it all comes crumbling down? What if it ends up being the best choice I'll ever make?
