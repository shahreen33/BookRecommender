WHAT HIDES BEHIND THE MASK takes place in Venice, the ancient Italian city famous for love and intrigue. Doctor Chiara Mackenzie Davis and her stepbrother Chas Weston find this out first hand when they must travel to Italy and discover the reason why Francesca Severino, Chiara's 84 year-old grandmother, travels to Venice-a place she has no reason to visit-without telling anyone. Chas needs to know the answer and he can't ask Francesca. She checked into the luxurious Cipriani Hotel-something at odds with her habitual thrift minded outlook-where she died the next day. The situation becomes more complicated when Chiara meets family she didn't know existed. However, the Cavaliere Orlando Paladino and his son, Father Girardo Paladino have their own questions about Francesca's visit. When Girardo's cousins show up, the atmosphere thickens with intrigue, which boils over with the arrival of Chas's mother, who comes to Venice in time for the funeral. Chiara and Chas find the answers they seek. However, along the way they must also find the answers to their own personal mysteries and discover the person who hides behind the mask each of themwears.
