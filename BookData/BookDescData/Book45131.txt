Nicole DaSilva keeps her mind on the future. That’s where her perfect life is. At least it will be if she can sort out her broken engagement, get her tattoo removed, control her wayward sisters and catch the person stealing from their business…but that’s easier said than done. Especially when there’s a huge, strangely attractive tattooist in her way... Noah Newcomb keeps his mind on the past. It’s where the demons come loose. He trusts no one and his only plans are for a vasectomy. He and Nicole make as much sense together as, well, an ex-con and a former school captain, but he's never been one to turn down a rebound thing. Especially not with a girl as Type A hot as her. It's your standard ‘say anything to my sisters and I'll call the Australian Tax Office and tell them there's $500,000 in cash under your bed' affair, but as Nicole and Noah hook up it's clear they’re falling for each other. Can they meet in the present? Do they have a shot at something steady?
