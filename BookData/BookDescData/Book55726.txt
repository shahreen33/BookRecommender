It was just supposed to be a one-night stand— Until he stole her life story and put it in a song. Now he’s rock’s hottest new artist— And she’s just found out she’s having his baby. Rory is a pierced and inked tattoo artist by day at Brothers Ink, but by night he’s lead guitarist for the heavy metal rock band, Convicted Chrome. He’s headed East on his Harley to catch up with the tour. Beautiful Rayne is headed West on her motorcycle with her girl squad…the Moto Babes. When rain forces them all to take refuge in the same motel, sparks fly. A night of drinking and karaoke leads to a connection deeper than either of them expects.

Caught up in a whirlwind career that offers temptations and sin at every turn, is Rory losing the biggest part of himself?
