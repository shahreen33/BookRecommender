By Wall Street Journal & New York Times Bestselling Author H.M. WardThe world as we know it is gone. The ice caps have melted and shifted south, devastating the northern territories. Cities such as New York and London now lie in frozen ruins on the ocean floor.Humans have become scarce as many died off during an epidemic, and many more perished during the floods at the start of this new ice age.These events have forced vampires out of the shadows to ensure their food source won't become extinct. Humans have been captured and forced to live like cattle on farms while the oldest of the vampire race--the Regent--have taken control of the remnants of civilization. Despite the Regent's best efforts, their plans for the captives backfire when human blood becomes anemic. With their blood weakened it can no longer sustain the master race. The Regent are desperate to save their race and will do anything to return to the old ways and so every known human is captured and forced into the Regent's way of life.But not all of the humans surrendered. Some evaded the hunters, hiding in safe houses across the frozen tundra. As decades passed, the free humans disappeared, died, or were captured, until there is only one left.
