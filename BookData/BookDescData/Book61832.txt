I never thought I’d fall for an older man. He’s smart. Sexy. Irresistible. Everything I’ve ever wanted, but I can't have him. He’s broken. Guarded. He'll never give me what I need. So why do I still want him? Because I am going to show him how to live again... and how to love. At least, that was the plan.
