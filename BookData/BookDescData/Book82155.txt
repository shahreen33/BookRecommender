Here's something to set you singing...Telling the story of twenty-two carols, Andrew Gant reveals a series of captivating - and often surprising - tales of great musicians and thinkers, saints and pagans, shepherd boys, choirboys, monks and ministers, and accompanies each with its words and music. We discover the carols' hugely varied origins; how few were directly composed as Christmas carols; why 'Hark, How all the Welkin Rings' becme 'Hark, the Herald Angels Sing'; how Ralph Vaughan Williams bolted the tune of an English lament for a dead ox to a poem by an America pilgrim to make 'O Little Town of Bethlehem'; and the mysterious link between Middle Earth and 'O Come, O Come Emmanuel'. Christmas carols brims with anecdote, expert knowledge and Christmas spirit - it's a joyous account of one of our best-loved traditions.
