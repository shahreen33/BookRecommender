He might be a rock star, but he never forgot the woman he'd only—desperately—loved from afar. When Cooper Hood left Snowberry, Montana ten years ago, he swore he’d never go back to the town that painted him with the same brush as his addict mother. But right in the middle of his band’s national tour he gets a call to come home: his mom’s got a whopper of a secret to reveal. Daisy Charbonneau’s in trouble. The talent she hired for her resort’s annual Huckleberry Festival’s just bailed on her, and she’s desperate to find a replacement act. Luck turns her way when she discovers her high school crush is back in town—and he happens to be a rock star.  As they work together, a crush deepens into so much more—but who falls in love in two weeks?Especially when Cooper’s never coming back to town, and Daisy’s never going to leave it.
