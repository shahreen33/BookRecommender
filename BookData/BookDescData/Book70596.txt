My mountain. My cabin. My woman – she just doesn’t know it yet. I left civilization and my demons a long time ago, seeking solitude up on Blackthorn mountain. Just one ex-marine, a remote cabin, and the wilderness, with no distractions. But then she turns up, blowing in with a winter’s blizzard like a very fucking big distraction. Blonde, beautiful, and mouthy as all hell, even when I save her from freezing that sweet little ass off. A rough mountain man like me should want nothing to do with a rich little city girl like Katrina. Except one look at her sweet, tempting curves, and one taste of those sassy, pouty lips, and I want everything to do with her. I saved her from freezing, but maybe it’s her who’s going to save my frozen heart. We’re trapped up here for the storm, locked in a cabin with only the heat between us to keep us warm. Her wealthy, city family thinks they can marry her off to some rich little shit. But they’re very wrong. My mountain. My cabin. My woman. I’ll make Katrina my bride, and I’ll be damned if I let them take her from me.
