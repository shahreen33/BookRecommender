Legend tells of an impostor-sword crafted by a witch-queen, destined to destroy a king. The whole story has never been told. Until now.Recently appointed to the Table of Less Valued Knights, Sir Thomas the Hesitant doesn't mind that the credit always goes to celebrity-knights. He tells himself this frequently. He doesn't truly believe it. The truth is, he thinks it's rubbish.When five armies attack England, everyone on the Round Table is too busy to track down the missing court wizard. Seizing the opportunity to shine a light on the Less Valued, Thomas vows to rescue Merlin and sets himself on a collision course with a talented but overconfident rookie sorceress, a lizard with delusions of grandeur, and one rather unfortunate pigeon.Only one thing is certain - things are not as they seem. They seldom are.
