Imagining Architects analyzes a series of unusual formal experiments in a group of eleventh-century stone temples built in the Karnataka region of southern India, demonstrating a self-conscious modernity of architects who searched for a new architectural principle in their design. Reinforced by contemporary inscriptions, the eight chapters of this book interweave analytical text and vivid illustrations, offering a close, history-sensitive reading of the moment of deliberate change as the eleventh-century makers themselves might have perceived it. Illustrated.
