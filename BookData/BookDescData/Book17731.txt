Lies, deceit and manipulation.A game Alexander White knows only too well, but never has he been on the receiving end with such devastating results. Thankfully he knows it all now because she’s shown her true colours and he won’t be fooled by them again. No matter how perfect she may have been, or how close to love he may have come, Elizabeth Scott and her treachery are now nothing more than yet another move in the chessboard of life.His business, as always, is more important than his worthless emotions and the storm brewing needs attending to. So after he’s pushed her out of his system, after he’s found his way back to the dull uninteresting type of emotion he’s used to he’ll deal with it.In the only way he knows how.Beth Scotts life is upside down. She was a mess. She still is a mess.But now she’s just starting to get irritated about her mess.How could he do this to her? And how could she have let him?Alexander White has a lot to answer for but she won’t be one of those stupid girls any longer. She has a two week rule and it’s about time to get on with it. She just needs a distraction, someone or something to remove the pain and help her find a way forward without him.If his twisted game has taught her one thing it’s to hold her head up and ask for what she wants. So if she can just keep those thoughts running through her head, and embrace what she now needs, she should be fine shouldn’t she?She should be able to deal with everything.She still has no idea what the hell she’s doing.
