**This novella is now included at the beginning of Paper Hearts (Hearts #2).**I met a boy once.  He made my heart go into a frenzy every time he looked at me, and my knees go weak whenever he touched me. Our love was so beautiful, that even its demise was bittersweet.  I met a girl once.  Her world, full of possibilities, made me feel like even I had a chance at being someone. She believed in me. She loved me. We were so secure, that even our breaking point seemed hazy.  Until we reached it.
