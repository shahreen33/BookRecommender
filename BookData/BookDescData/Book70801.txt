Everyone makes mistakes. But does everyone deserve to be forgiven?  She runs past the tinkling of children’s laughter that fills the park. Heart hammering, she reaches the riverbank, breath catching in her throat as her eyes take in the small body, tangled in the reeds, pale and lifeless.  Three years later.  Claire’s life is picture perfect. A new home in the countryside. A new-born baby. A doting husband by her side.  But behind closed doors, her life is falling apart.  And when a threatening note is posted through her letterbox, saying she doesn’t deserve her daughter, it’s clear that someone knows about her past…  Someone knows that Claire doesn’t deserve her perfect life. Someone’s going to do everything in their power to destroy it.  An atmospheric, chilling and absolutely unputdownable psychological thriller about a mother’s worst nightmare. Fans of K.L. Slater, Shalini Boland and The Girl on the Train will love the twists, turns and gasp-worthy shocks of this stunning debut from Ruth Heald.
