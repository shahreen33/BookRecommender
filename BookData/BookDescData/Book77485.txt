I am literally going to kill my mother. To say I have mommy issues is putting it mildly. The woman who abandoned me has a lot of nerve to just saunter back into my life without warning and drop a bombshell of atomic proportions. I tried to kill her as a way of resolving my inner Freudian issues, but my damned boyfriends stopped me. Spoilsports. As if wanting to strangle my birth mother isn’t enough, once again, someone is messing with my life and a new player steps in to save me. Did I mention my dark knight is tall, gorgeous, and fanged? Just don’t tell my lovers because apparently they’re not willing to share me with the undead. The final showdown with the mysterious figure—also known as the major pain in my ass—fast approaches. I don’t care how powerful they are. They screwed up big time when they took something precious of mine. It’s never a good idea to piss off this princess of Hell because revenge is my middle name. Thrust into the final showdown, thankfully, I’ve got more than my fallen angel and kitty at my side. Dark, Fanged, and Delicious is determined to join my group. I’m facing my biggest challenge yet, but don’t worry, with the help of my family and lovers, Hell will have its revenge.
