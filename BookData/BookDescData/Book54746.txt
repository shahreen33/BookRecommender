  is a highly-charged, gripping novel from the world’s favourite storyteller about how suddenly life can change for all of us, and that we might find what we're looking for in the most unlikely of places . . .
In Danielle Steel’s powerful novel, four San Francisco trauma doctors – the best and brightest in their field – confront exciting and exacting new challenges, both personally and professionally, when given a rare opportunity. Bill Browning heads the trauma unit at San Francisco’s busiest emergency room. With his ex-wife and daughters in London, he immerses himself in his work and lives for the little time he can spend with his children. A rising star at her teaching hospital, Stephanie Lawrence has two young sons, a frustrated stay-at-home husband, and not enough time for any of them. Harvard-educated Wendy Jones is a dedicated trauma doctor, trapped in a dead-end relationship with a married cardiac surgeon. And Tom Wylie’s popularity with women rivals the superb medical skills he employs at his medical centre, but he refuses to let anyone get too close, determined to remain unattached forever. These exceptional doctors are chosen for an honour and a unique project: to work with their counterparts in Paris in a mass-casualty training programme. As professionals they will gain invaluable knowledge, but as ordinary men and women they will find that the City of Light opens up incredible new possibilities, exhilarating, enticing and frightening. When an unspeakable act of mass violence galvanizes them into action, their temporary life in Paris becomes a stark turning point: a time to make harder choices than they have ever faced before – with consequences that will last a lifetime.
