Runners suffer one of the highest injury rates in recreational athletics. This book takes the novice and elite level runner alike through a step-by-step process of avoiding and managing injury from starting line to finish line.Covering running injuries around the body from foot to hip, the book focuses on three key aspects: staying on track and injury-free; early detection; and how to rehabilitate from an injury. With the knowledge that prevention is better than cure, the book focuses on helping runners to understand their body, identify weakness, and develop a natural defense against injury. Each of these stages includes key training sessions to add into the reader's existing program, relevant for all running abilities.This accessible manual provides the reader with the ultimate “pain to personal best (PB) guide.” For every common running injury, there is a comprehensive self-help guide, combined with advice on how to choose the best health care practitioner for their injury, as well as what to expect during treatment and prognosis for recovery. In each section there is also a case study of a runner or athlete on their journey through the injury, providing an insight into the psychological rollercoaster runners experience on their journey from treatment to track.With a foreword by Steve Cram.
