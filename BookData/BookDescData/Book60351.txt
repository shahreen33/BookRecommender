It just might. Berkland has accurately predicted at least six significant quakes around the world, an impressive record and invaluable asset in natural disasters. After all, scientists say that they aren't able to reliably predict earthquakes. Berkland hopes that someday earthquake warnings will be announced along with the weather, saving countless people's lives around the world. This is the first book to document one geologist's uncanny ability to foretell earthquakes around the world. The California geologist forecasted the famous Loma Prieta Earthquake that rumbled through the San Francisco Bay Area, and he was right on the money. Many of Jim Berkland's theories - based on tides, moons, geyser activity, magnetic-field changes, and strange animal behavior (disoriented pets, lost cats and dogs) - were linked to the great Indian Ocean quake-tsunami disaster on 26 December 2004.
