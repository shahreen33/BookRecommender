The Aesthetic and Decadent Movement of the late 19th century spawned the idea of "Art for Art's Sake," challenged aesthetic standards and shocked the bourgeosie. From Walter Pater's study, "The Renaissance to Salome, the truly decadent collaboration between Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley, Karl Beckson has chosen a full spectrum of works that chronicle the British artistic achievement of the 1890s. In this revised edition of a classic anthology, "The Ballad of Reading Gaol" has been included in its entirety; the bibliography has been completely updated; Professor Beckson's notes and commentary have been expanded from the first edition published in 1966. The so-called Decadent or Aesthetic period remains one of the most interesting in the history of the arts. The poetry and prose of such writers as Yeats, Wilde, Symons, Johnson, Dowson, Barlas, Pater and others are included in this collection, along with sixteen of Aubrey Beardsley's drawings.CONTENTSJohn Barlas - Oblivion / The Memphian Temple / The Dancing Girl / Beauty's Anadems / The Cat Lady / Terrible Love / My Lady's BathAubrey Beardsley - The Ballad Of A Barber / The Story of Venus &amp; Tannhauser (with illustrations)Max Beerbohm - A Defence of Cosmetics / A Letter To The Editor / DiminuendoOlive Custance (Lady Alfred Douglas) - Peacocks (A Mood) / The Masquerade / Hyacinthus / The White Statue / Statues / Candle-LightLord Alfred Douglas - Apologia / Two Loves / Impression De Nuit / Rejected / Ode To My Soul / The Dead PoetErnest Dowson - Nuns Of The Perpetual Adoration / Non Sum Qualis Eram Bonae Sub Regno Cynarae / O Mors!
