As any student of the great detective is aware, Doctor Watson did not publish all the adventures of his friend, Sherlock Holmes. He refers to some of these untold tales in the published canon, giving us tantalising hints of how Holmes was employed when not engaged in the recorded cases.The volume here contains a wealth of eighteen such Sherlockian treasures within it, recovered from the second box to be delivered to Hugh Ashton (the first contained those adventures published in the "Deed Box" series).With two exceptions, these stories have appeared previously in print, in the Dispatch-box series published by Inknbeans Press.Here, though, for the first time in one edition, in homage to the original style of The Strand Magazine, are the adventures of Sherlock Holmes in:The Affair of the Vatican CameosThe Reigate Poisoning CaseThe Reigate Poisoning Case: ConcludedThe Story of John Henry Augustus Clay (as told by himself)The Abernetty HorrorThe Adventure of the Finsbury HouseThe Curious Affair of the ArchdeaconAn Account of the Victor Lynch Forgery (by Inspector Lestrade)The Russian BearThe Adventure of the Hand of GloryThe Adventure of the Disappearing SpoonThe Lichfield MurderThe Case of the Two DetectivesThe Tarleton MurdersThe Case of the Abominable WifeVamberry the Wine MerchantThe Singular Affair of the Aluminium CrutchThe Adventure of the Two BottlesHugh Ashton has been praised as being one of the authors who come closest to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in his depiction of the great detective and his world.
