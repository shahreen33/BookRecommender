Second in Desperate Debutantes trilogy, Lady Greer Fairchild hopes to avoid guardian Lord Downey's plan of marriage to the first bidder by seeking her distant inheritance, controlled by Rhodrick Glendower, Earl of Radnor, Prince of Powys. Overly helpful Mr Percy reinforces rumor that the prince is rough, ruthless -- even a murderer. But Greer never imagines the brute would refuse to let her leave his remote Welsh castle until she has proven her identity. Or that she would be powerfully attracted to the passionately virile man whose gruff demeanor belies a proud and sensual nature. Greer falls under his spell, determined to unravel the secrets of her Welsh heritage and the mystery surrounding the dark prince who dares her to become his wife and princess.
