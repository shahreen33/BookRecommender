The Barnes Noble Review: The tres bon and marvy heroine of Louise Rennison's Confessions of Georgia Nicolson series returns in this fifth fab diary that's sure to get fans cheering -- Italian-American style! This time around, Georgia's lamenting the Sex God's departure to Kiwi A-go-go Land, and she's sure that her mouth will seal shut from lack of snogging. (Robbie's boring letter doesn't help her spirits, either.) But when Robbie's old band, the Stiff Dylans, introduce a new lead singer -- an utterly gorgey boy named Masimo -- Georgia's lips are ready for action. Will Georgia get an up-close-and-personal taste of the dear boy? After a few hilarious mishaps, her lip-nibbling future with Masimo doesn't look bright, yet due to some masterful Horn advice from Dave the Laugh and a lucky twist of fate, Georgia might end up dreaming of spaghetti and hamburgers after all. Although the Sex God is out of the picture, Rennison fans won't be disappointed with this installment that includes a new, drool-worthy stud and a totally surprising cliff-hanger. Like many of us girls, Georgia still hasn't figured out boys, but with her knee-slapping adventures helping us out, we're thankfully snickering the whole time.IShana Taylor/I
