Team: A.L.P.H.A.:Six battle-hardened alphas with one goal—to save any omega in peril   Cody Evans has spent the past six years hidden from the world. Held by a shifter trafficking ring, he’s been forced to serve any man who paid the right price for a submissive omega. Now, the unthinkable has happened: Cody is pregnant. Desperate to save the life inside him but with only a hint of possible help, he sneaks a phone and places a call to the help number he’d held in his head in case he ever got near a phone.  From the moment Levi Thurman scented the pregnant, emotionally broken omega, he had no doubt: Cody was his mate. He knows the young man will need time to uncover the dark secrets of his past so that he can heal, but they’re both shocked when Levi’s secret is revealed first: his soft, lacy, satin covered secret.  What surprises them even more is Cody’s need to be in charge… and Levi’s pleasure in obeying his commands.  But even as Cody unveils Levi’s softer side and Levi strengthens Cody’s belief in himself, the evil of Cody’s past haunts him—and when it comes to protecting his omega, Levi is all alpha, and there’s no way the men who hurt them can escape his justice.  This is the second book in this exciting series, but can definitely be read as a stand-alone novel. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and occasional violence. Be prepared for sexy manties and an omega with a need for control. HEA definitely included, intended for 18+ readers only. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown?  Trigger warnings: graphic violence, attempted rape, mention of past sexual trauma   Listening Length: 5 hours and 13 minutes.
