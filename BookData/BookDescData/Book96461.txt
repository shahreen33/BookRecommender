Painter, Brooke Belle, is running from her past and hoping that a few weeks in a quaint country cabin will bring her artistic muse back from the brink. But when she lands smack dab in the middle of Asheland Mobile Park, she’s sure there’s been a mistake. Not only has her mentor rented her a dilapidated mobile home in the middle of nowhere, but the trailer park is filled with big, burly, growly, flirty, sexy-as-hell lumberjacks. And one in particular is making her think that maybe she’s landed right where she needs to be.  Tagan James has a lot on his shoulders. As second in a woodcutting crew of bear shifters, he’s got all he can handle keeping his people from tearing each other apart on the job site. But when the beautiful, and terribly human, Brooke Belle lands on his doorstep, all honest and vulnerable and pulling at his animal’s protective instincts, he has to decide whether to boot her out of his park to protect his heart, or take a risk and save her muse.  Every bear shifter knows finding a mate can destroy a dominant like him. But as Brooke shows Tagan just how strong she can be, he’s second guessing everything—including his vow to never fall for a woman.  Content Warning: explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. Adult only bear shifter romance.
