I'm the hopeless romantic in the family and I don't care who knows. My brothers make fun of me for it, calling me "Princess" and "Cinderella" every chance they get, but I couldn't care less. I'm done with one night stands and women who mean nothing to me. My dating for the sake of dating days are over. I know what I want and I refuse to settle for less. I'm ready to find "the one." You know exactly what I'm talking about. Single mom Sofia can't stand me. I want to get to know her better, but she keeps pushing me away. I just need one chance to show her that I'm not the guy she thinks I am, but she won't let me get anywhere near her.Being a single mom has made her heart guarded. Being a single guy has made my heart determined.I wonder who's heart is going to give in first?The Fisher Brothers is a series of standalone novels that can be sipped one at a time, or binged in order. Each book is aptly named after one of the popular drinks at their bar. Enjoy!No Bad Days- Nick's storyGuy Hater- Frank's storyAdios Pantalones- Ryan's story
