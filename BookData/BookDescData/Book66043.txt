"There are five Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John?and the Christian. But most people never read the first four." There are any number of books on how to do evangelism. This book is different--it's an invitation to actually live out the message of the gospel. Jesus's original intention was for ordinary people like you and me to live lives that point others to the only Person who can give them hope for this life as well as the next--to visibly display the Good News of salvation through the Messiah and Redeemer of humankind.But many Christ followers today are either ridden with guilt for not telling others about Jesus or so silent that no one really knows they're a Christian. The Fifth Gospel will help you wrestle with the critical issues involved in living out your faith in front of a watching and sometimes not-so-friendly world.Isn't it time to become a witness for the One you profess to love? Prepare yourself to represent your Savior well and to discover a new way to do evangelism. Get ready for God to unleash the gospel through you!
