The School Library Journal compares Secret Speakers to the Narnia, Lord of the Rings, and Wizard of Oz novels in their starred review: "“Kingworth has created a rich, detailed fantasy world that is unique and as vivid as all of them, with charming, whimsical touches.” Hidden in the depths of Cloven Grave, the harsh imposter Harrold King hides a deep secret the parents know nothing about. After spending nine years hidden in a cellar, thirteen year-old Fair O'Nelli finally assumes it's safe to be seen. She knows that her father and brother are missing or possibly dead. But when she sets off in the company of three guardians to find Selador's Gate, she heads right into Harrold King's secret. If she and countless others are to survive, she will have to start making choices that place friendship above fright, faith over doubt, and compassion over fear. The audio book adaptation is brought to life by Booklist's Voice of Choice, Simon Vance. (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, The Girl Who Played with Fire.) British-born Vance was awarded Audiofile Magazine Golden Voice status, June 2009.
