When the lull of night falls over a sleeping midwestern town, an ancient, unimaginable horror creeps violently and purposely through the night. That's when the children come out to play. Children with eyes of solid back, devoid of emotion and remorse, and only asking for one thing... to come inside. But there are some who will not go quietly in the night. Some who will fight back to save not only their own souls, but those of their children, as well. This is their story.Collecting the blood-chilling first five issues of the hit AfterShock series BLACK-EYED KIDS, from author Joe Pruett (X-Men Unlimited, Cable) and artist Szymon Kudranski (Spawn, Daredevil/Punisher).
