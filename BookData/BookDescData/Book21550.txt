Does Italy, in particular, seem to be calling you?Deeply Rooted is a sensitive weaving of a family chronicle with the story of an unanticipated life transition. It begins with the author preparing to leave Egypt, where she and her husband had lived until his career came abruptly to an end as a result of a corporate merger. Without a job or a home in the United States, the couple had a weighty decision to make and not much time in which to make it. Giving in to a life-long yearning, they chose to make Italy their home. Leaving everything they owned crated and stored in a warehouse in Cairo, they packed two suitcases and left on their adventure.In Deeply Rooted, the author shares this search for a home and for her inner self. Her story is a day-to-day account of what this was like - the fear, the excitement, the doubts, the discoveries, the frustrations, the magic, the letting-go. At the same time, she reflects on one hundred years of her Italian family history and how her ancestors’ models of love, faith and strength enriched and influenced her own life and her decision to make Italy her home. Ginda’s is a story about planting a dream, believing it will take root, remembering family and honoring an ancestral home.Deeply Rooted whispers to the soul.
