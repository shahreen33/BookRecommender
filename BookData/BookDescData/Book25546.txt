The Hawaiian Way to Put Things Back into Balance! A uniquely Hawaiian concept, ho'o (to do or make) plus pono (righteous, balanced, forgiven, alligned, proper) was once how every Hawaiian strived to live. It reflects our true spiritual essence, living in harmony with the community and 'ohana (family), and guided and protected by our kupuna (elders) and 'aumakua (ancestors; guardian angels). Lee's newest book shares stories sure to give you chills, as you learn about the wisdom and mana (power) of pre-contact Hawai'i.
