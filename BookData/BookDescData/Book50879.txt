The brutally honest, surprisingly hilarious story of one woman's journey from one extreme of the weight spectrum to the other, and of the unexpected emotional chaos it created.Jen Larsen always thought that if she could only lose some weight, she would be unstoppable. So when diet after diet failed, she decided to try bariatric sugery. It worked better than she ever dreamed--she lost 180 pounds! As the weight fell away, though, Larsen realized that getting skinny was not the cure she thought it would be--and that suddenly she wasn't sure who she was anymore.Insightful and unsparing in her self-examination, Larsen depicts the devastating lows and exhilarating highs she experienced as a result of her weight loss--the crushing pain and confusion of feeling like a stranger in her own body after losing the weight that has always defined her, and the incredible joy of finally beginning to look like the image of herself she's always carried inside her head.
