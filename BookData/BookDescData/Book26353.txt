GAVINThe most important thing in my life has always been baseball. The sport has always been a constant for me, the one thing I focused on above everything else.And then I met her.I never dreamed I'd find someone who supported my love of the game. I didn't expect to fall for her like I did. Especially, since she was off limits.But sometimes life comes at you like a hard line drive, daring you to catch it. In the end, I have no doubt I'll be the one catching Mallory.
