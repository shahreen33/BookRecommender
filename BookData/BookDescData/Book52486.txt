If you've ever felt lost in the sea of contradictory training and diet advice out there and you want to know the truth behind 12 of the most common, and most harmful health &amp; fitness myths out there...then you want to read this book.Let me ask you a few questions.* Do you believe that your genetics are preventing you from making great gains in the gym?* Do you do certain exercises because they're supposed to "shape" your muscles? * Do you stretch before lifting weights to prevent injury or increase strength? * When doing cardio, do you shoot for a "target" heart rate zone to burn the most fat possible? If you answered "yes" to any of those questions, you're in good company as most people do the same. But here's the kicker: There's NO science behind any of it. Quite to the contrary, however, science actually disproves these things.Thanks to the overwhelming amount of fitness pseudo-science and lies being pushed on us every day by bogus magazines and self-styled "gurus," it's becoming harder and harder to know how to get in shape. Well, this book was written to debunk some of the most common and harmful myths in the health and fitness industry, and teach you what you really have to do to get lean, strong, and healthy.
