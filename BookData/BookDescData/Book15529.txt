Jess Mastriani has never been what you'd call a typical Midwestern teenagerâ€”her extracurricular activities, instead of cheerleading or 4-H, include fist-fights with the football team and month-long stints in detention. A part of Jess would like to be the prom queen her mother has always envisioned her being, but another part is secretly counting the days until she's saved up enough money to buy her own Harley.Then something happens that guarantees Jess will be one of the in-crowd...at least until her newfound talent ends up getting her dead.
