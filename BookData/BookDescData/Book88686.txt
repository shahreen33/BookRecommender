In "Hand-me-Down Bride," Sophie found her knight in shining armor, the miller’s son, Karl. He’s arranged to have her sisters come from Germany to seek their own happily ever-afters in 1870’s Pennsylvania. Little sister Elfie is cut from another bolt than her serious, tender-hearted older sister. Elfie is something of a material girl, and her Aunt, who’d arranged Sophie’s first marriage—to a rich old man—is ready to encourage her striking niece in her search for a life of comfort. Elfie doesn’t want to work the way her farm wife sister does, and her looks straightaway carry her into friendships with the local belles. With three very different men vying for her hand, everyone in valley is wondering who will catch this lovely butterfly.
