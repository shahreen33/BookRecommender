There’s nothing I love more than scoring.  I know what you’re probably thinking, but I’m talking about goals, not men. My entire life revolves around three things: soccer, and my two best friends, Ryan and Grant.  I’ve loved them since they were rowdy boys tearing up the town. Growing up, we shared everything from popsicles and toys to hopes, dreams, and the occasional jail cell. Now that we’re older, they’ve been known to share women.  But they haven’t shared me.  Never me.  Until now.  College is over. So is soccer. And I only have one goal in mind…scoring double.  WARNING: This friends to lovers quickie is deliciously sweet and over the top. There’s a soccer ball on the cover, but this story is less soccer and more balls if you know what I mean *wink wink* One-click this bad boy and grab a fan because things are about to heat up.
