Anda Weiss knows that going on a reality show to find love is, well, desperate. But after years of putting her love life second to her career, that’s how low she’s willing to stoop. Miraculously, the hot guy starring in Man Of Her Dreams is nice. Surprisingly normal. Altogether terrific. And Chance DiMarco kisses so well she forgets cameras are taping every second. Until she spends a red hot night with him, only to have all of America watch him kick her off the show.Seven months later, Anda decides that a mind-blowing one-night stand is the only way to move past her humiliation. But the man she hits on at a Vegas resort is far from a stranger. Anda seizes her chance to get payback on Chance. At least, that’s her plan... But does she have it in her to use Chance for a few more nights of great sex and then turn the tables and dump him? Is that revenge worth undoing all her healing? Will Anda leave with the satisfaction of another steamy hook-up with Chance? Or could her epic humiliation actually end up bringing her to the man of her dreams?
