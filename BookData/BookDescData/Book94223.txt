Dew Angels is Melanie Schwapp's first novel. It follows the story of Nola Chambers, a Jamaican girl who lives in the fictional village of Redding. Nola suffers from the affliction of being born with black skin within a family and community that prides itself on successfully 'washing out the black.' Nola stumbles through her life until, eventually, she lands on a path of self-discovery. The book introduces many dynamic Jamaican characters and explores elements of Jamaican culture and lifestyles; the contrast between the deeply rural experiences of Redding and the bustling life in Kingston city.
