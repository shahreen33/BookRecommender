After months of squatting in the Literature Club's clubroom, the SOS Brigade puts pen to paper and starts writing some literature of their own! The Brigade has just one week to create a literature newsletter if they want to keep the Lit Club's space from being reallocated by the student council. As each member prepares his or her contribution, Supreme Editor in Chief Haruhi keeps a watchful eye on her team, especially as Kyon's assigned romance story unfolds!
