The growing barbarian tribe is about to celebrate No-Poison Day – a time of love, laughter, and gifts. But all Elly wants is for her mate to be at her side before the brutal season arrives. All Bek wants is a way to quickly return to his female despite the mountains between them. Thanks to the talents of a newcomer… they're both about to get their wish and celebrate the happiest of holidays together.  This novella features characters from prior Ice Planet Barbarians stories and DOES NOT stand alone.
