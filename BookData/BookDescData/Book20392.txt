Joy Adamson, world-famous for her books about Elsa the lioness, has a new and enthralling story to tell. Its heroine is Pippa, an elegant, affectionate but enigmatic cheetah - the spotted sphinx."Mrs. Adamson is confirmed as one of the most remarkable women of her times... I believe The Spotted Sphinx to be her best book." - Derek Tangye, Sunday Telegraph"She has done it again! There is so much vital warmth in her narrative... Its pictorial record is superb." - Times Literary Supplement
