In a world where there’s only one woman for every twelve men, a lottery is the chance for five lucky men to win the prize of a lifetime… her hand in marriage.Nix never put his name in the marriage raffle for a reason. He doesn’t need a woman. There aren’t that many to go around anyway, not after a genetically engineered virus wiped out 90% of the female population. He has his job as head of the Security Squadron and it’s all he needs. He looks out for the township. He protects the few women who are left.But when his name is called to be one of the five husbands to the woman rescued from the badlands, he doesn’t speak up to correct the error.Because Audrey’s like no one he’s ever met before. Fiesty. That’s the name for her. She might be just the woman to handle a rough, brutal man like him.Sharing her with four other men is a small price to pay. In fact, the closer they all grow, the more Nix realizes he might finally have again what he lost so long ago—a real family.But when Audrey’s life is endangered, will Nix be able to save the woman he’s just learned how to love?
