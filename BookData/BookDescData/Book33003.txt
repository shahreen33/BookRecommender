I have to be the best. I am the best. I'm quick. I'm strong. I'm smart. I'm the star keeper of my high school soccer team, and I've got major leagues scouting me. As their captain, my teammates will do anything I say - on or off the field. Girls practically beg to be added to my list of conquests. As long as I manage to go pro for the best team in the world, I won't have to worry about my father's wrath. I'm Thomas Malone, and I've seen to it that the world revolves around me. There's a new girl at school, and it's just a matter of time before she gives in to my charm. This one's just a little more stubborn than most - she won't even tell me her name! She's smart, too. Maybe too smart. I can't let her in. I can't let anybody in. I'm not too worried, but even I have to admit she's interfering with my focus on the goal. Dad's not going to be happy about that. Did I mention I love Shakespeare? Yeah, I know. I'm a walking contradiction. According to the Bard - "some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them." Somehow, I got all three. Now how is anyone supposed to live up to that?
