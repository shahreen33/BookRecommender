A sharp curve, blinding headlights, metal on metal, his sons’ screams.

Instead, he returns to the day he has just lived and finds he is not alone in this strange new world.

The escape will lead some to greater life, others to endless death . . . and Bobby Barnes to understand the deepest nature of love.
