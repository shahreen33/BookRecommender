As the cataclysmic events unfold at Ravenswood, Beowulf is left fighting his own very personal war against the forces of Hel. Finally cured with the help of the wizard Asgrim, Beowulf and the men of his comitatus gather their forces and travel to Heorot to finally confront the monster, Grendel. In a journey which sweeps across the north, from the depths of the great Swedish forests and the marshes of Frisland to the gentle hills surrounding Sutton Hoo, Beowulf finally discovers that killing Grendel was not his sternest test after all. Woden has one more, even more powerful fiend to confront as the Gods vie for ascendancy over middle earth. Sword of Woden, Monsters, is the conclusion of a trilogy of novels which seek to tell the early life story of Beowulf and his clan, the Swertings.
