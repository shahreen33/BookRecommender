In 2002, Oskar Blues Brewery founder and owner Dale Katechis made a decision that would have a resounding impact on craft beer manufacturing for years to come. By putting his Dale's Pale Ale, a bold and flavorful brew, in a can, he dared venture where only the big corporate brands had gone before. A decade later the canning movement is in full swing, with hundreds of craft breweries now canning their beers. This volume provides a close look at the original artwork on 600 different modern beer cans from 40 states. Get to know the story behind your favorite beer's name and can design, with examples from breweries such as Sierra Nevada, Ska, Midnight Sun, Maui, New Belgium, Oskar Blues, and nearly 200 others. The craft breweries featured in this book turned canning beer into an art form!
