Haunted by the visions he inherited from his Jardi mother and isolated on his brooding grandfather's estate, Xavier thinks he'll go mad. When he finally escapes this dreary existence to attend university, he's bullied by his classmates because he's Jardi, one of the shunned Wagon People. But when one of his teachers, a master alchemist, takes him on as an apprentice, he begins to feel things are looking up. That is, until a mysterious seer appears to deliver the dark prophesy that a powerful sorcerer wants to enslave him because of his gift. Conflicted about his Jardi gift, the vision to see inside things and transform them, Xavier must embrace his heritage if he hopes to survive. His only allies in the battle against the sorcerer are a sentient falcon, who is both guardian and nag, and an enigmatic young knight with a lot of attitude and a dangerous secret. When the trio arrives at the sorcerer's castle, Xavier is bewitched by the beauty and power the sorcerer wields in his magical garden. Lost in illusion, will he choose the seductive, starlight voices that beckon him to darkness or the love of his friends?
