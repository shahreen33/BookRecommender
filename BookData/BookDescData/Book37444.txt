From NYT Bestseller Corinne Michaels &amp; USA Today Bestseller Melanie Harlow, comes a sexy friends to lovers standalone romance.Rule number one for a professional matchmaker?Don’t fall in love with your client.I screwed that up when I fell for my best friend, Reid Fortino. He’s gorgeous, successful, and sexy as hell. I figured it would be easy to find him a match—and save the family business at the same time. But the more time I spend attempting to find the perfect girl, the more I realize how much I want him for my own. What’s the harm if we give in for just one night? I should have known that would never be enough. Now I’m on the verge of losing my job and my heart. We were an imperfect match from the start, but I don’t know how to let him go.
