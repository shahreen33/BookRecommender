“Sometimes love happens when you least expect it.” That was what my husband’s mistress told me the day I found out about their affair.  I didn’t believe it until five minutes later when mouth-watering celebrity chef Tanner Reese walked up, tossed his arm around my shoulders, and told my cheating husband to take a hike.  Tanner and I couldn’t have been more different. He spent his weekends at clubs, rubbing elbows with fellow A-listers. I spent mine in yoga pants with cheese boards and a glass of wine—or six. Our relationship shouldn’t have worked, but it did. That is until Tanner proved to me that even though love happens when you least expect it...  So does heartbreak.
