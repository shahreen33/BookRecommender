It’s the early hours of the morning and Rose Denton wakes up behind the steering wheel of her car. She’s off the road, through a hedge and in a field. There’s blood on the windscreen and bonnet – but it’s not hers and there’s no sign of anything or anyone she might have hit. The last thing she remembers is being in a hotel on a business trip but now she’s miles away.Back home and her daughter’s boyfriend is missing. The last thing he did was argue with Rose over money.

And, perhaps more importantly, does she really want to know the answer?
