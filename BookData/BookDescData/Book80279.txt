Welcome to Darkblood—oops, I mean Darkhen Academy. There are three rules to survive the elite supernatural school:1.	Do not talk or even look at The Seven, the uber-powerful supes that rule the academy.2.	Never go into the Fae forest on a full moon… or else.3.	And most definitely do not fall for one of the extremely hot and unattainable instructors.Too bad I’ve never really been a rule follower…A year ago the supernaturals came out of the closet on primetime TV, and about a minute ago I found out I was one of them—well, a half-blood anyway. So here I am at Darkhen Academy, the only human and no magical abilities to speak of. The only reason I’m here is because of my father—a man I didn’t even know existed until now. He’s crazy powerful, and they think I could be too. But what could I possibly contribute to an exclusive squad of dragon shifters, fae, witches, and vampires? I guess we’re about to find out because the merging of the supernatural and human realms isn’t going as smoothly as planned. If word gets out that humans are no longer safe from the supes, our worlds will once again be closed off. It’s up to us to stop that from happening.The "Darkblood Academy" books are a spinoff of the "Hitched" series by G.K. DeRosa. The storyline is set after the events in "Hitched". It references some of it's storyline and shares some characters that were introduced there. Therefore it is advisable to read the "Hitched" books first.
