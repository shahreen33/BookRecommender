In Meditations on Quixote, Jose Ortega y Gasset presents a powerful case for integrating literature into experience. Through a series of "essays in intellectual love," Ortega explores the aim of philosophy: to carry a given fact (a person, a book, a landscape, an error, a sorrow) by the shortest route to its fullest significance. He then considers how literature, specifically Cervantes, contributes to realizing this aim.
