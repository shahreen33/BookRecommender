Three men, a tomboy-and one erotic game that could change everything.
 Simon, Eric, Rafael, Lee-and Charli. It-s never mattered that Charli is the only girl in the crowd. She's always been a tomboy, anyway. Just one of the guys. Between work and Couch Potato Thursdays, life is pretty full. Sure, no man alive can get through the friend gauntlet, but thanks to her boys and her toys, she's got plenty of fantasy material. It's a win-win situation. Until Lee has a destination wedding in Cozumel-and Charli's -best man- duties take a kinky turn. Through what looks to be foul play by Lee's new brides, Charli finds herself on a decidedly decadent shore excursion, playing -The Race Erotic-. With each sexy challenge, it becomes clearer that down deep, she desires not one, not two, but all three of her remaining single buddies.  They're the only family she's ever known. She can't imagine living without them. Will she have to choose? Or will the final score be three to one? Warning: Naughty costumes, kinky toys, a boy, a girl-two more boys, all doing unspeakably dirty things to each other.
