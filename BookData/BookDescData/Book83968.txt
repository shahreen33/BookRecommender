Dinosaurs are the gimmick here, not really the subject. The subjects are, first, antonyms--such as above/below and weak/strong--and then lunch. The paired dinosaurs, in a goofy array of pastels, are almost all smiling, even when the rhyme insists they're "grumpy"--so when they settle down to a lunch with (and not of) each other, the end is satisfying. The pictures and swingy short verses will make this a good group read-aloud, even for the very young. -BooklistThese prehistoric monsters are just perfect for the preschool crowds. A natural for story time. -School Library Journal
