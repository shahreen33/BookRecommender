Millie Watson doesn’t often take initiative when it comes to work but when an old friend – or, rather, acquaintance she can’t stand – wants to hire her to solve a potential haunting at her upscale home, Millie jumps at the chance. In truth, Millie doesn’t care about finding a ghost. She does have a specific form of payment in mind, though, and it’s something she’s itching to collect on. Since Millie can’t actually see ghosts, she calls in the only person she knows who can … Charlie Rhodes. Unfortunately for Millie, Charlie is a bit distracted with relationship issues of her own. Still, the gregarious psychic volunteers to pitch in. Before she found freedom, Millie was in a high-class world full of snooty and entitled people. That’s full on display now when she tries to track down the source of the ghostly disturbances … and comes up with a litany of human transgressions instead. Millie is determined to find answers, although not because she wants to help a friend. She wants payment, and she’s not going to stop until she gets it. She just needs to avoid trouble – which is easier said than done – while she’s searching for answers.  Note: This is a 30,000-word short set in the Charlie Rhodes Universe. It is set between The Undead Uproar and The Incubus Impasse.
