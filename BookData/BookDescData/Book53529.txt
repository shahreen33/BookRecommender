In an unknown time and place, there's a war going on in space and mankind has developed a system of fighting that includes two sides of a team. One person is the fighter who pilots the spacecraft and his partner is the navigator who directs the way.Navigators come from higher society and are mostly seen as privileged and intelligent. Fighters are men that are known for their violent tendancies, skills in combat, and anger issues.Abel didn't want to follow his politican father into his world and instead chose his own path as a navigator. He's gay and has always had strong desires that he's hidden... until he's partnered with his fighter, Cain.Cain is unpredictable, violent, possessive, and very skilled at what he does. He goes through navigators faster then any other fighter so he's developed the reputation that he's impossible to work with.When Cain meets Abel, he marks him and possessives him in every way possible unknowingly giving Abel exactly what he's been craving for years. Now the only question is, will their relationship grow to benefit them both in this time of war or with Cain's reputation and violent tendancies end up destroying Abel?
