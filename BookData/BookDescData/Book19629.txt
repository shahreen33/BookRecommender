There is a hollow space too vast for words through which we pass with each loss, out of whose darkness we are sanctioned into being." That one quote astutely describes not only my life, but the poetry in Anatomy of a Poet.One of six children, I grew up in a small Ohio town and married my high school sweetheart at nineteen. A Vietnam War widow at twenty, I went on to marry and then divorce two times. I made a lot of choices, some good, some not so good, but as one of the poems in the book ends, "...at least I made choices. How sad for those who merely hitchhike along, never daring to choose at all." [from the poem, "Choices"]Anatomy of a Poet was written over a period of forty years. The poetry is rich with memoir, humor, and at times is sensual in nature. [Author Note: Poetry can be daunting and hard to understand, but it doesn't have to be. I feel a poet has an obligation to write in a way that everyone can understand. A poem should flow easily through a poet's words, its meaning touching both the heart, and mind, of its reader. If a poem comes from the heart ... it will touch other hearts.
