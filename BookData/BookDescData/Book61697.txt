Not so much.Because really, chains? Could he try for a more original haunting technique? Or just give it up already?And okay, maybe she insults Old Salt when the tourists aren’t around.She never thought he was listening. Or that he had a few of his own thoughts about her attitude.And she never in a million years imagined he was soooooo hot!!***A previous version of this appeared in The Mammoth Book of Ghost Romance
