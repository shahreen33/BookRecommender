A sexy biker. A hot midnight encounter. One ride together that changes everything. Jax Reid is everything I should be afraid of--and everything I crave. My skin tingled from the first moment I saw him. Temptingly handsome, dangerous, and with a darkness behind his eyes. He was scarred. So was I. His past is complicated. Dark. So is mine. When my family stopped believing in me, he never stopped for one second. He’s stolen my heart. I’m feeling things I never thought I’d feel with a man like him. Vulnerable pleasure. Hope. And contentment. The only question left is, will this be forever? Or just an adventure. Either way, Jax is going to take me for one hell of a ride. And our adventure has a twist I wouldn’t have seen coming in a million years.  Biker with Benefits is a steamy standalone contemporary romance with a surprise ending! It is the fifth book in Mickey's Blackwell series, and can be read as a standalone apart from the other books which are in the same world.
