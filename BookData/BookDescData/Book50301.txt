“You don’t belong.”No words whispered in anger have ever rung more true.They’re the Kings of Brayshaw with the world at their feet, destined for greatness and in need of control. I’m the girl from the ghetto with nothing to offer and as defiant as they come. They say it doesn’t matter, that I’m one of them now, and nothing could ever change that. Not even me, should I dare try.But they’re wrong.They underestimate how far I’ll go to protect them.Trouble is coming...and they have no idea.-----Trouble At Brayshaw High is the the highly anticipated follow up to Boys of Brayshaw High, and should be read only after having read book one.
