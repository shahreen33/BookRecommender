In the future Professor George Bradley, computer staff in hand, “envisions” an archaeological site, which could turn history on its head. Then he falls through a ripple in reality.He enters a world where: trolls think they are human; elves believe humans can’t do magic since they don’t have souls; a child of prophecy is dying of a curse; a shape-changer is bent on killing him; a seeress keeps too many secrets; and an ogre and a boy struggle to defend a keep against the evil ruling it.This is a world where a starship crash landed, bringing about a war, which led to the laws of magic defeating those of science. Here a demon rages, intent on destroying all life, its minions intent on killing the human mage from another world.If that wasn’t bad enough, George’s computer is now rather sarcastic.
