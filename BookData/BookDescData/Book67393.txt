My father is a serial killer. No big deal. I promise. Me? Upset? No. Never. In fact, it would be really easy to pretend that the man never existed in the first place… if it wasn’t for the bodies. What bodies? Only about 200 of them. Like I said. No big deal. What is even worse? He has had a dual purpose for killing them and it isn’t just because he’s a sadistic monster. No. It is far worse than that. And if all of this wasn’t enough to deal with… I had eight men in my life. Yes. Eight. So how am I supposed to handle this? Who knows? Most likely it will end in blood and chaos. Wish me luck!   Join Nova on her 9 book series adventure! Book 1 contains a very small cliff hanger that simply pushes the plot along.
