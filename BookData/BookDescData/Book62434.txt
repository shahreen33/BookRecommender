Mother Teresa of Calcutta was the founder of the Missionaries ofCharity and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, but her story is so much moreremarkable. From her childhood in the Balkans to her work in India, from attendingthe victims of war-torn Beirut to pleading with George Bush and Saddam Husseinto choose peace over war, Mother Teresa was driven by a mighty faith.Newly revised and updated, this edition includes a personal insight into thebeatification and continuing process of canonization for Mother Teresa, theongoing work of the Missionaries of Charity, and her “dark night of the soul.”Mother Teresa consistently claimed that she was simply responding to Christ’sboundless love for her and for all of humanity, bringing to the world a great lessonin joyful and selfless love. This book is a glimpse into her extraordinary faith,work, and life.
