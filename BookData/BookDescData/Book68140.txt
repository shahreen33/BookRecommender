Mae Dafoe is back in her hometown chasing ghosts. She’s forgotten what it’s like to be around her big crazy family, and it’s a big adjustment coming from the life she’s created for herself in the years she’s been gone. Three days here, and then she can go back to her apartment in the city, and far away from the swamps of Uncertain. All she needs is closure. But when she finds one of the ghosts she’s been chasing, she’s shocked to find he isn’t a ghost at all, but a shifter. The old Cole that she knew doesn’t exist anymore, but as she gets to know this sexy, dangerous, growly New Cole…she starts thinking about the life she left behind. Pulled between two very different worlds, she has to decide on a damaging past and an uncertain future…and somehow survive them both.  Cole Jennings goes by the name Fargo now. Might as well, since he’s a dog most of the time. He’s hidden what happened to him from the entire town, but a girl he used to know is back in his territory, scratching at his secrets. He has one job to do, and that’s to keep the Lachlan gators and their mates protected, but Mae DaFoe is pulling at his instincts to let the animal inside of him go, and to be a better man. She’ll have to wait for him to finish his hunt though, because he has a grudge that won’t ever go away. If he can just keep her away from him for a little while longer, maybe he can keep her safe, too.  Shifters, witches, and ghosts, aw yeah! Don’t miss this exciting final installment in T. S. Joyce’s bestselling Keepers of the Swamp trilogy.   **Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. Intended for mature audiences.
