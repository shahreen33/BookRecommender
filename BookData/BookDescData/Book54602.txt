This original 2019Â work, based on the author's many years of teaching at Harvard University, examines mathematical methods of value and importance to advanced undergraduates and graduate students studying quantum mechanics. Its intended audience is students of mathematics at the senor university level and beginning graduate students in mathematics and physics. Early chapters address such topics as the Fourier transform, the spectral theorem for bounded self-joint operators, and unbounded operators and semigroups. Subsequent topics include a discussion of Weyl's theorem on the essential spectrum and some of its applications, the Rayleigh-Ritz method, one-dimensional quantum mechanics, Ruelle's theorem, scattering theory, Huygens' principle, and many other subjects.
