NO LONGER IN PRINT.The wheel of the year turns, bringing the joy of spring, the warmth of summer, the richness of autumn, and the merriment of winter. But eight Celtic festivals link these seasons together, bringing with them romance, lust, danger, and even magic. From a city under threat from night-time creatures at Ostara, to a selkie caught by the light of the Lughnasadh moon, to a writer caught in the flames of a fiery goddess at Imbolc.Eight authors have come together to give their own twist on these festivals, weaving each story with a blend of myth, magic, and contemporary tellingâ€¦to create A Celtic Tapestry.
