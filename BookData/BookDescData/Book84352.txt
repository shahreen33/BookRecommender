The London rake known as Lord Windmere, Matthew Edmund Fremont, is on the prowl for a wife. He has always liked the younger sister of his best childhood friend, Robbie Thornton, but will he ever consider Lady Jane? After all, she is too young and innocent for someone like him.  But Lady Jane Anne Thornton has always had a tendre for her older brother's friend, Matt. Their relationship, at a house party, seems to be going well until an enemy—who wants Lord Windmere solely for his wealth—interferes, and the consequences could be deadly.
