The war in Hagwood has begun. The ruthless Faerie Queen of Hallow Hill fights not only for her own immortality and her iron rule over Hagwood, but to serve her more far-reaching ambition: to conquer every corner of the known world. While the enchanted casket that holds the Queen’s mortal heart has been found, the golden key that can unlock it has been lost. If the Queen gains possession of the golden key, none will be able to oppose her.   The Queen’s dark armies rise up in battle against her long-exiled sister, joined together with the diminutive werlings against the forces of evil. Vastly outnumbered, they fight in hope of a miracle. Gamaliel, always the reluctant hero, is chosen for a special destiny, but at a cost. As lives are lost and a bloody battle rages, the question remains: Who will survive the war in Hagwood?
