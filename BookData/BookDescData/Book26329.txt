Break.That’s what my heart did when she stopped breathing.Effa—the girl who illuminated my world so vibrantly.And now with a long road in front of me, the path seems unclear.I never thought touring with a rock band could lead to this—me falling for the lead singer just for it all to end. All the while back home, life is precarious with my sister’s treatments making everything on edge. Times are tense, revenge is best served cold – Effa makes it hard to breathe, but am I enough for her to take another breath?
