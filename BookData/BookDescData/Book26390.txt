At 8:28 I was the girl who had everything. At 8:29 my whole world fell apart.A split second can change your life. I learned this the hard way. I wasn't ready to let him go. Even when the terms "vegetative state" and "will never recover" were thrown around I held onto hope. I mean, miracles happen, right? We deserved our happy ending.Three years later and I'm still hoping. In my heart I know I have to let him go but how can I? He's the only man I've ever loved. He"s my soul mate. My life. Then I meet Max. He's everything Aiden isn't and as much as I'm trying to fight my feelings, I'm losing. I don't want to fight anymore. I need to live my life. I need to move on.But in order to move forward I need to let go of the past.
