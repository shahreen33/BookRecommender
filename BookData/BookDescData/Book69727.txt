Hi I’m Gabriella Alexis Sandoval. Readers first met me in the short story, "Rendezvous". "Rendezvous" told of a mere moment in my life. "Revolving Doors", however, is my coming-of-age story and delves further into my life, and reveals how sometimes a broken heart can be a delicately packaged new beginning.When I was 18 years old, my heart was shattered by my college-bound boyfriend, causing me to escape to the comfort of a well-known exotic land…to the familiarity of my best friend’s abode…and ultimately, to the welcoming beds of unknown men.Through this experience, I gained a mentor, and quickly fixated on a world where I am boss, where the rules are my own, and where glass ceilings cease to exist.Hardly the broken girl I once was…I returned home, a young woman on a mission…a mission to own my sexuality, take control of my destiny, and create the blueprint to my erotic fortune.As I unwrap my beautifully wrapped future, and remove the lid from my once ordinary life, I become a Lioness who is unstoppable. And with my stealth-like swagger…and undeniable prowess…winning, has become my only option.
