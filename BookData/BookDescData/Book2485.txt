What if you not only fell back through time...but fell in love, too?Gabi knows she's left her heart in the fourteenth century, and she persuades Lia to help her to return, even though they know doing so will risk their very lives. When they arrive, months have passed, and all of Siena longs to celebrate the heroines who turned the tide in the battle against Florence--while their enemies will go to great lengths to see them dead.Even in the midst of the battles, Gabi is increasingly drawn to Marcello, just as Lia's is to Luca. In medieval Italy, the sisters must discover things inside themselves that they couldn't seem to find in the present--connection with their mom, courage within, and the understanding that a life well lived often means encountering sacrifice. But in a world long past, many things still keep Gabi from giving Marcello her heart forever...and one thing in particular calls all three of the Betarrinis home.
