When ace private detective Justinia Wright is on the case, there’s no such thing as the perfect crime.  The problem is Miss Wright would rather play the piano or forge a perfect masterpiece. Only when goaded by her brother and assistant, Harry, will she take a case. And then it’s murderers beware!  The Justinia Wright Private Investigator Mysteries Omnibus Edition collects in one volume the first five books in this series. Miss Wright’s been described as a “P.I. with panache” and “a very modern Nero [Wolfe]!”  If you like traditional mysteries, such as Nero Wolfe and Hercule Poirot, that are filled with wit, wise-cracking humor, and thrills and spills along the way, then look no further.  Get this omnibus edition because the game is definitely afoot!
