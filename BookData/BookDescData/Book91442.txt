Just in case coming to terms with her new witch powers wasn't enough of a challenge, Tina quickly finds herself embroiled in the middle of a muder mystery, with half the town thinking [i]she's[/i] the one who killed a local wizard.  With the help of her new roommates and her martial-arts obsessed familiar, Tina has to solve the mystery, learn basic magic and navigate the complicated social hierarchy in Western Woods. Sounds easy, right? And who's that strange, smoking-hot elf everyone keeps warning her to stay away from? Tina's definitely got her work cut out for her, but as she gets closer to the truth, it becomes obvious she's in danger.  Will Tina solve the mystery before she becomes the killer's next victim?
