Brianna Wyatt may be a victim of her father's machinations, but one look is all it takes for Cole Masters and Tyler Cannon to offer her their own style of menage a trois blackmail. Brianna Wyatt's father is blackmailing her into doing what he wants by threatening to send her brother to an institution. She would do anything to keep that from happening, including go along with his demented scheme of her getting pregnant by Cole Masters--a man who's been rumored to share a woman with his best friend, and who leaves Brianna's innocent senses in shambles. Cole is sure he's about to be blackmailed-why else would a man whore his daughter? But there's something about her that neither Cole nor his best friend, Tyler Cannon, can deny. They want her, and don't hesitate for a second on making their own offer. Her brother's protection for her body. When danger flirts with Brianna's life, there is nothing they won't do to keep her safe. Including listening to what their hearts are saying. Warning: this title contains graphic language, hot, explicit sex, bondage, domination/submission and menage a trois and is not for the faint of heart!"
