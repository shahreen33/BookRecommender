Kyle Fenton's nickname around his fraternity house may as well be "Shameless Flirt." Out and proud to his frat, he's more than happy to live up to that reputation, especially when new frat brother Daisuke "Dice" Keto moves in. However, Dice's reaction to Kyle's antics is cryptic at best, leaving Kyle frustrated in more ways than one. Will a lost bet--and a sexy rendezvous with a "Secret Admirer"--clarify the situation?

We, the seniors, placed a bet with the juniors of our fraternity to see who could raise the most money. Guess who lost? Now, each senior is placed in a separate room where our supposed punishment will happen. Walking into my assigned room, I notice two unusual things: a blindfold and a note that says “Sit down and put the blindfold on. —Secret Admirer”Photo Description: A black-and-white close-up of an attractive young man wearing a dark blindfold. His expression is stoic— not fearful, but also not excited. He isn’t wearing a shirt, and, based on the upper chest area that is visible, he’s muscular and fit.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "Love is an Open Road" event.
