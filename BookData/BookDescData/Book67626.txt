  Brought together by passion;Separated by destiny.
Sheâ€™s his muse.His love.His inspiration.And he refuses to let her go.For nearly two years, Kai Eastwood has watched Phoenix Banks lost in a state of coma.Singing the songs they wrote.Remembering the moments they spent together.Missing the kisses they shared.Holding hope.But how long can hope be held when, with each new day, Phoenix slips farther away?Maybe this timeWhen the music fades,And the silence invades,Their song will begin.
