Shake, shake, shudder, near the sludgy old swamp. The dinosaurs are coming. Get ready to romp. Join in with Triceratops, Stegosaurus, and friends as the dinosaurs stir up a Dinosaurumpus!Where can you find a Deinosuchus that practically pirouettes on its tail and a T-Rex that bounds gracefully through the air? Between the pages of Tony Mitton's Dinosaurumpus, where dinosaurs run, boom, shake, and shudder their way to the "sludgy old swamp" and rock the night away. Mitton's delightful rhyme and Parker-Rees's whimsical illustrations will make children want to join in the dance while they learn about some of their favorite prehistoric pals. By the time the romp is over, and the dinosaurs are fast asleep, kids won't be able to shake that jumping, thumping Dinosaurumpus beat!
