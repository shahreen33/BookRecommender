It's not everyday you have the number one box office star in your car. Actually, not any day for someone like me, Nova Sparks, a plain Jane hair stylist.  And the real kick in the rear end? Not only will he be in my car, in a few weeks, he’ll be in my life— as my stepbrother.  Fate has brought Ethan Hale into my small Montana world and kept him unattainable. How’s that for cruel?  Now I’m stuck being near him. Stuck with the tabloids and paparazzi. Stuck with these feelings I shouldn’t be having.  The only way to get unstuck is accept I can’t have him and send him back to Hollywood.  The only problem? He may have other plans.
