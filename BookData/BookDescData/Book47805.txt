True love deserves a second chance. I've been a fighter all my life, even before I made it my career. As a kid in the foster system, I didn't have any other choice. But I've never fought for something--for someone--as hard as I fought for Lucy. I was her protector, her hero--and she was my everything. From the day we met, she made our grim days in Atlanta's notorious Brighton Park fade away--leaving only us.But we broke each other's hearts, and we did a damn good job of it. A decade has passed since I last saw her, but not a day goes by that I don't think of her clear blue eyes or easy smile. So when I see her at one of my matches--and find out that she's engaged--I need to understand why she turned her back on me all those years ago. Because no matter what I do, no matter how many guys I knock out in the boxing ring, I can't forget her.So I'm not giving up on her. I'm not walking away.I'm going to fight for Lucy one last time.A Story Like Ours, book 2 in the Love Story duet, will release June 18, 2019.Love Story Duet:Book 1: A Love Like YoursBook 2: A Story Like Ours
