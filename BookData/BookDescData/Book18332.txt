After a reckless night out and losing everything I had worked so hard for, I leave memories of a London police cell behind me and head for Marbella with its promise of adventure and fun. Little do I know that Iâ€™m about to be thrust into the most terrifying time of my life. Wrong Place Wrong Time is a gripping true-life story of an unimaginable nightmare and how my ticket to a new life turns out to be a one way ticket to hell.
