This is a collection of fourteen paired essays written by Nandini Patwardhan and Ranjani Rao. Both writers grew up in Mumbai and spent long periods in the United States. The essays explore similar themes, but from very different perspectives. Topics covered are the emergence of ambition in childhood, becoming mothers in a foreign land, the meaning of home, and how the writers' values continue to be shaped by their formative experiences.This is a different kind of immigrant narrative. There is nostalgia, but it is colored with optimism, ambition, and courage. Curious and open-minded readers will find resonance in this anthology.
