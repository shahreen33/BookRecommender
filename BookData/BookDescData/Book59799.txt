Ghostology is simply the study of Ghosts. It is not ghost hunting, neither is it is parapsychology. The study of ghosts - Ghostology, is not trying to capture apparitions on camera, although that is sometimes a part of it. It is not trying to record the sounds and the voices of the deceased or of spirits, although that too is a part of it. Ghostology is the holistic study of a fascinating aspect of our humanity, a shared human experience that dates back to the earliest civilisations and is common to all of them. Ghostology is not a "How to guide" for those seeking to investigate ghosts but it provides an up to date consideration and a discussion of the many methods and techniques that will prove helpful to anyone interested in the subject, for those who actively seek ghosts or who are merely interested in discovering more about this fascinating subject.
