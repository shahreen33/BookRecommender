Based on a popular online comic, The Tragedy Series presents a series of sepia-toned drawings that address such unfortunate events as “what bad roommates the taxidermist and the necromancer make,” or “the triceratops that never got to see the ocean,” or the hurdles to romance that secret lobster claws present. One part Victoriana, one part theater of the absurd, and the rest full of heart, these illustrations delight the brain and the eye.This collection offers not just an array of funny-sad scenarios, however. Creator Benjamin Dewey also includes both a series of “sadness reprieves” as well as original, exclusive content to draw in the skinflints who might otherwise stick to the Internet’s free buffet.
