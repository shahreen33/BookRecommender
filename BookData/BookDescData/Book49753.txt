In this collection of hilarious essays, Edward Riche stretches his satiric muscles to lambaste just about anything that crosses his field of vision.  Newfoundland writes a heartfelt letter to Canada, offering to console mainland frustrations over a pint. The Canadian government brainstorms to find which national symbol it can ruin next. And a concerned citizen writes a scathing critique of The Muskrat Falls Festival of the Arts, now hundreds of dollars over budget.In Bag of Hammers Riche reminds us just how enlivening and enlightening satire can be, and how much we need it right now.
