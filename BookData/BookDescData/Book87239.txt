Vanessa Jackson is just trying to get divorced, not pick up a new man; and certainly not her divorce attorney. Gibson Kincaid is trying to do right by his new client, but in all honestly, he wants to get Vanessa divorced... so he can have her to himself.Vanessa's not-soon-enough-to-be ex-husband, Warren, isn't ready to let go of the young, naive woman he 'rescued' from a different life ten years ago. Though she and her girls are barely making it, life would be so much easier if she could divorce the sonofab#tch. Gibson, the youngest of four Kincaid men, all attorneys at Kincaid Family law is the rebel. He's never going to do what Mother Sylvia "The Silver Shark" wants him to do. Instead of catering to high profile wealthy clients, Gibson chooses to serve the 'down on their luck' sector, earning him the nickname Community Lawyer. His career might implode before he has the chance to open his dream law firm, but come hell or high water, he's going to get his newest client divorced so she can start a new life. With him. Vanessa swears she's ready to move on, to be rid of Warren Jackson, but she's holding on to a piece of her past that she doesn't want Gibson to know. When he finds out, it could change everything.
