 Two clashing colleagues stuck together for Christmas--will opposites eventually attract?Patrick has been single since he broke up with his cheating ex almost a year ago. With Christmas looming, he's resigned to spending it alone with only memories of happier times for company. When a business trip with a co-worker leaves them stranded in the Lake District due to heavy snow, it seems Patrick will have company for Christmas after all. It's a shame his companion is Kyle, who's undeniably attractive, but annoying as hell.Aware of Patrick's reluctant admiration, Kyle basks in the attention even though Patrick isn't the type of man he normally goes for. Averse to relationships after being hurt in the past, Kyle enjoys the occasional hook up, but has given up on seeking anything more meaningful.Stuck together, their antagonism escalates along with a heavy dose of sexual tension until it finally ignites. What starts as a Christmas fling soon feels like something special; but will their tentative connection melt away as the snow thaws? If they're going to take a chance on finding happiness together, they'll have to put their differences aside and learn to trust one another.Contains: enemies-to-lovers, snowball fights, bickering, spanking, a cute dog, a wise old lady, mistletoe, and a happy ending (of course).
