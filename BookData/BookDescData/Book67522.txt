Getting into Savage Magic Academy was just the beginning...I survived my night with the shifter alpha, but I'm not out of the woods yet. I need to find my brother without getting caught, survive my bullies, and pass my classes.Easy, right?Wrong.I also have to be prepared. My night with the shifter might've ended differently than I ever imagined, but now I'm being given to the vampire alpha. And this time, I might not be so lucky.Four men own me. To do with what they wish.And being owned? Well, it's harder than I thought.I was ready for them to break my body. To end my life. I wasn't ready for four handsome men who make me feel alive, even while their words cut deeply.I thought I'd never let anyone break me again, but what I'm facing now... it's more dangerous than being broken. And while I'd do anything to save my brother, if I'm not careful, I'll be completely f*cked.ROYAL VILLIANS is a bully academy reverse harem romance. All the characters are over eighteen. There is swearing and sexual situations. It is also a series of "episodes," like television episodes. Each story will be short, and it will end on a cliffhanger, but the next episode will come soon after.
