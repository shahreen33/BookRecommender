The King has summoned you, Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Lords, to his citadel at Holmgard. Your quest is to recover a missing shipment of gold and locate the patrol which has disappeared while investigating the suspected theft. As you and your men equip yourselves for the long ride ahead, you glimpse a crow perched on a window ledge high above. As it flies away a shiver runs down your spineâ€”in Holmgard the crow is a symbol of impending danger.
