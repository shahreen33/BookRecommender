Forgiveness … It isn’t always as easy as it sounds. Becoming a Marine had been Ryker’s dream, but that dream faded when it led to losing the one girl who held his heart. Returning to Alabama after being gone for more than five years was going to be hard, but he couldn’t continue to live without her. His world seemed empty and there was only one thing that could heal that void. Find Nicole… Beg for her forgiveness… And never let her go again. 
  She would always be his...
