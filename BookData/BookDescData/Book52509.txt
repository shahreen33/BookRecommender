MuriellaI’ve never been on a date.And I intended to keep it that way.But to save my best friends’ relationship, I agreed to three with the man I secretly long for.He doesn’t know why we can’t be. That chancing a relationship would bring everything crashing down around us.Whatever he makes me feel is irrelevant. Wherever he thinks this may lead, he’s wrong.Three dates.That’s all I have to survive before I can put him back where he belongs…At arm’s length. StoneSix years.That’s how long I’ve waited for her.Now I’ve got three shots to convince her what I’ve known all along…We belong together.Despite all of my determination, each new revelation seems to pull us apart.With everything stacked against us, we may not even make it to date three, let alone forever.
