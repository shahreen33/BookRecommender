Demon, the President of The Soldiers of Wrath MC, is a vicious bastard, a heartless killer, and has no regrets about any of the violent things he does in life. It is how he survives, and how he keeps his club and his men safe.  Deanna Monte has stayed in the life of her drug addicted, low-life father since her mother passed away. She may hate her dad, but after her mother's dying wish for Deanna to not give up on him, she knows she can't walk away.  When Deanna is given to Demon as payment for her father's debt, she fights with everything inside of her and refuses to submit. But she's never met a man like Demon, a cruel man that is big and powerful and can take her life as easily as he breathes. She shouldn't want him the way she does, not after he takes her away from her life, refusing to let her go, and tells her that she is his now.  But she does, and that frightens her most of all.
