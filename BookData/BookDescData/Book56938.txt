Silk is drawn into the Clone Conspiracy! And with a variety of folks mysteriously dead no more, she's about to face a Spider-Woman back from the grave! New U has made J. Jonah Jameson's dreams come true. First, his late wife, Marla, was returned to him, and now his adopted daughter, Mattie Franklin, is alive again as well! It should be a time for celebration, but Cindy Moon is feeling anything but festive - especially since her boss' entire resurrected family is setting off her spider-sense! And since Mattie used to be Spider-Woman, what will she make of Silk?Collecting: Silk 14-19
