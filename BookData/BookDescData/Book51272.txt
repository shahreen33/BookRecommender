Dear Author,Who are you and what have you done with my best friend? You think you know a guy and then, wham, it seems like I know nothing at all.My previously shy and somewhat geeky best friend seems to have been hiding a few things from me. For example, pink underwear— what the hell? And when did he acquire that ripped body and those tats? And why is he undressing in my kitchen? And why, oh why, am I even noticing his body and feeling the overwhelming desire to touch his skin and trace that intricate pattern with my tongue? He’s a guy! And my best friend! How did this happen and what else has he been hiding from me? I can’t breathe…Photo Description: A super-hot man is stripping in what appears to be a kitchen. He has an extremely fit and tanned body, with a ripped six-pack and muscular thighs. He has tattoos outlining his torso and across his lower abs that trail down his pelvis into his nicely-packed pink Emporio Armani bikini briefs. He is pulling a pale pink sweater over his head.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "Love Has No Boundaries" event.
