This dark and twisted tale of ownership will make your blood run hot. Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and Amazon Bestseller Vivian Wood writes dark romance as OLIVIA RYANN.   No one is coming to save me. I am his Fiore now, his flower. To do with as he wishes. And he wants everything. Monster wants my tears, my screams of pleasure, my shudders of fear. In return, he also brings me these moments of startling clarity. I know who I think I am. I know who he says I am. I feel I’m somewhere between, lost in an ocean of pain. When he trots out my brother with a wide smile, I’m forced to choose between them. It’s a simple choice: the only family I have left, or the Monster I’m increasingly drawn to?
