Jack and Jill Reed never dreamed of running a mental health facility. Far from it. They were nerdy hippies who were better suited to be flower growers. But as life happened and dreams changed, and by way of unforeseen circumstances, they found themselves at the helm of one of the most unique mental health facilities in the country. At the Reedâ€™s Northern Lights mental health facility, the patients mingle freely with the staff and each other. Some of the personalities are quiet and contemplative, some inappropriately humorous, and a few seductive and sexual. But, all are on a shared path that will lead them, and the staff, on the road toward self-discovery and self-destruction. And, in the end, the only sanity they will discover, is that which lies in the disequilibrium of love.
