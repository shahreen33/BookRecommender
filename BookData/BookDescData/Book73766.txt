Geatland – Late Summer 517 AD  Fresh from the desperate defence of the Northern borders of the Kingdom, Beowulf is appointed by King Hythcyn to lead the greatest ship army in the history of his people, carrying fire and sword to the ‘Black Heart’ of their enemies. But all is not as it seems. Hythcyn’s actions have thrust a flaming brand into the delicate balance of power in the Scandinavian lands, setting a series of events in motion which quickly spiral out of control.  As Beowulf begins to understand that the Allfather is carefully grooming him to confront the Grendel, a mysterious affliction begins to cast its long dark shadow across his soul, causing him to fear for his sanity.  In an enthralling tale of brutal battles, love and betrayal, Beowulf and his closest kin are swept up by the storm and scattered to the winds. From the mountainous rollers of the North Atlantic to the frozen forests of Swede Land and the bloody temple at Uppsala, Beowulf and his fellow exiles, the Wraeccan, gather their strength and prepare to confront King Hythcyn in the final battle for Geatland.  PRAISE FOR BOOK ONE ‘SWORD OF WODEN-SORROW HILL’  …a great start to a very promising series.  …fast paced and exciting…  …the style of prose used by C.R.May is so much better than normal debut novels. His story is well paced and wonderfully descriptive but most of all he knows how to tell a damn good yarn.  …one of the best battle sequences I have had the pleasure of reading for some time. Definitely recommended.  The characters became real, multi-faceted people, always the mark of a good writer.
