 I just had to try and be a bad girl, didn't I? I blame Ethan. This is all his fault.    Rule #9 â€“ We were never supposed to get this far. It was only supposed to be for a week. I don't even know what we're supposed to do now. I've never done this before.  "You ready for the ride of your life, Princess?" I ask her.  "You think you're that good, do you, Ethan?" Ashley counters.  Thankfully my dad's in the car with the window up, so he can't hear any of this.  "Better," I tell her, smirking. "You don't even know what you're getting into here."  "I think I have a pretty good idea..." she says, grinning uncontrollably and winking at me.  My dad rolls down the window. "What's the hold up?" he asks.  "Nothing," I say.  Yeah, well, that's it. Time for a road trip. We're going camping.  I still don't know how to tell my dad that I'm dating my stepsister. I don't know if I can ever tell him. He's already voiced his disapproval, whether he realizes it or not. With more and more people trying to interfere, it's getting harder to keep this a secret, though...
