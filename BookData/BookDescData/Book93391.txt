From the mind of master storyteller Neil Gaiman Young Jack's world was full of ghosts and ghouls, but one monster - a ravenous and hideous troll - would haunt him long into manhood. As the beast sups upon a lifetime of Jack's fear and regret, Jack must find the courage within himself to face the fiend once and for all. Beautifully adapted by Colleen Doran (TheÂ Sandman, Stan Lee's Amazing Fantastic Incredible: A Marvelous Memoir), a gorgeous new addition to your Gaiman library.
