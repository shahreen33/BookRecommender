Story 1: Mary &amp; Anthony   Mary has belonged to Anthony since the day she was born. They’ve known each other their whole lives, but he won’t touch her until she says, ‘I Do.’  Their parents' story should have been a cautionary tale, but when Mary finally agrees to Anthony’s proposal, they run away to Vegas to tie the knot.  But what do they do when things don’t go according to plan and they find themselves caught between a Russian sniper and his runaway daughter?  Easy! Lock themselves in a hotel room and pop some cherries!  Story 2: Samuel &amp; Nika  Samuel’s twin sister, Mary, is off to Vegas to marry his best friend, Anthony. Samuel’s heading to Sin City with them to give her away, but trouble in the form of a sneaky brunette stops him dead in his tracks.  Nika’s on the run, and she’s found herself backed into a corner. But she’s been trained on how to defend herself, especially against a big beast like Samuel.  From the first look, he was finished and had no intention of ever letting her go.  You begged for the story of Mary and Anthony, and here it is! The final chapter in the Taking the Fall series closes with two short stories on the children of Carter, Layla, Saint, and Jeanette.  Warning: These stories are just as fierce, just as strong, and just as steamy as the rest of the series. These novellas can be read as standalones but will be enjoyed even more after reading the Taking the Fall series.
