Nineteen year old Penelope "Nell" O'Hara is geared up for the worst Christmas of her life. The guy she's been dating just dumped her for her best friend, and all she has to look forward to over the break is a stay in Beggar's Hole--a tiny frozen town on the coast of Maine--with her retired father, his latest masseuse girlfriend and her brattish fourteen year old son. But one night, after storming out of dinner to take a brooding walk among the rocks, a misstep on the ice causes Nell's Christmas to take rather a different turn... She would have died, were it not for a mysterious, heat-exuding hero arriving out of nowhere to scoop her up in his arms, and warm and dry her body. Coming to, Nell finds herself staring up into a pair of deep gold eyes. Eyes belonging to a man who is quite unlike any she's seen before. His features are chiseled yet sensual, exotic but somber, like something beautiful and wild threatened by extinction. All of six and a half feet tall, and two hundred plus pounds of pure muscle, her savior introduces himself as Theon Aena.
