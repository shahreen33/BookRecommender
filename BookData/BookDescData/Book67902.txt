It’s been over a year since Master rescued me from the commune. Now, I live my amazing life with the man of my dreams as I pursue my career as a vlogger. The only problem is, as much as I love my master and the life we lead, I’ve sworn off all male friendships aside from Jake’s—our next door neighbor. It’s nothing personal. I just can’t seem to get past… the one thing that tore into my soul and won’t let go. I don’t want to be this way. But, I can’t seem to help it… Will Master find a way to fix what’s been broken?Or, am I destined to live my life jaded, thanks to a scarred past? I’m not a damn victim. If only my brain would get the memo.Warning: Read at your discretion. This novella contains shameless sexual M/M content. Adult F'in language. A smidgen of mushy love.
