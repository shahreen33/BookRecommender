All I can tell you is what I remember, in the words that I have.Hayley tends to her bees and follows the rules in the only world she has ever known.Until she witnesses the impossible: a drip from the ceiling.A drip? It doesn't make sense.Yet she hears it, catches it. Tastes it.Curiosity is a hook.What starts as a drip leads to a lie, a death, a boy, a beast, and too many awful questions.
