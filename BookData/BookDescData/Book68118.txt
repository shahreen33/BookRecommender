I just got a job in Montana and now the freaking building is burning down… …and I’m stuck inside. I’m about to die a broke, boyfriend-less virgin until a fireman bursts into the room. He’s come to save me from the flames, but when I see the territorial way he’s looking at me, I start to wonder who’s going to save me from him? Because this mean-looking grizzly bear shifter named Ethan Sullivan thinks I’m his now. “I saved you. You’re mine,” he keeps growling at me. He keeps calling me his mate and I’m not about to correct him when he’s got that feral look in his eyes. He wants to leave his mark on me. He keeps saying he’s going to claim me, whatever that means. I’ve always had a thing for firemen, but this rough wild-looking man is more than just a pretty image in a calendar. He’s real. He won’t take his possessive hands off me and he’s full on obsessed with my curves. This protective alpha wants me all for himself and he’s letting everyone know it. Especially me…   Ready for an alpha who can handle the heat and likes his girl with some meat? Ethan is a dominant Over-The-Top grizzly bear shifter who will have you howling for more. This is the first book in the Alphas In Heat series featuring the bear shifters from the Blackcloud Point fire station. Fire-fighting bear shifters? Yes, please! The books can be read in any order.  This fireman romance shifter book is SAFE, with no cheating, and a furry HEA guaranteed. Enjoy!
