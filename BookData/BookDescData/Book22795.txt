Strings Attached is a powerful memoir about resilience in the face of unspeakable tragedy, an inspiring and poignant tale of how one man transformed his own heartache into a legacy of triumph and joy for his students.His students knew Jerry Kupchynsky as “Mr. K” – the fierce, foot-stomping Ukrainian-born music teacher who rehearsed them until their fingers almost bled, and who made them better than they had any right to be. Away from the classroom, though, life seemed to conspire against him at every turn. Strings Attached takes you on his remarkable journey, from his childhood on the run in Nazi Germany, to his life in America caring for his two young daughters and his disabled wife, to his search for his younger daughter after she mysteriously disappears - a search that would last for seven years.  His unforgettable story is lyrically told in alternating chapters by two childhood friends who reconnected decades later: Melanie Kupchynsky, his daughter, and Joanne Lipman, a former student. Joanne recalls the intimidating teacher who nevertheless "had such absolute confidence—faith, really—in my ability to do better.” Melanie tells of a father who gave heart and soul to his family and students, who loved music and open skies, and who in spite of everything believed hard work would result in great beauty.Heartbreaking yet ultimately triumphant, Strings Attached is a testament to the astonishing power of hope--and a celebration of the profound impact that one person can have on the lives of others._______________________To hear the music from STRINGS ATTACHED, please visit StringsAttachedBook.com
