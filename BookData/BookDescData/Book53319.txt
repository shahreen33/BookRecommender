I died.It was supposed to be the end of my story. But after Aon buried me in the Pool of the Ancients, I learned that Under wasn’t done with me yet. Even though I escaped death the first time, there’s a prophecy predicting my demise, and it’s driving Aon mad. His desperation to protect me is dangerous, deadly, and I’m afraid of what he might do.The void that threatens to destroy this world is receding, yet Under is still not safe. I can feel it in my blood, the warning that something terrible is coming. Something bigger and stronger than all of us. But I am no longer the human girl merely fighting for survival. I’m different now, changed into something this world hasn’t seen in fifteen hundred years. I am immortal, a queen of Under.I am the Queen of Dreams.
