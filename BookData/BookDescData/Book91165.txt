They made him a destroyer Thirteen years ago, Palash Joshi indentured himself to Corporate Services in exchange for the cybernetic upgrades that made him stronger and faster; giving him a better life in exchange for allowing them to whittle away his humanity one horrible act at a time. Now though, his time as one of their operators is almost at an end. Freedom is in reach, and his only remaining job is to revisit the only woman who had touched his heart and destroy her life’s work. She needed a protector Netta Schulmann knew her corporate masters would send someone to punish her eventually – she had stalled too long in developing their perfect weapon, and the company that had been her refuge couldn’t risk their investment much longer. She didn’t expect them to send the same man who had shown her solace and protection when she’d been on the run, the one person she had trusted implicitly. Neither of them expected Corporate Services to send an assassin, to make sure they were both out of the way. Forced into flight, Netta and Joshi find that three years apart has only heightened their passion for each other, but with time running out, they will need more than passion to survive. They’ll need trust. But even that has limits, and as secrets from each of their pasts comes to light, not even love may be enough to save them.
