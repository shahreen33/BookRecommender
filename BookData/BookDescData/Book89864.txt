Listen to the news and keep your eyes open, because a curious little mouse has had his wish come true! Now We’re Talking! is the second in a series of books on Carlo’s adventures. This nosy little mouse leaves home for the first time to explore life inside the hospital. But Hospitalia is a strange place, and there’s no place for him to hide. Cold, sterile, and unfriendly, the hospital looks nothing like Carlo had imagined while sitting at home. Before he knows what’s up, the kitchen staff are on his tail. Will the hungry mouse manage to trick the hospital manager, cook, and exterminator without breaking the rules his parents taught him? You’ll find out in Mrs. D.’s next book on Carlo the Mouse, What’s Going On? If this clever mouse outwits you, don’t get discouraged. Keep reading and follow Carlo’s adventures!
