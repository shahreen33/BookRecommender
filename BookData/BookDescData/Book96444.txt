He’s been sent to betray Kane, but there’s a complication, and that complication is a smart-mouthed beauty who is also vying for a coveted spot on the crew. Dustin can’t keep his attention from Emma for long, and the more he gets to know about her, the more mysterious she seems. She is making him want to be a better man, but he’s in way too deep, and now he’ll have to choose a side. Too bad choosing could get him and the woman he loves killed.  Emma is a human on a mission: make it onto the Blackwing Crew. So when Dustin Porter, sexy werewolf with one helluva sense of humor, suggests they pretend to fall for each other, she’s pretty sure he has the worst ideas on the planet. That is, until his plan works a little too well, and now Emma is in way over her head. Dustin hasn’t been honest with her, and what she doesn’t know could get her hurt, but as she gets to know the witty werewolf, she begins to realize there is more to Dustin than meets the eye.  She’s falling hard for a man destined to betray the crew she loves, and now all that stands between him and oblivion…is her.
