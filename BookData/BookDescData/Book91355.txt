Daughter’s Need finished the Fixers series, but it left quite a few hanging threads. And since I know my readers, I decided to knit a few of those and show you where things have ended up. :)   A few of the stories in this collection began many books ago. Regalis and Tameka. Yesenia and a second trip to a certain Wanderer flea market. A couple of them are here purely because they made me giggle (Kish facing the impending doom of a crown on her head) or because I simply couldn’t resist (there was just no way for this to end without a quick trip to Quixal.) The rest volunteered themselves as I sat with my knitting needles and checked in with each of the characters who made this series what it is.  In case it's not obvious yet, if you haven't read this series, don't start here. Destiny's Song awaits you.
