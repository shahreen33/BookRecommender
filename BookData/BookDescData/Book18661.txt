'When the veil fell, any half bloods not strong enough to withstand Chaos were torn apart. Some, like me and my brother, survived The Fall. Most did not.That's the good news. The bad news saw a whole other world try and devour ours. Demons, we call them. They came in countless waves. Destroying. Killing. Many people thought it was the end...The Fall lasted a week. Tens of thousands died. Hell almost claimed our world as its own. And then, from one day to the next, it was over. The veil came back, stronger than ever. I'm not sure if anyone knows how it was put right. But I do know it's been six months since The Fall, me and my brother are on the run, and the leftover demons aren't the most dangerous things in LA. We are.'***"They have no defence against chaos." ~ Asmodeus, Ties That Bind, #5 The Veil Series.Set in the same 'world' as the Veil Series,  Chaos Rises, #1 The Chaos Series  will feature some of the characters we love (and hate?), and also introduce some new faces. The streets of LA are about to become a demon proving ground. Chaos will find a way. And as the Prince of Greed once said, "When chaos reigns, the veil falls."If you'd like to be kept informed of all the news, sign up to Pippa's mailing list here.
