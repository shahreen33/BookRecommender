What's to Love: Day Men. 28 Days Later. Dingo. Besides being one of our favorite writers, Michael Alan Nelson is one of the industry's preeminent voices in horror, and we couldn't be happier bringing back his fan-favorite creation Hexed for another dive into the depths of the Aether! Plus, Hexed was Pretty Deadly and Amazing Spider-Man superstar Emma Rios' introduction to the American comics scene back in 2008, and new series artist Dan Mora is poised to continue the trend with his lyrical, horrific, and wholly unique takeon Lucifer. What It Is: Luci Jennifer Inacio Das Neves (most people just call her "Lucifer") is a supernatural thief-for-hire, stealing wondrous objects from the dark denizens of the netherworld for her mentor/mother figure, Val Brisendine. But when Lucifer accidentally unleashes a terrible evil from one of the paintings hanging in Val's art gallery, will any of the tricks up her eeve be enough to stop it?
