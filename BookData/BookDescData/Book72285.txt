All Life is One. It is not only the multiplicity it appears to our five senses. This is the source of all the the problems we humans have experienced forever. However no amount of argument and discussion can resolve the issue for us. What we need is direct experience of the way things are.Inside every living being, including plants, is the Centre of the Universe. By humans, it can be accessed and investigated and the Truth realised. Once and for all, beyond all doubt. Although, it has no material substance and therefore will never be perceived by scientific instruments which are designed for perceiving material forms, it does have a location. It can be perceived by the mind's eye at the centre of gravity of the human body, exactly where the breathing is felt to rise and fall.Learn how to access the Centre. How to understand it. How to use it. How to enter it forever.
