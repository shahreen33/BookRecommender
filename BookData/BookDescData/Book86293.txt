From Gill Paul, the author of Another Woman’s Husband and The Secret Wife, comes a powerful new chapter in her Romanov saga… a gripping journey through the decades and across the continents, a novel of eternal love, devastating loss, and courage against all odds. Summer 1918: Pretty, vivacious Grand Duchess Maria Romanova faces an uncertain future. The nineteen-year-old daughter of the fallen Tsar Nicholas II, she now lives with her family in suffocating isolation, a far cry from their once-glittering royal household. Her days are a combination of endless boredom and paralyzing fear; her only respite is a clandestine friendship with a few of the guards imprisoning the family—never realizing her innocent flirtations could mean the difference between life and death. 1973: When housewife Val Doyle hears her father’s end-of-life confession, “I didn’t want to kill her,” she’s stunned. So, she begins a search for the truth—about his words and her past. The clues she discovers are baffling—a jewel-encrusted box that won’t open and a camera with its film intact. What she finds out pulls Val into one of the world’s greatest mysteries—what really happened to the lost Romanov daughter?
