Grade Level: 3-4 Age Level: 8-9 Listening Level: Grade 3-4 Ten-year-old cousins Jesse and Daisy have always wanted something magical to happen to them. So its a dream come true when Jesses newly found thunder egg hatches and a helpless, tiny dragon pops out. Jesse names the bright green dragon Emmy, short for Emerald. Soon the two kids are at Emmys beck and call, trying to figure out what to feed her. An Internet search leads them to the library and then back to the Internet, where they find a strange Website called foundadragon.org. Here Jesse and Daisy discover that the little dragons hatching means that they are now Dragon Keepers, and not only do they have to feed Emmy but they also have to keep her safe from the villainous Saint George, who has kept himself alive over centuries by drinking dragons blood. In The Dragon in the Sock Drawer, author Kate Klimo has cleverly imagined what it would be like if a couple of modern-day kids had to raise a dragon.
