I’m Remi St. James, and I’m a member of a secret society—one that rules the gothic halls of Brighton Saints Academy. I’ve officially crossed over. I’m an elite. I feel reborn.And the way he looks at me now…Gage Astor wants me. We’ve become the power couple that everyone envies. Even his Broken Saints. There’s a whisper in the ranks, a threat. I feel it when they look at me; the mysterious new girl that worked her way into the elite circle, presenting danger should she discover too much about their secrets.As I go deeper into their world, I start to question who my friends are. Who my enemies are. And whether I can even tell the difference anymore. A girl had to die in order for me to be adopted into their society…and like her, I fear the only way out of their ring of trust may be death. With the homecoming dance right around the corner, the girls of Brighton have a show to put on. Exquisite dresses and a glamor of makeup; a mask of wealth to hide who we really are. Who I’m becoming…Heavy is the head that wears the crown—and Gage rules with an unrivaled cruelty. When the biggest secret of all is revealed, I’ll have to don my own viscous tiara to take back control of my life.
