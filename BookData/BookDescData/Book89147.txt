Now more than ever, empowerment for girls is at an increasing global high through the awareness of education, power, and true beauty. In an attempt to help our girls and teenagers recognize this at an early age, we as a whole can eliminate trouble and growing trends that are damaging girls around the globe. Our first step is acknowledging and taking a step to revolutionize today's standard of beauty and it starts with the youngest of the youngest. Just as knowledge is power, so is beauty and both no one can take from you. In this heightened time of empowering women and girls around the world, this book helps our young ladies understand the beauty inside. With society and media suggesting ways to be beautiful, our children today are obsessed with the world's definition of beauty. Many of today's children are growing up with one parent in the home or sometimes, no parent in the home. So without someone or a parent telling you, you are beautiful, our children are looking for acceptance in the world and other places. With examples of demonstrated strength and courage, There's Beauty Inside... This Girl nurtures our girls to know they are beautiful despite what has happened to them. It is a collection of personal transparent poetry designed specifically to raise the awareness of the beauty inside and to help raise their self-esteem or confidence. Ages: 8-12
