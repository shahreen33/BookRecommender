“Big Bad Bill” Edwards, the biggest, baddest cowboy in Bear Creek Saddle, Idaho, has only gotten meaner in the years since his bride Melody died young… Miami bartender Allie Crawford has no idea what she’s getting into when she buys half-ownership of the sexy cowboy’s bar, inherited from his late uncle. She’d thought they’d built a friendship based on several months of emails back and forth. But in person, Big Bad Bill will do anything to keep her at arm’s length... only he can’t. The man is sinfully sexy trouble — big trouble. Especially since Allie is just one year out from when her cheating ex destroyed their marriage. How can Bill and Allie be together if their hearts can’t handle the risk of breaking once more? Bill has just three rules for dealing with Allie: Don’t kill her. Don’t kiss her. And above all, don’t fall in love... not ever again. For fans of cowboy romance, Idaho ranchers (heck, even Montana ranchers, since they're neighbors), and sizzling hot contemporary romance, this short novel by New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Shoshanna Evers is set in the mountains of small-town Bear Creek Saddle, Idaho. Ride 'em, cowboy!
