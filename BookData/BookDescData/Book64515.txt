An introduction to the healing effects of fasting using just one type of food • Includes Johanna Brandt’s grape cure with the author’s advice and commentary • Explains why mono diets are so effective at cleansing and restoring the internal cellular environment • Shows how to interpret your body’s signals to adapt the diet to your unique needs The grape cure, the lemon cure, the maple syrup cure, and the apple diet are all variations of mono diets that are based on restricting food intake to one food for a period of time. Using the famous grape cure pioneered by Johanna Brandt as his model (reproduced here in its entirety), Christopher Vasey demonstrates why these restricted diets are all remarkably effective in healing illness and restoring optimum health. Despite their different nutritive approaches and resulting healing benefits, all these diets work the same way: They help the body “burn” the waste products it contains to cleanse the internal cellular environment. They also keep the body’s eliminatory organs open in order to prevent the buildup of toxins. While these cures are responsible for healing people of many serious illnesses, including cancer, their principal use lies in the way they naturally eliminate waste products and prevent the body from absorbing toxins during the process. The Detox Mono Diet is a practical guide that provides all the information necessary for following a detoxification regimen. To make the application most successful, the author explains how to interpret your body’s reactions in a way that will allow you to adapt the cure to match your specific physiological needs, making your return to optimum health a unique journey.
