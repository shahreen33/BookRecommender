Alternate cover edition for ASIN: B00EO5DCT8Imagine if you were the first and only female police detective in Acapulco, investigating crime in a city both deadly and breathtaking. Mexican drug cartels battle for control and politicians are bought with blood money. Your partner once vowed to destroy you. Your new lieutenant is a drunk. Your lover might leave Acapulco. And then the restaurant you just left blows up. That's the situation for Detective Emilia Cruz in HAT DANCE, the second book in the sensational police procedural series taking the mystery scene by storm. Terrified by her nightmares of the restaurant fire and shaken by norteamericano hotel manager Kurt Rucker's possible move, Emilia must catch a violent firebomber and find a missing girl before the iconic beach city is destroyed.  Neither investigation is easy, because the influence and impact of Mexico's drug war is everywhere, just like the salt breeze coming off the ocean. Emilia's police work is soon hijacked by savage political rivalries, a corrupt Vice cop, and a woman in prison who knows more than she'll say.  As Acapulco screams for an end to the flames, the arsonist evades Emilia's sting operation. Meanwhile, the missing girl's trail leads to Acapulco's famous lucha libre fighters.  Inside the coliseum, the heat of both investigations ignites into an inferno. If Emilia's only chance to survive is to dance with the devil, will she take it? Would you?
