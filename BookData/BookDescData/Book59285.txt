One witch with a grudge, three cats with a secret, and one vegan with a very big problem. Priscilla “Price” Jones is down on her luck. First, her childhood sweetheart dumps her a month before their wedding so he can hook up with a model he met at one of his yogalates fitness studios. Then, her vegan smoothie store burns to the ground.  Out of work and out of love, Priscilla accepts the first job she can find, packs her bags, and takes the first bus from Portland to Salem, Oregon, to find her luck is even worse than she thought. Her new boss just died, and the old lady’s thrift store, her apartment, and three huge male cats just got added to Priscilla’s long list of problems. But when Price opens one of the old lady’s books and accidentally unleashes some witchy magic, Priscilla realizes her troubles have only begun…  A hilariously witchy reverse harem mystery.
