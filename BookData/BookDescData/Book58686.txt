Aka the totally lurid tale of the convenience store sex slave!After a vicious fight with her slut-shaming jerk of stepbrother, Natalie storms out of the family McMansion, never imagining that would be the last time she’d be allowed in the house. A string of truly rotten decisions follows, until she finds herself suspended from school, friendless, broke, and camping out at the minimart where she works. Worst of all, her college applications are due! Thanks to a helpful teacher and her own stupendous brilliance she manages to get into her top choice college. Unfortunately, dealing with the financial aid forms proves to be too much for her supersmarts and she is about to lose her spot because she cannot get the money together to pay the deposit. Enter Gareth Boyd, an old family friend and all-around manipulative bastard, who makes her an offer: sleep with his (totally hot) roommate, Jamie, and he’ll pay for everything. How hard can it be?  Warning: This story features an eighteen-year-old heroine with a foul mouth and horrible judgment, a criminally unscrupulous man intent on taking advantage of her, and multiple scenes of bondage, spanking, ménage, and one potentially triggering scene of attempted rape. The novel is an erotic fantasy in which characters manipulate or disregard notions of proper consent in ways that would never be acceptable in real life. Adult Readers Only.
