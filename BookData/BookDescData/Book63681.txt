Discovering Your Spiritual Gifts: A Personal Inventory Method is designed to help Christians identify the specific gifts God has given them. While no Christian possesses every gift of the Spirit, every Christian does have some of Godâ€™s wonderful gifts. And to be effective in ministry, Christians must find and use these gifts. This volume features an "inventory" of spiritual gifts designed to be taken either in a group or privately. This book will help clear up certain misconceptions about spiritual gifts and assist Christians in discovering the gifts God has within them.
