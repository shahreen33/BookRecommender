The Daughter of Beaston is hurting. Remington Novak is stuck in a city, her whole life altered for a man who didn’t keep her. A life change comes in many forms, but for Remi, it comes as a newspaper clipping, sent by her best friend. A Last Chance Crew up in the mountains is looking for help, and her skillset matches the requirements. Must like animals? She was a grizzly shifter. Must be okay with crass jokes? She was raised a Grey Back in one of the roughest Crews in existence. She could surely handle a few rowdy boys. When she shows up for the interview though, it’s clear she’s made a grave mistake. Kamp demands her inner bear’s attention immediately, but he’s dangerous to her body and soul. Something’s wrong with that lion shifter, and the more she tries to figure him out, the deeper she falls into a dangerous admiration for him and these mountains he’s claiming as home.  Kamp is out of options. His days are numbered in his Crew, his lion needs to be put down, and every day looks just the same. Wake up, fight the Alpha, fail at his job, sleep, repeat. He’s lost too much to recover, but one look at the fiery-eyed beauty, and this lion shifter lumberjack aching to change his destiny. It might already be too late, but now every day is worth fighting for just to see the growing smile on Remi’s face.  Two damaged shifters, one fate, one helluva mountain to climb to get this Crew to C-Team status. No one could’ve got him living again, but maybe…just maybe…the Novak Grizzly can save him.
