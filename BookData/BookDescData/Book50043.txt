 This teacher needs an O, and I can give that lesson. But I'm not supposed to touch her. Not since my niece Emmy came to live with me. No fraternizing with the parents, dumb school rule. Especially because all I want to do is take Daisy's innocence. She's beautiful, smart, and Emmy loves her. Three makes a family. But the tabloids will rip her apart. And she's not ready. Not for a guy like me. A life like this. At least I didn't think she was. But Daisy is showing me I'm the one who needs to be taught.  Filthy Daddy is the third book in the Her Billionaire's Baby series. It's a STANDALONE with no cliffhanger and an HEA. There will be one book each week for the next five weeks. Lots of babies and billionaires for you to love!
