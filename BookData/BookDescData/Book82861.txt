For centuries, the idea of witches living in our midst has enthralled us. How did this fascination develop? Why did it lead to the persecution of thousands of accused “witches”, most of them women? What does the history of witch hunts reveal about our identities and Western civilization at large? Thomas Fudge, PhD, an expert on heresy and the Middle Ages, helps you explore these questions. Holding doctorates in both medieval history and theology, Prof. Fudge is the perfect guide for this audio course on witch-hunting. Under his tutelage, you will discover how a culture of paranoia developed, why those ideas appealed to men and women in the 16th and 17th centuries, and what effects linger even today. Throughout this 18-part series you will analyze primary sources to understand and contextualize the regulation, detection, and prosecution of alleged witchcraft. By studying the medieval foundations for modern manifestations of witch-hunting - like McCarthyism - you will become more conscientious of the social dynamics of witch-hunts. As Prof. Fudge underscores, witches are a topic “used, misused, and abused.” This course includes a free PDF study guide prepared by your professor and course producer.PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio. ©2018 Now You Know Media Inc.
