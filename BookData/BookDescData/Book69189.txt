Ken Mansfield can write authoritatively about the music business of the sixties because he was there making it happen. As a young record label executive at Capitol Records, the Beatles were his clients, and they became his friends. Ken was hand-picked to be the first U.S. Manager of The Beatles' Apple Records and thrust into a world that would change his life forever. Some thirty years later, Mansfield's spiritual memoirs are set against the backdrop of his personal and professional relationships with John, Paul, George and Ringo, offering an insider's view of the group collectively and individually. From his first meeting with the "lads," to rare glimpses of what it was like to be part of the Beatles inner sanctum, Mansfield offers a transparent and intimate look at the Fab Four and the impact they had on his life. But that is only part of the story. With never-before-seen photographs and memorabilia from Mansfield's personal collection, memories of Beatles' writing and recording sessions, Paul and Linda, John and Yoko, the "Paul is dead" period, adoring fans, and cooking with George then pause for spiritual insights from the beach and a man trying to come to terms with himself and God. The Beatles, the Bible and Bodega Bay presents two portraits: the young man in London on top of the Apple building (and on top of the world!) as he watches the Beatles perform for the last time, and the older man on a remote Sonoma beach on his knees looking out to sea and into the heart of his Creator. Ken Mansfield is a Grammy-winning record producer, publisher, songwriter and former record company executive. a highly sought after public speaker, he is the author of The White Book (June 2007) and Between Wyomings (May 2009).
