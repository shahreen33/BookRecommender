 I wanted the sassy little lady the second I first saw her.  Caleb I had all the success that a self-made man like me could want. But something was still missing. Ready for a break, I returned to my hometown to find myself.  And found her.  Riley-Ann.  The sassy, curvy bartender-slash-waitress at the local watering hole, with a body made just for me.  But as it turned out, she was the only woman around to turn me down. And a virgin.  That's why I put in a bid for lunch with her at the county fair auction.  And nothing was going to stop me from winning her heart.   Riley-Ann I thought my life was finally on the right track, then it all fell apart.  Booted from the only promising office manager job I ever wanted, I turned tail and took a break from everything at my best friend's ranch.  The local saloon was hiring, so I got a job to keep my mind and my hands occupied.  Until he showed up.  Caleb Jackson Reeves.  The biggest name in business around these parts sat down at my bar. He was larger than life, older, wiser, and hot as hell.  And the square-jawed, ruggedly handsome older man wanted me.  I was in no state to deal with anything else in my life right now, not even him. Not his gifts, not his attention, not even the smoldering kiss he planted on me. The one I denied enjoying so much.  Except the first chance he got, he made a bid for lunch with me at the county fair auction. And he won.  Now, I was bought and paid for, and he wasn't about to let this chance slip away.  Warning. This hot and dirty western romance is steamy, spicy, and chock full of feels. If you like slightly over the top romance stories with a big strong alpha male who knows what he wants and isn't afraid to ask nicely for it, this is for you! Standalone romance with no cliffhanger and a sweet happily ever after to make you swoon.
