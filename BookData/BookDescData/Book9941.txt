"A groundbreaking guide for those who are manic depressive of who live with or love someone who is."-- "Publishers Weekly."In her revealing bestseller Call Me Anna, Patty Duke shared her long-kept secret: The talented, Oscar-winning actress who won our hearts on The patty Duke Show was suffering from a serious-but treatable-mental illness called manic depression. For nearly twenty years, until she was correctly diagnosed at age thirty-five, she careened between periods of extreme euphoria and debilitating depression, prone to delusions and panic attacks, temper tantrums, spending sprees, and suicide attempts. Now in "A Brilliant Madness" Patty Duke joins with medical reporter Gloria Hochman to shed light on this powerful, paradoxical, and destructive illness. From what it's like to live with manic-depressive disorder to the latest findings on its most effective treatments, this compassionate and eloquent book provides profound insight into the challenge of mental illness. And though Patty's story, which ends in a newfound happiness with her cherished family, it offers hope for all those who suffer from mood disorders and for the family, friends, and physicians who love and care for them.
