Fall in love with my teenage crush - tick Propose to him on a leap year - tick Receive a sad look and a whispered 'we can't' - tick, tick, tick. Austin Hart was my first everything–crush, love, and heartbreak. Seven years ago, he broke me to pieces and when my world imploded two years later, I stupidly fell back into his bed, seeking comfort only he could give. Accepting that we would never be together, I left Monroe and let him become a distant memory. Five years later an opportunity I can’t refuse forces me to make the long trip back to Monroe. And Monroe means seeing Austin again. I’d be lying if I said the years haven’t been good to him. He’s undeniably sexy, smoldering, and he still makes my heart flutter regardless of how much I want to dislike him. My body may still react, but my mind will never forget. Though I promised myself I’d never fall under his spell again, he has other plans— and the universe has even bigger ones.
