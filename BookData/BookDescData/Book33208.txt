She slowly begins to open up to the world outside. And maybe if she can get her popular jock neighbor Brad Kirkpatrick to be her homecoming date, her classmates will stop calling her a freak.In this heartwarming and humorous debut, Mallory discovers first love and the true meaning of home--just by taking one small step outside her house.
