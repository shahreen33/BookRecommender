Farley is a big fan of the extreme sport of bullriding. He follows the minor league riders from town to town, and he know their scores, their stats, and the brand of jeans they wear. Which is why he's so excited to meet one of the Morrell brothers at an autograph signing one day after an event.Chris and Cody Morrell are young, up and coming bullriders, brothers, and once in a great while, rivals at the game of love.

Will they be able to work it out so all three of them can be happy?
