But when Kelsey meets a charming book connoisseur and accepts his offering of a tarot card, she takes the first step toward her own risky addictions: the guy of her dreams, and his virtual escapes into her beloved storybooks. But the tarot cards canâ€™t guarantee a happy ending when the line between reality and fiction becomes dangerously blurred. **Get this seven-part serial of future gadgets, mind-bending virtual reality, and dangerously fun addictions in the complete Season One Box Set.**SEASON 1 EPISODE LIST: The Fool ~ Virtual Arcana #0The Magician ~ Virtual Arcana #1The High Priestess~ Virtual Arcana #2The Empress ~ Virtual Arcana #3The Emperor ~ Virtual Arcana #4The Hierophant ~ Virtual Arcana #5 The Lovers ~ Virtual Arcana #6
