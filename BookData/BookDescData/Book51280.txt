Dear Author,There’s a new boy in school, and he’s doing really well, academically and popularity-wise. He’s just been elected class president! Now all the girls want to go out with him even more, only a public coming out will save him, or will it? Now there are all these guys coming out of the woodwork, (even a teacher aide? who knows!) and he can’t catch a study break. All anyone seems to want to know is, who will get to plant the kiss that sticks?Photo Description: Two young men recline arm in arm against a striped cushion. They are wearing blue-striped shirts and black trousers. The boy on the left, the taller of the pair, is giving his companion a look of extreme dubiousness. The boy on the right’s smirk is pure mischief. Their shirts are somewhat rumpled. Hijinks have either ensued, are ensuing or are about to ensue.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "Love is an Open Road" event.
