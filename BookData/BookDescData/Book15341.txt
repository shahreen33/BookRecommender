“Throughout all my histories, I found no one I loved more than you... no one.”Those were some of Rhode’s last words to me. The last time he would pronounce his love. The last time I would see his face.It was the first time in 592 years I could take a breath. Lay in the sun. Taste.Rhode sacrificed himself so I, Lenah Beaudonte, could be human again.
