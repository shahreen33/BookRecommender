It's hard being a new mom on a barren, wintry planet. How about a mom...times two? Nora has to find a way to juggle babies, her mate, and friendships while catching the occasional nap. Can she get her groove back?   This is one of the Slice of Life Short Stories set in the ICE PLANET BARBARIANS series and does not stand alone. It should be read after BARBARIAN'S MATE.
