Their love is a legacy of broken hearts and shattered dreams. Can they find each other without losing themselves?  He is everything I want but know I can never have. Every fiber of my being has ached for Luke from the very first moment we met. However, with my parents’ legacy of toxic obsession woven into my DNA, I know love is pain and should be avoided at all costs. I'm unloved and unlovable. Still, in moments of weakness, I allow myself to imagine what it would be like if I was the kind of woman who deserved the love of a man like him.  She is hiding in plain sight, waiting for me to find her. Marnie has had my heart from day one, and always will. It's just a shame I couldn’t muster the words to tell her so when we first locked eyes. It's a failing I will live to regret for years to come. However, I'm determined to make things right, even if it takes me a lifetime. I need her to know she is enough. In fact, she is more than that. She is everything.
