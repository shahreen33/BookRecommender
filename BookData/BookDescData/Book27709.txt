The Vyrmin Will Rise…Hidden among us are the wicked. Their vile deeds have been retold from generation to generation down through the ages. They are hidden among us—evil men and women, always dangerous, always Wild. They are hidden among us—and they become beasts… during the Dark Times. The Blood Prince Awakens…One man is the key. He will renew the Hunt. But who is the Blood Prince? What horrific things happen when he enters the woods? Can anyone stop him? Will anyone even try? The Dark Times are Nigh…When the beasts that are men return to the Wild. When the beasts that are men return to the Hunt. When the Blood Prince takes the hand of his demon lover in the sky. When the screaming starts under the cold silver gaze of a pitiless, hungry moon. The Vyrmin Will Feed!
