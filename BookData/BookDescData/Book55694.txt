He’s got moves on — and off — the field.As receiver for the Miami Storm, Grady Murdock couldn’t be more satisfied with his professional life. Next up—his personal one. He’s a player on the field, not off, so when he claps eyes on Melinda at a Storm event, he’s neither surprised nor alarmed to find she triggers both lustful and long-term thoughts. Six years his senior, Mel isn’t so easily convinced.Independent, career-minded Melinda Shaw has singlehandedly built one of Miami’s premier event-management companies, but success hasn’t stopped her heart from shifting its focus to marriage and children. Still, she’s not about to burden a younger man with her fantasies of familial grandeur…until she does.Their combustible sexual chemistry notwithstanding, Grady still has to work overtime to convince Mel he wants her despite their impending parenthood, not because of it. It’ll take almost losing everything—and more than a few of Grady’s famous moves—to score Mel’s heart once and for all. **This title was previously published as His Daring Mistake.
