The Devil is part of the Cards of Love Collection. You do NOT need to read any other books in the collection in order to read The Devil.   They'll tell you I seduced them. Used my looks and body to lure them into my playground. They'll tell you I'm a sinner. A demon who held them captive with temptation and lust. They'll tell you I'm evil. A monster obsessed with the both of them. They'll tell you they made a deal with the devil. 
  What they won't tell you...is how much they liked it.
