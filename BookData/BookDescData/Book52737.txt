When Bina shifts to a school in Nauti-which is a long way from Koli, her village-she must daily cross the mountain, the river and walk through the jungle to get there. She is accompanied by Prakash, a boisterous twelve year old, and Sonu, her excitable younger brother. Together, they have many adventures-from helping old Mr Mani save his potatoes from porcupines to visiting the town of Tehri; and from escaping a landslide to encountering a leopard in the jungle.A touching and warm story by Ruskin Bond, this beautifully illustrated book showcases life in the hills and the wonders of friendship and bravery.
