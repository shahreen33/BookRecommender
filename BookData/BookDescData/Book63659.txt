You probably have a short list of people who impacted you during your childhood and teenage years. When those individuals intersected with your world, they became a new kind of leader for you.They were not new in the sense that they had never led anything before or they were radically different from other leaders.But they were new because â€¦ their influence gave you a new direction. their belief in you gave you a new sense of worth. they showed up at a new phase of your life, and their faith helped you solidify your faith in a new and authentic way.If someone showed up for you, then the question is, "How will you show up for someone else?"A New Kind of Leader explores seven beliefs and practical applications that will cause you to reimagine how you influence the next generation.Because when you hold the door open for a kid, you hold the door open for the future.For more resources like this, visit OrangeBooks.com.
