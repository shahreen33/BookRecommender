Del Bellator’s simple life of treasure hunting and demon slaying ended the moment she learned she was a Guardian between the Underworld and Earth. The only problem? She has no idea what that means and no control over the magic that could help her. Sure, she can turn into a Phantom and walk through walls, but in a world where demons can throw fireballs or strike her down with lightning, she needs control of some bigger magical weapons.To make matters worse, demons are now drawn to her like flies to honey. She’s a walking, talking demon magnet. To save her own life, she must master her powers. That means embarking on a treasure hunt unlike any she’s ever conducted. Fortunately, she has the help of Were-demon and Warden of the Underworld, Roarke Fallon, along with her FireSoul sisters, Cass and Nix. As the clock ticks down, she can only hope it will be enough.Demon Magic features kick butt heroines, a powerful hero, and otherworldly adventure.
