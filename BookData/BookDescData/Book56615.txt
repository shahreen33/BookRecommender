EDEN All I wanted was a fresh start in a new city...and a bartending job. I never intended to fall for the sexy, tattooed bar owner. Dark. Brooding. Emotionally unavailable. But Killian Vincent is a challenge I can’t seem to walk away from. He’s afraid that if I dig too deep, I won’t like what I find. But he’s wrong, and I’m determined to prove it.  KILLIAN Love can destroy a man. Bring him to his knees. That’s why I never let anyone get too close. Until Eden. Feisty. Stubborn. Irresistible. She’s on a mission to knock down my walls. Dig up truths better left buried. I need to convince her that walking away is the right choice…before it destroys us both.  *Beneath Your Beautiful is a standalone contemporary romance with no cliffhanger.
