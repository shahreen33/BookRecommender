Two teens discover the government is staging terrorist attacks to exploit and control the public in Tracy Lawson’s eerily believable YA debut novel. In an alternate reality version of 2034, terrorist attacks on American soil continue after the events of 9/11. The Office of Civilian Safety and Defense, created in 2019 to oversee domestic security, rises to unprecedented heights of power by exploiting the people’s overriding fear of terrorism. When Tommy Bailey and Careen Catecher meet during one of the bogus terrorist attacks, they discover the OCSD’s darkest secret: an antidote distributed by the government to “protect” people from the effects of imaginary toxins in the air is really being used to lull them into a state of submission. Tommy and Careen face a difficult choice: stay quiet about what they know—or risk their safety and anonymity to join an underground rebel group that’s determined to break the OCSD’s grip on the nation. Counteract explores the nature of power and the consequences and difficulties created when government attempts to control minute details of citizens’ daily existence. "Tracy Lawson's novel asks an even more disturbing question--what if the real culprit was someone or something we trusted? I thought The Hunger Games might be the Millennial generation's version of George Orwell's 1984. Now, I think Counteract and the Resistance Series are more primed to take that spot."--SR Staley, author of St. Nic, Inc., and the Tortuga Bay series.
