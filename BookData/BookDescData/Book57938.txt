Welcome to Low Town.Here, the criminal is king. The streets are filled with the screeching of fish hags, the cries of swindled merchants, the inviting murmurs of working girls. Here, people can disappear, and the lacklustre efforts of the guard ensure they are never found.Warden is an ex-soldier who has seen the worst men have to offer; now a narcotics dealer with a rich, bloody past and a way of inviting danger. You'd struggle to find someone with a soul as dark and troubled as his.But then a missing child, murdered and horribly mutilated, is discovered in an alley.And then another.With a mind as sharp as a blade and an old but powerful friend in the city, he's the only man with a hope of finding the killer.If the killer doesn't find him first.
