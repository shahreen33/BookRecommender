This volume is intended for software engineers and software project managers who want to use the object-oriented methods, processes and techniques. It shows how to use an object-oriented analysis and design methodology that synthesizes the best features of the most popular running methods, including Rumbaugh and Booch. The text outlines the entire object-oriented software development process from developing a requirements document, through an analysis phase, developing object-oriented models, mapping design models onto implementation language constructs, comparing some of the most widely-used analysis and design methods and presenting methods for achieving software reuse and management goals.
