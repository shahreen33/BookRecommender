Jake has a secret that could cost him everything he’s worked hard for, including his job. Will he risk everything for Jenny? Redemption, justice, and vengeance. Will Jenny and the men in her life be able to see where one ends and another begins? It’s a fine line between right and wrong. How far will someone go to protect the person they love? How much are they willing to risk?Revised edition: Previously published as A Summer Love, part of the Seasons of Love series. This edition of A Deadly Obsession includes editorial revisions
