LIFE ON MARS IS PRETTY GOOD–EXCEPT FOR THE NO PETS POLICY Like most Martians in the year 2184, Miley McMeteor has a way around the system. She keeps her dog Disco hidden. But when she loses him on spring break, she learns her pet is only the beginning of the secrets on her home planet. Pursuing her furry friend across a terraformed landscape, Miley faces the usual obstacles of a twelve year old on Mars: snooping neighbors, a deadly atmosphere, and a society based on corporations owning absolutely everything—even her. Her journal, Miley McMeteor and the Lost Dog On Mars, is young adult science fiction for interplanetary dreamers of all ages.
