Valérie and Jake were always good friends until they discovered that Jake had been affected by the Parum est virus, also called the short man virus. Stuck at a height below three feet wasn’t bad enough but Valérie seemed to be the opposite, growing to a height of six feet and five inches. As his fear of the giant world around him increased, Jake locked himself in as a recluse where he became a successful billionaire financial advisor. What Jake didn’t know was that though he had not seen her face to face for years, Valérie never forgot him and was working on a formula to control height. When he decided to move away to a private island to live around, Jake’s younger sister who was a champion of the couple being together, informed Valérie of Jake’s pending departure. Will Valérie be able to make the serum that will alter their heights and cure Jake from his fear of the giant world? Is there any hope for them in a world where to be different is to be ridiculed? Short on Love is an erotica novella with steamy and explicit scenes between a couple who are opposite in height.
