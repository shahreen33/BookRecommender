 Fact #257 - Allie Sai should have been named "Unlucky."It made complete sense that the girl terrified of flying and aliens would be drafted for colonization of an alien planet. Right? Right??She had one choice. Desertion. But again... Unlucky.A failed escape attempt leaves her chained to an airship chair with nothing but her bag, a vial of her family's super moonshine, and her anxiety for company (so much fun). Numbing her fear seemed like a brilliant idea - until pirates attack her ship looking for goods of the female variety.Looks like she'll have to save herself, but luck was never on her side. Maybe one day that would change, and her pirate would turn into a prince, but not today. Today, she cursed her bootlegging family's moonshine.It was just one sip... maybe two.
