There once was a boy, and I loved him.Logan Francis Silverstone was the complete opposite of me. I danced while he stood still. He was quiet, and I was always running my mouth. He struggled to find a smile while I refused to frown. The night I saw the darkness that truly lived inside of him, I couldn’t look away.We were broken together, yet somehow whole. We were wrong together, but always right. We were the stars that burned across the night sky, searching for a wish, praying for better tomorrows.Until the day I lost him. He threw us away with one hasty decision—a decision that changed us forever.There once was a boy, and I loved him.And for a few breaths, a few whispers, a few moments,  I think he loved me, too.
