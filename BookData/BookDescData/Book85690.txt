 She thinks she’s broken and I’m the one to fix her.  As an ex-Navy SEAL there are a few guarantees in life. Avoiding relationships is one of them. Dealing with PTSD is another. So when I come across the Reckless Bastards MC, it’s perfect for a man like me. Last thing I expect is to encounter Jana Carter at a painting class. Don’t ask why I was there. I can hardly keep my eyes off of her. She’s a shy, sultry vixen, and she grabs a hold of me so hard, I can’t let go. But, I don’t expect to fall for any women—much less find one who can deal with me and my messed up past. Just when I thought I’d built strong walls around my heart, I discover her walls are reinforced with steel. She’s so pure, so innocent—and hard. Against all the odds, I want her. I’ll do anything to have her, to make her mine.  Love filthy talking bikers who can drop your panties with just a whisper? You got it! Beautifully Broken is a full-length standalone romance with no cheating, no cliffhangers and a guaranteed happily ever after!
