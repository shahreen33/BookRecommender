Henslin's best-selling brief paperback text shares the excitement of sociology–its acclaimed “down-to-earth” approach and personal writing style highlight the sociology of everyday life and its relevance to students' lives. This text is a brief version of the highly regarded hardcover introductory text, Sociology: A Down-to-Earth Approach, 7/e. The essential 15 chapters cover all of the topics in the 22-chapter text, and retain the dual emphases on micro and macro (individual and structural) sociology. James Henslin has a unique ability to engage students without talking down to them or sacrificing content. With wit, personal reflection, and illuminating examples, he shares with readers a passion for sociology unmatched by any other introductory text.
