  "Once the evening's entertainment was over the Minotaur, as naked as Nature intended, clumped into Pablo Zapata's bar..."
A baby with a passion for theoretical physics...A winged nymph who exacts terrible revenge...A stolen coin that releases a wish-granting genie...And where else would you see Ginger Rogers learning the Ali shuffle, or a humble fisherman making friends with Poseidon?Charlatans and shapeshifters, lovers and leprechauns, ghosts and office creeps are just some of the characters that Kevin Ansbro brings to life in this volume of short stories. His tales span the globe and range from the wickedly funny to the sad and deeply unnerving. With his perceptive take on human failings, his vivid imagination and his glorious grasp of language, Ansbro's thought-provoking stories will stay with you long after you turn the final page."Every time Kevin writes a new book I know I have a good reason to celebrate. Totally absorbing, hilariously funny and profoundly moving - this is an author you shouldn't miss." Karen Holmes
