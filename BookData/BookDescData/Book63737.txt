In Fight, a five-session, video-based small group Bible study, pastor and bestselling author Craig Groeschel explores the life of Samson, helping you uncover who you really are---a man created with a warrior's heart in the image of God---and how to stand up and fight for what's right. Find the strength to fight the battles you know you need to fight---the ones that determine the state of your heart, the quality of your marriage, and the spiritual health of your family. The battles that make you dependent on God as the source of your strength. The battles that make you come alive. Craig looks at the life of Samson, showing how much we have in common with this guy. Things didn't work out so well for him in the end. But by looking at his life, you'll learn how to defeat the demons that make strong men weak. You'll become who God made you to be---a man who knows how to fight for what's right. Learn how to fight with faith, with prayer, and with the Word of God. Then, when your enemy begins to attack, fight for the righteous cause that God gave you. Draw a line in the sand. Make your enemy pay. Make sure he gets the message. Don't cross a warrior. Don't mess with this man of God. Come out fighting. And don't show up for this fight unarmed. Use the weapons God gave you, and you'll win. Can you feel it? It's inside you. It's time to fight like a man. Use this study guide to further explore the teaching found in the Fight video.
