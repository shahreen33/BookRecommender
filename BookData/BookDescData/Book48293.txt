They say New York City is the Devil’s Playground.They’re wrong.This city belongs to me.And so does Aislinn Granville. She is a pampered politician’s daughter.A decorative ornament, raised to smile and nod and do what she’s told.Except… she doesn’t. Not with me. Ever.In this city full of thugs and thieves, I’ve kept Aislinn safe.From my enemies.From me.
  
    Until now.
