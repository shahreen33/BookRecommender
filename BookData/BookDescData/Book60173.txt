#1 New York Times–bestselling author Jan Karon returns—with the story readers have been waiting for.   Over the course of ten Mitford novels, fans have kept a special place in their hearts for Dooley Kavanagh, first seen in At Home in Mitford as a barefoot, freckle-faced boy in filthy overalls.   Now, Father Tim Kavanagh’s adopted son has graduated from vet school and opened his own animal clinic. Since money will be tight for a while, maybe he and Lace Harper, his once and future soul mate, should keep their wedding simple.   So the plan is to eliminate the cost of catering and do potluck. Ought to be fun.   An old friend offers to bring his well-known country band. Gratis.   And once mucked out, the barn works as a perfect venue for seating family and friends. Piece of cake, right?   In Come Rain or Come Shine, Jan Karon delivers the wedding that millions of Mitford fans have waited for. It’s a June day in the mountains, with more than a few creatures great and small, and you’re invited—because you’re family.   By the way, it’s a pretty casual affair, so come as you are and remember to bring a tissue or two. After all, what’s a good wedding without a good cry?
