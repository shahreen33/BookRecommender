Sinner is the first book in the Reed Security Series. It is preceded by the series For The Love Of A Good Woman, and it is recommended that the series be read in order, as characters from the first appear in the second.Cara I've been broken for six years. I only started leaving my house three years ago, but I waited too long and now I'm so screwed up that I can barely stand to be around other people without freaking out. When a handsome, strong man with gorgeous eyes comes to my rescue twice, my therapist suggests he become a therapy buddy of sorts to help me. His jovial personality sets me at ease and he really does start to help me heal, but my untrustworthy nature takes over and could ruin the best thing that has ever happened to me.Sinner Everyone calls me Sinner because of my reputation with the ladies. I was in Special Forces until a few years ago and now I work for Reed Security. I love my job, but it's hard on relationships, which is why I don't try. Until her. Everyone sees her as damaged, but I see her spirit, her fight. I can't seem to get enough of her, but when my relationship with her threatens my job, I'm forced to choose which I want more. I just hope I chose right.
