God’s plan has never been to help believers avoid pain. In fact, He uses difficult seasons and relationships to propel His children toward their destiny. The healing process from emotional and spiritual wounds is a journey that prepares Christians to live powerful lives, fully trusting the God who has freed them from the past.Jason Vallotton thought his world was burning down around him when he found out that his wife, Heather, was having an affair and planned to leave him and their children. Using his own story as a poignant, evocative illustration of God’s grace and healing, Jason invites readers to reframe their understanding of redemption. With his dad, Kris Vallotton, Jason shows believers how they can steward the hardest times and deepest pain in their lives and allow God to use them to lay a foundation for complete restoration and empowerment for the future. While it may be hard to see emotional wounds as gifts when they still hurt so deeply, those who read The Supernatural Power of Forgiveness will discover that God can not only heal their wounds, but He can also use the process of healing to equip them for whole, fulfilled and powerful lives.
