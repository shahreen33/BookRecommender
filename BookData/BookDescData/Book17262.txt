Five stories of happiness...Five exercises...Five ways to find the elusive 'happy'... Will Jelbert had what many people would consider the ideal life: a well paying job, a beautiful wife and a great apartment, but he still wasn't happy. One day the life he knew came to an abrupt end when he was thrown from his bike, face first into the sidewalk of a Sydney street. After a year in recovery and a divorce, Jelbert decided to dedicate the next three years to a happiness psychology research. The result: The Happiness Animal. The world's first dedicated exercise guide to happiness condenses the latest applied positive psychology research into a guide to five muscles. For each muscle, Jelbert first narrates his own personal struggle, and then provides five simple exercises that he uses to find the elusive 'happy' in his everyday life.* * * * * "Jelbert has an incredible ability to say things that are logical and obvious, although without somebody pointing them out in the clear way he has done, most of us don't ever think them. He identifies the power of awareness, but before I read his book I was not even aware of many of my own thoughts''  - Danny Lawrence, BBC * * * * * "Jelbert has captured an immense understanding of the inner workings of society's struggle to find happiness with a whole hearted and honest truth. The exercises explained are an excellent route back to the inner being of happiness. A must read for everyone!" - Sadie Oliver, LIFE magazine * * * * * "Jelbert writes with honesty, authenticity and animation that allows the words on each page to come alive and live within the reader" - Lucy Proud, The Art of Being
