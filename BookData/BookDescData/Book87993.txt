I vow to diethat you might look my way.See how many have died like me in the bazaar of love.Amir Khusrau—poet, courtier, mystic, musician—straddled the worlds of politics and religion and helped forge a distinctive synthesis of Muslim and Hindu cultures. His poetry in Persian appealed equally to the Delhi sultans and to his Sufi sheikh, Nizamuddin Auliya. It was appreciated not only in India, where his Hindavi poetry has survived through a lively oral tradition, but also across a cosmopolitan Persianate world that stretched from Turkey to Bengal. Khusrau's poetry has thrived for centuries and continues to be read and recited to this day. But despite his vast literary output, there is a dearth of translations of his work. In the Bazaar of Love offers new translations of Khusrau's poems in Persian and Hindavi, many of which are being translated into English for the first time. Paul Losensky's translations of Khusrau's ghazals, including his mystical and romantic poems, comprise fresh renditions of old favourites while also bringing to light several little- known works. Sunil Sharma brings us many of Khusrau's short poems, including those belonging to the qawwali repertoire, as well as a mixed prose-and-verse narration 'The Romance of Duval Rani and Khizr Khan'.The first comprehensive selection of Amir Khusrau’s poetry, In the Bazaar of Love covers a wide range of genre and forms, evoking the magic of one of the best-loved poets of the Indian subcontinent.About the AuthorPaul Losensky is associate professor at Indiana University, Bloomington, where he teaches translation studies, and Persian language and literature.Sunil Sharma teaches Persian and Indian literatures at Boston University.
