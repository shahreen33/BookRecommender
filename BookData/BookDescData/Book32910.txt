The One didn’t exist.Then I met Meadow.The band's honorary little sister was off-limits. Too late for that. She says we’re “nothing serious,” but she’s gotten under my skin and I can’t stop thinking about her. And when I touch her, I know we’re meant to be.Happy Endings don’t exist.Not even with Ridge.My big plans never included falling for a rock star. Too soon for that. He wants to make us a “thing,” and I can’t deny our chemistry is combustible. His persistence is wearing me down, making his proposition hard to resist. If true love only exists in fairy tales, why am I beginning to believe that Ridge just might be my happily ever after?#SavetheDate #CominginSeptember #TheCrowBrothers #Rockstarromance #secondchance
