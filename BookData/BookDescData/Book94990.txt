No matter where you are in the world, there is a story that everyone knows. In every town, every village, there is a house no one sets foot in; a specter in the woods that parents warn their children of; a local landmark whose history is stained with death. Shadows at the Door brings the whispered, hand-me-down horrors of thirteen such places together, to entertain and unsettle. The anthology will immerse you in the eerie locales of Durham, Norfolk, Derbyshire, Rugby, the Scottish Highlands, Toronto, Pittsburgh, New York, Rural Yorkshire, Lake Superior, Canterbury and Melbourne, so you can be scared all around the globe.
