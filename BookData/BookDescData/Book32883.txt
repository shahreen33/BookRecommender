Dare Marquis is a bad boy rock star with a body to match. Cocky.Devilish good looks.A voice that commands attention. A night with him and no strings attached is just what I need. But he makes it impossible to not want more when he runs his hand through his dark, wild hair and smiles. One he only shares with me. Weatherly Beck is an angel with a body made for sin. Whip-smart.Drop dead gorgeous.Too good for any guy from the east side. Her life is planned out, so I don’t have a right to step in and mess up her future. But when I look into her sapphire blue eyes and taste the innocence on her lips, I know we’re meant to be more than a one-night stand. I want her to take a chance on me, to take a chance on us. She may not be a damsel in distress, but I Dare her to let me be her Hero.
