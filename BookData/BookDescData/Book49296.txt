Bridget never expected to see Alex Ross again after her father stole from the Ross family. When Alex contacts Bridget, it isn’t to catch up. He needs her help!  Bridget Boggs carries a lot of guilt over what happened to Alex Ross and his family. She had been good friends with the Ross boys until her greedy father lost part of the Ross family’s savings in a pyramid scheme. He went to jail, and Bridget and her family changed their names and went into hiding.  Bridget imagines that Alex and his brothers feel just as betrayed as she does by her father’s criminal acts. When she meets Alex again as a young hacker and the owner of White Hat Security, he has something more important to talk about than her father’s transgressions. A million dollars has been stolen from his company, and Alex needs Bridget’s help to track down the culprit.  Alex has certainly grown up since they last met. The man looks like a Greek god, and Bridget can’t help but be attracted to him. As she digs deeper into the theft from Ross Enterprises, Bridget doesn’t need any more distractions. This is a more dangerous job than either Bridget or Alex expected. The thief is willing to go to incredible lengths to evade the police, and the two amateur sleuths may find themselves caught in the crossfire.
