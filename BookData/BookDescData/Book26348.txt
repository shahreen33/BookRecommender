STACY  Meeting Cade Matthews changed my life in so many ways. He's sweet, funny, very handsome, and as loyal as they come. He's been more patient with me than I ever thought a person would be.  When things turn my whole world upside down, he is there to put them right again, if I'd only let him. I can't let him see what keeps me up at night because I know that once I do, he'll never look at me the same way again.  I believe in my heart that he is the only one who can put my pieces back together, but will entrusting Cade with all of me heal or break me completely?
