To retrieve the Iliad's' energy, Alice Oswald has stripped away its story and her account focuses by turns on Homer's extended similes and on the brief biographies of the minor war-dead, most of whom are little more than names, but each of whom lives and dies unforgettably - and unforgotten - in the copiousness of Homer's glance. Alice Oswald has won several literary awards.
