The first—and definitive—Polish vegetarian cookbook, with over 80 recipes from a Saveur award winner Most people associate Polish cuisine with rich, heavy meats such as kielbasa. But in Fresh from Poland, Michał Korkosz reveals a whole new side of his beloved culinary heritage—showcasing beautiful fruits, vegetables, grains, and herbs while still evoking the traditional food of his mother and grandmother. Korkosz’s passion for food shines through in his award-winning photographs. Here is vegetable-forward comfort food for every occasion: Brown Butter Scrambled Eggs; Buckwheat Blini with Sour Cream; Sourdough Rye with Cultured Kefir Butter; Chilled Beet Soup with Cucumber, Radish, and Dill; Polish Cheesecake, and (of course) sweet and savory pierogi of every kind. Polish cuisine has never been more vibrant—or delicious.
