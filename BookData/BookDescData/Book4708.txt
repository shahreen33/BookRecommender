This is described as a Phoetry Book, and Phoetry is defined as a fusion of Poetry and Photography. Both Clive Blake, the poet, and Chris Robbins, the photographer, grew up on Cornish family farms. Their love of Cornwall and the natural environment is self-evident in both the poems and the images. Both have also had to cope with disabilities, but this seems to intensify their creativity rather than hinder it. Adrian Blake, the graphic designer, has used his design skills to sympathetically and very effectively pull the whole thing together. This has ensured that the whole book has a very contemporary and pleasing feel to it. The subject matter is wide and varied, and is by no means limited to Cornwall's borders. Emotions are stretched in all directions, but the Cornish dry-wit, humour and general sense of fun is never far away. Clive's poetry has been described as user-friendly and he has been described as a peoples-poet, since his poetry is very easy to read and understand. Despite this he still manages to convey a very powerful and compelling message. This book does not allow normal conventions to restrict it. The book starts with The End, allows some of its text to slope at gravity defying angles and with the poem Happiless, boasts the shortest published poem in the world. Packed with sixty poems accompanied by sixty stunning images, everyone who reads it seems to have their own particular favourites. This is a book which really does have something for everyone.
