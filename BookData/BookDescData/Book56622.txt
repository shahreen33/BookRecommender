I like to think of myself as the good guy.The kind of man that will take a beating or a bullet for my brothers and not think twice about it. But anyone that knows my story has only seen the tip of the proverbial iceberg and my intentions sometimes resemble the Titanic.It's when I lose control.I do my best to love and respect everyone because some people need it more than othersâ€”even the ones that don't deserve it.My name is Gareth Bresett and the only thing that matters to me in this world is Bentlee Gains. I'll do everything I can to keep her safe from every evil in this world, including myself.Because while I like to think that I'm the good guy, I find more pleasure in taking out a mark than I do being in her arms.Regardless of who that mark happens to be.
