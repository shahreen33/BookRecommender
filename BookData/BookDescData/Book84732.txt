In the aftermath of Taylor’s death, all Emily wants to do is forget that cancer ever existed. She feels like she has done her duty both to Taylor and Jordan, even going so far as to ride and compete on Taylor’s horse so that the eventer could find a new home, bringing the dying woman into her house and helping to take care of her. Now she just wants to get back to riding her own horses and doing what she loves, show jumping.  But even in death, Taylor seems to want to interfere. She has left letters with her lawyer for both Jordan and Emily, letters that Emily is afraid will drive a wedge between the two of them and she wants to talk to Jordan about it only he doesn’t want to talk to anyone. He’s shut himself off from the world and Emily doesn’t know how to bring him back. She wants to give him space but she also knows that too much space might mean she loses her best friend forever.  And with the summer circuit underway, Emily is ready to get back on her own horses and start winning again. She wants to see her riding friends and have some fun after a depressing month that she is happy to leave behind. Only it feels wrong to have fun when Jordan is still so sad and competition on the summer circuit is fierce. What used to be a laid back and fun series has now become one for serious competitors and that means Emily will not only have to face off against people like Jess and Amber but she’ll be competing against her friends too all while trying to figure out if she should carry on things with Jordan or cut her ties with him altogether, even though it would break her heart.
