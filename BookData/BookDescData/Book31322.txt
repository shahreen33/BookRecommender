Lost. Stolen. Forgotten… until the Alphabits step in.  A Team A.L.P.H.A. spinoff series.  Sam Remington, former leader of Team Beta, has a new dream: to lead a team whose sole purpose is to protect those most vulnerable—shifter pups.  His new mate, Dean, shares his passion. As a child counselor, Dean is all too familiar with the darker side of the world when it comes to pups. If Sam can rescue them, Dean will do his best to help fix them.  Sanctioned by Team Alpha’s bossman, the great Ray Perkins himself, Alphabits is Sam’s baby. This new hand-picked team consists of five highly-trained wolf alphas—and one bumbling bear who couldn’t take a hint. As always with a new team, personalities will clash. But at the end of the day, they all share a common goal help lost, missing, and hurting children—starting with the needy wolf pup who lives across the street from Sam and Dean.  The Alphabits aren’t vigilantes. These former soldiers and officers of the law have to do things by the book—even when it tears them apart to do so. But once all their ducks are in a row, the bad guys had better beware! You do not want this team of protective alphas on your tail.  This is the first in a new series in the Team A.L.P.H.A. world, but can definitely be read as a stand-alone novel. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and some violence. Prepare your box of tissues and lock up your heart, because this book contains a fluffy little wolf pup who’s about to steal it away. HEA definitely included, intended for 18+ readers only. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown?
