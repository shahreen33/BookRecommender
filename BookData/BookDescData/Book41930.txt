My best friend is freaking awesome.But don't just take my word for it. Consider all his attributes.First, let's start with the obvious one.Size.He has this one fantastic bone in his body. It's bigger than other guys'. It's thicker, longer, more powerful.C'mon. I'm talking about his funny bone.Spencer Holiday makes me laugh like no one ever has. Sarcastic, self-deprecating, and always at attention with a joke--that's him.Except, it's no joke when he asks me to be his fake fiance√© for a week.The trouble is I'm already falling for him before we even start.Oops.
