All that matters to 15-year-Old Nobara Sumiyoshi is volleyball; she's an awesome vollyball player with big-time ambitions. But sometimes it seems like a girl just can't get a break in the competitive world of high school volleyball. Nobara's family wants her to inherit the role of mistress, serving rich patrons at her family's old-fashioned Japanese restaurant. No thanks! When Nobara joins Crimson Field High school, known for its top-notch volleyball team, it turns out that her mother will stoop to dirty tricks to keep her off the court. With assistance from her feisty Aunt Momoko, who's got some connections at Crimson Field, Nobara decides to start playing offense.
