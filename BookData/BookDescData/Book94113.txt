Have you ever met a truly good person? A person who cannot only, "Talk the talk" but, "Walk the walk?" I.D. Back was such a person. Born poor in the mountains of Southeastern Kentucky, he never accumulated wealth and material riches in life. He did, however, through his willingness to be used by the Lord in any way that He saw fitting, live to become one of the most influential ministers in Kentucky. This book documents the events of his life - from his childhood days spent under the eyes of a watchful, Christian mother- to his sinful days of youth, when he engaged in drinking and mocking the very preachers who he would one day preach alongside - to his acquisition of salvation and his travels as an Old Regular Baptist minister. With anecdotes that are both humorous and touching, this book is sure to bring tears of emotion (both happy and sad), to the reader.
