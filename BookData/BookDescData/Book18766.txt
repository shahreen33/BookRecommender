Every year, young men come from all over the world to join the IDF and fight for Israel. They leave everything behind and becoming what known as lone soldiers.Tom, a young man from Kansas, has traveled to Israel to fight for his people. He came to fight, He came to escape. Dan Green has it all. He owns Greentech technologies, lives in a small mention near Tel Aviv, and looks like a movie star. But his blue eyes, hiding a storm that threatens to smash him. The end of his marriage to Lena, his memories of his late father, his disappointment with himself and his internal wars, pushing him towards the edge. Dan and Tom cross paths at a crucial point in their lives. None of them thought that what began as volunteering mission, will change everything they thought they knew. This is a journey of exploration and discovery. About asking the right questions and finding the answers. In traffic jams of Ayalon Highway, the bustle of the city, on the battlefield, and deep in their dreams. Together they peel layers of pain, and find themselves.
