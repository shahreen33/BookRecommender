In the first title story, the supremely talented (especially with women) and outrageous Carlos Nine gives us the complete low-down on the sexy and dangerous killer Alexandra that the young Dungeon-keeper fell for so heavily. In the second, Killoffer (“676 Apparitions of Killoffer”) also focuses on a spicy girl, daughter of a prominent character.
