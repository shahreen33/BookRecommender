New York Times best-selling writer Jeff Lemire (The Valiant, Descender) and red-hot rising star Mico Suayan (Harbinger, Moon Knight) deliver an all-new ongoing series for Valiant’s most unrelenting hero!Bloodshot’s nanites made him a nearly unstoppable killing machine.

Now, Bloodshot is a shadow of his former self. He lives in self-imposed exile, reeling from the consequences of his past life and the recent events that nearly drove him mad. But when a rash of shootings by gunmen who appear to look just like Bloodshot begin, his guilt will send him on a mission to stop the killers, even if it means diving head-long into the violence that nearly destroyed him.Start reading here as visionary creators Jeff Lemire and Mico Suayan kick-off a brand-new beginning for the cutting-edge commando called Bloodshot…and plunge him to his darkest, bloodiest, most mind-bending depths yet!Collecting: Bloodshot Reborn 1–5
