Winslow Remington Houdstooth, notorious outlaw, handsomest heartbreaker in the American South, has just finished a lucrative job, but he's faced with a hippo-sized problem that would test even the most seasoned of hoppers. "Worth Her Weight in Gold" is another slyly funny, raucous adventure in the alternate America of Sarah Gailey's River of Teeth and Taste of Marrow.
