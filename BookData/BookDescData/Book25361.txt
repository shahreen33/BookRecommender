Listening to, or participating in, the singing of Handel's Messiah is now as much a part of Christmas celebrations as the buying of gifts. And that experience will be richer yet for people who realize the series of miracles that were required to bring this oratorio into being. Altogether, Handel composed as much music as the combined works of Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig Beethoven. Much of his music still lives to glorify the God whom Handel served with his great talent.
