 I can melt the snow with one look and make Mother Nature wish she could change her panties.  Carson I’ve been sitting on the bench for longer than I care to admit. A fluke accident throws me into the playoff game as starting quarterback in the biggest blizzard of the year. The weight of the team going to the Super bowl falls on my shoulders. I don’t mind, they’re broad—and I’ve carried a lot worse. I don’t have time for distractions. But when Gwen crosses my path, I lose track of all the x’s and o’s bouncing around my head. All I can think about is getting my hands on her sexy curves. She’s irresistible. I want her. At the games, in my arms—and in my bed.  Gwen Years of busting my ass have finally paid off. I’m one envelope away from practicing law. When Carson comes into my aunt’s diner one snowy night, I can’t help but wonder what I missed out on all those years buried under a pile of textbooks. Aunt Maggie says he’s a CIA spy, but it turns out he’s a third-string quarterback. He’s broad-shouldered, charming, and a true gentleman. But underneath that nice guy facade, there’s something dark about him, and I’m not sure I want to know. Not when I’m days away from chasing down the case that could make or break my career.  I don’t have time for games—much less football games—and I sure don’t have anything in common with the people who do. Time or no time—I can’t stay away from Carson and with each passing day, I get closer and closer to finding out the secrets he's carrying with him. Will I be able to handle the truth when it finally comes to light?  Show Time is a full-length bad boy football romance with a Happily Ever After. No cliffhanger and no cheating. Intended for readers 18+ due to Kindle-melting scenes and other mature content.
