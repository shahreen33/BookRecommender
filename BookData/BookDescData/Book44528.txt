The Baron ran a gambling island off the Texas coast in the Gulf’s blue waters. To Parker, it was just a floating crap game with class. To the Big Boys, it was competition they couldn’t stomach. They wanted a specialist to rob the Baron blind, pluck him like a chicken, and burn this paradise island into the sea. That’s why they sent for Parker. His price was 200 grand in cash and Crystal — a beautiful little blonde. So the pot was sweet, but the heist soon had so many twists it smelled like a brand-new lemon — and Parker knew the line between success and failure on this score would be exactly the length of the barrel of a .38.
