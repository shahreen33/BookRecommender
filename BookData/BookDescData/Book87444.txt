The great hunt had begun, and the hevelens were the prey. When would it end, and how? Impossible to predict…With the malian army defeated, the forces of Destruction are laying siege to the Gate of the Canyons and spreading out over the Windy Steppes. For every child of the wind or the water captured and hurled into the Great Rift, a Nylev, a fire-being, is born. Pelmen, Laneth, Lominan and Elisan-Finella must convince the krongos to join them in their desperate struggle, but only a handful of the mineral creatures remain, and Valshhyk, the Immolated, seems unstoppable…The Flames of the Immolated is the third and final book of the Ardalia trilogy. It includes a map of Ardalia and a glossary, with a description of the various creatures peculiar to its universe, and suggestions for the pronunciation of some words.
