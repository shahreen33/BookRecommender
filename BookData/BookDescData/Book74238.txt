Young witch Salem Hyde is stubborn, impulsive, and loves flying. Her cat companion, Whammy, is nervous, careful, and loves staying on the ground. Somehow, though, they’re best friends. In this second book in the series, Salem is invited to a birthday party, and she wants to make sure everything goes perfectly. But from the invitations to the presents, party games, and spells gone awry, nothing happens exactly the way it should, and she’ll need Whammy’s help to sort it all out.
  Praise for The Misadventures of Salem Hyde: Book Two
 "Cammuso’s lively art conveys wonderful expressions with just a few strokes, and young readers will enjoy the humor of Salem’s predicaments. Salem manages to give Edgar a memorable birthday party, and readers a very fun book." --Booklist "With lots of laughs and lots of heart, this sophomore offering doesn’t disappoint." --Kirkus Reviews "Salem Hyde is a whimsical character. The bright two-color pink and black illustrations convey the spunky heroine’s energy. Dark shadows lend volume and height where needed. Frames, wide and magnified in varying degrees, are filled with action and high jinks." --School Library Journal
