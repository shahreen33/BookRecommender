My body wants a mate. But I sure wasn't counting on three…  It's the most embarrassing time of any female shifter's life. My body is desperate to be mated, and it's willing to do whatever it has to to get the job done.  I have no home to go to, no place on this earth that feels safe.  Intent on riding out my mating season alone, I travel into the wilderness, when a freak blizzard leaves me stranded.  Of course, the only house around for miles is home to three ripped, wolf-shifter guys. They take me in—no strings attached.  In any normal situation, they'd be fighting each other for the right to claim me. But this isn't normal.  These men take their pack-bond seriously, and they share everything. If I let them, they'll share me.  Being so close to them as my season approaches is too much for me to bear. I need their hands on my skin, their touch. I beg them to help me scratch my itch and soothe my ache.  Only they don't just want to sleep with me. They want to take me as their lover. Their mate.  They want to keep me—for life.   Snowed In With The Pack is a steamy reverse harem paranormal romance, with dirty language and hot wolf-shifter alpha males. It is only recommended for readers 18+.  It is 22,000 words, and has a guaranteed happy ending.
