Evolution of a Killer is your introduction to Lazarus Solaris, a man who dwells in two separate worlds. In the underworld as well as U.S. intelligence agencies, he is a world class assassin - known only as "The Chameleon"; renowned for his ability to remain anonymous even after 20 years of crafting his trade.  To the rest of the world, Lazarus is known as the founder of "The Second Chance Foundation", known for it's scholarships for at risk teens as well as former felons.  In Evolution of a Killer “The Chameleon” is contracted by a Texas Banker with connections to a notorious drug kingpin referred to as"El Corazon"; Spanish for "The Heart". The contract is for Lazarus to make the banker disappear without a trace - along with millions of Los Zapatos de la Muerte Cartel, (The Shoes of Death). Lazarus, aided by the NSA and others deal with the Drug Lord while fulfilling the contract for the Texas Banker, Enrique Garza. An intricate solution develops which eventually leads to a dramatic culmination in Argentina.  While working the contract, Lazarus meets Angelique Shaloub - wife of the banker - and an unexpected romance begins to blossom between them; complicating The Chameleon's task when Angelique is dragged into the middle of the conflict by El Corazon, to be used as leverage against the banker.  As the story unfolds, you will be taken back in time - learning what changed the 7 year old son of an immigrant farmer into the killer he became. A killer as capable of random acts of kindness as he is violence. An enigma even to his closest friend, Psychologist Dr. Helen Hudson, who refers to him as "a Sociopath with the tattered remnants of a conscience."  Evolution of a Killer is only the beginning in many ways, changing the life of Lazarus Solaris and others forever.
