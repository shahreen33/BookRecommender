  Shirley F'N Lyle: VIVA the REVOLUTION

  Shirley Lyle hooks for a living. She's a big girl who keeps her profile low. But when a drug lord and his son toss her trailer, she adds a couple letters to her name. Now she's killed the drug lord's son and two meth zombies. Fed up, ready to set fire to her past, her job-and her trailer-she's dragged back into the role she's forsworn by a man who presses her buttons with a hammer. Shirley realizes she'll never be more than a four hundred pound hooker. But when her partner-in-revolution, Ulyana the Ukrainian stripper disappears, her car empty and bullet holes in the glass, Shirley reaches deep, finds her sass, puts flame to fuse. Who took Ulyana?The Russian mob?The man who beat Shirley down?The 83 year old drug lord who refuses to die?When all your life you've been one thing, but your survival-and your friend's-demand you be the hero...You put on the F'N cape. Prepare yourself for a battle of good and evil unlike any you've seen. With rave reviews from Publishers Weekly (starred review and best of the week), IndieNext List, Kirkus, BlueInk Review, Foreword Reviews, San Francisco Book Review, Seattle Book Review, Manhattan Book Review, Indie Reader and more, if you haven't read Clayton Lindemuth's unique brand of literary noir, what are you waiting for?
