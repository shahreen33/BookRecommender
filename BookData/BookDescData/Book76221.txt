Eliza: My life is perfect. I have a luxurious apartment and my dream job. I also have a sister willing to sign me up for a dating app against my better judgment. I promise her one week before the app is deleted forever. All it takes is one week before I’m matched with two amazing men and my perfect life becomes a perfect disaster. Murphy: I needed a drastic change and I got it. My move from the middle of nowhere to the city lands me in a classy part of town with an upscale job. All I need is a personal life to match. So, I join the masses and download an app.A match with the woman of my dreams has me considering a future. The only problem is that I’m not the only one wanting to make her mine. After all, 425 Madison is the perfect place to fall in love!
