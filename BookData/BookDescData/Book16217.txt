Book 1 in the rockstar series, Lost in Oblivion. Music saved him, but now it's keeping him from the only woman he craves... Brawny bassist Deacon McCoy pulled himself up from nothing and is living the dream now that his band Oblivion is opening for his idols on their first tour. He's frustrated at changes in the band's management, but one thing takes all the tension away—his fascination with the deliciously cute tour chef, Harper Pruitt. Born to roadie parents, Harper has has no patience for most rockstars’ love 'em and leave 'em ways. But when it comes to falling into Demon Deacon's bed—or against the wall, or on the golf course in a rainstorm—she doesn't seem to have any self-control. Hot nights with a naughty, inventive rockstar are one thing, but more isn't on the playlist. Until Deacon's dream with his best friends starts turning into a nightmare, and Harper begins to see the real man behind the façade. Except Harper has her own dreams to chase, even if what she’s started with Deacon might be the most important one of all. **This book is a standalone title in the Lost in Oblivion series.**
