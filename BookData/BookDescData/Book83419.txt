Chung is a consummate Samurai. Four renegade horseman killed his mother and father and entire village. Chung survived and started his wanderings. Along the way he met many old masters who often dwelled in mountain caves. He found his one true love but she was lost after the invincible one hundred destroyed her village. Chung has been searching and learning but he carries the pain of lost love in his heart that only Orpheus would understand. With the help of the Great White Eagle of the North, he crosses into different dimensions at sunset as that is when the dimensions open to someone with great personal power. With his Eagle guide, his ancient master sends him to different futures and different past lives. Chung has five warrior spirits including the Chimera with three dragon heads. Chung lives by the seven moral codes of Bushido throughout his many life adventures.
