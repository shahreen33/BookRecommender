 
  There is no pixie dust in faerie...
 In faerie The Hunt is the top of the food chain, and me? I'm the head of the viper, or so they tell me. But that's a lie. Something is rising, a dread, a fear that cannot be named, and I'm about to dive right into the thick of it. Now, if only I can get the guys and The Hunt to work together then maybe we can all come out of this unscathed.
  Join Eva and the guys as they adjust to life in faerie in this sequel novella to the For the Blood Series.
