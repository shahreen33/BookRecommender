Lily Buschwald is ready to live life on her own terms. After years in foster care, she is determined to leave behind everything she knows for the adventure of a lifetime: teaching English to a wealthy family in Cochabamba, Bolivia.But the program she’s signed up for is a scam. Suddenly rudderless and broke, she begins a whirlwind romance with Omar, a savvy, handsome local who’s left his life as a hunter in the remote jungle village to try city life. When Omar learns that a jaguar has killed his brother’s child in Ayachero, he gives Lily a choice: stay alone in the unforgiving city, or marry him and travel to the last in an ever-isolated string of river towns. Love-struck Lily sees no option. She follows Omar to a ruthless new world of lawless poachers, heartless missionaries, and option-less indigenous tribes driven to the brink of survival. A far cry from the romantic life she imagined, Lily is forced to navigate the jungle—and its residents—using her wits and resilience.
