I hadn’t seen Ryan Hudson coming. He stumbled into my life and settled immediately into my soul. As I’ve watched him beginning to explore a new kind of freedom, my heart has swelled and shattered a million times.  The trust he has placed in my hands is monumental. I will not let him down as others have. He thought the protective wall he built was strong enough, but I’m pulling it down. He will bare his soul to me. If he thinks his demons will scare me away, he's wrong. I’m not intimidated by them. We will fight them together.  Life hasn’t been fair to Ryan. But he hasn't let it beat him, because only the brave find hope in a second chance. He doesn’t comprehend the strength that he possesses, but I’m going to show him. Even if I have to burn the world down so that he can rise from the ashes of his painful past to be the beautiful creature I know him to be, that's what I'll do.  What he will come to understand is that he no longer belongs to the past. I am his present and his future. Those that clipped his wings no longer own him. I do.  And it's time for my Phoenix to soar free...  This is our happily ever after.   **Author’s note: Phoenix is a dark novel with intense scenes that may trigger some readers. Please read with caution.
