As Jax gets closer to the truth regarding his sister’s death, doubt overwhelms him. This is a very challenging and difficult time for him, and Kendra suffers from it; not only emotionally, but also professionally. She completely ignored her own goals in order to please her boss and the adorable baby, and she’s desperately trying to focus on her career.  Even though their official status is still unclear, the tension between them keeps increasing, leading them to make a huge mistake that will have serious consequences. And potentially break them apart for good.  Note: this is the third book out of five in the series. Contains explicit language for a mature audience only.
