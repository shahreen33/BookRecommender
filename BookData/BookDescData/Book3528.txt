An anthology of Divine proportions. These menacing tales feature beings of divinity from angels, demons, gods, goddesses, to personifications of divine principals. In "S(a)TAN" journey into how an ordinary boy named Stan becomes the evil figure head we know today. In "Fallen from Grace" learn how a traumatic and intentional attack helps push one Angel to give up his wings and embark on a path of revenge. In "Haunted" you will see how a Fallen Angel becomes a bitter shade of himself as he is continuously haunted by a murdered love and so much more! This book is not for the faint of heart.
