“Please Don't Remove MarGreat's Glasses!” is an inspirational coming of age story that follows the trials and tribulations of privileged teenager, Timothy Clement, as he prepares for his first year of law school. Timothy and his two closest friends embark on one last adventure before heading to college which puts them in the middle of Miami’s seedy nightlife, complete with partying, wild girls and various illegal activities.  Things go horribly wrong when Timothy crosses the wrong people and his younger brother Stephen pays for Timothy's reckless behavior with his life. Stripped of his status, abandoned by his friends and family, and incarcerated, Timothy is forced to reevaluate his life, and in particular, his atheist beliefs. After being paroled, Timothy reluctantly accepts the charity of a God fearing man named Jude who takes him in and helps him assimilate back into society. Jude patiently offers his support while Timothy endures prejudice, poverty, and physical disfigurement after a freak accident. Jude remains steadfast in his attempts to persuade Timothy to put his faith in God, but Timothy will hear nothing of the sort. Can Jude show this young atheist that it is never too late for salvation?
