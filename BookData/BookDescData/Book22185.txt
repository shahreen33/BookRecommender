The story of Lancelot is one of striving for perfection in the company of men only to fall short due to the sins of the flesh...but in Lancelot Du Lethe the most famous of the Knights of the Round Table is only partially of the mortal realm. He and Guinevere share a mystical bond of which Arthur can not be a part for they are both of the bloodline of the fey, and are immortally destined to be betrothed. This ensuing war of loyalties and love threatens not just the uneasy peace of the mortal realm, but of the entire netherworld of the multi-pantheons of gods as well.Drawing from Joseph Campbell, and from sources both historical and literary, this is a new take on the story of Camelot's most famous knight as told as only the author of Mad Merlin can.
