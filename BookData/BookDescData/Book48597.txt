Young Syaoran embarks on a worlds-spanning adventure to restore the memory of the most important person in his life, the princess Sakura - even though he knows that she'll never remember her love for him. The trail leads to a small town reminiscent of Europe at the turn of the nineteenth century, a place where the ghostly image of a golden-haired woman comes in the night to steal the town's children. Syaoran and his band of outrageous friends - affable Fai D. Flowright, loose cannon Kurogane, the odd creature Mokona, and Sakura herself - mount their horses and venture into forbidding, barren woods to solve a mystery, rescue the children, and retrieve one more piece of Sakura's missing memories.
