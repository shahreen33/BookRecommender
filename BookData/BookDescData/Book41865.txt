If you’re a guy like me, and you find yourself having banged your sexy new boss—the school principal—in the back of your Jeep one drunken night, here’s a few takeaways based on my experience...Lesson One: Always get her FULL name.Lesson Two: Consider asking what she does for a living.Lesson Three: Find out why she’s moved to town. Get details. Details are crucial.Lesson Four: Don’t alter her bio in front of an auditorium of high school students unless you know she has a sense of humor for that sort of thing.Lesson Five: If you ignore Lesson Four, apologize instead of flirt when you’re sent to the principal’s office.Lesson Six: NEVER sleep with her again.Lesson Seven: Pay attention to this one—it’s the most important of them all.Don’t fall for your one-night stand.Class dismissed.
