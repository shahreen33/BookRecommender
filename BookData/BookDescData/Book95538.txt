"I can confidently go on to state that A Twist in the Eye is the most exciting collection of weird fiction...that I have read for many years. Moreover, I am confident that after the reader has gone through the tales he or she will be as amazed as I am that Charles Wilkinson is not far better known and appreciated in the field... "- Mark Samuels in his introductionThroughout the sixteen stories collected in this remarkable book Charles Wilkinson explores themes of place, ritual, identity, death and transmutation with a rare, if not utterly unique, confidence. They are enigmatic but never vague, dreamlike but never illogical, horrifying but only occasionally visceral. Few writers can write ‘weird’ with so convincing a voice.The full table of contents is as follows:Introduction by Mark SamuelsReturningThe Human CosmosHidden in the AlphabetLine of FireIn His Grandmother’s CoatNight in the Pink HouseCold PlatePetrol-savedThe World Without WatercressGold in AshAn Invitation to WorshipThe Investigation of InnocenceChoiceA Lesson from the UndergrowthWatchers in the WoodHandsThe book is a lithographically printed, 256 page sewn hardback with printed endpapers (by a follower of Bosch), limited to 260 copies.
