Twyla Penn's first few days at her new job were going pretty well- right up to the moment a man in a ski mask pulled a gun on her and tried to toss her into the backseat of his car. Luckily, the hot cop she'd seen in the bar earlier showed up and saved her.  Jensen Reed never paid any attention to all the "boom" stuff his fellow officers talked about- until Twyla. With one look at the beautiful blonde with the soft brown eyes, he knew they were meant for each other.  He protected her once. Now he wants it to be a lifelong job.
