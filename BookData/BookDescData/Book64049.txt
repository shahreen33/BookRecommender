Part of a series of books containing myths as retold by first-rank contemporary authors, this is Alexander McCall Smith's telling of the Celtic myth of Dream Angus, a god of love, youth, beauty, and also the bringer of dreams. He is cherished by all, but fated to love only Ca√©r, the swan maiden from his own dreams. Smith spins five charming stories of Dream Angus with five tales of his modern alter egos.
