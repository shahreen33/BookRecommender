From the heart of The Velvet a writing community built around the fervent love of neo-noir fiction comes an original anthology. Stacked with brilliant emerging writers alongside some of the strongest established voices in contemporary literature, WARMED AND BOUND crosses literary boundaries on all sides, to deliver an altogether unique reading experience. Through seemingly opposed conventions, beautiful prose makes a hard impression on the short story form. From a scary love story to a nostalgic thriller, a hardboiled pursuit of salvation to the black humor that is existentialism, WARMED AND BOUND is rogue humility and lovesick noir, where humanity is a dirty puzzle. It 's Velvet Noir. Welcome.

The result is fiction at once conceived from high artistic intent and executed with depraved populist energy." Steve Ericksonauthor of Zeroville and The Sea Came in at Midnight
