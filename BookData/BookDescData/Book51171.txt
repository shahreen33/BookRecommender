I can’t hold her.I can’t speak to her.I can’t even see her.The most important piece of my life is gone.I had everything.I had Winnie.And just like that, my unconditional love vanished.Picking up the pieces is impossible.There’s no easy way to fall out of love.But that’s exactly what I have to do.The Edge of Heaven is the emotional conclusion to Wrong Side of Heaven.One jilted love story.Four converging paths.A brand new forever.
