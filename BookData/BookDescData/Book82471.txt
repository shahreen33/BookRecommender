DEEP MAGIC is a bi-monthly electronic magazine that publishes clean short fiction in the fantasy and science fiction genres (epic, paranormal, steampunk, etc). Our issues are also filled with author interviews, art features, book reviews and tips for writers.  This month, we feature an exclusive interview with Rysa Walker on her first graphic novel based on her bestselling series time-travel series, The Chronos Files. We also share some sage advice on worldbuilding from USA Today bestselling author Shannon Mayer. We also include short stories from fantasy legend Eldon Thompson ("Thorns"), John D Brown ("From the Clay of his Heart"), and a sci-fi story from Eleanor Wood ("Her Glimmering Facade"). We also feature stories this month by Stephen S Power ("Catskill Dragon"), Charity Tahmaseb's fairy tale twist ("Gretel and Hansel"), and Beth Powers ("Claimed By The Sea"). And along with an interview of our amazing cover artist, we'll also be publishing an extended sample of Josi Russell's excellent sci-fi novel ("Caretaker"). Once you've read it, you'll want to purchase the rest on Amazon.  If you want to read gripping stories that don’t rely on sex, swearing, and graphic violence—you’ve come to the right place!
