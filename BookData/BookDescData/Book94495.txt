The exciting sequel to THE GUMSHOE, THE WITCH, AND THE VIRTUAL CORPSE! 2034 was a rough year for Drew Parker. His car broke down, his rent went up, and his partner was kidnapped by a revenge-crazed performance artist. And to top it off, one of Drew's clients was tossed from a skyscraper- after being stripped naked, smeared in human fat, and painted with occult symbols. So far, 2035 isn't shaping up to be much better. What started off as a simple case involving a deaf girl and her cheating boyfriend is getting complicated. It doesn't help that the boyfriend is one of five identical actors cloned from the frozen corpse of a dead movie star. Or that he's up to his neck in a convoluted blackmail plot. Or that the guy is being stalked by some sort of secret agent, a dame in a clown mask with the combat skills of a Navy Seal. And besides, Drew has his own problem to deal with. A personal matter involving a male prostitute, a privatized version of the KGB, and a vampire sex cult. Well at least his Wiccan partner, Jen, is back to help him out. If he can just get her to cut back on the practical jokes. ... and the dating advice.
