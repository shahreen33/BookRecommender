This world is evil.  My mother used to tell me that evil only comes to those who are looking for it, and maybe she was right.  Corruption and death walk hand and hand in this town. I refuse to give in, but giving up seems to be my only option.  As a detective, I’ve seen enough killing for ten lifetimes, and now, leaving is the only way to keep my sanity.  I never thought that my last case while training my replacement would have a stranglehold on me personally.  It’s like the Hangman is placing the noose around my neck, and the rope is only getting tighter.
