Two boys forge a friendship through their mutual love of horror movies, comic books, and FANGORIA magazine, and in the rural woods face an eerie demon lady during the pivotal summer of their lives: the summer between elementary school and middle school - the summer of 1986. Aaron Saylor (author of the acclaimed SEWERVILLE) brings you this tale of youth and horror in the '80s as an excerpt from the upcoming horror novel ADVENTURES IN TERROR WITH JASPER BOHANON, due later in 2014 from Point Nine Publishing.
