Zuri LaCrosse is a special young lady. In fact, she might even be considered … collectible? Although she is infected with the werewolf virus, she tries to live a normal life until she meets a strange old man named Goddard on a dusty desert highway. He lures her into his house where she is held captive. Goddard promises her a new and better life, but can he tame her feral ways and transform her from a scruffy country werewolf into an elegant young lady? And who—or what—is making those strange and terrifying noises in the locked room upstairs? Zuri must either find a way to escape captivity, or give up her freedom to become a cherished and pampered pet in Mr. Goddard’s Menagerie!
