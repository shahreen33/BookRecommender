Jared Kane…Our new racing driver.God on the track.And the man I didn’t know I wanted until I fell into his arms and kissed him before uttering a single word.He’s resisting me at every turn.But he’s wasting his time.I always get what I want.And I want Jared Kane.Paisley Nash…The boss’s daughter.Spoiled, entitled, tenacious, and spunky.She’s completely off limits.Until I’m warned not to touch her.Then it’s game on.Except taking her to my bed might cost me everything I’ve fought hard for.No woman is worth that.Not even Paisley Nash.
