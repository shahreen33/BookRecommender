For its 25th anniversary celebration, Sweet Valley Middle School is burying a time capsule--and a special schoolwide contest will decide what goes inside.  Identical twins Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield are each determined to win.  Jessica is teamed with her fellow Unicorns, and Elizabeth and her friends are with George Hankel, the shyest boy in school, who is without a mother and who hardly ever sees his father.  With the race just about even, Elizabeth stumbles on the one thing that will definitely make her team win--an old football that belongs to George Hankel's father!  It's the football that was used to score the winning touchdown at Sweet Valley's first state championship.  Now, there's more at stake than just winning.  Maybe Elizabeth can also bring George and his dad back together again. . . if Jessica doesn't get to the football first.
