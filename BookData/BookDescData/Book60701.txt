This is a love story...and it's nothing like the other Navy SEAL books you have read. It's a look inside the head of the man who wore the uniform.  Lieutenant Ben Keegan leaves the Navy after a decade of service. He's been shot, captured, tortured, blown up, taken shrapnel, and he suffers from six tours of combat. This is a touching love story about overcoming pain and learning to trust and love...  Former Navy SEAL Lieutenant, Ben Keegan, starts teaching history at the university Lara attends. Ben starts his own contracting firm, Dark Horse Guardians. He frequently takes on black-op missions for the CIA and other foreign intelligence entities.  Lieutenant Ben Keegan is a mystery man and Lara is immediately intrigued with him. But, more importantly Ben is strongly drawn to her. Incredibly handsome and attentive to Lara, there is one big problem: he is legally married and has a child. And, Ben is wrestling with problems from his many years in combat.   Lara is 24 years old, brilliant, beautiful and finishing her master's degree in a small New England town, but there's one thing missing from her life – a love relationship. Lara Reagan O'Connell is constantly pursued because of her striking good looks, but Lara refuses to get involved physically with any man before marriage. And, getting involved with a married guy would be out of the question. In today's world, she is considered a dinosaur, holding out for the right guy. She also harbors a dark secret that causes her to be introverted and cautious in all dealings with men.  Lara O'Connell is about to have a man enter her world who will alter the course of her life.   Their love story takes the reader on a romantic, psychological, sometimes gritty, journey. Both characters remain steadfast to their values, and discover that even though they have lived completely different lives – they have more in common then they originally thought.
