 Two women. One deadly secret. A rivalry that could destroy them.  Ava Wells is perfect. She has the boyfriend, the career, the looks. But one night changes everything and her life suddenly isn't so seamless. Jade Fernleigh is ambitious. She's worked hard to get where she is. And she's not about to let Ava take the job she rightly deserves. Both women share a secret that could destroy them, but who will crumble first?  Praise for The Liars:  'An irresistibly, compulsive thriller' Ella Drummond, author of My Last Lie. 'A well written fast-paced story, with more twists than a corkscrew' Amanda James, author of Another Mother.
