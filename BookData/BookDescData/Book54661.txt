An inspiring memoir from the front lines of history by award-winning 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley.Don’t ask the meaning of life. Life is asking, what’s the meaning of you?With this provocative question, Truth Worth Telling introduces us to unforgettable people who discovered the meaning of their lives in the historic events of our times. A 60 Minutes correspondent and former anchor of the CBS Evening News, Scott Pelley writes as a witness to events that changed our world. In moving, detailed prose, he stands with firefighters at the collapsing World Trade Center on 9/11, advances with American troops in combat in Afghanistan and Iraq, and reveals private moments with presidents (and would-be presidents) he’s known for decades. Truth Worth Telling offers a resounding defense of free speech and a free press as the rights that guarantee all others. For readers who believe values matter and truth is worth telling, Pelley writes, “I have written this book for you.”
