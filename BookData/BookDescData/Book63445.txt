In the Haymarket district of London, a Cockney prostitute accidentally intercepts a letter from a client containing an urgent plea for help. When the letter's writer is found dead, police call it a suicide. Amateur sleuth Julian Kestral thinks it's murder and teams up with the prostitute to track a diabolical killer.
