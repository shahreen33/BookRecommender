#1 NYT bestseller Archer launches a brilliant series – a Clifton Chronicles spinoff – about Detective Warwick. But this is not a detective story, this is a story about the making of a detective.Jeffrey Archer's Clifton Chronicles reinvigorated his already-illustrious career to the highest sales level in a decade, and now Archer launches a brand-new family saga tailor-made for Clifton fans: the life story of William Warwick. William is a new recruit in the London Metropolitan Police Force, and his father is a distinguished judge. Rather than follow in his father's footsteps, the way his sister has, William has always wanted to be a detective.This series debut traces William's complicated relationships with his family; the origins of his career; his first mentor, career police officer Fred Yates; his first months on the beat; and his first case as a detective, an investigation into an art theft ring which has continually outsmarted Scotland Yard. It also introduces the series villains, ruthless art collector Miles Faulkner and his defense attorney, Booth Watson.As with the Clifton Chronicles, the Warwick novels tell the story of a man, a family, and an era of our times in the way only Jeffrey Archer can. His legions of fans will be enthralled through each volume, as we follow William's life, through his career, his love life, his family, and the many triumphs and tragedies of each.
