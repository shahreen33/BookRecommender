Especially with a quirky chick who drove me insane. But something about her got under my skin, and into my heart.And I had to have her.All of her. Now.Falling in love in the back of a truck, just the two of us, was easy.Dealing with psycho fans, jealous exes, and demons from the past....not so easy.Loving Storm is a fast-paced SWEET (not erotica, not a lot of drama) novella that gives an extended look into Storm and Evie's future.
