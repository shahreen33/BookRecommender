THE TERRIGEN CLOUD FINALLY FINDS LUNELLA LAFAYETTE! But her transformation isn't what you might expect! Plus, poor Lunella's been so busy worrying about the Terrigen Cloud turning her Inhuman, she's totally unprepared for...Cosmic Cooties?! Because when a new boy moves to town from far, far away, he's oddly interested in her. Meanwhile, the most wanted T-Rex in NYC is running out of places to lie low--a problem that won't get any easier when our darling duo undergo a body swap! It's a big change-up that will see Luna spending a freaky Friday (or whatever day it happens to be) as Devil Dinosaur, and vice versa! Will Luna evade capture? Will DD scrape a passing grade? And who exactly is Moon Girl's new 9-year-old archnemesis, Kid Kree? Lunella's got a huge future in the Marvel Universe, if only she can survive the present!
