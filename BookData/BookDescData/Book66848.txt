One simple question changed both our lives.Can I keep you?We were only nine then, and all that mattered to us was seeing each other again.But that all changed as we grew up. Years of pretending like we didn’t know each other. That nothing we felt when we were younger had ever happened. As if that question was never asked.Who knew that it would take so long for us to figure it all out? To stop pretending and finally realize that we had been there for each other all along.  It might have taken us 21 years, but it’s finally here.And this is our story.
