When I was seven, I stole her candy.When I was fifteen, I stole her first kiss.At eighteen, I stole her innocence.Now at twenty-five, she's trying to steal my life.My fate was sealed being born the bastard child of my father. I played my role in the De Luca family until reality caused my path in life to skid to a halt.My fate is damned. And the one person that could save me is the one I've stolen so much from in the past.
