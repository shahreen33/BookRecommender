Elijah Black, a hardcore Navy SEAL, eats, sleeps, and lives for his missions—and little else …  The self-proclaimed playboy has no time for relationships, unless it's between the sheets. So he’s more than happy to leave for his newest mission, a quick extraction of a terrorist believed to be responsible for a series of bombings in Europe. But the mission doesn’t go as planned, and the terrorists take Elijah prisoner.  Nasima was only supposed to care for his body, not his heart…  As the nurse charged with keeping the prisoner alive, Nasima is alone with Elijah every day. Sparks fly between them, but Elijah makes it clear he cares little for Nasima’s traditions and only wants her for her body. Still, she grows to care for the broken soldier, and it isn’t long before she begins to dream of abandoning her strict upbringing for Elijah’s tempting embrace.  A passionate encounter leads to more than just feelings…  After Elijah’s failed escape and another beating, Nasima is found comforting him and suffers the consequences. Just as Elijah realizes he will do whatever is necessary to save her, but before they can get to safety, Nasima reveals a secret that may be Elijah’s undoing.  Will Nasima's secret keep her from breaking through Elijah’s tough exterior in time for another escape, or will he decide to make the journey alone?
