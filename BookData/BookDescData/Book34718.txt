Green Arrow's life will be forever changed as he is betrayed by those closest to him! A budding relationship with Black Canary forces Ollie to confront the fact that he can't fight "the man" if he is "the man." And one by one, his friends desert him-and all the money in the world won't bring them back when he needs them most.Collecting: Green Arrow 1-5, Rebirth
