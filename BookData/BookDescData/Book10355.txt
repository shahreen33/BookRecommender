For years, he was a part of my life. I watched him rush to the hospital countless times, his beautiful surgeon hands racing to save lives.After all this time, I can’t escape the truth. I want Dr. Lowe. Lust chokes each moment we’re together. He promises to fulfill my fantasies—every dirty, naughty desire we can dream up.Only, I can’t have him.He’s confident. Experienced. Seductive.And he’s my ex-boyfriend’s father.
