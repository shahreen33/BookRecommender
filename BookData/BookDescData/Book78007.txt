Questions about figgins, DEATH, mind-destroying footnotes, carnivorous Luggage, quantum butterflies,the magico-numerical significance of what we must always call twice-four or seven-plus-one, and even the precise sex of the Great A'Tuin, the enormous sea-turtle who swims eternally through space bearing (via four elephant middlemen) the Discworld ...all these and many more will keep fans of fantasy and the Discworld occupied for many happy hours. Each of the faculties of the Discworld's greatest college of magic, Unseen University, in the heart of that great metropolis Ankh-Morpork, have provided a number of questions - and the answers, in case you don't know as much about the Discworld and fantasy as you thought you did. However, be assured there is no golden turtle buried somewhere on the Sto Plains for followers of the *hidden* clues to unearth ...this is just a myth!
