Bennett James was out of my league. Beautiful. Charismatic. Addictive. He was the type of man that women fawn over, that could have anyone his heart (or his insatiable libido) desired. He was never supposed to notice me and he sure as hell was never meant to pursue me. Darci Walker is an enigma. Guarded but wild, if she lets you close enough, and therein lies my problem. My sweet, untamed addiction liked to play timid. That was her first lapse in judgment. Turned me to fire, kick-started a game of cat and mouse I couldnâ€™t get enough of. Me, the Big Bad Wolf. Darci, my sinfully, sexy Riding Hood.
