I thought I had it all: twin sister, cute boyfriend, and magic beyond my years. Night Shade Academy should’ve been easy for me, but nothing could prepare me for the moment when I’m kicked out of my birthright House and placed with the evil witches known as the Darks—despite being born a Light.Now, I’m stuck with a bunch of evil witches who compete in this crazy tradition where they pit the first years against each other, fighting for their place in the hierarchy at the Academy. The only rule, try not to die.Oh, and did I mention it’s not just witches we have to contend with? There’s also Vampires and Lycans, as well.Thanks to the help of a gorgeous Dark that I find myself a little too attracted to, I’m able to keep my ass-whoopings to a minimum, until someone pushes me too far, and I find out exactly why my magic affinity is Dark.
