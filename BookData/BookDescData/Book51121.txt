The biggest wedding in years is about to take place, except the bride, Paige Livingston, has been stood up. Tanner Welles has buried himself in his mountain cabin to escape reality and mourn the death of his wife who took a bullet meant for him. Bad timing for both, as the two find themselves stranded together during a severe blizzard. But once the storm passes and Paige returns home to Denver, Tanner makes a disturbing discovery that sends him straight to the Mile High City. Someone wants Paige dead.
