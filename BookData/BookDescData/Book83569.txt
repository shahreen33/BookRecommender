NIGHTMARE is an online horror and dark fantasy magazine. In NIGHTMARE's pages, you will find all kinds of horror fiction, from zombie stories and haunted house tales, to visceral psychological horror.  Funded as a stretch goal of our sister-magazine LIGHTSPEED's Queers Destroy Science Fiction! Kickstarter campaign, this month we're presenting a special issue of NIGHTMARE called Queers Destroy Horror!: an all-horror extravaganza entirely written--and edited!--by queer creators. Here's what we've got lined up for you in this special issue: Original horror--edited by Wendy N. Wagner--by Chuck Palahniuk, Matthew Bright, Sunny Moraine, Alyssa Wong, and Lee Thomas. Reprints--also selected by Wagner--by Kelley Eskridge, Caitlin R. Kiernan, and Poppy Z. Brite. And nonfiction articles--edited by Megan Arkenberg--by Lucy A. Snyder, Sigrid Ellis, Catherine Lundoff, Michael Matheson, Evan J. Peterson, and Cory Skerry. Plus a selection of queer poetry selected by Robyn A. Lupo and an original cover illustration by AJ Jones.
