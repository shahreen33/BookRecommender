The devil owes the Hatter a favor…  … and he knows just what he wants for his prize.  But unless he can corrupt sweet Alice, he cannot claim her—for one cannot steal a soul that isn’t tainted. That is... unless an innocent offers it of her own free will.  THE WHITE QUEEN is a tale of pure horror by USA Today bestselling author Addison Cain. There is no romance, no white knight. For the twisted Hatter lurks in these pages, ready to devour your soul and haunt your dreams.  Previously published under the title "Nightmares in Wonderland" in the anthology 'The Dark Forest'.
