Years ago, the Dark Knight suffered his greatest ever defeat...when the Joker killed Jason Todd, the second young man to adopt the identity of Robin. Now Jason has somehow returned from the dead, and taken on a guise once used by the Joker - the Red Hood! As the new Hood's murderous rampage through the Gotham underworld continues, Batman finds himself riddled with doubt and regret and uncertain of how to proceed. Is Jason a lost cause? Can he still be saved? Or will he meet his demise once again at the hands of Gotham crime boss Black Mask? This electrifying tale, the sequel to "Batman: Under the Hood", is one of the most talked-about Batman stories in years!
