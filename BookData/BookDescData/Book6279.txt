Tough, taciturn…And a fool for letting her go…  Wyoming rancher Quinn McKay was biding his time until his levelheaded wife came to her senses and called a halt to this trial separation—never believing their marital rough patch would drag on for a coon’s age.  Libby McKay knew when she married the gruff, laid-back cowboy that he wasn’t prone to blathering on about his feelings. But three months have passed and her stubborn-as-a-mule husband is still living by himself in the horse trailer. It seems he’d rather hold onto his pride than hold onto her.  When Quinn realizes Libby is determined to move on if he doesn’t change, he offers her one weekend of uninterrupted sexual decadence to rekindle their love life and to hash out their differences.
