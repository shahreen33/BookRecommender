Snails might seem simple - after all, they're just one shell and a whole lot of slime. But these slow, squishy creatures are more complicated than they appear! Did you know snails build roads like engineers, shoot arrows like archers, and go undercover in camouflage like spies? Did you know they can be smaller than a seed or bigger than a grown-up's hand? Author Kevin McCloskey mixes snail science, art, and hilarity for the newest book in his Giggle and Learn series, praised by the NewYork Times as a winning combination of facts and gross-out fun.""
