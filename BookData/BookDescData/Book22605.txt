Opening in 1941, THE FERIA is a stunning tale of two countries, where we find Soledad, a smart, educated young Mexican-American with big plans. She and her family, however, begin facing the economic pressures inflicted by a nation readying for war. To ensure her family's survival and continued success, her father betrays her in an act meant to save her family’s agricultural fortune. Brutally torn from her true love, Xavier, Soledad’s carefully concealed secrets begin to collapse. The challenge of putting everything back together and resisting the desire and love she has for Xavier presents itself in a daring love story dancing on both sides of the border, intricately written around Mexican and American cultures and the great uncertainty that comes with love.
