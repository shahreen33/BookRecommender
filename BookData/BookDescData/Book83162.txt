This edition of The Adventures of Pinocchio has been reproduced from the 1901 version with the late Victorian pen and ink illustrations of Carlo Chiostri. Some of the pages have been redesigned, some drawings enlarged, yet Chiostri's spirit still pervades the book. Everything is there as before, the familiar profile of Pinocchio, his paper clothes, his bread hat and his friends -- good and bad -- Gepetto, Master Cherry, the Cat and the Fox, the Carabineers, the Green Fisherman, Fire Eater, the Blue Fairy and many others. This early edition is written and illustrated for older children, and would be of interest to adults.
