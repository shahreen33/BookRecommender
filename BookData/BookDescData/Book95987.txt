Stunning in its simplicity and grace, Mirror is visual tour-de-force that requires no words to tell its universal tale. Author and illustrator Suzy Lee masterfully creates a world where a little girl explores and dances — at first cautiously, later exuberantly — with her reflection in the mirror. When discord between the girl and her reflection surfaces, Lee's unforgettable story provides a gentle reminder that our actions have consequences. A beautiful book sure to be embraced by the many fans of Wave, Suzy Lee's Mirror strengthens her growing reputation as one of the most exciting new authors to watch.
