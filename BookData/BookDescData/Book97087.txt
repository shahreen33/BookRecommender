Everybody has problems. But Travis? Yeah, he has so many problems that he finds it hard to breathe sometimes.  He spends five years catering to his ex-wife’s every want and need—all to make it possible to continue to see his child.  He isn’t supposed to fall in love with a woman, but he does.  He isn’t supposed to find someone that is willing to put up with his ex-wife’s crazy antics, but he has.  He isn’t supposed to be happy, but he is.  And all it takes is his ex-wife finding out about his new-found peace for things to change.  ***  Hannah saw him and knew he was the one.  All it took was one look into that haunted man’s eyes, and she was lost, never to be found again.  She thinks she has it all. His love, a new baby made with that love, and a house to raise their blended family.  She’s wrong, and Travis’ ex-wife is out to prove it.  ***  Travis doesn’t deserve Hannah. All he’s done is hurt her.  She’s done everything in her power to keep everyone happy, but the more she tries, the harder his ex-wife pushes. Until one day, there’s nothing left to push.  Hannah leaves, and Allegra wins.  But Travis isn’t willing to let her have her way any longer.  He fights back, and only gets a bullet to the chest to show for it.
