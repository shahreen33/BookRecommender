The Cabal of Thotash has languished for years within their poorly-ventilated Manhattan lair. All of their rituals to summon an ancient malice and help it unmake reality have accomplished little beyond annoying the upstairs neighbor. When a charismatic sacrifice talks her way off the dark altar and into a leadership position, the Cabal's fortunes turn around, as do their ideas about what it means to serve the greater evil. The Cabal of Thotash is a wickedly funny novelette that peers beneath the hood of an evil cult and finds the inevitable collisions between orthodoxy and modern culture.
