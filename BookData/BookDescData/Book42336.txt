Ionic and covalent bonds are a piece of cake for MJ. But human bonds are a little harder ...There are only two things MJ wants in her final year of high school:1) Glowing grades and ...2) to convince uber-smart, chiselled-jaw Jason they’d be a winning team outside the science lab as well as in.Tutoring deadbeat drummer, Luke, isn’t part of the plan. After all, he has average intelligence, takes disorganised notes and looks like a partied-out zombie at their study sessions! Not even his taut biceps will win MJ over.But MJ learns that she could be tutored in a few life lessons too: That sometimes there’s good reason to skip chemistry tutorials. That intelligence is so much more than a grade average.And that sometimes you can’t beat the chemistry.
