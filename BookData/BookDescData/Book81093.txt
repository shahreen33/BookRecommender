Bekki is happy running her salon, Harroway’s Hair and Beauty, and she is ready for another busy day.  The last thing Bekki expects is for her first customer of the day to die in her hairdressing chair. It is presumed Stella died of natural causes. But then evidence points to suspicious circumstances and her hunky husband, Detective Nick, and his new, tough partner, Dave, believe she was murdered.  The townsfolk don’t appear to be interested in bringing Stella’s killer to justice as she wasn’t exactly well-loved by most of the locals. But Bekki is determined that her murder doesn’t go unpunished so she decides to help the investigation along and try to uncover the truth.  Will Bekki find the murderer before someone else is murdered?
