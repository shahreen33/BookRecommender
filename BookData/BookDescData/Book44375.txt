He'd always be there for her, always. But only for her. Grace's life is perfect â€“ great boyfriend, great family, great life at college. It's all coming together, everything she wanted as a child. Cain never had a family. His mother died when he was a baby, and he never had a father. Raised by a series of foster parents, he's spent his whole adult life drifting around, until now that is. When the two of them meet, there are obvious sparks, but they're nothing compared to what follows, a series of events that will cause Grace's perfect life to crumble all around her. But he's always there, always there to save her when she needs saving, to protect her when she needs protecting. Even if she doesn't know it. As their lives continue to intertwine, a shocking revelation causes Cain to question everything in his life, leading him on a path that brings his world, and Grace's, crashing down in front of them.
