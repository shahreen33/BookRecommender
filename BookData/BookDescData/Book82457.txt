War of the Staffs: Quest for the Staff of Adaman takes place on a world called Muira, where a powerful vampire wizard named Taza is brought through the void by a vengeful goddess named Adois, who lends him her powerful staff so that he can take over the planet and turn it from good to evil. Passing himself off as a god, Taza slowly convinces the Illanni, a race of dark elves, to take on the cloak of vampirism.Nearly two thousand years pass before the scheming vampire makes his move. But his careful planning is jeopardized when Prince Tarquin is born to fulfill a prophecy and confront the most evil creature Muira has ever known. The Prince, however, cannot succeed alone, and when Morganna, an Illanni noble woman, threatens Taza’s plans by starting an underground movement against him, she strikes her severest blow when she saves Tarquin’s life.He is also championed by the great wizard Celedant, and the young man is sent to the dwarvan militia to learn combat and survival skills by joining an elite group of soldiers known as the Borderers, while the wizard begins his search for the Staff of Adaman – the only object capable of defeating the Staff of Adois.Tarquin and Celedant’s epic journey spans the continent where they face not only a vampire wizard, but orcs, demons, and other monstrosities, including a lich, dravens, and an elemental creature the planet has not witnessed since its fiery formation. Book one of the trilogy, The Quest for the Staff of Adaman, begins the search for the first of two pieces of ancient staff as Taza’s assassins hunt the Prince to thwart the prophecy. Tarquin, however, is not the only target. Celedant must confront not only assassins, but powerful and dangerous creatures that Taza brings through the void to destroy the wizard as well as the growing resistance among the dwarves, Wood Elves, and High Elves.
