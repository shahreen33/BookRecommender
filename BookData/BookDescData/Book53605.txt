  While on a mission for the CIA to recover stolen Iraqi artifacts, Lara Croft narrowly escapes death–only to be thrown headlong into her next action-packed adventure.
After destroying years of his research on the ancient Méne cult, archaeologist Professor Frys is murdered by an unknown assassin. Lara Croft knows her colleague must have stumbled upon a dangerous secret–and someone took his life to ensure it would remain in the shadows. So Lara jets to the mysterious cloud forests of eastern Peru, home of the Méne ruins, and makes a shocking discovery: A group is attempting to revive the sinister cult and its mind-controlling ways. One of the followers is Lara’s former friend and failed protégé, Tomb Raider Ajay–and she is determined to see Lara silenced . . . permanently. But Lara, never one to run from a challenge, has other plans.
