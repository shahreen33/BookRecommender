Dawn Oliver - daughter of theatre royalty, talented in her own right, and, according to the internet... a complete and total fraud.  All she wants is a fair chance to prove herself - no nepotism, no social media campaigns, no sponsors. Just pure talent, which she has in spades, if she can just get someone to believe in her.  The way Patrick Bell does.  Straightforward, self-assured, and exactly the kind of energy Dawn needs, if he can get past his own demons. He's good with life as it is - he's managing, with no expectation of anything beyond a casual connection.  A chance meeting brings about an unexpected spark of chemistry... leading to a bond neither of them seems to be able to get away from.
