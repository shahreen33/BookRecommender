Jerry can't wait to explore the dark, spooky old cave he found down by the beach. Then the other kids tell him a story. A story about a ghost who is three hundred years old. A ghost who comes out when the moon is full. A ghost ... who lives deep inside the cave! Jerry knows that it's just another silly made-up ghost story.... Isn't it?
