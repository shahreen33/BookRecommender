Theo Hsu is back—in Hawai‘i, that is. Following the death of his father and a brush with disaster in the icy Wisconsin winter, Theo wants to reconnect with his family, work the job he loves, and find a way to get with lifelong secret thirst-trap, HPD Detective Koa Palapiti.Theo's a beat cop, not a detective. That doesn't stop him from wanting to solve a few mysteries about Koa… like why is he blowing hot and cold? What's going on with him and his partner, Freddie Ortiz? Will investigating a shipping magnate with shady ties to human trafficking and international espionage put Koa and Freddie in over their heads? And does Koa still have some kinkhound howling in his blood? Theo's halfway around the world, and right back where he started. This time he's gonna get what he came for—unless Koa’s latest murder case gets both of them first.
