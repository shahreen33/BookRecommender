She was everything, yet she was nothing. She was there, then she wasn’t. I didn’t expect her, never wanted her. But there she was, everywhere yet nowhere. She drew me in with her looks. Locked me with her first words, then stole me with her lust. She was everything I didn’t know I was searching for, yet nothing I needed. She was a conundrum, difficult and confusing. One who was impossible of staying away from.
