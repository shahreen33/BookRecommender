New York Times bestselling author Hannah Howell brings the proud heart of Scotland to life in her magnificent novels. Now the seven MacEnroy brothers are about to take America by storm . . .   Off the New England coast, courageous Mehitabel Ampleford wields a rifle to protect her home from a brutish band of men who are after her land. She will not be intimidated, but their attacks are growing fiercer, and just as their latest confrontation threatens violence, a bold stranger appears out of the ocean mists to send the raiders packing.   Geordie MacEnroy has seen the ravages of war in his mountain town—and in the injuries suffered by his youngest brother; now, his restless soul is calling him to find sanctuary by the sea. His long journey to the beautiful coastline of his adopted homeland feels like a new beginning as lovely Mehitabel, so wise and self-sufficient, offers blessed hope for healing his brother’s wounds. Geordie envisions a beautiful life with her as his bride, but a woman who has fought so fearlessly for her home may not willingly surrender all for his love.
