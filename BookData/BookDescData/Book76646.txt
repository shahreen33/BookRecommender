From the author of the highly acclaimed The Story of Land and Sea, a captivating historical novel, set in the late eighteenth-century American South, that follows a singular group of companions-an escaped slave, a white man, and a Creek Indian-who are being tracked for murderIn 1788, three men converge in the southern woods of what is now Alabama. Cat, an emotionally damaged white man from South Carolina, is wandering aimlessly after the death of his wife and son in childbirth. Bob, a garrulous black slave from a Pensacola sugar plantation, is escaping to freedom. Istillicha, edged out of his Creek tribe’s leadership, is hunting for money and supplies to reclaim his village.In the few days they spend together, the makeshift trio are seduced by the need for money and commit a heinous murder that soon has the forces of the law bearing down upon them, led by a probing French tracker named Le Clerc. Sent to pick up their trail, he must decide which has a greater claim: swift justice, or his own curiosity about how three such disparate, desperate men could act in unison.Katy Simpson Smith skillfully brings into focus these men whose lives are both catastrophic and full of hope—and illuminates the lives of the women they left behind. Far from being anomalies, Cat, Bob, and Istillicha are the beating heart of the new America that Le Clerc struggles to comprehend. In these territories caught between European, American, and Native nations, a wilderness exists where four men grapple with the importance of family, the stain of guilt, and the competing forces of power, love, race, and freedom—questions that continue to haunt us today.
