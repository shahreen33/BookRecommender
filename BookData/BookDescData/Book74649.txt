The power of pleasure...Gabriel Miller took everything from me. My family. My innocence. My home. The only thing I have left is the determination to get back what's mine.He thinks he's beaten me. He thinks he's won. What he doesn't realize is that every pawn has the chance to become a queen.And the game has only just begun.
