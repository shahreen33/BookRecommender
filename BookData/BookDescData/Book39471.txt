Reprinting Cerebus Issues 151-162The counterpoint to the impressive foundation of the two-volume, 1,200-page Church &amp; State is the equally impressive, equally complex Mothers &amp; Daughters, the first volume of which is Flight. This graphic novel concerns the fight between the newly established matriarchy and the opposing "daughterarchy." Cerebus, trying to regain the power he lost when the matriarchal Cirinists took over, heads down a fateful, blood-soaked path. Dave Sim is often reviled as a misogynist because of the radical politics and philosophy laid down in his books, the groundwork of which begins here and builds toward the climax of Mothers &amp; Daughters, which was so explosive that when it was initially released it cost Sim several close friends.
