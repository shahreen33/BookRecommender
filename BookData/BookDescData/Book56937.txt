Even a super hero's life can get boring. Double-check your gear. Patrol the city. Save the innocent. Report back to your boss, the Jackal. Wait, what? Why is Prowler working for the Jackal, not Spider-Man? What does the resurrected Madame Web have to do with it? And what has Prowler already done that may have compromised him?! Hobie Brown, a.k.a. the Prowler, may believe in what the Jackal is doing, but that doesn't mean it's easy. As his assignments get more dangerous, Hobie will be forced to wrestle not only with the meaning of his existence, but also the underground army of unruly super villains the Jackal has created!
