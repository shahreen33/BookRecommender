Jobs, including mine, hang in the balance.But Gideon doesn’t want a publicist.He wants a new muse. As I fall deeper under his sinful spell, a lifetime of secrets and carefully crafted lies unravels. Too late, I remember the sinister truths they protect:I am already someone’s masterpiece.And the original artist wants me back.*Art of Sin is book one of a duet and ends on a cliffhanger. But don't worry, book two, Sin of Love will be released March 28th! *This duet takes place in the world of the Vision Series but can be read as a standalone.
