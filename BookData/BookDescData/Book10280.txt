The Broken Road is the story of Ard and West, who have been friends since the second grade. They've been through a lot together: homework, broken bones, the death of a parent, and dreading high school dances. Through Ardie working the family farm and taking care of his siblings, and West chasing his college boy dreams, their friendship never falters, even with the gap of years and lifestyles. West goes through a series of boyfriends, making Ardie wish his friend could find someone who loves him as much as Ardie does himself. Waiting for the right time to tell West he's gay, Ardie figures he's lost his chance when West finally meets someone who seems just right for him. When the bottom falls out for West, there's only one person he thinks to call. Ardie is there for him when he does. A little vacation seems to be just the thing, not just to ease West's mind, but for Ardie to slide into West's life again, letting his friend know how much he cares. Will these two best friends ever realize there might be more between them than just friendship? Will their Broken Road lead to happiness, or just more heartache. Poignant and heartfelt, Broken Road will leave you craving more!
