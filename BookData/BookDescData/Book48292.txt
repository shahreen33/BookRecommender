I am the monarch of Manhattan’s underworld.A corrupt king, ruling a sinful empire. I wasn’t born to the crown.Nevertheless, I wear it well.Aislinn Granville is the Crown Jewel of my empire—my queen. To my enemies, she’s my Achilles heel—a perfect pawn. Without her, I am a wounded warrior. A ruthless, relentless beast.There is nowhere she can be taken that I won’t find her.No adversary I won’t crush to get her back.Even if I have to burn this city to the ground.
