Could you handle ten men?When I was little, my momma told me that I was probably gonna need to kiss a whole lotta frogs before I found my prince.Her definition of a prince is Roderick McGregor, owner of the biggest property development company in the state with ten of the most gorgeous sons in the northern hemisphere.Ten! Yeah, I said ten.Finding  I'm going to have a stepbrother would be bad enough, but ten is a whole other ball game. Then I overhear my new stepbrothers talking about 'the plan' and I'm flabbergasted.Finding the one is hard enough...finding ten should be impossible. This is a 100,000 word standalone mega menage/reverse harem romance.
