“The feeling I have in this very moment, after not seeing her for so long, will haunt me forever, reminding me why I left to begin with.”For as long as I can remember, Easton Crews has been off-limits. As much as it kills me, that’s never going to change. After his little disappearing act three years ago, then suddenly showing up out of nowhere, I shouldn't want anything to do with him. It doesn’t matter how beautiful he still is. Or how close we once were. It shouldn’t matter that my entire body lights on fire with need whenever he gets close. He chose the worst possible time to leave without so much as a goodbye. However, just like the first day he walked into our home, I'm drawn to him, needing him near me just as badly as I need air to breathe, and I can't stand it. I want to hate him. I know I should hate him. But hating him is the last thing he'll let me do. I push, he pulls harder, until I'm completely wrapped up in him, my mind lost in the one person who is forbidden—the one person I’ve always loved, even when he belonged to someone else. Easton was never meant to be mine. It took me years to come to terms with that and now that I finally have, he's here, right in front of me, more irresistible than ever. The part I fear the most about that—he’s the one person capable of completely wrecking my world. “I’m not leaving until you take all of your hate out on me. Let me feel it. All of it. Every dirty look. Every nasty fucking word. I will have it all before I leave. Stop hiding from me.”
