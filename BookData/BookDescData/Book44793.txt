Find the strongest man there. Give yourself to him in return for protection. It’s the only way you’ll ever survive.Convicted of a minor crime, Riana is sentenced to a prison planet—a dark primitive hold filled with convicts vying for power. Her only chance of survival is with Cain, a mysterious loner who has won his territory in the prison through intelligence and brute strength. Sex is all she has to offer, so she uses it. She’s under no delusions here. No one is ever released, and no one ever escapes. Survival is all she can hope for—until Cain.[Note: An earlier version of this book was published under the same title and a different penname. It has since been substantially revised and expanded.]
