'Max, your father is here. He's come to take Matthew away'Have you ever wondered what would happen if Max's husband met Max's father? What would Leon do?They're normally a fairly amiable bunch, but this is the story of what to expect if St Mary's doesn't like someone. As in, really doesn't like someone. Warning: contains a unit-wide criminal enterprise, a great deal of illegal activity and a sad misuse of public resources. All the things a father will do to protect his family.It is also a story of revenge. Because this is payback - St Mary's style.
