Winter it's coming... it's already here, and with it comes a horror no door can keep out. It's there in the yard, in the faces of the snowmen a young boy doesn't remember building. It's in the oddly empty streets below Santa Claus's crumbling sleigh. It's in the unnatural movement of the snow that suffocates a widower's town, and in the cold eyes of a lonely man's estranged children.Here, there is no holiday cheer, only spine-chilling fear, in the DEAD OF WINTER.Featuring seven stories, an introduction by the author, and a list of recommended books for the winter season.
