She prays each morning, attends worship every Sunday, and confidently takes up the struggle to defend traditional marriage when she learns marriage licenses are being issued to gays and lesbians in nearby San Francisco. But the certainty that she is living right falters after her teenage son, Josh, swallows a bottle of sleeping pills. Her fear deepens when she discovers that Josh struggles with same-sex attraction. If she's living right, how can Josh be gay?Desperate for a cure, Jen and her husband send Josh to a Christian conversion therapy camp recommended by their trusted pastor. Jenn is unwavering in her faith that Josh can be transformed by the grace of God. But as the story unfolds, her husband, son, and daughters seem to be questioning her deepest values, threatening irreparable damage to the tight-knit Henderson family.Author Laila Ibrahim tackles a subject directly out of the headlines in "Living Right," an intimate story about a mother's struggle to reconcile her religious beliefs with her son's sexual orientation. "Living Right" strips away the politics of gay rights to reveal what's really at stake in this ongoing conflict: family. As with her debut novel, "Yellow Crocus," Ibrahim's second novel explores an intimate and sensitive topic with insight and compassion.
