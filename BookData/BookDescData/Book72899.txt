WANTED: ROOMMATE. Must be tidy, polite, and absolutely not my brother's hot as sin best friend.I have no idea why I said yes.Maybe I'd had one too many wines. Maybe I'd done it accidentally. Maybe I'd been sleep-texting.One thing I know for sure is this: I absolutely do not want Ethan Hawkins in my apartment, up in my business, taking over my space.Yet he's here. Moving his stuff into my spare bedroom. Sending a wave of panty-melting, musky man-scent my way every time he walks past me.Here's the thing.We don't get along--at all. We never have, and I don't think we're going to start now that we're under one roof.There's also that little issue where I'm kinda, sorta, totally in love with him...Uh-oh.
