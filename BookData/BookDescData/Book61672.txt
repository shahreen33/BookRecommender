Sahily, in all of her mysterious Spanish beauty and seeming-desire to be with him, remains out of reach. He is an author struggling to raise his two children and pay his bills and still somehow find a way to meet the challenge of all the greats who have come before him.By night the living voices of dead writers mock him. There is Bukowski and Nin, but most of all there is Papa. The great Ernest Hemingway, a proud heavyweight who parades in his golden championship belt, telling us that it will never, ever be taken.A work of romance without falsity and literature without pretension. It is heart-wrenching and passionate, dangerous and defiant, and will leave readers with a sense of both loss and victory. The Girl From Tenerife is exquisitely written and deeply moving.
