Here once was an old woman who lived alone in the woods. After a night of heavy rain, the woman came across a ditch she had never seen before. In the ditch, laid the dead bodies of several young women. The woman had no idea who would do such a thing. It couldn't have been her mother, father or cousin because they're all dead already.
