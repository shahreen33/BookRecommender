what do you do when the machine that makes sure the king is perfect breaks down? what to do now that now the monarch is the wrong king? the worst king?you, a simple hard-working ape, now in a new world with a leader you canâ€™t trust, are just trying to get by, to keep on doing the good things you do: run rescue operations in the tumbledowns, secure ancient artifacts for posterity, and help the needy. but the king is always obstructing, sewing dissent and suspicion, poisoning your communities. well, what can you do?you can hide. you can endure. you can fight.or you can fix the king machine.
