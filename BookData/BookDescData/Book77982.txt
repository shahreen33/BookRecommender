This book surveys non-traditional subjects and approaches that have become part of the mainstream discipline of medieval history. Within each section are essays on subjects such as the social self, use of psychoanalysis, and sex and gender in medieval life. This text clearly articulates key concepts, defines critical vocabulary and demonstrates how postmodern theories, which have influenced all areas of the humanistic disciplines in recent years, are applied to the study of medieval history in practice, challenging our most fundamental assumptions about the meaning of historical evidence and our ability to read and interpret it.The book is organized around three major themes: the self or recognizing people in premodern society; literary techniques for reading historical texts; and historicizing sexuality and gender.
