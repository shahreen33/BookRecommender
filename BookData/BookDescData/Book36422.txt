What's it like to be a monster in a town full of monsters, who don't know you're a monster? Complicated and a little scary, but doable.  What's it like to be the girl who can't die...that everyone seems to always want to kill? Frustrating as hell.  What's it like to accidentally raise psychotic alpha vampire everyone fears, who drops a lot of bodies on his first day out as a 'gift' for your troubles? Terrifying, if I'm being honest.  What's it like when that crazed vampire tells you he wants you to be the happy little intermission, during an ongoing ancient story, and expects you to use your vagina to draw in a werewolf alpha, a Van Helsing alpha, and a sexual deviant alpha, so he can have his old friends back? That's when a girl has to stop, look around, and question her life choices.  I really don't know how this stuff keeps happening to me. Life was simpler when it was just me accidentally blowing myself up while trying to create potions and shampoo.  I've lived my life in such secrecy that I've spent most of it lonely. So lonely, in fact, that my best friend is a delusional ghost. I'd rather focus on her than all the crazy things happening in my life at current. Ever since coming to this town, I've had my throat slit by vampires, attracted way too much attention from some powerful alphas, and did a lot of regrettably stupid things because...I'm too gullible for shady monsters.  To them, I'm the fool. To them, I'm the naive girl in over my head. To them, I'm the pawn on a worn chessboard, while the seasoned players knock me around.  Meanwhile, I'm still left to figure it all out on my own, because, just like me, no one wants to share their secrets.  **Reverse Harem **Sexual Content **DARK HUMOR **Cannot be read as a stand-alone (Gypsy Blood is book 1.) **Language warning
