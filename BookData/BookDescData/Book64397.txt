The definitive account of the Krays’ world, their criminal activities, and two lives spent running the Firm. Until now books on the Krays have been subjective and incomplete—memoirs by police officers and witnesses, or whitewashing accounts and affectionate recollections by friends and family. This will be the first wholly objective look at how the twins came to power, fell, and, at least in the public eye, rose again. The book will draw together the many often conflicting versions of events—at least five reasons have been offered for the death of George Cornell—and separate fact from fiction. It will include many stories never previously disclosed, such as: • Charlie Kray’s real position with his brothers. In recent years there have been allegations that he was both a serial molester of women and a police informer, both far from the general picture of a hail-fellow-well-met man manipulated by his younger brothers. • The Krays’ bribing and intimidation of witnesses and their use of solicitors and the clergy to set up potential defences against police action. • Just how many people did they kill, or were killed on their behalf? The book will examine claims that they killed up to 30, including an analysis of their possible involvement in the deaths of lawyer David Jacobs and former world champion boxer Freddie Mills.
