When Fenn's best friend is injured on the job as a big city cop, Fenn welcomes Jason home to Montana. After all they both grew up on Fenn's father's ranch, both cowboys through and through. The challenge is that Fenn has loved Jason since they were teenagers. He's held up a facade for years, bedding women but never committing to any. How can he possibly keep his hands to himself when the cowboy he's longed for is finally within reach?Jason has pursued his dream of one day having his own family, something he's never had. But when his wife files for divorce and a suspect shoots him because his mind is filled with his failed dream, he has no choice but to return to his hometown and to Fenn who has always been there for him. As Jason's therapy for a wounded heart, Fenn has assigned him to work side-by-side with him as one of Fenn's ranch hands. But coming home for Jason means facing what he'd probably run from in the first place--the fact that he's never been able to take his eyes off his best friend for long. He shouldn't notice how Fenn's smile brightens his world, how his blond hair glints in the Montana sunlight, or worst of all, how big, hard, and sexy Fenn's body is.
