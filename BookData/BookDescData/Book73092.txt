Anton Szandor LaVey has been called "the most dangerous man in the world," a "charlatan," an "evil genius." What secrets lurk within the man who shaved his head on Walpurgisnacht, 1966, and declared the foundation of the Church of Satan?For many years, Anton LaVey has directed his mysterious organization in seclusion, declining all public appearances, and refusing most interviews. Having gained admittance into LaVey's inner circle as his assistant and confidante, Blanche Barton knows the "Black Pope" as well as anyone on earth. Written with the full cooperation of her enigmatic subject, Miss Barton's biography reveals what has previously been hidden from public view. In "Secret Life of a Satanist" we are treated to the full and unexpurgated stories behind:* LaVey's erotic involvement with Marilyn Monroe during her "lost years" as a stripper, and Jayne Mansfield's fatal infatuation with the Devil.* The dark origins of Satanic ritual, including ties to Sir Basil Zaharoff and the mysterious "Black Order" in Nazi Germany.* LaVey's early career as a hoodlum, carny, burlesque house organist, Zionist operative, lion tamer, and ghost hunter for the San Francisco Police Department.* LaVeyan philosophy and aims, combining misanthropy, eco-terrorism and nostalgia to forge the future Satanic Empire.* How the strange powers attributed to LaVey have affected his enemies, and friends."The Secret Life of a Satanist" is augmented by 24 pages of photographs, many never before seen, from LaVey's personal collection. An appendix includes several documents and essays by Anton LaVey, including instructions on lycanthropic transformation previously rejected by publishers for fear of provoking a "bloodbath."Here is, finally, an uninterrupted and unexpurgated visit with the author of The Satanic Bible, The Satanic Witch, and The Satanic Rituals, a man who has devoted his life to the overthrow of Judeo-Christian ideals.
