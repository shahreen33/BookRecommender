Dear Author,We’ve been best friends since elementary school. We were each other’s first everything; friends, kiss, lovers, boyfriends and almost husbands. We were happy once, the kind of happy that makes others sick, envious, jealous, I could go on and on… but things changed. I thought it was what we needed, this thing I did, and I didn’t think it through. He’s not with me anymore, he’s gone. Now, I have to make it right. I have to fix this. I can’t lose him. I’ll do whatever it takes.Photo Description: Three pictures: the first is a couple holding hands during a spa treatment. Adorable, but not the one I wish to focus on. The second is where the story gets interesting— it displays a man kneeling on a bed naked, in deep contemplation. Look at his body— he is tense, conflicted, out of sorts… It’s a fascinating state of mind. The third is a GIF displaying self-resentment, pain and determination— three pictures, one perfect story arc.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "Love is an Open Road" event.
