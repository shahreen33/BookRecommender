When 28-year-old Valentin Romanovsky discovers that he will be infertile by the time he hits his 30s, he goes into an all-out panic. Young, rich, and notoriously single, Val was sure he had all the time in the world to drink, party, and enjoy the beautiful women who were constantly at his disposal. Best known as the Romanovsky brother who thrived on living in the fast lane, he always partied hard with the distant dream of having a wife and a family one day. If that dream had any chance of coming true he knew he had no choice but to settle down... and fast. But with who? Late night trysts and one night stands were his calling card. There wasn't a single woman in his life who he could picture being the mother of his child.  Except the one woman he knew he could never have.  Zoey Black would always have deep love in her heart for the Romanovsky family. They'd taken her in at fourteen when she’d been at the lowest point in her life, with no place else to go, and treated her as their own. Ten years later, the Romanovskys were still apart of her life--as far as Zoey was concerned, they were her family. The parents called her “daughter” and the four brothers called her “sister.”  Well, not all four.  Val Romanovsky never called her "sister", and as secrets, lies, and betrayals are revealed, Zoey would finally understand why.  Interracial erotic romance. Strong sexual content, strong language. TAMING VAL is the first novella in The Romanovsky Brothers four-part series
