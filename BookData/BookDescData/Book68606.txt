Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix was a Roman general and statesmen who would become dictator of Rome. Dictatorship in the ancient world was very different than how it is thought of today - a single man was elected to take charge to pull the country back from the precipice. And that is exactly what Sulla did, fighting for both the interests of the rich and poor and leading Rome to military victory.
