The man I’ve been secretly in love with for years.And total ass.I am so done with him.Except there’s one small problem.Now that I’ve cut him off, his hockey game is in the toilet. He’s convinced I’m his good luck charm, and he wants me back. But only for his game.I’ll be strong. I will. I’ll resist.Asses don’t change their stripes.Or do they?This plan would be so easy if the man wasn't Charming as Puck...Charming as Puck is a romping fun romance between a hockey player and his sister's best friend, complete with farm animals, epic birthday presents, and Berger Twin sightings. This romantic comedy stands alone with no cheating or cliffhangers and ends with a pucking awesome happily ever after.
