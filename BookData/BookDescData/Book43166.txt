This "deeply moving book" (Studs Terkel) portrays the Japanese experience of WWII. This oral history is the first book to capture - in either Japanese or English - the experience of ordinary Japanese during the war. In a sweeping panorama, Haruko Taya Cook &amp; Theodore F. Cook go from the Japanese attacks on China in the '30s to the Japanese home front during the inhuman raids on Tokyo, Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki, offering the first glimpses of how the 20th century's most deadly conflict affected the lives of the population. The book "seeks out the true feelings of the wartime generation &amp; illuminates the contradictions between the official views of the war &amp; living testimony" (Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan).
