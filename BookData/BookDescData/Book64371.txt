Take one Marquess, responsible, worldly, deadly dull but concealing an artist's soul.Add one rebellious, brilliantly creative but lonely young lady who craves love, home and family.Combine with ill-assorted guests at an ill-fated house party hosted by a dowager with a poison tongue and a penchant for scandal.You'll be shaken, you'll be stirred, you'll laugh and you'll swoon-most of all you'll be tossed into an intriguing Victorian love story that you'll never want to leave.
