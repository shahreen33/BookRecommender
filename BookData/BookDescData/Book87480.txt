“For women readers, this is a romantic international spy novel; for men, it’s an international spy novel with romance – all wrapped up in a true life suspense thriller written with Dan Brown flare.”First in the SILENT CATS series, JD Wallace's Deadly Dance spins the mind-bending, genre-blurring fictionalized true story based on the life of Kat, the youngest Kidon Katsa Assassin in the history of Mossad, and her husband, Pantera, the fabled Chief Black Site Interrogator, who worked under such special access programs as the Operation Copper Green (created under Donald Rumsfeld), the United Nations Security Council – Special Operations Group (UN-SOG), and Task Forces 88 and 121.Reaching back to 1989, Kat and Pantera meet in the City of Seven Hills, beautiful Rome, Italy, at a U.S. Embassy New Year’s Eve ball, kicking off their 16-year relationship in the onion-layered world of covert operatives, spy hunters, slave traders, and sovereign-paid intelligence peddlers. Of necessity, their encounters are beset by lies wrapped in half-truths, concealed in shadowy realities. Kat and Pantera maneuver through action-packed covert operations, romantic encounters, torture, and acrobatic combat, all while coming to grips about who they’re hunting and who is hunting them.
