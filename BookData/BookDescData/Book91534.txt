THE PAST IS STILL OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. IT. MUSTN’T. COME. BACK.  Detective Inspector Tracy Collier has at last swept her past under the carpet, but someone else’s is about to come billowing out in a cloud of death. A dead body found beside a stream brings more questions than answers, and the clock is ticking, putting Tracy on edge.  Further grating on her nerves is an old friend, DI Kane Barnett, a man she once knew intimately but now sees as a pain in her backside. Tracy has been brought in to head a serious crimes squad, ousting Kane from his previous position as lead detective. Kane doesn’t like being demoted—who would?—and his lack of support has the potential to derail the case.  Tracy vows to concentrate on the killer rather than Kane, and she goes through the motions trying to catch the murderer, but there’s something about Kane’s behaviour that’s niggling her. Something to do with his previous case where a good girl had gone bad.  What is Kane up to? And will Tracy find out, along with capturing a killer—a killer who has a mind to strike again and again, bringing secrets out into the open that have long been hidden behind closed doors? And, with the appearance of a person from The Past, Tracy has to face her reasons for what she does next, proving she will forever carry all that deceit.  DI KANE BARNETT’S STORY IS AVAILABLE NOW: GOOD GIRL GONE BAD
