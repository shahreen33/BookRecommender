Still a legend in his own lifetime, the Hawk, hero or anti-hero of THE ROAD TO GANDOLFO, is back, irrepressibly maddening, a $500 million caper up his sleeve. Worshipped by the men he once led into battle, General MacKenzie Hawkins is now in his sixties, and shows no sign of retiring from the intrigue and politicking which is his lifeblood. And it is Sam Devereaux's misfortune to be yet again dragged into the Hawk's endless quest for justice, honour - and, of course, loot. Crammed with wit, action, intrigue and suspense, this is brilliant entertainment from the master of action.
