With this bundle, collect all four editions of Keri Smithâ€™s Wreck This Journal, including the classic black, as well as three special limited edition covers: duct-tape, red mesh, and paper bag.  In these updated editions, Wreck This Journal asks readers to muster up their best mistake and mess-making abilities and to fill the pages of the book (or destroy them). Through a series of creatively and quirkily illustrated prompts, acclaimed artist Keri Smith encourages journalers to engage in "destructive" acts--poking holes through pages, adding photos and defacing them, painting pages with coffee, coloring outside the lines, and more--in order to experience the true creative process. With Smith's unique sensibility, readers are introduced to a new way of art and journal making, discovering novel ways to escape the fear of the blank page and fully engage in the creative process..
