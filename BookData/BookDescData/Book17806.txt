Some Murders Shouldn't Be InvestigatedThe City of San Francisco is locked in a grip of fear. A series of occult murders has led, Inspector Thomas James, to a crime scene similar to a murder committed 90 years ago in the once grand Aleris Hotel. A place where power barons of the early 20th Century engaged in witchcraft. And silent film stars indulged in the most wicked of sins.A place where no one questions the black smoke that rises from the hotel's incinerators in the middle of the night.
