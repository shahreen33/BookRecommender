’Cause sometimes luck ain’t enoughIn the year since the Whisperer’s attack, I’ve been busting my hump to become my best wizard, like my father. Now I’m ready for a test.When a dark mage starts planting infernal bags around New York City, I get my wish. Like time bombs, the bags detonate without warning, spawning demonic beings that rip the souls of innocents from their bodies. And the attacks are accelerating.Meanwhile, a new wizard has come to town. A recent addition to the Order, Pierce is everything I’m not: refined, self-assured, and adept at magic. He even has Detective Vega blushing. If riling my resentment wasn’t enough, he’s trying to shoulder me out of my own case, stoking my suspicions.With the race to stop the dark mage growing more desperate by the minute, I need to prove that I’m the wizard to get it done—not Pierce. And without relying on my luck quotient.That saying about being careful what you wish for?It’s there for a reason.BOOKS IN THE STRANGEVERSEProf CroftPreq. 0: Book of SoulsBook 1: Demon MoonBook 2: Blood DealBook 3: Purge CiyBook 4: Death MageBook 5: Black Luck* More to come *Blue WolfBook 1: Blue CurseBook 2: Blue Shadow* More to come *
