The ultimate sacrifice…  Drenched in wealth and power, Caspian holds my city by the throat. No man or woman denies him, not even me.  But he owes me a debt I intended to collect.  Our trade was fair—my submission to his pack for the lives of my wards.  Pleasure, willing female attention, affection, he’s starved for such things. Starved for me.  And though he may have tricked me into his bed, he will never have what I know he longs for most. My heart.  Not so long as he holds the lives of my family hostage.  Ravaged Captive: Wren’s Song Book 4 is a dark, sinister Omegaverse Reverse Harem tale for those with twisted tastes and a love for unabashed bad boys. Complete power exchange dominates these pages, as do THREE smoking-hot Alpha antiheroes.
