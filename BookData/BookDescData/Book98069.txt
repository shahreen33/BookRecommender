 Debuted a top 15 book in humour.A STANDALONE romantic comedy from author Melissa Williams. A hot cop and a donut baker, what could go wrong? It was a donut emergency. A dough or die moment.At least, that’s what I’m telling myself. It would explain why, from the moment Baxter DeCavhalo comes crashing into my kitchen, I’ve been acting out of character.Why I’m sharing secret donut recipes, licking frosting off fingers that aren’t mine, and falling for the off-limits neighbor. I know better, I need to be focusing on my bakery and my next donut creation…but there’s just something about Bax that keeps me coming back for more.It’s not the heat of the kitchen that’s getting to me, it’s Bax. And this slow burn is about to combust.
