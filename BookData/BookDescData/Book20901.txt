Separation. We all get one true love in our lives, and it's up to us to find it. Fate will act and try to push us together, but ultimately it's up to us to recognize who that one person is when he's standing in front of us. It turns out that I recognized who my one person was when I was separated from my husband. Anxiety. On the same day I determined that I was finally going to file for divorce, I confessed my secret to Jesse Drake, my swoon-worthy colleague known for his womanizing ways. Jesse invited me to crash with him, and with each new piece of the enigmatic Jesse puzzle that I started to fit into place, I found myself wondering if Fate had pushed us together for a reason. If only my husband would stop getting in the way of the man with whom I was meant to be.
