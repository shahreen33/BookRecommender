Willa Knight: Dweller? Bad-ass? Notorious pet to five magical beings?  In Blesswood, there are rules, and someone is trying to teach her how to follow them. The only problem is Willa. Which shouldn’t be anything new, since she has been a problem since birth—something her pseudo-sister Emmy would agree on.  So it definitely shouldn’t be new … but it is.  Because things are starting to happen that have never happened before.  Things are starting to get …chaotic.  This is a full novel, 90,000 words. Book 2 of 5 in the Curse of the Gods Series
