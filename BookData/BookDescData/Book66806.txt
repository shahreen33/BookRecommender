C O M I N G S O O N . . .SAINT College turned out to be my first everything. Love.Sex.Heartbreak.Giving up and running home wasn’t an option.I was in too deep.My life was strained before I met Oliver – no father figure, an absentee mom, a night of regret haunting me, and living life so controlled I barely let myself live at all.But all I wanted was to save Oliver more than myself. Isn’t that what unconditional love is?SINNERCollege was suppose to be my second chance.I was working on my third.I broke her heart in record time.Everyone leaves and no one ever comes back. Even Layla.The guilt and pressure of another self destructive regret weighted too heavy. So heavy I invited my demons back in to soften the blow.I added mistakes to my bad reputation.I was proving everyone right about me.It was never the demons driving my decisions, she was never the cure, and I’m simply a pretty face with an ugly past.
