A tree has bloomed on a city block outside a house for many years. Inside that house, several generations of a family have grown up. Grandma and Grandpa arrived at the house from a country far away, and Mom and her brothers played on the steps on warm summer days. This little girl learned how to walk on that street, too. Hyewon Yum's This is Our House is a warm story withÂ spare text that follows a family through seasons and generations, from the early days of immigration to the times that made their house into a home.A Frances Foster Book
