LIGHTSPEED is an online science fiction and fantasy magazine. In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF--and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales.  Our cover this month is by Reiko Murakami, illustrating a new original science fiction short from Ashok K. Banker ("Tongue"). Our other original SF this month is from Christopher East ("An Inflexible Truth"). We also have SF reprints by Andrea Kail ("The Sun God At Dawn, Rising From A Lotus Blossom") and Carrie Vaughn ("Swing Time"). Plus, we have original fantasy by Susan Palwick ("The Shining Hills") and Bruce McAllister ("Ink"), and fantasy reprints by Ken Scholes ("East of Eden and Just a Bit South") and Seanan McGuire ("A Citizen in Childhood's Country"). All that, and of course we also have our book and media review columns, spotlights on our fantastic writers, and an interview with Annalee Newitz. For our ebook readers, we also have an ebook-exclusive reprint of the novella "Steppin' Razor," by Maurice Broaddus. Our excerpt this month is from Daniel H. Wilson's new novel, THE CLOCKWORK DYNASTY.
