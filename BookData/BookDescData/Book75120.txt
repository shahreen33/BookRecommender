The best-selling author of ANIMORPHS and EVERWORLD presents a fresh, exciting, and gritty new science-fiction series that combines a little 2001, a little Armageddon, and a whole lot of action! Three groups race to gain control of the ship and Mother--the ship's power source and the Remnants' only chance to create a new Earth. It's a race against the clock, each other, and forces beyond human comprehension...it's a race the humans may not be capable of winning. And it all leads to the ultimate face-off between Billy and the Baby's true form. Will the Baby prove indestructible? Will Billy be able to tap hidden powers? Their conflict rushes toward an end so finite, so unbelievable, weapons will be dropped in awe, fighting will cease for a time...and new enemies will emerge.
