  Deck the halls with knives, chains, and dangerous children’s toys!
  Team Alpha is celebrating the holidays, but a surprise blizzard has snowed them in at Bossman and Papa P’s house, along with a few friends.  Not that Papa P minds. He’ll take any excuse to keep his loved ones close and stuff them full of good food.  It’s not only snow that’s flying through the air, however. Omega counselor Dean and Team Beta leader Sam may have found more than a little holiday cheer while joining the team’s holiday festivities.  And Christmas wouldn’t be Christmas without Bossman and Papa P recounting the joy of their anniversary… and the hard times that came before.  This book is best enjoyed if you’ve already read the previous Team Alpha stories, as there are plenty of in-jokes, purple sparkly knives, and growing children sprinkled throughout this tale. As always, you can expect some naughty knotty fun, humor not suitable to share with your mother-in-law, and all your favorite characters. Trigger warnings: graphic violence and mention of human trafficking. HEA definitely included, intended for 18+ readers only. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown?
