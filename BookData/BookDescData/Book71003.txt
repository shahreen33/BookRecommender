Wellston is in love with his father's best friend, but to save his heart, he tries to avoid the man who only sees him as the kid he used to know.  Wilder came back home after eight years to find that the kid he used to know was gone and in his place was a gorgeous man with no sign of the shy child he remembered. Two years have passed since that reunion, and he is no less enamored by the twenty-two-year-old and endlessly drawn in by the need to rile the messy, but somewhat uptight young man. He knows he needs to step back. How the hell would pursuing something with Wellston even work? How would he ever face his best friend?
