Cleo Hill is a married woman, in love with a man she's never really known—her husband, whom she hasn't seen in eleven years.  Paxton "Torch" Hill is a Notorious Devil, a man who's been wrestling with his personal demons since before he knew the horrors of war.  When a threat against his club means danger could be lurking around his estranged wife's door, Paxton is determined to protect her. Yet, one look at the woman he left behind, and he knows his plans are about to change.  The past is not an easy thing to forget, especially not for a woman scorned. While Cleo isn't the innocent catch he once knew, there's something about that rough and ready man she's not sure she can deny.  After all—they promised each other forever.  *Recommended for readers 18+ due to Language, Sexual Content, and Violence
