Rebekah is not your ordinary pre-veterinary student: she's only seventeen years old, and she's Amish! On the surface, Rebekah seems to be adjusting well to college life. She's dating Braeden, a sophomore hottie, and she's even getting along with her flighty, messy roommate Allie. But as Rebekah struggles with her demanding classes and the competitive atmosphere on campus, she realizes that there is something missing from her college experience: the beautiful Amish faith that she grew up with. Rebekah visits her Amish community, where she is pressured by her family and the church elders to rejoin the Amish faith. She faces gut-wrenching questions: Can she bring her faith to college life, or must she return to live among the Amish? Can she find a way to excel academically, or will freshman biology and chemistry steal away her dreams? And is there a place for Braeden in her life, or must she leave her love behind to be true to her faith?
