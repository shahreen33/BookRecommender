My name is Camille Richards. I'm a simple woman and I love my quiet life and work hard to keep it that way. I write romance stories, the kind where the man crashes into her life and completes her world while they fall madly in love with each other. Damon Deverick is the epitome of complicated. What this man does to me is unlike anything I’ve ever dealt with and I think that’s my problem. I don’t know how to respond to him. He’s powerful even when he stands completely still, not saying a word… but when he touches me it’s as if everything before that very moment was minuscule in comparison.Who knew I'd be this intrigued after a single day with him? It’s supposed to be easy... but there’s just one problem, to him this is work and I’m not sure I can separate business from pleasure because it seems to be one in the same when it involves him.
