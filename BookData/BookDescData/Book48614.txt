  My entire life can be summed up in one sentence: 

  "Well, that didn't go as planned."
--T-ShirtA typical day in the life of Charley Davidson involves cheating husbands, errant wives, missing people, philandering business owners, and, oh yeah...demons, hell hounds, evil gods, and dead people--lots of them. As a part-time private investigator and full-time Grim Reaper, Charley has to balance the good, the bad, and the undead. And those who want her dead, of course. But Charley's learning to make peace with her fate: Sure, the forces of hell are determined to see Charley banished forever to the darkest corners of another dimension--with the son of Satan himself as her husband and world-rocking lover. But she can still find a way to have her happily-ever-after after all...right? Praise for the Grave!
