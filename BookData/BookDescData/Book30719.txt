After years of enjoying the quiet, civilian life, former Recon Marine Brandon Colson still has a large price on his head. . . only his family doesn't know it. That is, until heavily armed terrorists break into his house and try to kill him and his family. After swiftly dispatching the would-be assassins, Colson realizes the ghosts from his past have somehow managed to come back to haunt him. His identity--a secret until now--has been mysteriously compromised. Something he did years ago has kept anger burning in the hearts of powerful Arab adversaries. With his family in hiding, Colson and local detective Sam Collier set out to locate and neutralize the remainder of the terrorist cell.
