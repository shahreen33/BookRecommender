TORI  I’ve been living on borrowed time since I was born. My dreams were big. But my reality cut them down to size. The life I’ve settled for is small. Safe. Stifling. Until I meet him.  He’s my forbidden fruit. My guilty pleasure. My greatest danger. He has me dreaming of a life I never thought I could have. He teaches me to hope. To want. To crave.  If I’m not careful, Dante D’Agostino will have me dreaming of happily ever afters. And that’s the most dangerous dream of all.   DANTE  I don’t believe in miracles. Fairy tales are for chumps. In my world, only the strong survive, and love is a weakness.  Then I meet her. She’s no princess in a tower. She’s a fighter. A warrior. She’s the strongest woman I know.  Before I knew it, she set my life ablaze. Then, before I could stop her, she melted my iron heart.  This sure as f*ck ain’t no fairy tale. I don’t know what the f*ck it is.  This Lois Lane doesn’t need a superman. She doesn’t want a protector. But protect her I will. With my life if I have to. Tori Lowe has changed my life forever. And I’m never going back.
