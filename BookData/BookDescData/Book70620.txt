A PIRATEâ€™S PASSION Sam Bellamy is a notorious pirate--dark, dangerous, and devilishly handsome. In innocence, young Maria Hallett teases him, taunts him...and surrenders to a scorching seduction that leaves her in disgrace as his ship sails. But Sam cannot forget Maria--his golden-haired angel, a haunting beauty whose awakened sensual passion has seared his very soul with tormented longing. When he returns it is to claim her, to sweep her into his pirate's world--on a perilous voyage of daring dreams and dangerous desires...and a confrontation with a love that thunders with the raging passion of the stormy sea.
