"This is a very tumultuous journey of self-discovery, and I worry that once I finally arrive at the doorstep of myself, I will knockâ€”and the door will open to reveal an empty house."In the Hands of a Mischievous God is an intimate portrait of a young artist and her earliest memories. This stunning collection is written with frank, disarming honesty, and ranges from reflections on the rooms in her childhood home to her views on the concept of love. Each essay follows the red strings of fate and explores just what it means for a girl to grow up.
