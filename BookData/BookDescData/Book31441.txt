Until, after Reid’s bought their plane tickets and made all the plans, Topher dumps him. Rather than stay home and mope, he chooses the possible lesser evil and heads for Mapleville. He’ll deal with his misery and the snowball of ways his life is falling apart when he gets home. One thing for sure, he’s not going to make important decisions based on the vagaries of an unreliable love life. Maybe the good things of life are just not meant for him.

He longs for a mate, someone to spend his life with, raise a family with and in small-town Mapleville, there just wasn’t anyone who fit the bill.

Between switching orders and outbursts there was nothing more he wanted than to have the wedding be over and done with. Until a coffee shop encounter with Reid turned his world on its axis. Instant chemistry and a connection like none he’d experienced before had him wanting time to slow giving him the opportunity to convince Reid to stay in Mapleville and be his omega, his mate.
