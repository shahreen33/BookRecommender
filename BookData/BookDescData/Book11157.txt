Jamie has Down’s syndrome, autistic spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He is a beautiful, charming and lovable little boy, but he is also - how can we put this? - an exceptionally “challenging” child. In this hilarious, heart-warming and unforgettable memoir, Jamie's long-suffering dad shares a selection of side-splitting and occasionally poignant stories from Jamie’s unconventional childhood. Find out why he can never go back to his local library, and why the staff at his local swimming pool flinch whenever he arrives. The author also offers his own witty take on all sorts of topics connected to the subject of disability, and parenthood in general.
