*Book five in the hugely successful zompoc series*  ODIUM V The Dead Saga  On route to find their friends, Nina and Michael find so much more. After almost being killed by the Hell’s Highwaymen—a fifty strong motorcycle gang, Nina and Michael are forced to take refuge at their headquarters until Michael recovers. Finding a new purpose in life isn't easy, but Nina is realizing that she's stronger than she believes and needed more than she knows. At least, that’s what Shooter—the brutish, blue-eyed president of the biker gang, keeps telling her. *  Meanwhile, Mikey is trapped in the candy store. Phil is gone, so is O’Donnell, and who knows what’s happened to Ricky. All Mikey knows is that he’s in for a whole world of pain unless he can think of a way to escape before Tim and Clare turn him into their lunch. * With both of their lives hanging in the balance and heading in completely different directions, Nina and Mikey drift further apart. And it’s not just distance that separates them. Because when your fates keep pulling you away from one another, maybe it’s time to just call it a day and move on.
