Young cop and bodyguard Mitchell Graves earns his keep -- and his first time in a billionaire's bed -- with mayor-to-be James Russo in this next installment of The Billionaire and the Bodyguard. After Russo pushes them past the limits of professionalism, Graves' dedication and training are put to the test when a madman takes a shot at Russo. What started as a borderline boring assignment now spirals, the two men's fates becoming inextricably linked. EXCERPT:'Mitchell can barely catch up to himself, can barely keep track of his own body, and before he has any idea what he’s doing, he realizes both of his hands are balled into Russo’s sweater, realizes that his head is tilted up and his mouth is open wide as the older man kisses into him, realizes that the man tastes like champagne and whiskey and that Mitchell is very much in danger of allowing himself to drown in this sensation without a second thought.Mitchell drags their mouths apart.“Sir, I don’t think – "But Russo doesn’t relent. He closes the distance between them again, interrupting him, setting an urgent pace. And when Mitchell breaks a second time to speak, Russo continues undeterred, kissing under Mitchell’s jaw, down his neck as Mitchell speaks.“It’s been a strange day. We shouldn’t do this,” Mitchell says. Russo just grinds into him in response.“We should absolutely do this,” Russo says, kissing him again. Mitchell tries not to kiss back and it’s impossible, too good, and all of the blood in his body seems to have rushed to his groin. Mitchell’s logical brain surges forth again, and he forces himself to pull back.'
