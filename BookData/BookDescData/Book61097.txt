A Christmas Shifter Story. Katherine "Kat" Strudwick convinces herself this Christmas will be like all the other ones before it where she is stuck in the middle of the hell of purgatory that is unrequited love. At twenty-four, she avoids the object of her affection by remaining in her shifter form—a feather-tailed glider. She has no idea this Christmas is going to be different from all the others.  Declan Garrett is a man who knows who he is and what he wants. He’s known for several years Kat is his mate, but rather than pursuing her, he honoured his best friend’s request to wait. As a scientific researcher, he knows all about the value of patience.  This Christmas, Declan is ready to show Kat that they belong together by courting her polar bear shifter style.  The gifts are purchased. His plans are set. Now he can only hope the little mouse doesn’t lead him on too long of a chase.
