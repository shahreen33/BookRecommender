 The temptation to sin and lure of the forbidden can be impossible to ignore.  Sex Education, A Woman's Awakening: The Series: Rebecca Beiler's recent sexual urges are at odds with her strict religious upbringing. Married at 17 to a sexually repressed man who left her a widow, at age 26 she now finds herself yearning to be taken hard by hot men with chiseled bodies. When an indiscretion with a neighbor leads to a six-month expulsion from her community, Rebecca attempts to purge herself of her sinful desires by giving into them, in full. Unfortunately, each new intoxicating encounter only intensifies her cravings â€” intense lustful cravings for physical ecstasy that lead Rebecca to dark recesses of the sexual underground and compel her to do things the likes of which she never imagined herself capable.  In Book 1 Rebecca inadvertently sees a pornographic image that spurs in her a dormant desire for sex. One thing leads to another until she's forced to embark on the adventure of a lifetime, one that will lead her to question her former life and spark a fierce hunger for physical pleasure.  This series was formerly published under the name Shunned.
