How can you say goodbye to the love of your life?In Undying Michel Faber honours the memory of his wife, who died after a six-year battle with cancer. Bright, tragic, candid and true, these poems are an exceptional chronicle of what it means to find the love of your life. And what it is like to have to say goodbye.All I can do, in what remains of my brief time,is mention, to whoever cares to listen,that a woman once existed, who was kindand beautiful and brave, and I will not forgethow the world was altered, beyond recognition,when we met.
