The Summer Solstice brings new mysteries from the deep.  Tourist season is underway in the coastal community of Beechwood Harbor. Holly Boldt is up to her eyebrows in work. Between the coffee shop and her potion business, things are moving at a break-neck pace. But when a teenage runaway starts causing trouble around the harbor, she has to step in, especially when she realizes the terrified girl isn’t just another out-of-towner on summer vacation.  With her posse of magical misfits, Holly’s ready to kick up some sand and get to the bottom of the guarded teen’s dilemma. After all, summer in Beechwood wouldn’t be any fun without a little magic mystery.  **Previously published in the Spell or High Water Anthology.** ***Fits in the timeline after the events of Lucky Witch, book five in the Beechwood Harbor Magic Mystery series.**
