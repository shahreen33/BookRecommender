What happens to a story when it ends too soon?When Eva and Adam fall into bed one Friday night, tired and happy after drinks with friends, they have their whole lives ahead of them. But then their story ends.How I Lose You is a love story told backwards – the story of Eva and Adam, which is warmer and funnier and more beautiful because we know it is going to be interrupted. It’s a story Eva thought she knew – but as she will discover, it’s not just the ending of the story that she got wrong.
