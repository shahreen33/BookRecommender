Smart, blond attorney Whitney Lambert and her sexy Chicana sister-in-arms, Lupe Ramos, are back in a hip, noir mystery that spirals deep into L.A.'s Koreatown. When the two women arrive in Koreatown to collect Lupe's son from his grandmother, they come upon a masked intruder who has just tied up two old ladies, murdered one, and made off with the $75,000 savings of a Korean widows' club.
