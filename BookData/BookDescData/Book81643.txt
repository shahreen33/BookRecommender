A powerful novel about innocence and guilt, atonement and healing, friendship and betrayal, Trinity Fields maps the landscape of the American soul. Kip and Brice were best friends, born on the same day in 1944 in Los Alamos, New Mexico, the most secret place on earth. Sons of men who engineered the atom bomb, they play macabre games as children, tempting the fate that looms over their closed community. As they come of age in the mid-60s, Brice is drawn into antiwar activism, while Kip disappears into Vietnam and ultimately into the secret war in Laos-leaving Brice to marry Jessica, the woman they both love. Twenty-five years later, Kip returns, a ghost soldier come, perhaps, to reclaim what was lost.  "Brilliant . . . dramatically real and poignantly felt . . . a remarkable feat." (Chicago Tribune)  "Morrow's assiduous probing of the intricacies of moral choice hits us where we live-or ought to live." (The New York Times Book Review)  "Astonishing in its breadth and vision-an intimate record of a dangerous age." (The Boston Globe)
