Harry Whitewolf’s hard-hitting, straight-talking, seventh collection of poetry combines topical anti-establishment and anti-fascist themes with anecdotal reminiscing, personal confessions, and verse about immigration, television, drugs, pubs, cigs and gigs, delivered with Whitewolf’s humorous, playful, passionate and distinctive voice.Unpretentious and powerful poetry for the underbelly of twenty-first century society.
