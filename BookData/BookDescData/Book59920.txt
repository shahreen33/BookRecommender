Carry the Pocket Gospels and Acts of the Apostles with you, and keep the Word of God as your constant guide and inspiration! in April, Pope Francis handed out thousands of pocket-sized copies of the Gospels and Acts. He asked the faithful to read a passage every day, saying, "This is the word of Jesus!" This small pocket-sized book, with a durable Kivar cover, has the four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles with a beautiful Italian fresco on the cover just like the Pope's! Take it with you and read it anytime you have a few minutes during the day. On the bus! Waiting for an appointment! Anytime!
