The brilliant mind of Grant Morrison (Animal Man, Doom Patrol) is showcased once again as his most groundbreaking and ambitious project concludes! Independently, each of these characters is featured in a story arc that redefines his or her purpose in the DCU. But their stories also interweave with the other Soldiers' tales, forming a grander story of a devastating global threat to mankind. Together these reluctant champions must arise and somehow work together to save the world...without ever meeting one another!Collecting: Frankenstein 2-4, Mister Miracle 3-4, Bulleteer 3-4, Seven Soldiers of Victory 1
