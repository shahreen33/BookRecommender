Sage Primrose dreams of the day she meets the man who will sweep her off her feet. She didn't expect him to abduct her while she wore nothing but a towel. Why did bad men have to look oh, so good?  Feral Kincaid will do anything to protect his family. When a human female supposedly kidnaps his niece, he goes to get her, claws blazing. But the abductor turns into the abductee and suddenly he has to figure out how to apologize to the one woman he needs to forgive him: his mate.  This tiger isn't used to romance in his life; he's too busy protecting his pride from a rival determined to take his land. But Feral would gladly take on bad guys instead of trying to figure out how to romance a human female. Sage needs to watch out. Feral is hellbent on romance and his target is her.
