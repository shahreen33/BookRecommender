This is Book 2 of 2 in the Version 2.0 series, and can be read as a stand alone novel.
  Scott McAllister's attitude is as much a part of his software empire's public image as its bestselling video gamesâ€”there's no way he's letting his board of directors force him to behave just because someone might be watching.  Then he meets his new publicity manager. Kenzie Carter is gorgeous, intelligent, and order driven to a fault. Having her around is the perfect excuse to get down and dirty during business hours. While he's at it, he'll show her the appeal of embracing chaos, and claim he's complying with the board's edict.  And as long as he doesn't fall for the woman who's supposed to make over his geeky exterior, he can pretend screwing around with her isn't a conflict of interest.  Warning: This book contains a score-list topping, top secret office romance between a billionaire video game executive and his publicity manager.  Publisher's Note: This book was previously released as Conflict of Interest (Bits & Bytes Book 1). It has been newly edited for this re-release.
