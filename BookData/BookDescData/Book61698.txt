This holiday season, there’s more than gingerbread in the oven. I was always a type-A kind of girl— and that’s exactly what got me into trouble with Sterling Ahren. Having a baby before thirty didn’t work out, so I took some time off to sort out my life. Sterling’s my new landlord… and he doesn’t plan anything.He’s a billionaire playboy who can’t stand the holidays. A recluse of the worst kind, Sterling makes Scrooge look like a generous soul… except Ebenezer was never this sexy. He doesn’t want a family— until the night we have a spontaneous one-night stand, and forget to use condoms. I can’t have a baby with a disorganized, free spirit like him. Between my overprotective brothers and his crazy fans, I already know this isn’t going to work out.Except Sterling isn’t willing to let me go. He wants me home for the holidays… and this is my last chance to make a Christmas miracle happen. One thing I know for sure: when Sterling and I collide, it’s going to be anything but a silent night. Funny, touching, and delightful, this smoking hot billionaire holiday rom-com by Claudia Burgoa will make you feel the magic of Christmas.
