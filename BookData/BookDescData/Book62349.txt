Popol Vuh, the Quiché Mayan book of creation, isn't only the most important text in the native languages of the Americas, it's also an extraordinary document of the human imagination. It begins with the deeds of Mayan gods in the darkness of a primeval sea &amp; ends with the radiant splendor of the Mayan lords who founded the Quiché kingdom in the Guatemalan highlands. Originally written in Mayan hieroglyphs, it was transcribed into the Roman alphabet in the 16th century. This new edition of Dennis Tedlock's unabridged, widely praised translation includes new notes &amp; commentary, newly translated passages, newly deciphered hieroglyphs &amp; over 40 new illustrations.
