'The Erotic Muse' is the story of K, a young porn-addicted college-dropout who shies away from relationships and harbors dreams of becoming a writer. Full of anguish, he is given to self-abuse. One evening, while masturbating to his favorite erotic muse, Fanny Leone, sprawled on the cover of an underground porn magazine, K finds himself magically transported to a parallel world where all sexual desires and perversions are fulfilled, although with the price that he might remain trapped in this unique pleasure-hell all his life â€“ unless he can find a way out. This 'way out' is his redemption, a journey studded with heart-stopping adventure, life-threatening danger, nerve-wracking horror, and a brush with true love.*Warning: This book contains graphic descriptions of a sexual nature, some of them involving rape fantasies. Readers who are bothered by such scenes may choose to skip it.*Universal Book Link (Amazon/Kobo/Nook/Apple/Angus &amp; Robertson/24 Symbols):https://books2read.com/u/3k0aDR
