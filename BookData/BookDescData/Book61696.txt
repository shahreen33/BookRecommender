How insane is it to marry an alien as a publicity stunt?I’m Sunny Weathers. You probably recognize me from my reality show, Sunny Weathers Excellent Adventures. I’ve had to perform a lot of crazy stunts in my career but this one takes the cake! The producers are sending me to another planet to become an alien’s mail order bride. I’m not allowed to tell anybody it’s a put-on, and as soon my contract is up, I’ll be leaving planet Dakon. Unfortunately, I hadn’t counted on my attraction to Mr. Tall, “Darq” and Handsome… I’m Darq. The moment I laid eyes on the female with pretty mud-colored hair and sunny smile, I knew she was mine. Competition for females is fierce, and I was determined to claim a mate from the latest shipment from Earth so I broke the rules. If anyone finds out, my own brother would banish me to the icy wilderness, and I’d lose my mate. I will do anything to keep her…
