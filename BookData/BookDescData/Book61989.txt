In most remote control transmission systems, only small data rates are required for transmitting the control functions of home entertainment equipment. The reliability of the transmission is essential as an incorrect interpretation of a transmitted code is not permissible. Corrupted signals must be ignored. In most coding schemes, commands are repeated until the remote controlled device reacts as desired. The operator can directly observe the result of pressing a key by means of visual feedback.Several methods of modulation have become well established. A reliable and power saving transmission method in which bursts of the carrier frequency are transmitted is called “Pulse Code Modulation” (PCM). There are three commonly used representations of one bit in remote control systems. The “Bi Phase Coding” has one rising or falling edge in the centre of each time slot. In the “Pulse Distance Coding”, all bursts have the same length but the time between the bursts is different depending on the value of the bit. In the “Pulse Length Code”, there are two kinds of burst lengths depending on the bit value.In addition to different kinds of coding and different carrier frequencies, there are further variations in the data formats; with and without pre-burst, with different numbers of bits in a command, and with different bit lengths. Two common data formats, the RC5 code and the NEC code, are described in more detail here.
