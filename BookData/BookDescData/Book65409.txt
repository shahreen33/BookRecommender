This rightly-named "Middle East western on water" takes off from Djibouti, a sweltering, downtrodden city at the lower end of the Red Sea. From this inhospitable port, documentary filmmaker Dara sets out into the Indian Ocean to make a movie that presents a sympathetic view of the pirates operating in the region. Accompanied by a towering, resolutely skeptical African sailor, she ventures into dangerous, unknown waters, heading into a tempest far worse than any weather. Trademark Elmore Leonard twists, turn, and wry current affairs commentary.
