Less A wrenching true tale of horrific loss, Surviving Heartbreak Valley is the story of a woman who suffers the worst tragedy imaginable but somehow finds the strength and courage to go on with life. In 1989 Linda Walls had put an abusive relationship behind her, graduated college, and was ready to start the next chapter in life. But in one hellish night everything changed. She came home to find her house on fire with her four young children trapped inside. The children's father, Bernon Howery, a violent man who stalked Linda following their break-up, had ignited the blaze. In 1991 he was sentenced to death for murdering his children. Linda meanwhile began the difficult process of putting her life back together. Rather than simply drowning in a sea of despair, she began speaking out against stalking and domestic violence to help prevent what happened to her from befalling others. She became an outspoken advocate, conducting seminars, speaking to organizations and groups, appearing on the Oprah Winfrey Show and in a Diane Sawyer documentary. But Linda's battle for justice and to establish a new life for herself was far from over. Bernon Howery continued to wreak havoc in her life, fighting to have his death sentence overturned which was eventually commuted to four life sentences. Writing Surviving Heartbreak Valley is "my next chapter," Linda said. "I want the telling of my story to add a real sense of urgency in building greater awareness of the domestic horror taking place in America, and our nation's need to galvanize a crusade to prevent it."
