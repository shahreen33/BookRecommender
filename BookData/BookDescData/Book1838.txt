It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a classic 19th Century romance must be in want of an update.Rowan Faine compulsively overeats to compensate for the big changes that have taken place in her life. Forced to cope with the death of her parents in a car accident, inheriting her rebellious younger sister to rear, and the constant bombardment of junk food at Knight & Daye, the Downtown Dallas law firm where she’s a secretary, Rowan gains 35 pounds. Her beautiful and skinny best friend, Madelyn Morrison, tells her that the book, "Diary of a Dieting Madhouse—The Diet" (available on amazon.com), keeps her thin and healthy.Even though Rowan deals daily with the erratic nature of the attorneys she works for, in an atmosphere where class distinctions, while subtle, still thrive even in this enlightened time, she is caught off balance by a new, lateral hire attorney, the proud and haughty Grey Faris. Grey and Rowan instantly clash, particularly when she overhears him call her “fat.” His best friend, Rex Selkirk, is also a client, and falls in love with Madelyn, against Grey’s better judgment. Rowan, who begins to lose weight and shape up, soon becomes convinced that her prejudices against Grey are well-founded. But her outgoing, playful nature and impertinence have attracted his attention, and, in spite of himself, his admiration.A modern retelling of Jane Austen’s classic "Pride and Prejudice," "Diary of a Dieting Madhouse" is a love story with a sassy heroine, an edgy subplot and a companion diet. It has been described as “Bridget Jones’s Diary meets Skinny Bitch.”For those interested in knowing more about Rowan’s diet, get your copy of "Diary of a Dieting Madhouse—The Diet" at amazon.com.
