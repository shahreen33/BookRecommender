Both daring and exacting, Torn from the Sun, journeys beyond the ensnarements of mortality into a freedom from fear. The poems' meditations, rendered in supple language and forms, invite us to step into the footprints of Miyamoto Musashi, John Coltrane, Walter Benjamin, Jorge Luis Borges, Vincent Van Gogh--and the author himself--as they fly and fall through their own labyrinthine paths. Torn from the Sun weaves a mosaic steps that stir the ashes of rebirth, a recognition that these bewildering corridors are not simply a prison house, but a ritual space for inner discovery. Traced in this poetry is a way out and it is the way in.
