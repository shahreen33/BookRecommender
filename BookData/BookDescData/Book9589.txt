Good Girl, Blended #1 *Revamped Edition* Contemporary romance with a naughty twist. Willow, the wayward, is just another disillusioned teenager with no path in life. She spends her days haunting Revamped and her nights taunting her family. Willow’s high school diploma didn’t make her feel like and adult, nor did the eve of her 18th birthday. Everything changes dramatically on the night of her birthday when her cousin inadvertently takes her to the Playroom. Willow finds something she wants for the very first time in her life, and she’ll stop at nothing to obtain it, even if it means becoming a responsible adult. Ride along as Willow innocently learns everything the hard way with hilarious, heartwarming results, and as she encounters nearly debilitating, painful roadblocks. Will she stay the Willow Monster or become a Good Girl?18+ Good Girl is a dark coming-of-age tale, which begins the Blended series.
