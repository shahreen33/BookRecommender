What do a Vampire, a Fae, and a hunk of a Wolf have in common?Me.They all have me.Remember that whole ‘don’t sleep with other students rule’ that I blew out of the water? Turns out it wasn’t the only thing I blew.Finn, Howl, and Saxon are officially mine, and after facing a kidnapping, crashing an underground blood party and going toe to toe with the Alpha Wolf my boys are stuck to me like flypaper on an untrimmed bush.Too bad things for us are about to go upside down.It all started with a piece of paper from a certain bullnosed wolf challenging me to a life-or-death battle of wills.Here I was thinking Bloodwood Academy for the Supernatural was going to be easy.My hands are full with a new semester, new duties, and three dangling… men. I might have a problem if the mysterious fourth guy that Saxon keeps talking about shows up.Bloodwood Academy is a full-length Reverse Harem with no end to throbbing actions, breathless battles, and page turning scenes that will make you want to lock your door and shut out the world for a while.
