For the world's eleven million Mormons, as well as anyone interested in religious history, here is a complete account of the founding and growth of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints. In 1830 Joseph Smith, a young farm boy in central New York state, founded the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints. He and his followers joined the American exodus westward, but were hounded out of every settlement they established by people who read a brand of evil into their message of goodness. Finally, Brigham Young established a new kingdom in the basin of the Great Salt Lake. A New Zion is the story of the migration west - a fresh look at Mormonism and its successful social programs as well as its failures. Illustrated with 150 historical photos and maps, this book covers everything from Joseph Smith and his followers through the journey west, right up to the present day.
