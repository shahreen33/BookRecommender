Take the next step. From radical followers of Christ to radical communities of faith.  In Radical, David Platt’s plea for Christians to take back their faith from the American Dream resonated with readers everywhere, and the book quickly became a New York Times bestseller. Now in Radical Together, the author broadens his call, challenging us to unite around a gospel-centered vision.  How, he asks, might such a vision reshape our priorities as the body of Christ? How might well-intentioned Christians actually prevent God’s people from accomplishing God’s purpose? And, how can we best unleash the people of God in the church to carry out the purpose of God in the world?  Writing to everyone who desires to make an impact for God’s glory—whether you are an involved member, a leader, or a pastor—Dr. Platt shares six foundational ideas that fuel radical obedience among Christians in the church. With compelling Bible teaching and inspiring stories from around the world, he will help you apply the revolutionary claims and commands of Christ to your community of faith in fresh, practical ways.“I love Radical Together! Please read it. God is using David Platt to lead his church into much-needed reform.… I don’t know of a church leader that I trust more.”—Francis Chan, author of Crazy Love“I have the privilege of knowing David Platt, and I assure you that his life and ministry commend what he has written here. Read this book. Like the right medicine, it may be more helpful than comfortable. In fact, my prayer is that it may be an explosion, shifting many churches from centering wrongly on ourselves to centering rightly on Christ and his agenda for us—and for his world.”—Mark Dever, pastor of Capitol Hill Baptist Church, Washington, DCFrom the Trade Paperback edition.
