The name on the cover was "Richard Bachman," but the imagination inside could only belong to one man--Stephen King. for years readers of these four novels wrote to "Bachman," asking if the author was really Stephen King writing under a pseudonym. At last the secret is out--and so are these four spellbinding tales of future shock and suspense, now available in one volume.Here is rage, a story of stunning psychological horror about an "extra" ordinary high school student...a chilling glimpse into a future America where a macabre marathon, The Long Walk, is a contest with death...Roadwork, an eerie variation on the theme of "Home Sweet Home"...and a nightmare vision of a ghoulish game show. The Running Man, where you bet your life--literally.The first two of these superlatively shocking novels were completed before Carrie was even begun. the others were written in between some of Stephen King's most popular bestsellers to date. And each of them is marked by the undeniable fascination of one of the most brilliant imaginations of our time.--jacket
