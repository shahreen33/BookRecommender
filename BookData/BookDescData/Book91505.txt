EATING IS NOTHING BUT TORMENT  Still grieving, DI Bethany Smith is stumped by a letter and map that have arrived, stating someone is dead and where to find them. The problem is, the map has been drawn by hand, and she can’t quite work out where the location is. When she does, she’s led to a place of business—but what has that got to do with the murder?  With the body eventually found, the shock of the mutilation has Bethany reeling—plus the fact that the deceased is a minor royal ‘celebrity’ in Shadwell. Why have they been killed?  Then two more bodies turn up, and the case gets more complex.  What weapon has been used to scour skin off? Where have certain body parts gone? And what does the image of a child’s toy mean?  The killer has lived a twisted, abusive life, with secrets no one should have to keep, but can Bethany feel sorry for him despite what he’s done?
