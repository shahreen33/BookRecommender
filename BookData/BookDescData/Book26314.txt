When Brooks walks into my life, I can’t keep from wanting him. He’s perfection—a sexy veterinary student who knows how to cook and always cheers me up when I’m down.  But I don’t deserve a man like him. There’s a darkness in me that no one could ever love, and I know he’ll abandon me, just like everyone I’ve ever cared about.  Just like my father.  I wouldn’t be able to stand that hurt, so I push him away.  Then my ex comes back. He betrayed me before, but now he says he wants to make me feel whole again. I know it isn’t right, and I shouldn’t let him into my life. But all I want is to recapture the happiness I once had.  But sometimes those who want to fix things leave you more broken, and some friends turn out to be false.  How can you tell true love from a lie?
