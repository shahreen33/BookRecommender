Sweet, innocent, virginal Sarah had never once stopped thinking about her stepbrothers since she left for college. Identical in looks but opposites in personality, the twins were everything Sarah wanted in a lover. Now that sexy little Sarah was home for good, twins Luke and Logan could no longer fight the pull and keep away from her. She'd grown into a beautiful young woman. She had curves that made their mouths water and a body made for two men. Evidently years in the Marines and away from Sarah hadn't curbed their lust or obsession. It was time for Luke and Logan to make a move. It was time for Sarah to learn who she belonged to. She was theirs - heart, body and soul.Warning!
