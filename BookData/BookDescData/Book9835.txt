I thought being dumped was painful.And it was.Trust is more fragile than hope, and maybe even fear.And it wasn't the only thing left damaged. My heart and my ego were dragged through the mud as well.But, I'm collecting the pieces.Moving on.Or I was, until I learned the guy who has stolen my thoughts and attention is a client who my often eccentric and demanding boss personally assigned to me. As one of the most sought after event planners in Chicago, I'm determined to keep things professional, especially when I learn his connection to my boss extends beyond money or a favorâ€”but family. With one glance I forget reasonHe smiles, and I lose sense. But how deep is my past buried? And how much are we willing to sacrifice?
