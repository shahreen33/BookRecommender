If Dante's "Inferno" and Orwell's "1984" had a bastard love child, that abomination would be called "Breit New World." This scathing political satire posits a dystopian Amerika under the iron thumb of Ayatollah Steve Bannon. Protagonist Danny Algernon is just another misogynistic homophobe with a dead-end job -- until he's thrust onto the national stage in a quest for enlightenment, glory, and the ultimate prize: to win the reality TV show "Nine Ladders" and be named the next Ayatollah of the United States.Read the story that right-wing news outlets have labeled "pornography," "garbage," and "libtarded" -- read it before the book-burning starts!"A profane and disturbing farce." --Ben M. Dover, New Satan Book Review"Reminiscent of 'South Park'." --Micah Hunt, Cockatoo TimesThis satire is a collaboration between fiction authors John Whitebred and Redd Whyne.
