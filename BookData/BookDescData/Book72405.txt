Ayla  The darkness never truly left me. It’s always there, waiting for the right moment to strike.  It’s been months since I ran away from the nightmare that was slowly killing me. I ran for my life, straight into the arms of a man who I thought would be worse than the nightmare I’d left behind.  Little did I know he’d become my savior.  But my happy ending was ripped away from me in a blink of an eye. I had everything…and I lost everything.  Alessio  I didn’t believe in angels. But then I saw her. I touched her. I kissed her. I made love to her. In return, she saved my soul.  I was no longer unlovable, because my Angel found it in her heart to love me.  I had her…and then I lost her.  But I will not stop until I find her.  Even if it means starting a war and spilling the blood of everyone who gets in my way.  I will find my Angel.
