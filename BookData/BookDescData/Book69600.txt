Crime journalist Doug McGregor is all bent out of shape - still recovering from a savage encounter with a psychotic killer, he also has dark secrets to hide. But Doug has to put aside his own demons when friend and contact DS Susie Drummond needs his help to investigate the brutal murder of her ex-lover. When a gangland power struggle erupts into violence on the streets of Edinburgh - and much closer to home - Doug and Susie's already tense relationship is sorely tested. Together they confront a conspiracy that reaches deeper than even a cynical hack like Doug can imagine. As Doug's about to find out, all the devils are here - and none of them want him to discover the truth.
