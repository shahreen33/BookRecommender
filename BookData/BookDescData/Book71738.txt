When Samuel Johnson dies, he finds himself in the body of the man who killed him, unable to leave this plane or return to the son he left behind. Moving from body to body as each one expires, he inhabits a series of lives as stymied, in many ways, as his own. As Samuel Johnson migrates between men and women, young and old, he offers us a watchful consideration of the ways experience is mediated, the unstoppable drive for human connection, and the struggle to be more fully alive in the world.
