Dark Dreams: A plague decimates South America, and an infected survivor is hunted through the shanties of Rio de Janeiro; an asteroid strikes central Australia, triggering waves of unspeakable horror; a pink Cadillac, full of screams, rumbles toward the Promised Land.Pale Horses: A girl dreams of escaping her black and white life, into a Technicolor world where she is the star; the Shepherd of Souls keeps vigil over a dying child, while civilization clings to faith on the edge of a ruined world; an elderly lady recalls her wondrous childhood, in a present where the walls are too close, and reality uncertain.In his debut collection, Rio Youers presents six stories—glimpses of worlds, and lives, fraught with pain, love, and hope—where the things we trust are often fractured, and where the darkest places sometimes hold the brightest lights.
