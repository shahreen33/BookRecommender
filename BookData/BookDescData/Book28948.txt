The strangest realm on Battleworld is now the most mysterious region of the Marvel Universe! And Earth girl Becca is stuck in this land of sword and sorcery -- with no experience with either! She has only one mission: get home alive. But will becoming apprentice to Goleta the Wizardslayer aid that quest, or render it even more unlikely? In a land of myths, monsters and...muscle cars? Becca and Goleta will brave the Enchanted Village and Fang Mountains, seek aid from Catbeast and the Dog-Fighters, and find themselves in the middle of a war between Lava Men and Man-Things. But most dangerous of all is Morgan Le Fay -- Becca had better hope she never falls into the sorceress's evil clutches! Join Becca's quest, and brave the dangers and uncover the secrets of Weirdworld!Collecting: Weirdworld 1-6
