When Theresa Aletheia Noble, FSP, began keeping a ceramic skull on her desk and tweeting about it, she had no idea she'd be starting a movement. Her daily tweets about memento mori - Latin for "remember your death" -contained quotes and insights that have inspired others to remember death daily. Many have found this ancient practice to provide an important perspective on their lives in view of Jesus' call to repentance, conversion, and the hope of resurrection. And now Sr. Theresa Aletheia's series of tweets has led to a memento mori -inspired Lenten devotional. Each day contains a reflection written by Sr. Theresa Aletheia based on the liturgy of the day for all of Lent, Holy Week, and Easter. The devotional also includes a memento mori examen or review of the day, a daily moment of intercessory prayer, and daily reflections on death from the tradition, including the Church Fathers and many of the saints. Prompts are provided for journaling that can be used along with the Remember Your Death: Memento Mori Journal, also available from Pauline Books.Lent is a time when we remember the death of Christ and the sacrifice he made to give us eternal life. This devotional will help you to meditate on your own mortality and the incredible gift of salvation in preparation for Easter. Whether you get a skull for your desk, a memento mori journal, or a Lenten devotional, it is vitally important to the Christian life to remember the fragility of your life on earth-because one day you will die.
