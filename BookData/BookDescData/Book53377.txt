Another body in a string of ritualistic murders, a serial killer who’s getting cocky; Detective Derek Childress thinks this day just can’t get any worse. And then he meets his new partner.  Investigator Kayle Perrine is a Variant: one of several races of once-thought mythical creatures who now live among and lord-over humankind. Led by a group of vampires called the Clan Gentry, the Variants protect their own, just as they did when Derek’s previous partner was killed by one, nearly a year ago. Now that Perrine’s on the case, Derek expects a cover-up.  Kayle Perrine has worked his whole life to prove himself, but being paired up with a boorish mundane like Derek Childress is feeling more like punishment than reward. Derek is so blinded by his prejudice against Variants, that he refuses to see the evidence Kayle finds blatantly obvious. The sooner Kayle can close this case, the sooner he can go back home and forget about the infuriating human detective.  A brutal attack forges a fragile truce between the two men, driving them together. Derek and Kayle must learn to trust and depend on each other while tempers flare and passions of every kind run hot between them. Yet as they begin to grow closer, one fact continues to keep them apart: they are from different worlds.  With time running out to solve this case, Derek and Kayle understand that love may not be enough to overcome prejudice, politics, and murder.
