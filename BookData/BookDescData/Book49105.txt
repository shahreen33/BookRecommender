When his dad decides to send him on an adventure holiday, poor Tim--who is more suited to armchair pursuits--realises that this could well turn out to be the very worst time of his entire life. Little does he know quite how bad things will get, especially when he is forced to bunk-in with the hideous, arrogant and bullying Giles. But as the holiday progresses he finds himself quite enjoying its challenges. Even abseiling--once he is safely back at the bottom of the cliff--doesn't seem so bad.
