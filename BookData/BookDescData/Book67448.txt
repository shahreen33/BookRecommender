Ellie  I was ready for love and had the means to bring it my way, so why not?  One little love spell couldn’t hurt me.  Only, the man who answered my call into the fates wasn’t the one I was looking for.  Don’t get me wrong, the fates seem to know what I like to look at in a man, but that’s it.  What’s worse is, I think I may have missed my chance at true love while I was distracted with this loser.  Mateo  Ellie literally fell into my world in a pharmacy parking lot. When I set her back on her feet, I knew nothing would be the same.  After talking with my cousins, also my business partners and mountain lion clan mates, they all felt a surge of something and an urge to go to the pharmacy.  It was like she drew us in.  Once we meet her, there’s no denying that our shared attraction for her isn’t normal. Could this be a rare shared fated mate?  As we try to find an answer, we still have to find a way to deal with this jerk following her around.  But when he turns out to be more dangerous than we could imagine, more than just love is at stake, it’s the very life of the woman we all love.
