A sweet and funny story about sharing, friendship and belonging.When Little Panda startles Big Panda awake inside his den, Big Panda crankily declares, “Mine.” Then he puts Little Panda outside, “Yours.” When he still won’t leave, Big Panda offers Little Panda a kite. Which delights him! Until the kite’s tail starts annoying the other animals in the forest by sweeping up their things. They all give him the same message: their things, “Mine;” the kite, “Yours.” And soon the animals themselves get caught as they try to reclaim their stuff. Can they all learn a new word — “Ours”?No “mine” allowed! This story’s too fun not to share!
