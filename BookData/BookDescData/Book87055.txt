Discover the ancient divination system used by witches and gypsies, perhaps older than the Tarot and much simpler to learn and use. This book gives a basic understanding of the traditional systems, then goes on to instruct the reader on how to make their own set of Witchstones and ultimately to change and personalise the system so that it belongs to them alone and resonates with their own cultural background and personal iconography. The author, a practising witch for 25 years, explains the history, meaning and use of the runes in a way that is easy for someone with little or no occult knowledge to comprehend but still useful if you already practice magic. Learn to read the runes, and go on to develop and use them as a magical tool.
