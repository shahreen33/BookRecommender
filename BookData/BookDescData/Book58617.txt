A BS-free world, where no one can lie, and the honest will thrive.Just when they finish the prototype and turn down an offer to sell their brainchild to a huge corporation, Theo is found dead. Greedy companies, corrupt privatized police, and even the president herself will stop at nothing to steal the Truth App. Sam sets his sights on exposing all lies and holding everyone accountable.But he and his friends quickly realize the costs of a BS-free world: the lives of loved ones, and political and economic stability. They now face a difficult question: Is the world capable of operating without lies, or are lies what hold it together?Praise for Will McIntosh's Burning Midnight:"In an impressive YA debut, adult SF author McIntosh spins an action-packed adventure....An engaging cast and thought-provoking premise help fuel this thriller." --Publishers Weekly"With a fascinating premise and likable, underdog protagonists, this is a winner." --Booklist"An exciting, fast-paced adventure from start to finish." --The Horn Book Magazine"An adventure fantasy thriller . . . with an unpredictable twist." --TheGuardian.com
