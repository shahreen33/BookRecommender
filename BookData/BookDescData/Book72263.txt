Tiny fairies. Huge adventure. Matilda Whipplethorn is about to get what she's always wanted, and it's a bad thing. Being a babysitter isn't much of a dream for the average thirteen-year-old, but Matilda is anything but average. She's half a centimeter tall, invisible to the human eye, and hearing-impaired. Her mother won't let her forget any of that. So for Matilda, adventures are in short supply. Finally agreeing to let Matilda take some responsibility, her mother gives her a list of emergency procedures for babysitting. The only problem; humans aren't on the list. Minutes into her first job, watching her sister and an obnoxious neighbor, humans appear in isolated Whipplethorn Manor. They tear her home, the fireplace mantel, right off the wall of Whipplethorn and Matilda's afternoon babysitting job goes long term. When the mantel ends up on display in an antique mall, the security that Matilda always took for granted is gone. She can lock the doors, but that doesn't keep the kids in or spriggans and the fly-eating phalanx fairies out. Matilda's up for an adventure, if only she could hear it coming.
