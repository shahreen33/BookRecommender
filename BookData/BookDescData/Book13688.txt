You’ve met the men of BAM. Now get to know the rebel.Who is Reid Matthews?A child, abandoned and unloved.A teen, adrift and disregarded, using his superior tech skills for the wrong intentions.A young adult, his future overshadowed by his prison record, his life an endless loop of loneliness.Until he is given a second chance and a new life emerges.A career he once thought he could only dream of, surrounded by people who show him that family and home aren’t simply words.And a girl who shows him the greatest, most complex code he could ever write. Love.
