Do you believe in Guardian Angels?Have you thanked your Guardian Angel today?I never did... now I wish I had.Now I understand the hard work and difficult situations they face every day. That car that veered off course, the knife that slipped or even the close call when you nearly tumbled from a tree. It wasn't good luck that saved you, it was me.My name is Adam and I'm a guardian angel.
