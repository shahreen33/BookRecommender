From Wall Street Journal and Amazon #1 Bestselling author Terri Osburn comes a new installment in the Shooting Stars series.  Veronica Shepherd thought she was fine. She thought she was over her ex-husband. But now said ex-husband is marrying his high school sweetheart–the only woman he’s ever really loved–and Veronica is not taking the news well. In fact, she’s spending Christmas Eve drinking herself into oblivion, and into the arms of one sexy bartender.  Based on his childhood alone, Cameron Rhodes should either be in prison, in rehab, or six feet under. Instead, he’s spent the last twenty years building a life that no one could have predicted. Now, to his own disgust, he’s been named one of Nashville’s most eligible bachelors—mostly because he’s one of the wealthiest men in town. A rich mortal among the stars.  Cam’s life is turned upside down when a beautiful woman passes out in his arms. With nothing but a dead cell phone and a useless coat check ticket to go on, his only option is to take her home and let her sleep it off in the safety of his apartment. What follows is an adventure he never saw coming.  Before the ball drops on New Year’s Eve, Veronica and Cam will pretend to be lovers, become real lovers, and consider the possibility of becoming so much more.
