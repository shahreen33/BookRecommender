Since he caught me looking, he uses every opportunity to tease me, handling that cucumber in the most lewd and distracting way when he’s supposed to be helping in the kitchen, whispering that I could never handle a man like him.When I sneak into his room to prove him wrong, things go from crazy to downright sinful. And it turns out, Barrett’s right. There’s no way I’m walking away from this in one piece.BRO CODE is a new standalone romance coming April 10th from New York Times bestselling author, Kendall Ryan.
