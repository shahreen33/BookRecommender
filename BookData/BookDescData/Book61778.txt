*Prequel to Faking Ms. Right*Dating can be tricky, but how hard can it be to find the right guy? Or even just a normal guy?  For Everly Dalton, it’s a bit like trying to walk in stilettos—while drunk, blindfolded, and wearing the wrong size shoes. She hasn’t exactly been lucky in love. In fact, she just might be cursed.  A guy who only dates lookalikes of his ex? Pass. An alpha-male businessman who bolts in a moment of crisis? No thanks. A date that turns into the creepiest interview in the history of ever? Where does she find these guys?  Join Everly as she dishes to her friends about the surprising, unpredictable, and sometimes crazy adventure that is modern dating. Will she keep matching with frogs or find her Prince Charming?  Everly Dalton’s Dating Disasters originally appeared as six serial episodes in Claire Kingsley’s newsletter. The complete series is available here in one volume. Each episode is an account of one of Everly’s (typically terrible) dates. This series of short stories takes place before the full-length, stand-alone hot romcom, Faking Ms. Right.
