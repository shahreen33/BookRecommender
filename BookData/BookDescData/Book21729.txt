Readers everywhere fell in love with Syd, Maddie, David, Michael, Pete, and the irrepressible Roma Jean Freemantle in Ann McMan’s 2011 bestseller, Jericho. Now, return to the tiny mountain town in the much anticipated sequel, Aftermath.Over the past eighteen months, Syd, Maddie, and little Henry have become a family, and things are going surprisingly well for most of Jericho’s residents . . . if you don't count the devastating storm that whips through town. In the weeks and months to come, Syd, Maddie, and all of Jericho are forced to pick up the pieces and rebuild their homes, their lives, and their town. The task is sometimes hard, sometimes emotional, and sometimes absurd, but is always full of smart and sassy humor and an abundance of good food and wine.
