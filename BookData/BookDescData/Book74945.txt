Rhy Ellison, former elite Navy SEAL Commander, retired from the teams the same way he lived, in a blaze of glory. After nearly thirty years of stellar service, he almost crashes and burns, but his hard-earned reputation saves him from a court martial. Now all he wants is to kick back in Margaritaville, but the Department of Homeland Security has other ideas.  The DHS Special Group Leader offers him a contract he couldn’t refuse, they need him to put his famed skills back in the game and help recover vital information stolen from a CIA asset overseas. When Rhy learns the CIA pain-in-the-asset involved is none other than Harper Chandler, a woman he never wants to see again, much less work with, taking the mission becomes a no-go, even with the money.  Then he learns the missing dossier could clear him of crimes he’s been accused of that led to his court martial, Ryh signs on without a second thought. The opportunity to clear his name is too important to be brushed aside. Especially by the woman directly responsible of killing his men, and almost his career.  He’ll pay the price of working with the beautiful, cocky, know-it-all if that’s what it takes. But he refuses to allow her to get him killed or give her another shot at his heart.
