When I was five years old I told Toren Grace I was going to marry him when I grew up. When I turned eighteen I made it clear I still felt the same. The problem? He's fifteen years older than me and he's my father's best friend.  Toren Grace. My father's best friend. My pseudo-uncle. He's always been my rock. The one I should never, ever want. But I do want him, and I love him. I always have. He loves me too.Tor's one of the good guys. Loving. Devoted. A strong moral compass. One kiss between us rocked him clear off his axis. Now we can't forget how that kiss felt, and what it changed. Nothing will ever be the same between us. I know he's struggling with his feelings, but I'm determined. I'm not a little girl anymore, and we can't deny we were meant to be together. The heart wants what the heart wants, and it doesn't care about age or how we met. My father cares, though. And he's the one person neither one of us can stand to hurt. We're all being torn apart, and I don't know how to make everyone see that the wrongs are actually right.* Torn can be read as a single book.
