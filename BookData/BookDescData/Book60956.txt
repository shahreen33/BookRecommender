Graham has everything he needs to survive the wilds of Colorado. He can guide anyone through the wilderness but the one thing he can’t guide is his heart. He can’t control the growing feelings for his best friend, Wes.  When Wes came back to Colorado he took over as Sheriff of Anderson Pass, a small sleepy town nestled in the wilderness. Sleepy little towns don’t have to worry about the dangers of the outside world, right? Wrong!  When Graham is taken by gunpoint from his store, Wes and his team are his only hope. The race is on to not only save his friend, but to save the man he loves.
