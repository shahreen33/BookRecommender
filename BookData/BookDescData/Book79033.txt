A terrible evil lurks in the mountain…Lizzie is not your average tourist. She may have just arrived on the idyllic Greek island of Corfu, but her mind is not on having a good time. Far from it, Lizzie has a daunting task to undertake: to claim back her twin brother who was kidnapped twenty years earlier on her previous visit. In a cave. By an evil witch. When Lizzie sees her brother again, she receives the shock of her life. The witch has tricked her… And, as if this weren’t enough, a handsome local steals her heart to complicate her life even further…"It's a step up from Mills and Boon - much more Mary Stewart than Barbara Cartland, with a bit of Gothic horror and Harry Potter-esque magic in the mix. And it's certainly a page-turner." ~Hilary Whitton Paipeti, author of In the Footsteps of Lawrence Durrell and Gerald Durrell in Corfu"
