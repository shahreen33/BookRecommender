From USA Today bestselling author W Winters comes an emotionally captivating and thrilling, romantic suspense.  At first, his words were harsh and his touch cold. I didn’t want to be in his presence any more than he wanted me there. I knew he was a dangerous man and he could destroy me if only he wanted to.  That’s not what he wanted though. It’s not what he needed. It’s not what I desired either.  It’s so easy to get lost in the touch of a man who’s powerful and unattainable. A man who wants for nothing … except me. Soft touches and stolen glances made my blood heat and my heart beat in a way I never knew it could.  Yes, it’s easy to fall into a haze of lust and desire. But there’s a reason his reputation is one of a heartless man. And I should have known better.
