Yara Parmstone, human thief and newly chosen Queen of the Dragon Shifters, woke up this morning to a living nightmare.The last full-moon ritual didn’t give the dragon shifters their usual power boost—but it did give them a wimpy human as queen. Now? They’re pissed. They blame Yara. And they’re out for blood.It’s even worse than that, though. Something dark and powerful is working to pit the dragons against each other, including the brothers in Yara’s sexy-as-hell harem. Why? To invade the land and snack on some crunchy humans, of course.Yara’s about ready to develop a new motto: bros before hordes before civil wars. Or it least, she would be if she thought she might live beyond her coronation.
