In this collection of personal essays, Pamela Capone writes with both heart and humor. Using historical and contemporary examples--as well as stories from her own life--she writes for the soul and for the sole intention of pointing to love.This book is about teensy-weensy firecracker love, love that, when ignited, lights up someone's dark night. It's about feet-on-the-ground, sky's-the-limit, life-changing, world-engaging, mustard-seed love that grows from a hunch, an idea, a nudging from above--and then blossoms in the willingness of a heart to act on its sometimes-wobbly faith.Such audacious, underestimated love--like the little engine that could from the childrenâ€™s book--just keeps chugging along over "impossible" hills, shrugging off the naysayers, imagining the view from the top. The difference is, this tenacity in the human heart is what turns seeming underdogs and ragamuffins into influencers and game-changers, right in our own communities, workplaces, homes . . . or wherever we go in the world.May Pamela Capone's often-hilarious observations and always-engaging experiences put a little fuel in your tank to help you get up and over, so you can see that all things are indeed possible . . . if you believe that Love can.
