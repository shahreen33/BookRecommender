In 1984, the twelve-year old Caldwell twins, Reese and Luke, are living the typical middle-class American childhood, until Luke is brutally murdered. In present day, Reese is a forty-two year old life coach in the public's eye but a vigilante in private, never believing the system was adequate in finding her brother's killer. Her secret identity is partnered with the ghost of her twin, and together they hunt the criminal scum of the earth, child killers and rapists. Although their relationship is unorthodox, they are closer now than ever and together they manage to dig up past demons that won't stay dead.
