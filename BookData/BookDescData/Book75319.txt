Bunny has an idea: He'll go with her! Soon, Bunny's friends Bear, Raccoon, Bird, Porcupine, Squirrel, Mole, Mouse, and Frog decide to join him--and Josie's first day of school turns into a critter-filled adventure!For any child starting school, here's a comforting, funny, and very fuzzy celebration of friendship that will make everyone excited to hit the books."Silvestro and Mai-Wyss make plain the joys of intellectual curiosity and exploration, and their message is clear: Libraries and schools are wonderful places to learn, grow, and seek your joy."--Kirkus"In this appealing story, Silvestro offers a new twist on the familiar first-day jitters theme by switching from the child's perspective to the outsiders' point of view. . . . Colorful illustrations set a buoyant tone for this endearing sequel to Bunny's Book Club."--Booklist "Jam-packed with comedic details (art supplies get stuck in Porcupine's quills; Frog demonstrates his jumping-rope prowess), Mai-Wyss's busy pictures heighten the geniality of this celebration of friendship and school."--Publishers Weekly
