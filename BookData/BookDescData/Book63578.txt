Sara Robinson's father, Hobby Robinson, was one of the most important photographers of the 20th century to be so little well-known, at least outside the Shenandoah Valley of central Virginia. He chronicled over three generations of Elkton townsfolk, compiling and self-publishing nine books. Using his vast collection of photographs, his own and those he obtained, he gave us a people and a place. SOMETIMES THE LITTLE TOWN is Sara's gift of ekphrastic poetry inspired by the portraits in her father's collection. And like her father's work as a photographer, Sara's poetry is a tribute to little towns everywhere. REVIEW: A loving waltz of poetry and photographs of mid-twentieth century life in Elkton, Virginia. -- MARTHA WOODROOF, WMRA Public Radio, Producer of The Spark, Author of Small Blessings.
