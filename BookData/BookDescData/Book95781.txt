Forgetting the worst moment of her life is harder than she thought, especially when Andrew Malcolm re-enters her life, surfacing from the ashes of her past.The structure that Melissa built for herself is threatened by Andrew, who isnâ€™t willing to let her walk away. He would hunt her to the end of the world to have the girl who wanted to be the best he never had.But what happens when the walls start crumbling around Melissa and she is forced to face the past she wanted so hard to forget? Will Andrew be able to pick her back up and show her that he cares, or will Melissa lose the chance to have true love?*** This is a clean romance but if you are looking for something wholesome or sweet with a traditional story then this is not the book for you.But if you want something modern, not necessarily abiding by the traditional formula of relationships, without having to read graphical sexual content, explicit language, and extreme violence then this is the book for you.Also, take note that human trafficking is a subject that is explored in the novel.***
