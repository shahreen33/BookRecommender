Introductory information systems textbooks often present the topic in somewhat of a vacuum. That is, they focus on information systems without really succeeding in showing how IS is integrated in organizations, how knowledge workers are supported, and how important IS is for an organization's success. Many undergraduate students do not understand why they are required to take an IS course since they are not IS majors. Many also expect the introductory course to focus on personal productivity software. This textbook will teach students how to exploit IS in a technology-rich environment. It will emphasize why, no matter what their major, information and communications technologies (ICT) are, and increasingly will be, a critical element in their personal success and the success of their organizations. In other words, they need to be introduced to concepts, principles, methods, and procedures that will be valuable to them for years to come in thinking about existing organization systems, proposing new systems, and working with IS professionals in implementing new systems.
