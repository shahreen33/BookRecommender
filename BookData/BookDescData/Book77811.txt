This book is a labour of love that has been twenty years in the making. V M Zammit has been writing for as long as she could hold a pen together, and this collection brings together some of her favourite poems in one place. Split into three sections, this collection looks at poems about heartbreak and pain, about the influences of the world around us, and about the questions we all have sometimes. It also contains a series of poetry called 'Definition', that follows the story of a couple as they come together and fall apart again.
