Time is running out for the planet Xorrn in Friends Like These, an adventure supplement for the Star Wars®: Age of Rebellion™ roleplaying game. When intelligence reveals that an important and secret shipyard is under threat, the player characters have two days to arrange the planet’s defense and recruit allies in the region before Imperial forces arrive. Friends Like These takes players to a new sector where they encounter Mandalorian culture and face a brutal moral decision regarding who the Rebel Alliance should call friends.Within the 96 full-color pages of this supplment, players and game masters will find gazetteers for three new planets, countless NPCs, and directions for creating playable human characters of the Mandalorian culture. Although designed primarily for Age of Rebellion players, because of its Outer Rim focus and balance between warfare and diplomacy, Friends Like These is ideal for groups incorporating characters and material from Edge of the Empire™ and Force and Destiny™ as well.
