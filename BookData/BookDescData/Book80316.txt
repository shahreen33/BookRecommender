Simon was her ex-husband's best friend and her worst enemy, someone who made her life a living hell. However, Simon has managed to sell his soul and needs her to get it back. And he is now literally sending her to hell to get it. Thereâ€™s just two problems: how does she get there, and then how does she get out again before she becomes a demon?
