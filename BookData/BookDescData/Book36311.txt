Kyle Hanson went from faking paranormal activity for a camera to two paranormal attacks in as many days. Both times, the attackers have left behind a single clue to their aggression: the name of Kyle's missing brother, Tyler. Kyle returns to filming with The Raventree Society with two goals: find out what the spirits know about Tyler and get out alive. And when the team is invited to investigate a plantation house with ties to the underground railroad and sighting of multiple paranormal entities, Kyle could fail both. It doesn't take long for Kyle to find out that the rumors of hauntings at the Coal Mansion are much more than just legend. And when the sun goes down and the investigation of the house begins, Kyle quickly finds himself separate from the group and at the mercy of an entity that has no desire to reveal any secrets.
