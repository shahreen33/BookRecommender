A NEW 6X9 EDITION OF THE EISNER-NOMINATED SEXCASTLE!Shane Sexcastle, formerly the World's Greatest Assassin, has paid his debt to society for killing the vice president. Leaving his violent past (also: prison) behind, he's decided to settle down and sell flowers in a small, quiet town--but that doesn't mean he'll tolerate the fools who think they run this town.An homage to to the likes of Die Hard, Road House, and '80s-era WWF wrestling, SEXCASTLE may just be the single greatest '80s action movie never made."Come for the action, stay for the laughs and the surprisingly poignant character work."--The Onion's A.V. Club
