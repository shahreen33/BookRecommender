Chloe MacArthur has finally found her mate but he's the one wolf she can't have.  To save her heart from further pain, she leaves the pack that she's come to consider her family. Unfortunately, unfinished business leads her back to her childhood home and straight into a deadly game with shifters that will do anything to prevent her from learning the truth.  Ian Lachlan is in mourning. Nearly two years ago, he lost his mate but, thanks to Chloe, he's finally living again. When he wanted to give up and die, she saved him.  Now, Chloe is the one who needs help and Lachlan plans to return the favor. Intent on protecting her from her enemies, he follows Chloe and soon discovers that he wants far more from her than friendship. He wants everything she has to give.  But can either of them let go of the past long enough to reach for their future?  *Though this book features characters from the Bitten series, it can be read as a standalone.
