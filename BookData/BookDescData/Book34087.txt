Super-smart, shy Violet has a huge crush on her first college roommate, Chloe—but Violet can’t come out with her confession, because nobody knows that Violet prefers girls. Chloe invites Violet to join the sorority sisterhood of Eta Nu Pi and in spite of her reservations, Violet can’t resist Chloe’s persuasive argument, but when the girls find themselves involved in an erotic, mind-blowing hazing, both of them discover something about themselves—and each other.
