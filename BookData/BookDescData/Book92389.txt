In this witty, sensual, poignant tale, New York Times bestselling author Suzanne Brockmann explores destiny, deception, and that steamy tipping point between deep friendship and romantic love.Photograher Clint McCade was a rugged free spirit with the perfect life, until he realized something vital was missing--Sandy Kirk. Since grade school, Sandy had been Clint's best friend and closest confidante. She was smart, beautiful, shy--and clueless about her power over men. But when Clint finally seeks her out to declare his love, he finds she's fallen for another man.Sandy knew she was a lot of things to Clint--except what she'd always longed to be: the woman he loved. So it comes as no surprise when he encourages her pursuit of another, even offering to coach her in the art of seduction. But soon the friends find themselves engaged in a series of crossed signals, mixed messages, and unbearably titillating close encounters that prove only one thing is certain: body language doesn't lie.
