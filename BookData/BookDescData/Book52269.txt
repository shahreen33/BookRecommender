Meanwhile she stores every crumb of his affection and covertly makes trouble for anyone she feels gets in his way.But when a bright new PhD candidate catches the Professor’s eye, Sylvia’s dreams of the fairy tale ending she has craved for so long, are soon in tatters, driving her to increasingly desperate measures and an uncertain future.Sylvia might have been sleep walking through her life but things are about to change now she’s woken up…A quirky, charming uplifting novel perfect for fans of Gail Honeyman's Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine and Sarah Haywood's The Cactus.
