2016 SFPA ELGIN AWARD NOMINEEDawn of the Algorithm is a bestiary. Yann Rousselot’s poems are characters, they are forces of human nature, genetically engineered with a single purpose: to herald the apocalypse. Rousselot paints a darkly comical portrait of humankind, a species plagued by heartbreak and alienation, yet driven by hope and, at the very core, a burning desire to connect.***Our resident aliens, octosharks, algorithms, mecha-robots, pathogens, and kaiju (to name a few) will be very happy to make your acquaintance. Please do not feed the zombies.***Illustration credits: Brian James MurphyOsman GaniJihan KikhiaEmma Strangwayes-BoothLaura Stevens (photography)Sabine Dundure (photography)Lucile TailladeKeith McDougallJuliana GalbraithChristiana SpensSamantha WongAlex MantheiDelphine DupratMathieu SourisseJordan GlassJérémie ParetAaron Lopez-BarrantesFan AhaEugenia LoliYann Rousselotwww.dawnofthealgorithm.com
