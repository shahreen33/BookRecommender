Beaten and left for dead by his two partners after a botched robbery, Dominic Donato wants revenge so badly he can taste it. First he must survive—alone—in a remote part of the unforgiving Mojave Desert with nothing more than the clothes on his back. But a life-or-death encounter with a wild coyote reveals to Dominic the true secret of survival, and he will use that knowledge to make his partners pay, along with anyone else who crosses his path. Soon Dominic will unleash his newfound power on the world, and nothing will quench his thirst for revenge.
