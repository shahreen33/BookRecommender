What image best describes your heart?A water-drenched kid in front of an open fire hydrant?Or a bristled, desert tumbleweed?You're acquainted with physical thirst. Stop drinking and see what happens. Coherent thoughts vanish, skin grows clammy, and vital organs shut down. Deprive your body of necessary fluid, and it will tell you.Deprive your sould of spiritual water, and it will tell you. Dehydrated hearts send desperate messages. Snarling tempers. Waves of worry. Growing guilt and fear. Hopelessness. Resentment. Loneliness. Insecurity.But you don't have to live with a dehydrated heart. God invites you to tread your thirsty soul as you would treat your physical thirst. Just visit the WELL and drink deeply:Recieve Christ's work on the cross, the energy of his Spirit, His lordship over your life, and his unending, unfailing love.Come thirsty and drink the water of life.
