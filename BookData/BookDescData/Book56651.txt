Two years. That’s the amount of time I’ve wasted lusting after Wyatt Douglas.  He had me the moment he roared up on his bike and flashed his charismatic smile my way. I wanted to jump on, wrap my arms around him, and ride off into the sunset.  Then my brother introduced him as his friend and crushed my short lived happily ever after.  To make matters worse, we work together at World Class Wrestling and our storylines are intertwined. I have a strict rule I’ve always adhered to: never mix business with pleasure.  But with each moment we spend together, avoiding that carefully drawn line is becoming more difficult.  There’s an ongoing rumble between my heart and my head. Which one will win out in the end?  *can be read as a standalone*
