From New York Times Bestselling Author Kristen Proby comes Stay With Me, an all new addition to the series that has sold more than a million copies to date, her beloved With Me In Seattle Series!  Amelia Montgomery has left her past behind her. With a beauty and fashion career that’s skyrocketing and a loving family around her, everything else is just junk in the rearview mirror.  Until it’s not.  When she has to drop out of the public eye, her cousin Jules offers her a new, temporary life on the Puget Sound. Her past may be catching up with her, but hope for the future is in Seattle.  Wyatt Crawford can’t figure out the enigmatic beauty who’s living next door. As an architect, he’s usually good at looking beneath the surface—but she barely even leaves her house.  Until she needs his help.  When she knocks on his door, how can he resist? It isn’t long before Wyatt and Amelia become more than just neighbors. But when he finally learns the truth, will the skeletons in her closet be too much for him to handle, or will he stay?
