In Dennis Sharpe’s passionately intense short story, “A Short Walk To Forever,” we meet Jen, an early thirty-something whose life hasn’t turned out the way she’d hoped. When Gabe left her at the altar two months ago she never expected to see him again. But when he shows up out of the blue at her door unannounced, interrupting her disappointing ebb and flow, she’s floored. He looks completely different from the man she’d known for years, and now he has dropped in out of nowhere to ask her to go for a walk. Nothing in her wildest dreams could have prepared her for all the emotions his revelations would provoke.
