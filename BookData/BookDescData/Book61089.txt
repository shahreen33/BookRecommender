Sometimes, the end is only the beginning.  Emmy was born a dweller and she expected to die as a dweller ... until Willa changed everything. Now she has no idea of her path, and she certainly wasn't prepared for what would happen after her death. Caught in the middle of a war that threatened to prove much more significant than anyone had ever expected, there is only one person who can help her ... but his terms are steep.  Cyrus was born out of necessity: a being of light, brought to life with a singular purpose. Time has changed him and the recent events have unsettled him â€¦ but a certain transformed dweller is about to do much worse than that. She is about to turn his existence upside down.  Topia is giving them no choice: they survive together, or the war is lost.  This is a NOVELLA, over 30,000 words. Book 4.5 of 5 in the Curse of the Gods Series
