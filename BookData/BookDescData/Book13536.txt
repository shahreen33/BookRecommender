-LUCY-There is a love so fierce it cannot be measured. A heart so strong it will never slow. There is a promise so sure it can never lie.He promised me that love forever.Even when it wasn't enough. -CAMERON-Forever. Everlasting. Eternal.There is no measure of time. No sounds of the ticking of a clock. Just the rising and falling of the sun.And our own sense of forever.  But our forever isn't always.
