Has it been too long since you've been scared? The long-awaited Ghost Hunting Diary Volume VI is finally here! Curl up in your favorite chair, set your favorite sipping beverage beside you, and settle in for another spooky ride into the paranormal. You'll wander into Louisiana in "Cajun Crossovers," although it's not the ride you think it will be. Then back to Texas for some ride-alongs with Aunt Belle and her cohort, T. M., as they investigate the "Old Calvert Nursing Home" and granddaughter "Tara's Home." Yep, the SRT crew does "do" a cemetery again; graveyards after dark are still one of their favorite haunts. T.M. also continues her work to help lost, wandering souls in "Crossing Over Violent Death Victims." Then you'll see what happens when one of the nasties is able to breach Simmons' own house in "Demon at the Door." If you feel some eyes watching you while you read, T.M. hopes it's not too far from your chair to the light switch on the wall. Sometimes it looks like quite a distance in a dark room where ghosts might be prowling, huh?
