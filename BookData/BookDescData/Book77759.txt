"Is This My Home?" is the story of a little girl who travels around the world in search of her true home, after realizing that there is a difference between 'house' and 'home.' Along the way, she encounters animals who show her the importance of caring for the planet. The beautifully illustrated, 43-page storybook is a joint effort between Danish green energy company Ã˜rsted and creative partner Wieden+Kennedy Amsterdam. Illustrated by South Korean artist Yeji Yun, it is available in four languages, either as a free e-book download or a narrated 6-minute video.
