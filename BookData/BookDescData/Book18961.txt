Sometimes bad decisions... are made for the right reasons.
I lost everything with the death of my bandmate—my privacy, my reputation, my career, and the love of my life.I’m nothing but the living ghost of Madelaine Dobransky. Still, I’ve managed to make a new life for myself and build a successful business from the ashes. And even though my world is filled with guilt, secrets, and suspicion... it lies buried beneath the surface.All I wanted was a tattoo. I didn't know that it would bring him—the one who watches—back into my life. Nor did I expect the tempting tattoo artist, Dexter McClellan, to lay claim on a place in my world. Dex wants to know me, to know the truth.But I can’t let that happen. Because the truth is buried for a reason.The truth will destroy me.
