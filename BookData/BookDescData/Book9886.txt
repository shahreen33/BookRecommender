Hell hath no fury like Alex Finley... For as long as Alex could remember, life had taken everything from her. Her father abandoned her and her dying mother, only to return upon her mother's death - with a new wife - to reclaim the family's Wyoming ranch. Alex's rage drove her away to Los Angeles to live with a man who could never satisfy her.Only after ten years does she come home - and she hits the town with a vengeance, unleashing her pent-up lust on willing cowpoke Connor Matthews. But she's in for several shocks. It turns out that the ranch is now a resort, that her late father split the estate between Alex and her young half brother, and that Connor - the bucking bronco she wants in her bed - is running the place.Now, Alex is torn between accepting both a new family and a lover who can give her everything she needs, or selling out to a smooth-talking neighbor and leaving the last behind her. But only when her life is on the line does she realize what she desires more of all...
