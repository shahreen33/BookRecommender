Twenty-five years ago, Roberto Clemente made baseball history when he became the first Latin American to enter the Hall of Fame. This book explores one of the game's most dynamic players and perhaps its most selfless humanitarian. From modest beginnings in Carolina, Puerto Rico, to a legendary career with the Pittsburgh Pirates, to his tragically premature death in a plane crash, this book details the story of one of baseball's most compelling characters. Interviews with teammates Willie Stargell and Al Oliver, Former major league commissioner Bowie Kuhn, and close friends of Clemente lend insight into his character and contributions.
