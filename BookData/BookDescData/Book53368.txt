He was gorgeous, older, and had the worst reputation in all of England.The way he looked at me sent shivers down my spine.Our first meeting was at a wedding, where he followed me outside and kissed me.Our second meeting ended in a huge fight with me kicking him out.Our third meeting, I went on a double, blind date.You can imagine my surprise when I saw familiar blue eyes across the table opposite my friend.Oh….no….He was sarcastic and witty and damn,If he wasn’t the sexiest bastard I ever laid eyes on.Then he sent me an email listing thirty reasonswhy I should go on a date with him.I was expecting a suave and intelligent list.Curious, I read on.𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐨𝐧 𝟏 – 𝐈 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐰𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐞𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐨𝐧 𝟐 – 𝐈 𝐥𝐨𝐯𝐞 𝐦𝐲 𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐦𝐚𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐨𝐧 𝟑 – 𝐈 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐚 𝐬𝐢𝐳𝐞 𝟏𝟑 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐞 – 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐝𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐡.The man’s a fool, his list was some of the most ridiculous things I’ve ever read.And the funniest.We laughed hard…and loved harder.You can outrun everything……except your past.And his has caught up.Wild handsome players don’t fall for wholesome girls like me,Or do they?
