Understanding Flying Weather is Derek Piggott's introduction to meteorology for glider and light aeroplane pilots. In simple and accessible terms it explains how atmospheric phenomena can be used to improve flying performance and to make flying both economical and enjoyable. Taking into account advances in satellite and computer technology, the book describes pressure patterns, cloud formation and how soaring conditions can be used to advantage, as well as detailing the effects of depressions, anti-cyclones and local topography. Its uncomplicated text and diagrams cover the syllabus for the British Gliding Association Bronze 'C' Certificate and so will be particularly relevant to those studying for this important examination.
