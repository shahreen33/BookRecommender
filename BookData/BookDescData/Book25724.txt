Playing fast and loose with the Order’s rules has finally caught up with me.Sentenced to hunt down a cagey insurgent known as the Death Mage, I’m not feeling overly optimistic. Wizards with far more experience have tried and, well … died.But overmatched or not, I want this assignment. The Death Mage killed my mother—he might also be my father.I need to play it smart, though. The mage wields an evil, mind-warping magic. A power that undermines his victims’ sanity while pledging their souls to an ancient being and devourer of worlds.How would I even know if that magic was corrupting me?Or is it already?
