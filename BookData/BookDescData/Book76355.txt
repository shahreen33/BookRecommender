We are the Fallen Daughters trapped in a dark and twisted world.I am the daughter cast in a forbidden and haunted house, captured to earn my release.I am the daughter born from evil with no choice but to fight.I am the daughter of the apocalypse.I am the daughter cloaked in slumber, nightmare and vicious ways.I am the daughter taken to breed with the enemy.I am the daughter in search for the light as I am surrounded in thick darkness.We are the fallen. The daughters who dance between love and lunacy.Come join us in our tales.
