For bookworm, Charlotte, nothing turns her on more than poetry—except maybe her shy, stuttering, older stepbrother, Nathan. He’s as much of a bookworm as she is—he even works in the library—but Charlotte knows there’s more to her sexy stepbrother. Underneath his smart, shy exterior lurks the body of a god—she knows, she’s caught enough glimpses of his physique at home—but Nathan has rebuffed her advances at every turn.  Charlotte drowns her sorrows with her best friend, Amanda—her best friend with benefits. Amanda indulges Charlotte’s love of poetry, reading to her while they play together. When Nathan surprises the girls indulging in the poetry section of his library, Charlotte’s hopes are dashed once again. Nathan simply tells them to get dressed and go home. How can he resist? Charlotte wonders aloud. Then sly Amanda gives her an idea.  A wonderful, awful idea. What if Nathan doesn’t know it’s his stepsister he’s kissing, touching…? A plan begins to form in scheming Charlotte’s mind to draw her stepbrother in with sweet honey until he finds himself trapped, impossible to escape…
