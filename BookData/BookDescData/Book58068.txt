In this gorgeously wrought and imagined novel, an investigative journalist interviews those who knew--or thought they knew--Alejandro Bevilacqua, a brilliant South American writer and author of the masterpiece, In Praise of Lying. Through the diverse voices of those close to Bevilacqua and their divergent portraits of the man at the center of this literary examination of truth, the reader holds the power of final judgment. In All Men Are Liars, Alberto Manguel pay homage to literature's shapeshifting inventions, in which our own ideas or the world and the people around us are given agency and projected onto these brilliant, virtuoso pages.
