Back home in Leeds, Amy Reed is jobless and out of sorts, until she manages to bag herself a new start in Bath. New job, new apartment and new acquaintances. Girly nights out, Sambuca shots and a run in or two with a hot rugby player. The perfect scenario to help her forget about Isaac and his sorry arse. Or is it… ‘Wow! Look at the hotties at the bar,” Petra points. Looking round, I see a group of guys all in sports gear, one of them being Justin. “Oh, the one in the middle is my neighbour, he plays rugby for Bath.” “Phwr! I wouldn't mind getting in a scrum with him,” says Petra. “How come you have only been here two minutes, and you’re already putting the moves on the local men?” Justin catches my eye, and gives me a little wave. I offer a delicate, unassuming wave back, only to catch Kat and Petra waving at him like a couple of flapper girls. These two are going to get me into so much trouble.  What Isaac Rice wants, Isaac Rice will do absolutely anything to get, and Amy is the only thing in his sight. ‘Who the f**k is this Justin guy? I'm not happy, he seems to be spending a lot of time in her apartment, and often till late. If he's touching her, I'll rip his f’ing head off. I can't wait much longer. I'm itching to make a move, make my presence known. Soon. Very Soon.
