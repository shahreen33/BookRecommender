Three Novellas written by Alan Vanneman, but incorporating the primary characters in Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe series of mysteries. The first novella is set in the 1930s, so as to be appropriate to the original Nero Wolfe stories. The other two have been set in the 21st century. But all three feature Nero Wolfe, mostly either sitting at his desk or upstairs playing with his orchids, and Archie Goodwin doing all the necessary leg work and gathering of data.
