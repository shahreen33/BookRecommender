This is a collection of poems and illustrations by Christian DeWild. These poems touch on the funny side of the macabre from Morbid Lester and his little dead bugs, a series of unfortunate events for a rather clumsy vampire, a wrong way witch to more personal poems about self realization like Sorrowful Jane and Me and You a Bit Eskew. There is a little bit of everything in this collection of poems, limericks and very detailed drawings.
