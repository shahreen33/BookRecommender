Little did I know the ending would turn out to be the worst part of it.I hear the sound of the phone like in a dream.I wish it would stop after two rings, like the postman used to, but the obvious criminal intent of this annoying instrument of obstruction makes me think it will not relent so easily.It's three o'clock at night.A wicked hour for a call.I pick up and a strange voice, coming from the other end of the world, tells me that my brother is dead.And this is how the nightmare begins.Six days have passed since I received the call.Yesterday we buried my brother.I hate their criminal minds.Tomorrow is predicted to be another day in hell.
