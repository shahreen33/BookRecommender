Jack Norton is a GhostWalker, a genetically enhanced sniper with a merciless sense of justice, a phantom welcomed by the anonymity of the night.

Then he meets Briony, an unusual beauty on a mission of her own. But they share more than the sweltering heat ... Briony shares the GhostWalker powers. Yet she's different.

And Jack and Briony's flight will take them into frightening conspiracy of mind and body - across the globe and into the heart of darkness, where the shocking truth is something neither of them could have foreseen - or can escape...
