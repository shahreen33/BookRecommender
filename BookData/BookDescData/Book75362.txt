Toronto business consultant, Serenity Layne, knew she could only depend on herself. Married to her career, she has no time for other pursuits and life's intangibles. Widowed for three years, Roger Scott is a single parent to his ten-year-old son, Adam. On a day out with their dog, Roger's cell phone rings incessantly. Adam has played matchmaker and put his father's profile on a number of online dating sites. The week before Christmas, Serenity is heading up a series of meetings after a six-month study of the Canadian retail chain, jonathans. After an unpleasant encounter with one of the store managers, she escapes from the boardroom, only to get knocked down by their pet. Guilty over the accident, Roger invites Serenity out for a drink to apologize. Over the course of the week, and spending time together, feelings long dormant for Roger are re-awakened. At the same time, emotions foreign to Serenity fill her with contentment and happiness. Will the couple get their happily ever after?
