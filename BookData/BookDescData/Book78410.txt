Contradictions...  Tall and short.  Inked and unmarked.  Golden and porcelain.  Soft dreads and wild red.  Dark and… darker.  Keeping more secrets than a teenage girl's diary, Harlow Cooper hides a lot behind her bubbly personality. College student and intern. Loyal friend and loving daughter. Fangirl and girly girl. Lover of strong coffee and even stronger margaritas. Former bartender and current… Well, let’s just say she’s suddenly in need of pasties and an industrial sized drum of glitter.  Quick with a smile and joke, people assume Kase Teo is all ego with a slacker follow-through. But lurking behind his hauntingly beautiful blue eyes is an ocean. Knowledge, quick wit, experience, pain… There are depths to Kase that most don’t see. If there’s one thing he’s learned, it’s that life’s all about appreciating the beauty.  For Kase, that means going after the redhead that’s set up residence in his mind. And his fantasies.  Now he needs her to see life’s more than just a best case scenario.  ***Warning: This book is intended for adults. It contains frequent adult language and situations.
