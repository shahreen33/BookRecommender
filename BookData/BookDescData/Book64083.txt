 
  The power to love. The power to heed your own voice. The power to hope in a world of blood and shadow.
 Yesterday morning, most of Saphrona Melioska's family was executed. Today, at dawn, she and her brother's widow would have followed them to the block. But something changed.Saphrona doesn't know who paid for their sentence to be commuted, but by that act of kindness, she and her hearth sister are exiled to the remote island of Ghondatha, where Saphrona's only relatives live.She has nothing to take with her but the legacy of ten generations of master sculptors, a family name beloved in the world of Art, and her own credo: there is goodness and beauty in everything.Upon their arrival at Ghondatha, however, Saphrona and Leigh find that even ageless Ghondatha is not what it once was. The island has a new liege-lord, a nobleman from the lavish Amkadan Empire, with deep pockets and extravagant ideas about progress.All Lord Gideon Bloodstone requires is that the villagers obey three laws: no one may leave the island; all who are invited to his nightly masquerades must attend; and those who are not invited must mind the curfew and stay home.Who is this man who has stolen the last familiar piece of life Saphrona has left in the world?Someone who will change forever how she defines that which is good and beautiful.
