Mrs Rooney, old and unwieldy, is dragging herself towards the railway station on a Saturday lunchtime to meet her blind husband on his way back from the office, and guide him home. She passes the time of day with a man with a dung cart, and a man with a bicycle. A third man with a motor car offers her a lift. A church-struck spinster helps her up the station steps ... All That Fall, specially commissioned by the BBC and first broadcast on the Third Programme in 1957, was immediately and universally acclaimed for its comic and linguistic exuberance.
