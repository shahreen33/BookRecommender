It's Easier to Dance is the remarkable memoir from author Annie L. Harris, a woman born in the late 1940s with cerebral palsy. This extraordinary book is the first of its kind to provide a chronological view of the historical development of the civil rights movement through three different lenses: those of a woman, a minority, and someone living with a developmental disability.This insightful and unflinching account of Harris's life over the past sixty years reveals not only her heartache and pain but also her hope and triumph.Chapters such as "Ticket to Freedom," "A Change in Identity," and "My Life's Rhythm" reveal a complex woman who has lived a life in defiance of ongoing social stereotypes and barriers. Told in a warm, candid, conversational style, Harris offers a compelling window into a world rarely seen as she uncompromisingly tackles issues of equity, education, sex, relationships, kindness, belief in the supernatural, and the power of love.In the vein of inspirational works by Helen Keller, Maya Angelou, and Oprah Winfrey, Harris's absorbing story encourages us all to look past our physical trappings, speak in our own voice, and believe those who speak for themselves.
