A play, set in 1940, about brothers James and Charles living through the war in two completely different ways. Which means more, family or pride?   Whilst their families back home suffer through the Blitz, five young soldiers are forced to kit up and set off on what could be the mission of their lives, or the only mission of their lives. Not knowing who gave the orders or where they have been sent, should they travel thousands of miles and risk their lives just to take their chance of living up to the highest of ranks, or is it more than that?
