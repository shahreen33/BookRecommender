Small towns and gossip go together like flaky crust and sweet pastry cream. Between the police scanners, social media, and the senior center, it's like a zombie apocalypse where they consume people's secrets instead of living flesh. But Vangie Vale wants nothing more than to stay under the radar...especially the police radar. So when her new bakery becomes linked to a murder investigation, nothing will stop the gossip mill from connecting her to the dead body. Can't have that.Forced back into the role of investigator, this newly-arrived-in-town part-time bakery owner has to become the very thing she hates--a nosy, small-town gossip--in order to clear her good name, and keep her face off the front page. But when a date-gone-wrong brings her face-to-face with the Sheriff, Vangie can't ignore the fact that one of her macarons was involved in a murder. She has to find out who-dun-it.Book One in a cozy culinary mystery series from USA Today Bestselling Author, R.L. Syme.Expected release date: July 20
