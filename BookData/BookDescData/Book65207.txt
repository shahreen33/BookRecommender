Hello, Nancy.You're at your usual locker at Fitness Plus. The time is 9:15. Your cell phone is dead, your home phone won't answer and your daughter, Beth, is alone with her nanny.It will take you eighteen minutes to get home. If you drive fast.Shame. You're already eighteen minutes late . . .The kidnappers' only stipulation is that Nancy must tell her husband, Michael.Her only problem is, she doesn't know where he is. But she recalls him mentioning a number she must call if anything unusual happens. This triggers a Code Red at specialist security company Cruxys Solutions, who send investigators Ruth Gonzales and Andy Vaslik to track him down.But they can't find a single trace of him.What do you do when a child's life depends on finding a man who doesn't seem to exist?Praise:"Gonzalez and Vaslik make an appealingly mismatched investigative unit."--KIRKUS REVIEWS
