 
  “The monster isn’t under my bed. It’s screaming inside my head.”  
  
 Cursed by the Kiss of Eternal Night, Samira lives her life as an ancient and powerful vampire, guarding her emotions carefully. One slip up and the darkness inside her could send her on a rage-filled, bloodlust path of death and destruction. It’s happened once before, and it could easily happen again. For over a century, she’s managed to keep the beast inside her at bay, but when someone from her past shows up unexpectedly, her emotions hang by a thread. Especially when she finds out they are working with the Phoenix, the source of the growing evil in Rouen. Maybe it’s time she stops controlling the monster inside her. It may be the only way she can save those she loves.
