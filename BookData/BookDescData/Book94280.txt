A mysterious condition sweeps the country, leaving its victims in a catatonic state. The power grid fails and the world goes dark. Somewhere in Florida, where the sprawling suburbs meet a dying citrus grove, a janitor at a small community radio station, an FCC field agent, and a DJ attempt to restore order and humanity. They build a radio tower to recruit survivors. As newcomers arrive and occupy the homes of the affected, a community grows and thrives. But when supplies dwindle and more people succumb to the condition, a doomsday preacher arrives to test the limits of the community; and the radio tower, once seen as a marvel, begins to look like an abomination.Radio Dark fuses Cormac McCarthy's visceral realism with Daniil Kharms' absurdist sensibility to create a uniquely surreal post-apocalyptic novel.
