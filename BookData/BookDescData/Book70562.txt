Wild Milk is like Borscht Belt meets Leonora Carrington; it’s like Donald Barthelme meets Pony Head; it’s like the Brothers Grimm meet Beckett in his swim trunks at the beach. In other words, this remarkable collection of stories is unlike anything else you’ve read.“Sabrina Orah Mark is a writer of strangeness &amp; tenderness &amp; undeniable brilliance. I wanted to read this book aloud to everyone I’ve ever loved, &amp; to fold it into a locket to keep close to my heart.” Elizabeth McCracken
