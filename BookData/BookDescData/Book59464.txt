Katarina Bishop is a thief. To many it wouldn’t matter that she now uses her considerable skills to re-steal valuable works of art and return them to their rightful homes.  She’s still a thief.  So that’s why Kat’s surprised when an Interpol agent comes to her one snowy evening, asking for Kat’s help.  The Magi Miracle Network was set to auction off a very rare, very valuable Faberge egg two days before Christmas, but the egg’s been stolen and now the charity’s reputation—and their future—is on the line. Kat’s family and Interpol might be opposite sides of most jobs, but someone just stole Christmas.  Now it’s up to Kat and her crew to steal it back.  The Grift of the Magi is a Heist Society novella and is approximately half the length of the other novels in the series. It stands alone, but if you want read more about Kat and her crew check out Heist Society, Uncommon Criminals, and Perfect Scoundrels.
