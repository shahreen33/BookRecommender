Anaterri, leaning forward, head bowed, had both hands on the big oak table bracing herself. Leto moved around Genevieve and the kids, coming in behind his mother. She raised a hand, stopping his progress. "I'm sorry, but I must finish this," she said quietly, taking a deep breath to calm herself. Standing upright, she slowly looked at each individual around the table, taking a moment to make sure she had eye contact with them before moving to the next.  "I apologize for my outburst, but it is imperative that you understand what's at stake. I'm tired of losing family, tired of seeing my children and grandchildren losing precious parts of their lives. Many times I've wished I'd never heard of this prophecy or been involved in setting it in motion. But then again, I would have missed out on the most passionate love I've ever known and this, my family," she said, pointing to all those surrounding her.  "You asked, how they could look this way," she said, pointing at the kids. "I will let my grandchildren tell you their story, but before they do, I ask a commitment from each and every one of you in this room today. A commitment to stand tall and stand united. A commitment to end the evil plaguing this land. The same evil that has been terrorizing and killing our families and friends for the last three decades. A commitment to kill that bastard Treagar once and for all. If you can't make that commitment today, please stand and leave. We will understand. There will be no ill will against you. Those of us that remain will still carry on the fight to fulfill the Prophecy once and for all.  The Dragon King is here among us today, for those that didn't know. So, I leave you with this from the Dragon Book of Lore; 'A tale is told in days of lore, of a Dragon King born that will end the war. Appearing as one he is really three, the Prophecy reads, this will be.' The war is here. Please reveal yourself, mighty Dragon King."
