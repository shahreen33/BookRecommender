From husband-and-wife team Tom Angleberger, creator of the New York Times bestselling Origami Yoda series, and Cece Bell, author/illustrator of the Newbery Honor graphic novel El Deafo, comes the third title in a funny and clever illustrated chapter-book series about a mystery-solving Venus flytrap. With easy-to-read language and colorful illustrations on almost every page, this early-chapter-book series is a must-have for beginning readers. In this new caper, what happens when Flytrap loses his partner in crime solving? All the clues point to his assistant, Nina the Goat, as the culprit, leading the city to arrest her and leaving Flytrap goatless. To save the city, Flytrap must unveil the true master criminal. But, can he do it alone?  Inspector Flytrap in the Goat Who Chewed Too Much brings readers back to the wacky world of Inspector Flytrap’s Detective Agency, home to the world-renowned solver of BIG DEAL mysteries. The plant detective works tirelessly with his assistant, Nina,on his community’s unsolved cases. There’s no case too big, but there are definitely cases too small for this endearingly self-important plant detective. Celebrating the disabled yet enabled, the character Inspector Flytrap is wheeled everywhere (on a skateboard, of course) by his goat sidekick as this mystery-solving duo works on cases such as “The Big Deal Mystery of the Stinky Cookies” and “The Big Deal Mystery of the Missing Rose.”     Combining wacky humor and a silly cast of characters with adventure, friendship, and mystery, the powerhouse team of Tom Angleberger and Cece Bell have created a uniquely engaging series that is perfect for newly independent readers and fans of Ricky Ricotta, Captain Underpants, and the Galaxy Zack series. Also included in these books are graphic novel–style pages that will attract reluctant readers.
