"I have fallen in love with Chrissy and Autumn and their continuing journey to health while finding themselves in the middle of a murder mystery adventure. My pre-teen daughter and I enjoyed reading The Dog-Eared Diary and then discussing the clues, plot twists, and characters." --Antoinette Brickhaus, Maryland "Through the relationship between Autumn and Chrissy, Wing also shows the importance of therapy animals and how much they can help those who need them. Add a sweet romance to the intrigue of the mystery and you've got a book that you won't want to put down." -- Melissa Alvarez, Intuitive, animal communicator and author of Animal Frequency and Llewellyn's Little Book of Spirit Animals "Diane Wing has created a wonderfully endearing little character in Chrissy the Shih Tzu.
