Vegan Recipes That'll Punch Your Taste Buds in the MouthNatalie Slater has been described as "Martha Stewart meets Iron Maiden," taking vegan cooking to places it has never been before. Influenced by slasher films, pro-wrestling, punk rock and heavy metal, her quirky-yet-delicious comfort foods are a refreshing take on vegan eating with award-winning flavors. Along the way, her off-color humor, irreverent rants and density of pop-culture references will make you laugh out loud.Inside this high-energy cookbook you'll find recipes for Bike Messenger Brownies—inspired by the espresso-infused chai latte these speed demons use to fuel up; and Crouching Cornbread, Hidden Broccoli—Natalie's sneaky way of getting her son to eat vegetables. Other creations include the Grilled Mac ‘n' Cheez Sandwich, Taco Lasagna, Chick-O Cheesecake, and her Shepherd's Pie Pizza, about which she writes, "Some people were born to rock n' roll. Others were born to ride. I was born to put mashed potatoes on pizza."Bake and Destroy was named one of the most anticipated cookbooks of the year by VegNews.
