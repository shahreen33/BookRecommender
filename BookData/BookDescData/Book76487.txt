In the poems of Virginia Beards, insomnia is a 3-ring circus, a Dairy Queen mutates into a funeral parlor, an 18th century graffito enlivens a bedpost in a Venetian palazzo, a swim in the Nile both lulls and terrifies. What she sees both directly and via a sideways glance, the inanities of the overheard as well as of the zeitgeist, and the stresses of domestic relationships are some of her themes in "Exit Pursued by a Bear." Whatever the focus, she is committed to the pleasures of language and to multum in parvo, much in a small space.
