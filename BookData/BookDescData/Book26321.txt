It started without trust. Passion. Lust. An all-consuming need; that was all we had in the beginning.Lies. Betrayal. Deceit. We moved past it all and fell in love anyway.Over ten years later, with a family of our own, our little world was perfect. Happy.But then that happiness faded away when she came into our lives.No control. No power. Just heartbreak and unwanted submission.We were forced to our knees at the sight of her. The words falling from her lips were like nails digging at our soul because we knew.We would have to go through hell to get out of this.And even then, I wasnâ€™t sure if it would be enough.
