WHAT EVERY MAN THINKS ABOUT APART FROM SEX (blank inside) is a two hundred page book and every page is totally blank. The front and back cover are realistic representations of a self-help pseudo-psychology book. This book contains no words inside whatsoever - just two hundred blank pages and is a humorous talking point... Brought to you by Sheridan 'Shed' Simove, performer, author of 'Ideas Man' (which has words in it), and novelty gift entrepreneur.
