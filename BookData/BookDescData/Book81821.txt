“I don’t trust anyone.” Leaving her job and only home, sassy, independent Analise is determined to do whatever it takes to convince the Vampire Lord Devin Fallinsworth to help locate her missing friend Beth. What was not part of the plan, however, was her most unwelcome attraction to an irresistibly desirable, arrogant and dominating playboy. “Well, I’ll just have to remedy that now, won’t I?” With a rogue vampire still on the loose, Damian DiStephano, Regent Vampire Lord of the East, has his hands full trying to keep the fallout to a minimum. The last complication he needs is for his fiery Moira, his Fated, to finally walk into his life at a time when everything is in utter chaos, putting her directly into the crosshairs of a centuries old war. But now that he has her, he’ll be damned if he’ll let her go.  He had the power to destroy her permanently... Analise is equally drawn to and infuriated by the most gorgeous man she’s ever laid eyes on. And how can she bear Damian’s touch, when the touch of anyone before him repulsed her? With the inability to let others in, she simply needs to stick to the plan, use Damian to locate her friend and return home, heart unscathed.  But even the best-laid plans can go awry.
