Whitney Logan is a young attorney who can count her billable hours on one hand. Then she teams up with Lupe, a Chicana prostitute who makes up in street smarts what she lacks in Whitney's advanced degrees. Desperate to come up with the rent, Whitney can't afford to turn up her nose when a well-coiffed L.A. "housewife" offers her a thousand dollars to track down her missing housemaid, an illegal Guatemalan alien named Carmen Luzano. Too bad Whitney's sweet-smelling client turns out to be as phony as any of L.A.'s millions of wannabes--and Carmen Luzano turns up dead. Together, Whitney and Lupe find themselves inside the seamy underbelly of life in Dogtown--a world where drugs, the INS, and Central American politics converge with a vengeance.
