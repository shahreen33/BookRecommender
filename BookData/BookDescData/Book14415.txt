Dusty Waters is a ghost story, a family saga, the history of a haunted house, and a biography of a folksinger. Dusty's friend, Katharine, has volunteered to help her write the official biography, but there is one piece of her life that will not be part of the biography, she can see ghosts; Dusty's ancestral home Tanglewood is filled with them. This inherited sight adds a vexing dimension to her psyche that becomes an uneasy burden to live with, she feels compelled to escape in order to find peace. Dusty's life journey takes her from Tanglewood in Lyons, New York to New Orleans, Taos, New Mexico, and finally back to Tanglewood.
