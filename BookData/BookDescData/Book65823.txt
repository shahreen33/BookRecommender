Outlaw Jack Bowdre is on his way to jail—and completely unaware that he's traveling with Nora Kane, the mail order bride he's been corresponding with for so long. No wonder the chemistry is flying...It's too bad Nora doesn't know Jack is her groom-to-be. All she sees is a scoundrel. But when their stagecoach crashes, they're suddenly left to fend for themselves—and each other. The longer they're together, the stronger their feelings grow. Hounded by desperate men bent on doing them harm, Nora and Jack will do whatever it takes to find their happily ever after...but first, they'll have to shake the devils from their trail.
