"The suspense is intense, the plot is hot and the style is to die for. A thoroughly entertaining entry" in the Madison Night Mystery series (Catriona McPherson, Agatha Award-winning author). When a rare five thousand dollar bill arrives in the mail, interior decorator Madison Night knows it's a message from her past. In happier times, she once joked that she could be bought for $5000--how could she deny a bill with her name on it? Suspecting the bill indicates trouble, she consults a numismatist. They set up a meet, but upon arrival she finds an abandoned office, a scared dog . . . and a dead body in the kitchen. The twist? The victim isn't the numismatist; it's a John Doe. The police--led by Lt. Tex Allen--are on the case, but it's Madison who discovers the victim's identity. But where's the numismatist? Before long, she uncovers a kidnapping plot, a unique counterfeit operation, and the true price of her own independence. "A terrific mystery is always in fashion--and this one is sleek, chic and constantly surprising. Vallere's smart styling and wry humor combine for a fresh and original page-turner." --Hank Phillippi Ryan, Agatha, Anthony, Macavity and Mary Higgins Clark Award-winning author "A fast-paced mystery with fab fashions, an appealing heroine, and a clever twist, That Touch of Ink is especially for fans of all things mid-century modern." --Reader to Reader
