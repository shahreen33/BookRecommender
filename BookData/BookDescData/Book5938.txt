The main societal conflict present in this world is prejudice and hate, and it is in fact the primary underlying theme for the book. While the typical prejudices we see in our reality don't exist in this world, the author has flipped the lens of prejudice to focus on the three different breeds of humans. The characters are forced to deal with the prejudices that permeate their society on both a professional and a personal level, in an environment where hate seems on the knife's edge of destroying their dearly bought peace.
