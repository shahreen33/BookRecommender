This academy is like no other…  My name is Lexi Cameron and until three weeks ago, I thought I was human. It was all a lie. I’m a demon, and I’m signed up to attend The Demon Academy.  I soon find out it’s the darkest, cruellest school around and not many survive a full year, let alone three. Welcome to DA, where unless you are a high demon, you can expect to be treated like trash.  My plan?  To be invisible and get the hell out of this academy, but it doesn’t work out that way…  I have one angel teacher trying to get rid of me, the students of DA making sure I know what a demon can do and I’m not going to survive Demon Academy for long.  That is until the Lucifer sons see me. They want to break me, they love to play games with my heart, and even if I wanted to run from them…I can’t. I’m apparently their mate.  And just like their father’s home, hell can’t be escaped.    RH Dark Bully Academy Romance. 18+
