***All three books in The Devlin Black series now in one boxed set! Dom Up, Dom Fever, This Dom***Dear Ladies, I’m the man of your dreams and I can prove it. All shapes and sizes are welcome. I’m ready to settle down and start a family. Must be open to a long term relationship. The true kind. One that will last forever (contract required and only voided by me). I’ll show you how a woman is really supposed to be treated. Submissive preferred, but not required. Will train. It’s time to Dom up. Sincerely, Devlin Black  (To be printed in the Los Angeles Herald, Sunday after next - Bachelor’s Edition. Front Page.)  Victoria. The one that got away. When she left I spiraled out of control. Two years of misery led me to write my Ad. Now she’s back and even as I go forward with my plan, my feelings for her haven’t diminished.  Secrets. Deception. Betrayal.  Can our relationship survive? Can we become the family I know we are meant to be? Or will our secrets ruin everything?
