Psychic Copeland Forbes is still recovering from a gunshot wound that nearly ended his life. Back at work for the first time since the shooting, Jude and Cope interview a potential client who claims he’s being haunted by an ex-boyfriend. A man, they discover, that is missing and presumed dead. Making matters worse, Cope can’t connect with the man’s spirit.  Ghost Detective Jude Byrne is torn between working the case and insisting Cope stay home to recover. After almost losing him once, Jude doesn’t want to take any chances with the second chance they have been given.  As the suspect list continues to grow, so do incidences of phantom chest pains for Cope. Convinced he’s not crazy, Cope enlists the help of Madam Aurora to make contact with the reticent spirit.  Can Jude and Cope find the killer or will the next ghost pain finish what Cope’s gunman started?
