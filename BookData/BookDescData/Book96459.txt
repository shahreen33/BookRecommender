Creed Barnett has one simple rule—no potential mates allowed in his territory. As if there isn’t enough on his shoulders trying to manage his crew of misfit, broken bear shifters, his past is now coming back to haunt him. And when the woman he hasn’t been able to stop thinking about for the past five months shows up in his trailer park, he’s re-thinking all the rules he set up to protect the Gray Backs. Gia is a curvy stunner, but his interest in the bombshell goes deeper than her good looks. She’s sweet, and fun, and puts his inner bear at ease in a way no other woman has managed. But Gia has also brought trouble to his territory that will turn his life upside down.  Gia Cromwell’s life is ruined. She’s lost everything she used to value about herself and has nowhere to turn but to the man who started her downfall in the first place. She fully expects the sexy, reclusive bear shifter to turn her away just like everyone else in her life, but when he offers to be her protector instead, she’ll have to fight hard to keep her walls up. She knows she isn’t Creed’s true mate, but that doesn’t stop her huge crush. How can she not fall head over heels for him? Creed is easy on the eyes, sure, but he has a heart of gold and a protective streak a mile wide for the people he cares about. Now she just has to figure out whether his interest is genuine, or if they’re both in this for all the wrong reasons.
