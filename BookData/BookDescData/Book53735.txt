This isn’t how fairy tales typically begin, but it’s where mine starts…No money, no phone, and abandoned on the streets of Chicago.With my baby in my arms, I wander into a bar in a shady neighborhood and ask to use their phone.When my father turns us away and completely disowns me, the bar owner, and total hottie, offers us a place to stay…no strings attached.I’m leery at first.Hot alpha guy.Down on her luck single mother.I mean, who wouldn’t be wary?Lucio Gallo isn’t like most men, though. He’s fiercely protective, loyal, and did I mention he’s covered in nothing but muscle?Above all else, he’s everything I need but never knew I wanted.
