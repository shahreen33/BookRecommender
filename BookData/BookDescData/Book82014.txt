Eve's power-hungry witch parents will kill at the slightest insult, and Eve's unwillingness to use her own supernatural abilities is enough to incite them. Boaz, a powerful vampire, may be the only one able to save her, to give her the one thing she's never had--love. But in Eve's world, no one is who they seem and everyone has an agenda. And the more she stays with him, the more difficult it becomes to spot the true devils, especially when she becomes one herself.
