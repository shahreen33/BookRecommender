Jim wrote a new short story, Christmas Eve, as a gift for his fans on December 24, 2018. It is posted to his website and Facebook page. The story is set after Peace Talks and depicts Harry's first Christmas Eve as a dad, as well as a few other familiar faces. As it was released before its predecessor, it does offer some hints as to the happenings of Peace Talks, but no major spoilers.
