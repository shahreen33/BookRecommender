WITH GARFIELD, YOU CAN FEED AN OLD CAT NEW SNACKS!But our lovable ball of fur will take the leftovers, too! So get ready to party night and day as Garfield eats, sleeps, and (occasionally) purrs his way into your heart--especially if you're baking lasagna. Whether he's plotting his next late-night refrigerator raid, stalking a jelly donut, or scaring a Girl Scout for her chocolate mint cookies, it's all in the name of food and fun!
