‘Tis the season for magical mayhem. Leigh vows upon her magic desk and witch’s broom that Thankshanukkamas will be filled with childlike joy for her, her family, and her friends—even if it kills them. And it may just come to that! With a new publishing contract in hand, the disasterpieces fly from Leigh’s desk. With titles like Sleighing the Elfa-The Elf Pack Book1, Restoring The Old Schlitt House-A “Do Yourself” Romance, Fangin’ the Billion-were, and Gangin’ the Billion-were, the mischief piles up.When the EPA (Elf Protection Agency) shows up at Leigh’s door, she’s got some explaining to do. Throw in a couple of retired mobsters, Fur-Con, bats in the belfry, along with a shape-shifting witch, and you’ve got a recipe for catastrophe. Can Leigh and the gang save the fate of all paranormals? Or will this be the end of the line for Leigh and her band of magical misfits?
