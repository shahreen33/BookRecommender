In The Starcrusher Trap, the Separatists unleash a terrifying new weapon on Republic-held systems - an enormous starship, the Starcrusher, is destroying every ship sent against it! Yoda agrees to a risky plan to stop the Starcrusher, and assembles a Jedi strike force that includes Obi-Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, and Ki-Adi-Mundi. Too late, the Jedi realize that the Starcrusher mission has become a trap - one specifically designed to kill Jedi!Book Details:
