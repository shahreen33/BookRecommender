She was the nanny. He was the boss. Most of the time he thought he worked for her.Dr. Greydon West had it all … or at least that’s what everyone said.The broody, single father of two was nothing like I’d imagined.He was my boss … I was the nanny.Hot-tempered and regimented, with spreadsheets for everything, he had me wondering why he’d ever had kids in the first place. The word fun did not exist in his vocabulary.And then one day I stumbled upon his secrets… the mystery behind his brusque behavior.I began to soften towards him and notice things I hadn’t before.That was when those sexy dreams started waking me up at night.The lust that exploded within me was impossible to ignore.And that kiss … I definitely should not have let that happen.Nothing good could result from that. If I wasn’t careful, everything, including my heart, would go up in flames.
