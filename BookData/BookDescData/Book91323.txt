An alternate cover for this ASIN can be found here.Over a year and a half had passed since Jade Godfrey, aka the dowser, fixed my mother’s necklace, since I’d thwarted the vision of the death of love, and since I’d made a deal with a devil and acquired a demigod for a mentor. I still didn’t understand or control my power, my magic, but it had been a great year. A year of rest. A year of love and light. But now the reprieve was over. Now it was time to see. Magic willed it so. -------------------- This paranormal romance/urban fantasy is the second book in the Oracle Series by author Meghan Ciana Doidge.
