Revised to include an original autobiographical introduction by Bruce Springsteen and a new chapter featuring all of the lyrics to his most recent Grammy Award-winning release, "The Rising," as well as 32 pages, of never-before-seen photographs.This is the complete collection of Bruce Springsteen's recorded lyrics, illustrated with hundreds of never-before-published images from some of rock &amp; roll journalism's greatest photographers, including Annie Leibovitz, David Gahr, Lynn Goldsmith, Bruce Weber, and many others. From Jim Marchese's informal backstage shots during the European leg of the 1980 "The River" tour to Neal Preston's amazing documentation of the "Born in the U.S.A." days to Pam Springsteen's portraits showing a side of the musician rarely seen by the public, this is the most intimate look at Bruce Springsteen ever published. The photos and lyrics are accompanied by original commentary by Springsteen, in which he reflects on the songs, the performances, and the quarter-century career that for many defines the American dream.
