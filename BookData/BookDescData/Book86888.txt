  Abductions rarely go as planned…but this is just ridiculous.
Torn from the Faeling Games on the beaches of Scotland, Quinn MacKenna suddenly finds herself doggie-paddling in a turbulent sea of blood with no land in sight.And that’s the highlight of her day so far, because her abductors seem perfectly content to simply leave her in this strange Otherworld. Quinn must fight tooth and nail to unearth answers about herself and her place in the worlds of both Man and Fae…even if that means losing herself, first.Luckily, it seems teeth and nails are all the rage as Quinn teams up with an unlikely guide as a god’s consolation prize. Unfortunately, it turns out man’s best friend can be one damn salty dog.Debts come due and masks are torn away, and Quinn learns that nothing and no one is as they seemed. That her entire life has been a setup for a much more nefarious game. And the only way to even have a chance at winning is to fetch those broken remnants of her soul.It’s a dog eat dog world out there…And this black magic arms dealer likes to bite—when the mood is right.
