Dorian Gray is immortalized in a painting made by renowned artist Basil Hallward, who quickly realizes that this is his ultimate masterpiece. The painting reflects Grayâ€™s beauty and gracefulness in such a way that it seems to take on a life of its own. And it does. From that point on, the painting starts aging but Gray himself remains young, gradually depicting a convoluted and bizarre relationship between the two of them. With somewhat sinister humor and a sharp honesty that contrasts the hypocrisy of his Victorian era, author Oscar Wilde has given us a classic that knows no barriers of time.
