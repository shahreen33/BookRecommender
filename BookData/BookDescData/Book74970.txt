As a former SEAL commander, Dex Carson had participated in more than his share of rescues. When called upon to lead a multi-agency team into the Virgin Islands National Park jungle to rescue high value targets, he knew he was headed for trouble. Ten teenage girls—whose parents were members of Congress—and their chaperones, needed saving from kidnappers. He cringed. The thought of entitled children and diva mothers made him clench his teeth. When he saw she was on his team, he was ready to quit. His heart couldn’t take it. But a SEAL never quits.  At forty-two, Rayne Yoshida felt too old to go tromping through the jungle after the Speaker of the House’s new wife. The recalcitrant prima donna had slipped her usual Secret Service protection and followed her sweet-as-sugar stepdaughter to the Caribbean on a student work/adventure trip. But as Agent in Charge of the Speaker’s detail, she had to go. Her mood darkened when she saw their team leader, the bull-headed, bossy, but oh so sexy, Dex Carson. They had history…that had almost gotten her fired.  With a category five hurricane bearing down on the tiny island, they only have days to find and rescue the girls and their chaperones…and keep their hands off each other.
