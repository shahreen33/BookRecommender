Recently-widowed Susanna Carmichael is trying to piece her life back together, when she discovers her sister and brother-in-law have been savagely murdered.  Acting on impulse, she races to the hospital bedside of her one remaining relative, her fifteen-year-old niece, who has managed to escape the killer.  While the police are convinced it was a botched burglary and the culprit is unlikely to return, it soon becomes clear to Susanna…someone is targeting her sister’s daughter.  
  From the sun-kissed shores of Southern Spain, to a quaint English town, and back again, My Sister’s Daughter is a heart-wrenching, nail-biting, psychological thriller.
