Time to cowboy up!I need to hide out. To start over. It's time to get tough and fend for myself.When times get tough in Texas they say: "Cowboy up!" Well, two of the sexiest cattle ranchers in the entire state are offering me a job. This could be the first step to reaching my dream.My (secret) fantasy.Now I need to concentrate on my work. But how can I? When Holden stares into me with his smouldering, dark eyes I can barely remember my name. And one boyish, charming smile from Travis makes me melt into a puddle. Still, I can't mess up this opportunity. This ranch is the only chance I have to hide out and start fresh. Even if being here does have me aching to ride. And I'm all about saving horses! In fact, with these sexy cowboys living under the same roof as me, I might just have to save two horses and ride them instead.
