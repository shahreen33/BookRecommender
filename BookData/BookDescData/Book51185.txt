One glance was all it took…I'm a cheater.I'm a liar.My whole life is a mess.I love a man.No, I love two men…I think.One makes love to me. The other sets me on fire.One is my rock. The other is my kryptonite.I'm broken, lost, and disgusted with myself.But I can't stop. This is my story.My broken love story.
