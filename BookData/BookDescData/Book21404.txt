River guide Madeline Kruse has to choose. She's always had the nomadic river life rather than a settled home, and now she's on the run from the long-running pain of a missing father and critically ill and dangerously workaholic mother. Madeline's flight takes her to northeastern Utah, a corner of the West time has passed over and for a time she feels safe and content. But in the tiny town of Junction, she meets alfalfa farmer Chris Sorensen, whose family has split apart since September 11 and the enlistment of his brother in the U.S. Marines. Through Chris and a drama taking place deep in the Utah backcountry, Madeline learns that the canyons and community she loves are more threatened than she knew, and she must overcome many obstacles if she is to find peace and her place by the river.
