Did the Cold War end or did the KGB find a way to retain its power and dominate the new Russian Federation? "Harry's Rules" is an espionage thriller set against the backdrop of post-Soviet Russia in the early 1990's. Written by a veteran of CIA's Clandestine Services, the novel exposes the chilling and authentic sources of the power and the abiding malice of the people who rule Russia today. When a CIA officer is murdered shortly after meeting a long inactive Russian agent in Vienna, Harry Connolly is sent on a secret mission to investigate. He is drawn inexorably into a vortex of violence and international intrigue when his mission runs afoul of a powerful Russian revanchist organization controlled by former KGB officers.
