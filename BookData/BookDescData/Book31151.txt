There's one thing former zombie novelist Jack Jupiter hates more than bullies, and that's his hometown of Woodhaven, Ohio.  When Jack's mother passes away in a freak car accident involving a half-eaten deer and a pack of cigarettes, he and his fianc√© Darlene are forced to go back to Woodhaven for the funeral.  Little does he know it might be their funeral, too.  A few months before Jack and Darlene's arrival, a mysterious flu-like virus swept through the town, infecting nearly every citizen. Now, like ticking time-bombs ready to explode, everyone is dropping dead. But they aren't staying dead. No. They're coming back as flesh-eating zombies.  Not only will Jack Jupiter have to bury his mother, confront bullies ten years after high school, and save Darlene, but he'll have to fight the dead in order to stay alive. And these aren't like the zombies from his books.  Nope. These walking corpses are real.
