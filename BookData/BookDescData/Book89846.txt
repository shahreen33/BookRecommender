Mother Duck is quick to adopt Baby Kitten after finding him all alone in his milk dish. Little Duckling is excited to have a new brother, and even though the other barnyard animals laugh because Baby Kitten has fur and purrs while Little Duckling has feathers and quacks, the two brothers couldnâ€™t care less what the other animals think of them.  Little Duckling wants to teach his new brother to swim but Baby Kitten is afraid of the water. He is content to sit on the riverbank and watch his brother swim until a summer storm blows in and floods the farm.
