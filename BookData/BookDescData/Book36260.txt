Linda Ashcroft offers an intimate memoir of Jim Morrison at the height of his career. This vivid portrait is based on her diaries from the four-year period when she knew Morrison. "Wild Child," one of Morrison's most popular songs, was written for Ashcroft. Morrison's dreams and demons, and the meaning behind his lyrics and poems, are revealed through Ashcroft's evocative writing. Wild Child is a richly detailed and passionate account of what life was like with the legendary Doors singer. It is also the first book to illuminate the mystery of Morrison's death through the words of the woman who was with him when he died in Paris, Pamela Courson. Before flying to Paris, Morrison told the author: "It may have been in bits and pieces, but I gave you the best of me." In return, Linda Ashcroft gives us the best of Jim Morrison.
