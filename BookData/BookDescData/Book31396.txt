Cold Case Sergeant, Ronan O’Mara, is set to return to work at the Boston Police Department after the birth of his first child, when a knock at the door brings back a part of his past he thought was gone forever: his father, John. The only thing that Ronan knows about his father is that the man was a no-good drunk who was gone from Ronan’s life before his first birthday. Now that John is back, all he wants is a chance to tell his side of the story. Not surprisingly, Ronan wants no part of this reunion.  No one is more stunned by this turn of events than psychic, Tennyson Grimm. He’s been in contact with Ronan’s deceased mother, Erin, since he and Ronan started working together. Surely if there was more to the story about Ronan’s father, Erin would have told him. Caught between a rock and a hard place, Tennyson is left to navigate the minefield of this complicated father-son relationship, while trying to support the man he loves.  When John O’Mara finally gets the opportunity to explain where he’s been for the last thirty years and, more importantly, why he stayed away, will Ronan and Tennyson jump in to help him solve the decades old crime that kept him away from his family? Or will Ronan stand by what he’s always believed to be the truth about his father? A truth that might just turn out to be dead wrong.
