But breeds rarely leave the same way they enter.If Kathleen ‘Katy’ O’Sullivan doesn’t find a miracle than no one can save her, even her adored Da, Barrett O’ Sullivan. Northern Ireland’s Chief Constable can save her from the fate her country would order her to.Rescue comes in the form of the famed, Devil Black, a former Breed Rogue Executioner and now, her mate.
