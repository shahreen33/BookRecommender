This work, based on FitzGerald's own research &amp; travels, takes us inside Vietnam into the traditional, ancestor-worshiping villages &amp; the corrupt crowded cities, into the conflicts between Communists &amp; anti-Communists, Catholics &amp; Buddhists, generals &amp; monks &amp; reveals the country as seen thru Vietnamese eyes. With a clear authority unrivaled by other books, Fire in the Lake shows how America tragically misinterpreted the realities of Vietnam. Fire in the Lake received the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs, an American Academy of Arts &amp; Letters award, a Nat'l Institute for Arts &amp; Letters award, the Front Page Award, the Christopher Book Award, the Washington Monthly Political Book Award, the Sidney Hillman Award &amp; the Bancroft Prize. Since initial publication, Fire in the Lake has achieved classic status. An essential text for students of Asian-American relations. FitzGerald's new writings on Vietnam appear, along with photos by Mary Cross, in Vietnam: Spirits of the Earth, published by Bulfinch in 11/2001.Note on the TitlePrefaceAbbreviations1.
