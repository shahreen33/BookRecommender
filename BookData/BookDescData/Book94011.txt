Wake up—it’s springtime in the swamp! As 999 young frogs awaken, they panic to find that all of the other animals are still asleep. First they wake the biggest frog… then the tortoise, the lizard, and the ladybugs. But when they hop down a hole and all pull together, they find someone they don’t want to wake—a big, long snake. Don’t wake him up! Luckily for the frogs, the tortoise carefully carries him away.Ken Kimura and Yasunari Murakami are back again in this delightful tale about frogs and friendship!
