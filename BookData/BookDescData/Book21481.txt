Welcome to Burden Hill - A peaceful suburb like any other with white picket fences and vibrant green grass - home to an unlikely team of paranormal investigators.Black magic, demonic frogs, and zombie roadkill are just a few of the problems plaguing this seemingly sleepy little town. With the human residents unaware of the danger, it's up to a determined crew of dogs (and one cat) to keep their community safe.Horror, adventure, mystery, and humor thrive on every page of Beasts of Burden, which promises to capture readers' hearts and haunt their dreams.Award-winning comics creators Evan Dorkin (Milk & Cheese) and Jill Thompson (Scary Godmother) come together to share the lives of some unlucky heroes, first introduced in The Dark Horse Book of Hauntings, for which Dorkin and Thompson won coveted Eisner awards for Best Short Story and Best Painter. Animal Rites collects those earliest tales, along with the four-issue comic series Beats of Burden.
