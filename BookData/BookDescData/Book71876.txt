A cave is a pocket for a bear, a breath is a pocket full of air. A hat is a pocket for your hair, and a seat is a pocket called a chair...  A Sock Is a Pocket for Your Toes: A Pocket Book is a whimsical pocket full of bells and balloons, ice cream and mud, giggles and hugs. Elizabeth Garton Scanlon's delightful verse is captured in Robin Preiss Glasser's energetic artwork, which follows four families through a busy day exploring the surprising ins and outs of the world's pockets. This special book will leave readers young and old with pockets full of joy!
