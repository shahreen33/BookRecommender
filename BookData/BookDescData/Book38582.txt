Who? A breathing meat. Why? Some breathing meat lucky enough to understand their purpose of existence. But most of the meats have no idea why they exist in the universe. The meat who knows and the meat who doesn’t know experience the same pain, uncertainty, and heartbreak, but have different points of view on everything. Where? Under the sky. On the soil. Between the air and the sea. In the arms of people who treat you badly. What? Something you don’t know and something you know. If you’re lucky you’ll find the answer but other questions will come to you soon after that. When? Not today.
