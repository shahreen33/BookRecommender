I’m a former slave. The sister of death. Collateral.He’s a bad man. A cartel boss— and my everything. I thought I was done being someone’s toy, but I was so very wrong. Safety is nothing more than a premise in my world, and it seems my own sister can’t be trusted. Loyalties will be tested, and even my big bad wolf might not be able to save me this time.A priceless pawn. A knight in blood stained armor. A love worthy of any sacrifice.Hate me or hold me?
