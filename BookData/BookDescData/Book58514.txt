The jackpot Cam hit in Vegas finally gave him the chance to party like a rock star. He never wanted to forget the weekend he barely remembers, so he got himself a permanent souvenir: his first tattoo. Now more tattoos are beginning to appear and Cam has no idea why. Mornings in the SoCal apartment he shares with his best bud are all starting off the same way: Cam wakes up and discovers a new ink breakout somewhere on his body. Sometimes it’s undecipherable writing. Other times it’s a strange symbol. Every time it’s a blemish even his most expensive exfoliant can’t scrub away. All attempts at finding out who or what is vandalizing his once-immaculate appearance are coming up empty, and the ever-multiplying tattoos aren’t just destroying his looks; they’re destroying his whole life. Forced to embrace his altered self, Cam starts over in the place he least expected. There his life begins to follow a familiar and comfortable pattern and gives him hope of a new normal. What Cam doesn’t realize is that his transformation is far from complete.
