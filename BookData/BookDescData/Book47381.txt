Welcome to historic Lea Bay, home of maritime lore and the region’s most popular pirate festival. It was also the landing site of the infamous Lords of the Deep, ruthless pirates who once pillaged the area and said to have hidden a chest full of cursed treasure.  But this year’s pirate festival will be different.  This year, the Lords of the Deep are coming home.  Recovering from the death of her husband, Daphne Jordan is thrust into a series of bizarre events leading up to the big celebration. Lea Bay locals have been reporting strange incidents. Green mist. Seismic activity. Sinister sightings in the harbor, things with scales and long, sharp teeth. Monsters. Joined by her brother-in-law and a local police officer, Daphne must solve the mystery before whatever is swimming beneath the shore surfaces for all eternity. Before the Lords of the Deep resurrect their long-dormant leader upon the Bay—and the world.
