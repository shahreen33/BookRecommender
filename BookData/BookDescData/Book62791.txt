“The Wolf has played me for a fool.”  I’ve no clue who is hunting me, but he demands I complete his tests. I fear if I can’t figure out his identity, he’ll kill me just like he said.  His eyes were blue the last time I looked into them, but now when he glares at me they’re green. Is the Wolf playing dress up? Or are there two monsters who have stolen me?  “Did you think I’d make this easy for you, Red? Are you ready to play again?” – The Wolf  I want out of this nightmare, and the only way to do that is to win.  I need to win.
