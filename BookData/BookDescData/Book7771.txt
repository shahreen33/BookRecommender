This dark and twisted tale of ownership will make your blood run hot. Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and Amazon Bestseller Vivian Wood writes dark romance as OLIVIA RYANN.   Something has shifted and changed in me. I have left Katherine behind, and stepped fully into the blossom of Fiore. But while I am undergoing that transformation, Monster too senses a sea change within. He’s violent and moody and… he seems to care about what happens to me. It is unthinkable, but maybe the fragile bond between us has grown into something more. Something dark and glittering and provocative. Profound and emotional. I know that this wasn’t his plan. I know that he hates that I might have power over him. But I hope that the delicate thing between us grows. Even if I don’t know where it might lead either of us.
