Brock lost his brother to werewolves. Now he’s in danger of losing himself. Bitten by a werewolf at sixteen, he fights the transformation, taking the excruciating pain as a punishment for his mistakes. With the help of a risky drug called Lycanthrox, he’s managed to stay human for two full moons. But he knows he can’t last much longer.Hungry for revenge, Brock vows to kill the wolf who bit him. But Brock’s ex, Cyn, still cares about him enough to stop him from a suicide mission. As the heat between Brock and Cyn rekindles, he feels like a beast next to her beauty. He can’t stay with her; he can’t ignore the werewolves howling outside his window. When he hunts down the pack, Cyn follows him; the werewolves take them both hostage, then start running, the police hot on their tails. Brock isn’t sure he can get out of this alive before the wolf within kills him–or someone else does.“With Bloodborn, Karen Kincy opens a frightening new chapter in the werewolf legacy. Brilliant, dark, and filled with haunting images. Highly recommended.” — Jonathan Maberry, New York Times bestselling author of Rot & Ruin and King of Plagues
