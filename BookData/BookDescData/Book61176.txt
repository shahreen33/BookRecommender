*On sale for a special new release price!*  When she was bad, she was better.  Elizabeth Harding, the perfect, polished daughter of politicians, plays by all the rules. Or so it seems. Tired of a lifetime of denying her passionate nature, she’s created an alter ego. As Tess, Elizabeth is able to safely and secretly indulge all of her wild fantasies—even if that fantasy is financing a private club of pleasure.  Driven and ambitious, Luca Santos has clawed his way from rags to riches. His boss’s daughter has tempted him for what seems like forever, but he’s known that the pampered princess probably wouldn’t be down with his dirty ways. Elizabeth is sweet, innocent, demure…so what’s she doing sneaking around a place that revels in sexual abandon?  One night. So many ways to ruin a person.  Note: This title contains explicit language and sexual roleplaying. Elizabeth and Luca's story will conclude in Stay My Fantasy, coming in June.  Length: 30,000 words
