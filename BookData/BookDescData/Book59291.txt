Sergeant David Wolf has put his Special Forces days long behind him, settling down as a cop in the small ski resort town of Rocky Points, Colorado. He's a good cop who's seen bad days before, but none quite like this. As if narrowly escaping an attempt on his life, his addict ex-wife being back in the picture, and complications to his all-but-certain appointment to Sheriff weren't enough, he's just received word that his traveling blogger brother has committed suicide in the Alps of Italy.Devastation and resentment over his only sibling's selfish act quickly gives way to a nagging suspicion that he isn't getting the whole truth. Conviction of his brother's character is enough to pull Wolf from his pressing situation at home to the entirely foreign land of Northern Italy -- into a more dangerous and volatile turn of events than he could have possibly imagined. With the help of a beautiful young officer of the Caribinieri, Wolf must piece together what happened on that last fateful night of his brother's life without ruffling too many feathers, or paying the ultimate price. A gritty tale of international mystery, Foreign Deceit is a cerebral, visceral and emotional ride that will keep you guessing until the final pages.
