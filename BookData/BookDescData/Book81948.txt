From the Back CoverMillions were affected by the deaths of David Bowie and Alan Rickman in January 2016. Many wanted to help fight cancer. Forty of them were the authors who met online and released this anthology, with proceeds going to St Jude's Hospital, Minnesota, to fund cancer research.'Stardust, Always' is a collection of short stories and poems from a group of authors that truly spans the globe, from Britain to Australia, America to China, Mexico to Norway. There are stories of angels and goblins, wizards and shape shifters, those who survived cancer and those who didn't. There are stories of rock stars and piano teachers, mists and melons, Little Red Riding Hood and the end of the world.This is a diverse collection of writing, from a diverse collection of writers. There is humour, and there is grief. There is hope, and there is acceptance. But always, there is stardust.About the AuthorStardust, Always is a Charity Anthology written in memory of David Bowie and Alan Rickman, lost to us in 2016 to cancer.
