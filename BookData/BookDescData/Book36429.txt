Sophie Morrigan inherited many magical gifts from her death goddess mother. Most of them inflict torture, except the most beautiful. That one kills.  As an agent for the Faerie Affairs Bureau, Sophie loves retrieving dangerous magical objects. The job lets her indulge her covetous nature, and most importantly, it pays the bills. But when a routine job goes south, she finds herself struggling to keep her deadly magic in check while fleeing the wrath of an enraged dragon.  In a desperate search for answers, Sophie stumbles across Owen, a fae nightclub owner who's as sexy as he is irritating, but just happens to hold the key to her problems.  Sophie wants nothing more than to get her magic under control and return to her normal life, but first she'll have to face off with all the dangers Faerie can throw at her. Can she fight her way back home? Or will both she and Owen fall prey to a crazed death cult?  Bound by Faerie features a gutsy, kick butt heroine, a broody and dangerous hero, and a ton of magical mayhem.
