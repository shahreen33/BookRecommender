Once upon a times and happily ever afters? Sometimes Destiny is far too dark to give us a traditional faerie tale!Life is a fragile thing, not only in the mortal sense. It's like a big glass ball waiting above your head, and sometimes one simple thing can send the glass crashing down around you in a million small pieces. All you can do when that happens is stand by and watch as the pieces of your life shatter, fall, and then settle around you. You have two choices; you can try and piece them back together one by one, or you can start all over and try and make a new glass ball. Somewhere in between the two options, is where you find the person you're meant to be, the person that's somehow strong enough to take destiny face on, no matter how impossible that may seem. But when fate hands you a life unlike anything you've ever dreamed of, will you be able to handle it?Calandra thought she lived a normal enough life; she fought with her dad like any other teenage girl. She had a boyfriend that she knew was it for her. School was coming to an end, and she was going to have all summer to spend with Tristan while her father was out of town; it doesn't get much better than that. But when a stranger comes to her in a dream, life takes an unexpected turn. Calandra is thrown into a whirlwind where she discovers the heritage her father has been hiding from her for years, learns of a whole new world, and finds that destiny doesn't always hand you the life you dreamed of. Now, the question is- can she handle it all? Will she accept what she's meant to be?In the first installment of The Euphoria Series, Field of Innocence shows us that not all Faerie tales start with once upon a time or end with happily ever after. Sometimes destiny is far too dark for that. Link: http://lainylane.com/Field
