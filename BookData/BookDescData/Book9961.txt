Confused, scared, lonely, and in constant fear, she waits – struggling with her feelings of mentally abandoning her child. Soon, psychologically, she attaches herself to her captor. The abductor, after a few days, opens the door and explains the following to the group of women. “Tomorrow morning, at eight am, one of you will forfeit your life to save the other three. If one person isn’t willing to die, everyone will die.” Ryan Capshaw was raised at the hand of an abusive father, and grew up believing he was worthless.
