A Reminiscence of Sherlock HolmesEccles was shocked to hear of Aloysius Garcia's beating death. He'd spent the night at Wisteria Lodge, Garcia's rented house, but when he woke up in the morning, he found that Garcia and his servants had all disappeared. He was alone in an empty house.Eccles met Garcia, a Spaniard, through an acquaintance, and seemed to form an unlikely friendship right away. Garcia invited Eccles to stay at his house for a few days, but when Eccles got there, he could tell that something was amiss. Garcia seemed distracted by something, and the whole mood of the visit seemed quite sombre. And then one of Garcia's servants handed him a note -- and the man's mood became even darker.
