More often than usual, Aries questions his purpose in life. In his heart, Aries believes he should be doing something with more significance. However, his dubious, timid demeanor continuously holds him back from pursuing the answer. The ultimate question he desires to answer is – what is my true destiny? The answer to his question soon comes to fruition after finding himself far away from Earth to the realm of Nari. There, Aries learns he once was the mystical hero, “The Guardian Angel.” Unfortunately, during his absence, Nari has been held under siege by his nemesis, a demon named Blace. It is up to Aries to regain his powers and save the realm. The stars appear to be aligned, except, for one problem. Aries has no recollection of being the “Guardian Angel.” Being the only one who can to save Nari, Aries’ reluctance to accept his gift leaves the fate of the spirits in turmoil. Not to mention, Aries only has one week to save the realm before Blace obliterates it. Will Aries accept his calling as the “Guardian Angel” and rescue Nari from demise?
