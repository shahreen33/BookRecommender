The more Carter Devereux, a professor of archeology, researches and studies the history of the human species, the more he becomes convinced that Solomon was onto something when he said:“The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. Is there anything whereof it may be said, See, this is new? It hath been already of old time, which was before us. There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.” Ecclesiastes 1:9 -11 (Circa 940 BC).Carter’s research and exploration into this history take him to South America, India and the Middle East where he makes mind-boggling discoveries which challenge our entire view of human history. And before long, Carter finds himself with not only a large number of critics from across the world but also a number of ardent followers.Through the ages kings, rulers, power seekers and governments have been trying to secretly, and sometimes not so secretly, to get their hands on artifacts believed to have immense power. Examples include the Holy Grail, the Ark of the Covenant, Bachal Isu – the staff of Moses, carried by David, and the King of Kings, Jesus Christ, the Spear of Destiny, the time machine “the glock” created by the Germans during WWII, and ancient lost cities with hidden fortunes of gold and artifacts with unimaginable powers.There is a no shortage of unscrupulous, power hungry people who will do anything, including kill, to possess these relics- if they exist.Most frightening of them all are the ancient texts that speak of earth’s destruction by nuclear weapons thousands of years ago.Do those nuclear weapons still exist?If so where are they?Can Carter Devereux discover them before anyone else can?Carter is drawn into the secret world of archeology which he never knew existed where phrases such as; “above top secret,” – “never existed,” – “will be denied if uncovered,” – and “black ops budgets,” are part of the language.Nothing New Under The Sun is a full-length novel, a thought-provoking mystery about the discovery of antediluvian human civilizations and the terrifying consequences of digging up the past. Nothing New Under The Sun is the first book in J C Ryan’s Carter Devereux Mystery Thriller series, the prequel to the stimulating, fast paced thriller, The Wolves Of Freydis.
