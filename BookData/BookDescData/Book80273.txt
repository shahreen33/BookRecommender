Figures Giselle would turn out to be the child of literal Chaos.  As a budding immortal who could mold into anything, staying in Cursed Academy doesn't bode well. She'll probably end up a goddess of disaster or tripping, according to her new boyfriend Ronin. But transferring to Olympian with Ronin means breaking an oath made by the gods on the River Styx--and the gods won't he happy. So long as Giselle bears Prometheus's mark, she stays at his school.  Worse, her arch nemesis Wendy's forming her own secret society to banish her to the Underworld. But fighting back means destroying Wendy with her uncontrollable powers, which will turn her into a dark goddess for sure.  Certain she'll get paired to fight Wendy during Combat Exams, there's just one way for Giselle to save herself: get Wendy expelled. And the only way to do that is to show Wendy's involved with the Lower Order, the terrorist cult who attacks the gods and wants to force Giselle into their ranks. That's hard when all Ronin wants is to keep her safe.  Can Giselle risk her friendships, her future, and possibly even Ronin's heart?
