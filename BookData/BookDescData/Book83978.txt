From a diverse set of young writers comes a lyrical, fantastical, and heart-wrenching collection of stories for the holiday season. Each tale is a warm light, strung together by threads of loss, love, and the new beginnings that Christmas brings.We hope these stories will uplift and console in a season that many find stressful and turbulent. So, although it's been said many times and many ways, Merry Christmas to you.
