Barely surviving her first term at college, all Ren wants to do over break is relax and bond with her roommateâ€”not get eaten by a sentient building or attacked on the street. But with increasingly open warfare brewing between the magical factions and Layers of the world, this time, Ren will not fail in making sure everyone she loves stays safe and protected. That includes doing things like filling her parent's house with personal art heavily embedded with wards, bubble-wrapping her increasingly imperiled roommate, and even making sure that a certain sexy thorn-in-her-side continues to breathe free air.Finding herself on duty protecting the entire university alongside campus god Alexander Dare...was not what she'd had in mind. But this time it's not only her life on the line. And Ren will do anything to protect those she loves.
