Jake is a jeek—part jock, part geek—who finds out he’s an unwitting target of genocide against a secret society known as the Druids—a society he didn’t even know he belonged to.O’Brien, one of the last druids, is his mentor. Unfortunately, he is a dud when it comes to magic, but at least he is ex-military.As for picking his girlfriend . . . well, that’s a split decision. Alexis and Kendra are opposites in almost every way.Now, if he can just survive the nightwalker—an obsidian-skinned creature with a thirst for blood and a banshee’s mind-destroying scream, who wears a cloak black enough to make the grim reaper jealous—then he might have a chance.Ultimately, protecting his loved ones, and himself if possible, becomes his priority.
