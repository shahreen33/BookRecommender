Want to play a game… When research chemist Kiera Underwood receives a cryptic phone call about her twin brother, she tries to contact him to no avail. Her twin sense tingles, warning her that something is wrong. When he doesn’t return her call, and the manager at Oceanic Labs claims he didn’t come into work that day, she heads to Cold Harbor. But when she arrives in town to find the door to her bother’s house ajar, she races to the lab to question his fellow employees.  Solve the puzzle and save your brother… Kiera’s not prepared when an attempt is made on her life and Blackwell Tactical operative and former Army Ranger, Cooper Ashcroft delivers her second shock of the day. Someone killed the lab supervisor and stole a deadly biotoxin. The main suspect? Her brother, and Blackwell Tactical has been hired to bring him in. If that wasn’t shocking enough, she’s suspected of colluding with him. She had nothing to do with the theft or murder, and despite the evidence staring her in the face, she knows that her brother is innocent of all charges. She sets out to prove it, and she’s soon the victim of a near abduction thwarted by Coop. He’s faced with the reality that she’s telling the truth and someone has likely abducted her brother—perhaps killed him—and now Kiera’s very life is in danger, too.
