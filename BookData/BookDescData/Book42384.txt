Jo, April, Mal, Molly and Ripley are five best pals determined to have an awesome summer together...and theyâ€™re not gonna let any insane quest or an array of supernatural critters get in their way! Not only is it the second title launching in our new BOOM! Box imprint but LUMBERJANES is one of those punk rock, love-everything-about-it stories that appeals to fans of basically all excellent things.
