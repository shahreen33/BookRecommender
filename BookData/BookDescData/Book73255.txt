What if I told you that the life of your dreams isn't out of reach? What if you could have a personal relationship with someone who knew all the intimate details of your present and future? You may already know the answer to this mystery and not even realize that you do. Today's culture has formulated some crazy ideology surrounding the Holy Spirit and, sadly, has turned many people off to the idea that a relationship with Him is a valuable and obtainable reality.In this book we are going to debunk the quirky, false claims that we have been led to believe about the nature of the Holy Spirit. We will take real steps toward the understanding of His true nature, as well as what our lives can look like as we welcome His involvement in our daily lives. I truly believe that by the end of this book and, more importantly, this small but significant encounter with the Holy Spirit, you will be standing at the doorstep of a life you once believed was only to be lived in your dreams.
