But I refuse to put on the baby oil just yet, there’s got to be someone out there willing to hire me. Luck is not on my side, at least until I spot the Crow’s feather.

No, I'm not kidding, it literally kept me from being a can of spam. The feather, not done with me yet, takes off again. Driven to chase it, I do, and it takes me to this gloomy foreboding building that I don't recall ever seeing before. And as fate would have it... there's a now hiring sign on the front gate.
