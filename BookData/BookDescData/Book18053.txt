Be careful what you search for...Sixteen-year-old twins Emma and Jack Guthrie hope for a little summer adventure when they find an eighteenth-century message in a bottle revealing a hidden pirate treasure. With their best friend—and Emma's secret crush—Cooper Beaumont, they discover the treasure, and accidentally unleash an ancient Gullah Hoodoo curse that attacks Jack with the wicked flesh-eating Creep and promises to steal Cooper’s soul on his approaching eighteenth birthday.Determined to save the two people she loves the most, Emma apprentices herself to an elderly sea island hoodoo root doctor who agrees to teach her the magic to undo the hex while she works to unravel the riddle of the pirate’s message. With the clock ticking down to Cooper’s birthday and Jack turning into a walking skeleton, Emma must hone her new skills to conjure visions of the past to discover the curse’s origins, steal an antique ruby, battle a horde of terrifying demon dogs, and summon ancient spirits who can help set things right before it’s too late.
