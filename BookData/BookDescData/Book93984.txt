Little Owl flies through the night forest, visiting his friends. One friendly fox says hello, two beavers wave, three skunks nibble berries. And when Little Owl finally reaches his own tree, he sees Raccoon who has gathered ten acorns. Sweetly told, 1-2-3 is just right for children learning their numbers!
