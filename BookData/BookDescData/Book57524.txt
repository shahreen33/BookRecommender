From the host of the popular podcasts, "The Liturgists Podcast" and "Ask Science Mike," a story of having faith, losing it, and finding it again through science revealing how the latest in neuroscience, physics, and biology help us understand God, faith, and ourselves.  What do you do when God dies? It's a question facing millions today, as science reveals a Universe that's self-creating, American culture departs from Christian social norms, and the idea of God begins to seem implausible at best and destructive at worst.  Mike McHargue understands the pain of unraveling belief. In "Finding God in the Waves," Mike tells the story of how his Evangelical faith dissolved into atheism as he studied the Bible, a crisis that threatened his identity, his friendships, and even his marriage. Years later, Mike was standing on the shores of the Pacific Ocean when a bewildering, seemingly mystical moment motivated him to take another look. But this time, it wasn't theology or scripture that led him back to God it was science.  In "Finding God in the Waves," "Science Mike draws on his personal experience to tell the unlikely story of how science led him back to faith. Among other revelations, we learn what brain scans reveal about what happens when we pray; how fundamentalism affects the psyche; and how God is revealed not only in scripture, but in the night sky, in subatomic particles, and in us.  For the faithful and skeptic alike, "Finding God in the Waves" is a winsome, lucid, page-turning read about belonging, life s biggest questions, and the hope of knowing God in an age of science."
