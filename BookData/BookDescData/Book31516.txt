It’s been four years since the tragedy that claimed the Mountain Ridge Alpha and Mel, the mutual mate of Alpha Hassan Amari and the beta Toval. As a mated Alpha-beta pair, Toval and Hassan have managed to defy the odds and come through tragedy stronger than ever, despite the shroud of secrecy that surrounds Mel’s death. Strange letters from an impossible sender throw the fragile balance of their healing into question.  Alphas are dying in Europe, and a group of omegas with a deadly mission has taken credit. They call themselves Epsilon, and they’re hell-bent on overthrowing the hierarchical system that has ruled the shifter world for as long as anyone can remember. Meanwhile, the success of the European Council breeding program, known colloquially as the Futurus Initiative, has increased pressure on stateside Alphas to conform in order to save their dwindling population. Hassan and Toval’s joint effort to fight the Initiative seems to have failed, but Epsilon has less peaceful methods in mind.  One letter changes everything. The leader of Epsilon chooses Hassan and Toval to deliver his ultimatum: Abandon the initiative, or every pack Alpha in the Council will die. Toval and Hassan find themselves the unwitting messengers of this twisted message, pitted against a corrupt Council and a ghost of the past who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Time will tell if their love can withstand this dangerous new alliance.  This is book 10 of the Mountain Shifters Series and contains story elements that are meant to be read in the context of the events in the rest of the series. This work is meant for mature audiences only. HEA, no cliffhanger.
