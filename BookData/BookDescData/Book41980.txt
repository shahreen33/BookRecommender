Harper Martinez is just a quiet, nerdy sixth grader who wants nothing more than to find the perfect Halloween costume. Kiel Johnston is her best friend and all he wants is the same thing. Two days before Halloween, Harper finds a spooky, old cape at a strange new store downtown. She has just enough money to buy the cape, but she and Kiel have no idea what trouble it's going to cause them. This cape comes with a little something extra: A GHOST!
