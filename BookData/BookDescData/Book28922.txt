Peter Parker has gone international, and he's making his next stop in China -- but one of Spider-Man's most terrifying villains has followed him to Shanghai! And the malevolent Mister Negative has two of Spidey's former friends in his thrall: the fan-favourite duo Cloak and Dagger! Can our ever-amazing wall-crawler handle two inverted heroes without falling prey to Negative's influence himself?  And Peter's globetrotting doesn't end in the Far East -- a final showdown with the Zodiac will lead him all across Europe! When Scorpio puts his master plan into motion, there may be no way Spider-Man -- or anyone -- can stop him from seizing control of the future! Spidey's neighborhood is bigger than ever, but it's far from friendly!
