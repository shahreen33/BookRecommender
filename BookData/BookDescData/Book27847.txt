On a day when nothing seems to be going Lucy's way, she just wants to binge watch her favorite TV show and inhale a couple—okay, a dozen—cupcakes. But the black cloud that’s followed her all day makes another appearance when she realizes she’s out of sugar. Resigning herself to the fact that she'll have to ask a neighbor for some neighborly help if she wants those cupcakes, she sets out to do just that. When a dripping wet and freshly showered hottie she’s definitely never seen before answers her impatient knock, she’s rendered speechless. Okay, not speechless, because that’d be far, far too easy for her. Instead she humiliates herself in typical Lucy fashion, then bails, certain if she tries hard enough she can go the rest of her life without running into Hot Neighbor Guy again.Too bad for Lucy her neighbor isn’t so easily deterred.
