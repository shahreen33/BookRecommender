Book 1 of The Father/Son DuetI said good-bye to my son. But he had one final request—a letter I’ll never forget.Dear Dad,If you're reading this, it means I'm gone. I had one dream, growing old with Holland. Death won't stop me from providing for my wife. And because you're the best man I know, what I'm about to ask—my last request—I know you'll do. Please take care of Holland. Take her back to California with you. It's a lot—I know. But, I’m placing my most precious possession in your hands.Love, Scott But the thoughts swirling through my mind are certainly not what my late son had in mind. How do I resist this woman in front of me? After all, you can't choose love, it chooses you.
