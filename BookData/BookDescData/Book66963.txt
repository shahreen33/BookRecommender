In July 2013, David Thatcher died of a drug overdose in America. More than you were was written by his daughter, to try to understand what came after. The result is a striking collection of poetry which explores addiction, family politics, childhood memories and grief. Her short, sharp poems home in on situations to reveal their complex relationship and the challenges she faced after losing him. A brave debut, More than you wereÂ explores what it means to lose a father to an addiction and live on. Shortlisted for the Bare Fiction Debut Poetry Collection Competition 2015 judged by Andrew McMillan.
