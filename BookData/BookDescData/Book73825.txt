John Hancock had everything a boy could want. He lived in a beautiful house, wore fancy clothes and ate the most delicious food. When his uncle died, he became the richest man n New England.This wasn't enough, though, because John wanted everyone to like him, too. Most people did, but one certainly did not--King George of England.John refused to pay taxes to the king, and to show how mad he was, he made his signature on the Declaration of Independence so large that the king wouldn't need his spectacles to read it!
