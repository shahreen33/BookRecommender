Philomena Black has decided the next step of her life includes being a bride. When she finds out that she’s been placed as a Mail Order Bride much more quickly than she expected, she’s off to Nebraska and her new life. Unfortunately, upon arrival, she finds that her new life isn’t going to be what she expected.  But Lewis Meyers has no desire to marry. Finding himself in charge of his brother’s children, and wanting to see them taken care of appropriately and to alleviate his responsibility with them, he uses an agency to hire a housekeeper. But marriage? No way!  As Philomena seeks an alternative to being a mere housekeeper, Lewis sees the men lining up to court her and finds himself inexplicably jealous. Soon his heart yearns for this wonderful young lady to become more than a children’s caretaker, but is it all too late?  The question remains: will Lewis ask for her hand in marriage? And, more than that, will Philomena accept?  Philomena’s story is one of the amazing tales in the Western romance collection, Young Love Historical Romance Volume 2, by #1 bestselling clean Christian romance authors, Misty Shae and Terri Grace.  Each story is a great read in itself, and can be read alone, or even better read them all as part of this adventurous feel good series.
