The third stand-alone romance in New York Times bestseller Marie Harte’s small town, shapeshifter romance series: Cougar Falls. There’s more than one way to outsmart a fox… Trust Julia Easton to screw up Sheriff Ty Roderick’s March Madness plans. The pixie-faced vixen might be the picture of feminine perfection, but she tests his innate sense of order to its limits. Weeks ago, he let his conscience turn down a proposition his body still burns to accept—then she vanished. Now he’s in the middle of Nowhere, Washington, racing to rescue her from danger. There’s risk in leaving Cougar Falls, but it’s the only way Julia can hope to save her sister from making the same mistake she almost made with Ty. Settling down and having kits is one thing, but it can’t be done with a human, especially one from a hunting family. Unfortunately, her sister isn’t budging, and the fiancé’s brother won’t take Julia’s no for an answer, either. When Ty comes riding to their rescue, Julia plans to use him and lose him. No way is she throwing herself at that alpha jerk’s feet in gratitude. Then Ty gives her the answer her heart still longs for: he wants to spend the rest of his life making things right. Now if only she can find the courage to say yes. This title has been previously released. Warning, this title contains the following: brutish killers, outfoxing females, and a love so hot it should be illegal. But no worries, the sheriff has a few tricks up his sleeve.  “Sassy strong females, protective alpha males who love their mates. Interesting conflicts both outside and inside their secret town. And of course, lots of shifter lovin’! ... For short stories, they are well developed and deliciously layered.” Ms Pink
