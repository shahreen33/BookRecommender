Since publishing A Woman’s World in 1995, Travelers’ Tales has been the recognized leader in women’s travel literature, and with the launch of the annual series The Best Travel Writing in 2004, the obvious next step was an annual collection of the best women’s travel writing of the year. This title is the seventh in an annual series—The Best Women’s Travel Writing—that presents inspiring and uplifting adventures from women who have traveled to the ends of the earth to discover new places, peoples, and facets of themselves. The common threads are a woman’s perspective and compelling storytelling to make the reader laugh, weep, wish she were there, or be glad she wasn’t.In The Best Women's Travel Writing 2011, readersHave lunch with a mobster in Japan and drinks with an IRA member in IrelandLearn the secrets of flamenco in Spain and the magic of samba in BrazilDeliver a trophy for best testicles in a small town in rural SerbiaFall in love while riding a camel through the Syrian DesertSki a first descent of over 5,000 feet in Northern IndiaDiscover the joy of getting naked in South KoreaLeave it all behind to slop pigs on a farm in Ecuador...and much more.
