Born in the deep as a princess with fins and gills, she was hidden among the humans, so her father - a corrupt sea king - could not use her to his advantage, or worse, destroy her in order to keep his position as ruler of a kingdom in the North Atlantic.A mysterious visit from a crystal-eyed stranger, along with the onset of startling abilities brings Meri to a realization that her life is in for a drastic change. Expectations are high and duties aren't taken lightly in the Deep. Thankfully, Meri's true form knows exactly what's expected of it. With the guidance of her mentor and his unmatched 'charm', and a few others along the way, Meri will have to make some tough decisions. Will she fulfill her dream of becoming a small town veterinarian or give it all up to save a world and a lifestyle she remembers nothing about? Is there someone she's destined to be with after all? Will her deadly fear of water be a problem?
