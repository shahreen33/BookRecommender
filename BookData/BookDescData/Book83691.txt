Stepdaddy Savage is a smutty Taboo novella featuring an over-the-top alpha. Read at your own risk  You do not say no to Graham Savage, because Graham Savage doesn’t ask. Just like his name suggests, he takes, and right now, he believes I’m his. He is a cold, calculated, ruthless, formidable Irish mobster, and... my step-dad.  Regardless of the fact that it's nothing more than a business transaction, he's technically married to my mom. Even still, I find myself scared to be caught, yet even more terrified of being cut loose.  They say love is like a butterfly…well, we are about to prove to the world that it’s also like a punch in the face. Sometimes inevitable…and always painful.
