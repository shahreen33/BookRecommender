With all my degrees and knowledge, how could I have lived with my head in the sand for so long? I'm thinking of nicknaming myself 'Ostrich'... head in the sand, backside flopping around in the air, going around in circles, tripping over my own long legs and awkward feet, never getting anywhere at all. It certainly seems an appropriate label, especially given the latest mess I'm now working my way through Mr. Magdalena LaSige, a thirty-three-year-old criminal archepsychologist, throws herself headfirst into finding a kidnapped Carmelite nun-the sister of her former professor, the handsome and wealthy Dr. Peter Janus. She is given ancient pictures and symbols sent from the kidnappers, clues in an archetypal trail of deceit. The Pyramids of Giza, DNA codes, constellations, medicine, money-these symbols, stories, and legends all combine to challenge everything Magdalena has taken for granted as truth. And the truth seems to be the last thing Dr. Janus wants to discuss. What is his connection with the pharmaceutical companies he consults for, and how does that play into the kidnapping? Is the 'scorpion's sting' a medical project or something much more sinister? Painfully aware of her limitations, Magdalena uncovers religious, medical, and governmental lies while racing against time. Will she solve the mystery, or will the truth behind the deceptions leave Magdalena paralyzed by the scorpion's sting?
