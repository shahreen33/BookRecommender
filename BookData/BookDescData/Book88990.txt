I need her to get me off the charges brought against me for my latest dumb mistake. But first I want to get with her.  Riley is an ambitious young lawyer who thinks I'm not her type. I'm a military bad boy and now I'm a criminal to boot. She's representing me so she's not even supposed to entertain the idea of being with me. And I don't do the kind of relationship a good girl like her would want. As a NAVY seal, I'm good at going in deep and not leaving a trace. Getting in, getting out, moving on are all the things I do best. This case can make or break both of our careers. So neither of us can afford the distraction of a forbidden romance. I know I can get her to bend all the rules. But will she get me to break my only one? Never take my eyes off the mission of being strong, tough and completely single.
