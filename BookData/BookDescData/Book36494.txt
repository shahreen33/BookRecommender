My nightmares have started closing in. Now I’m just trying to survive them. When my past comes back to haunt me, I find myself relying on the men I’ve come to care so much about. With their help, and the help of my best friend, I’m trying to navigate the threats—old and new. When I’m summoned to go before the Council, I have no idea what to expect. Thrust into a world of politics and status I’m not sure I agree with, my unease grows as I struggle to find my place. When my powers develop with the help of my Phoenix, I feel more prepared to take on the unknowns stacking up against me. Will my guys and I be able to face the trials in our path, or will the secrets of a world that's Hidden in Smoke destroy us before we’ve even started?  *18+ Reverse Harem Romance.
