Love and loss. Passion and pain. I’ve always been a fan of Edgar Allan Poe because his work epitomized how one can be driven mad by the truth and freedom of those emotions. So, when I needed to put the finishing touches on my doctoral research on Poe, I returned to my hometown of Richmond, VA—a place Poe also considered home. In truth, I could’ve gone anywhere. But Jackson Parker was back in Richmond. Best friends since we were twelve, JP was my support system. Separated by life but connected by technology, our relationship always had a flirty undercurrent, but it wasn’t sexual. Although our attraction was mutual, our affection was platonic. Until it wasn’t.I didn’t know when it happened. I didn’t know why it happened. I didn’t know how it happened. But love and loss, passion and pain collided in September and when I found the truth in the madness, that set me free.
