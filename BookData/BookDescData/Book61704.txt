Crystal Cove is about as safe a place you can find. Aria Lowe doesn't know if she believes that. She hates change, and lately there's been plenty of it going on around her small town. Aria doesn't like change; it terrifies her. Aria doesn't need to explore things or spread her wings; what if she fell instead of flew? Imagine how surprised she is when cocky but sweet Gabe Holmes makes her feel like she's soaring. Gabe has lived life loud and large just about long enough-he spent most his life on the go. A stop in Crystal Cove brings sweet, gentle, and sexy-as-sin Aria Lowe into his sights. But, Gabe's all about change and Aria has no room for that in her orderly life. Can Gabe prove to her you can stand still, and fly free at the same time?
