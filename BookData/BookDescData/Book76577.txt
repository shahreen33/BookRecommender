The Lucky Ones is Julianne Pachico's haunting debut collection of stories. Set in lush, heady Colombia - and also in a jungle-like New York City - it brings together the fates of guerrilla soldiers, rich kids, rabbits, hostages, bourgeois expats, and drug dealers. Exploring what makes a victim and what makes a perpetrator, these stories show lives fatefully entwined, despite deep cultural divides.
