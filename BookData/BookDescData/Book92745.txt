Series co-creator Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's personal interpretation of the Evangelion characters and story is sure to intrigue new and old fans alike.

As a carrier fleet steams towards Japan carrying a mysterious embryonic form linked to the true origins of the human race, a hurricane is about to blow down Shinji's momentary peace: the wind through the red hair of Asuka Langley Soryu, the new Eva pilot arriving in Tokyo-3...One of the founding members of Gainax, Japan's most progressive anime studio, Evangelion's Yoshiyuki Sadamoto was also the character designer for their recent Adult Swim smash FLCL.
