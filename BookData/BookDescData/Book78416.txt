Paisley I met Liam when I was sixteen years old. There was something about him that tempted me to break all the rules. I was enthralled by his bad boy ways, but I knew there was so much more to him—a side of Liam that he didn’t allow people to see.Little did I know, he’d save me on what could’ve been the worst day of my life. At that point, there was no going back. He was my everything. I felt safe in his arms.Until someone tried to kill me. LiamI was only seventeen years old when I met Paisley, and I haven’t been able to keep my eyes off her ever since.She was everything I wasn’t, but that didn’t stop me from wanting her, from making her mine. I’d love and protect her with my life. The cartel started gunning for her, and that was the worst decision they could have made. They’ll never know what hit them...Me.
