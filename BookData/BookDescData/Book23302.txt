Since his first literary appearance in 1886, the murderous Mr. Hyde has embodied the evil that even good men—including his alter ego, Henry Jekyll—are capable of when the constraints of civilized life are loosed. This chilling anthology also collects nine of Stevenson’s best-known tales of horror, including The Body-Snatcher," "Markheim," "Thrawn Janet," "The Bottle Imp," "The Isle of Voices," "The Waif Woman," "Olalla," and "Will o' the Mill."
