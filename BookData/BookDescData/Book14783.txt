ISLAND OF THE ASSASSIN is about two kinds of silence in conflict. A covert killer, Kai Landrie, contracted by the CIA to target Islamic terrorists, develops moral scruples. He shares his doubts in confession with Peter Quince, a priest, who gets renditioned for receiving classified information. The result: two unconditional secrecies, sacred and profane, tragically collide.
