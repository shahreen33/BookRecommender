After surviving the Hunger Games-like Testing, Eva becomes the Aerie’s first female Archon. The second installment of the Books of Eva continue the harrowing struggle between past and present, Aerie and Boundary.Eva is the first Maiden in Aerie history to train as an Archon: a sacred leader of the New North. All eyes are watching as she prepares to uncover the Relics of the evil past. Wounds remain: both from the harrowing Testing and the murder of her brother, Eamon. But she has learned to feign grace. And although she is betrothed to Jasper, she carries a secret. Lukas, a Boundary dweller and former servant, still visits her in the dead of night. And he alone may know who killed her twin brother.Her feelings for Lukas are forbidden. Even more troubling is his conviction that she is the Angakkuq, a mystical figure destined to destroy the Aerie. Eva tries to focus on finding Eamon’s killer, but on her very first Archon expedition, she uncovers the Genesis: the legendary ship that brought the Founders to the New North. What they find in the Genesis upsets the fragile balance between the Aerie and the Boundary, and threatens to destroy their entire civilization. Eva’s world is shattered, but she may be the only one who can—as both Archon and Angakkuq—prevent a war that would take everything from her.
