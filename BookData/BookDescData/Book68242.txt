Sloane has everything she thought she ever wanted- a great career, a great apartment, great clothes, a life she had worked hard for.  Until one night, one chance encounter, one decision that changed everything.

With no other choice, she agrees to his terms, climbs in a car with him, and travels almost clear across the country toward her new life. But the long hours on the road - and even longer hours in cabins and hotel rooms - together start to show her things.
