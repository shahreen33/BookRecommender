My name's Steve Mann and I've been a professional dog trainer and behaviorist for more than 30 years. As founder of the Institute of Modern Dog Trainers, I've helped transform the lives of over 100,000 dogs and their familiesâ€”and now I want to help you, too! Whether you're living with a brand-new puppy, an adult dog, or a rescue dog, my methods will give you everything you need to know. Using simple, proven, science-based and ethical techniques, I'll show you how to have the best relationship with your pup, as well as teaching you how to get: super-fast recalls, great loose lead walking, perfect manners, and much, MUCH more.
