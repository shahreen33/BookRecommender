Alpha-Mania Adventures is an innovative five-book series that ignites imagination and gives pre-reading children the foundation to become successful readers in the future. These exciting and colorful stories are the perfect tools to teach pre-reading skills through play. Storytime at home or in the classroom becomes fun and educational. Each adventure combines the heroic quests of five intrepid kids with phonological awareness and phonics, the first two components necessary to become a good reader. Captain Ray and the Rhyming Pirates (Book 1 of 5) practices the first phonological awareness skill: rhyming. Rhyming words are words that have the same middle and end sounds. For example, "bat" rhymes with "hat" because they both end with the sounds /at/. The story: Alex, Eddie, Izzy, Olly, and Umber are the Alpha-Maniacs, five adventurous friends who live in the magical Letter Lagoon. Out of the blue, a band of bumbling pirates sail ashore, seeking help with a treasure map theyâ€™ve found. The pirates speak only in rhyme, and they have no idea how to go about finding treasure. The clever kids jump at the chance to train the clumsy buccaneers in all aspects of being proper pirates, setting the stage for many exciting adventures to come. Every Alpha-Mania Adventures book includes:- An introduction to phonological awareness and tips to use the book to its maximum benefit- An exciting story that will charm young audiences- A Find the Hidden Objects phonics activity embedded in the illustrations- Bonus Activities related to phonological awareness, phonics, and/or letter formation- Easy-to-use guides on Letter Sounds and/or Letter FormationJoin the Alpha-Maniacs on their first of five phonological pirate adventures with Captain Ray and the Rhyming Pirates!
