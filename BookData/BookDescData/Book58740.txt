Forever.If she were to simply whisper my name, I would be at her feet, begging to touch what I shouldn’t, taste what doesn’t belong to me, run my hands along the sweet innocence she taunts me with.Penelope Justice is eighteen, old enough to graduate high school but—according to her parents—not old enough to live without 24/7 security.

I’ve done bad things in my life, and I don’t deserve her. But I can’t do the honorable thing.I’ve never been noble, and I’m not starting now.
