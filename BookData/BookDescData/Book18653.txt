Sometimes everything goes to hell. Sometimes hell comes to you.Jessica Moore has one hell of a to-do list. 1) Bring the fury who attacked her friends to justice. 2) Obtain the last item required to relock a magical prison. 3) Save the world by actually relocking the damn thing before its demonic prisoners escape.But with a red sky enveloping the earth, humans and nonhumans alike are panicking, and the crazy fringe is getting violent. Anti-magers-humans who want to destroy all things magical-are waging war on Jess and her friends.Then there's still the problem of the key. It's the last item Jess and her allies are searching for, but legend claims it's trapped within the prison itself. Someone will have to go in there and face down the demons to find it.Naturally, guess whose strange power is the only thing that might succeed? Even with Lucen at her side and a Gryphon army at her back, this might be too much for a misery junkie to handle.Warning: Blood and tears will be shed, sacrifices will be made, and more secrets will be revealed. So kiss your loved ones and hold your weapons tight. No one ever claimed the apocalypse would be fun.
