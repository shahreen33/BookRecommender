For more than a century before gay marriage became a hot-button political issue, same-sex unions flourished in America. Pairs of men and pairs of women joined together in committed unions, standing by each other “for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health” for periods of thirty or forty—sometimes as many as fifty—years. In short, they loved and supported each other every bit as much as any husband and wife.  In Outlaw Marriages, cultural historian Rodger Streitmatter reveals how some of these unions didn’t merely improve the quality of life for the two people involved but also enriched the American culture.Contents:Walt Whitman &amp; Peter DoyleMartha Carey Thomas &amp; Mamie SwinnNed Warren &amp; John MarshallMary Rozet Smith &amp; Jane AddamsBessie Marbury &amp; Esie de WolfeJ.C.
