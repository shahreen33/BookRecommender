  Framed. Imprisoned. Pregnant. It's her worst nightmare...
Jenna Burns is horrified and distraught when she returns home to find her stepdaughter murdered and her beloved fianc√©, Robert, missing. When the police discover Robert's blood, she is charged, and imprisoned until trial. When Jenna learns she is pregnant, she must fight to protect herself and her unborn baby in the notorious Fallenbrook prison, surrounded by inmates who believe she is guilty. With only fifty-four Mother and Baby Unit prison spaces in the country, Jenna must convince the prison board to let her keep her baby, or it will be taken away at birth. But as her due date nears, and she tries to work out who the real killer is, she begins to fear that her child will be given to her worst enemy: whoever put her behind bars.
