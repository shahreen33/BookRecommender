A horror novelist goes missing in Maine...No, not that guy!I barely have time to recover from my last case before I'm hired to look into the disappearance of horror novelist L.H. Cain. Seems like she's disappeared from the face of the earth. With her mega-rich father breathing down my neck every step of the way and an ancient wizard trying to convince me to use the creepy sword in my basement, this case isn't going to be a walk in the park. Unless the park has ancient demons and weird undead...things.Oh, and Mallory's back!It's time to sharpen the swords and open a can of whoop-ass on some eldritch horrors.
