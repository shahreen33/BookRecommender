DON'T CLOSE YOUR EYES...He's watching you. He knows what you're doing. He knows what you're thinking. He's coming after you.DON'T CLOSE YOUR EYES...He has a knife. The steel blade gleams. Whenever you close your eyes, you can see it--the tip of his knife, pointing at your chest.DON'T CLOSE YOUR EYES...He's closing them for you."A master of sheer fright... the tension never lets up, building page by page to a nail-biting, hair-raising finale!" --Florida Times-Union
