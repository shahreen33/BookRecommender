Of course, worry can be an important asset when it forces our attention on problem-solving. But anxious worrying can cause us to unnecessarily focus on threat, to retreat and avoid, and to seek reassurance and safety which is no way to foster a life of growth and excitement. In his fifth published book, Dr. Reid Wilson proposes a groundbreaking, paradoxical approach to overcoming anxiety and worry by moving "away" from comfort, confidence, and security and willingly moving "toward" uncertainty, distress and discomfort. Through the use of unconventional strategies, readers will learn how to confront anxiety head-on and step forward into the face of threat. Drawing on a range of sources from firefighters and fitness instructors to Sir Isaac Newton and Muhammad Ali "Stopping the Noise in Your Head" demonstrates the importance of shifting our perspective and stepping "toward" our challenges in order to regain control of our lives."
