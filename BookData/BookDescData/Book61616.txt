This short novel, or novella, is 83-year-old Tony Whelpton's second this year, and his fifth since he switched from being a best-selling author of school and college textbooks in his late seventies, a change which he wishes he had made many years ago because of the enthusiasm which his novels have inspired. In the summer of 1986 Wilf Broadhurst is a desperately unhappy and lonely old man, a former factory hand living in Nottingham. Now a widower in his mid-seventies, he lives alone, has virtually no friends, and lost touch with his only daughter nearly thirty years ago in acrimonious and heart-rending circumstances. In despair he consults his doctor, but the only help he is offered is a suggestion that he should get out more – perhaps get a dog or start going to church – or even to the pub. In Wilf’s place, which option would you choose? And how would you rate your chances of having a happy Christmas? You will enjoy reading how Wilf's determination, resourcefulness and intelligence see him through.
