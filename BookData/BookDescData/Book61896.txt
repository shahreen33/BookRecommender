In the city of God's Helm, built ages ago under the shadow of the crystalline Sky Castle, Humans and Orcs have terrible Tinder hookups, Beholders and Gelatinous Cubes run Fortune 500 companies, and New Wave Dwarves wait tables at trendy Hobgoblin bistros.A young Ranger woman who came to the city with dreams of adventure, her drug dealing reptilian wizard roommate, and her boisterous Dwarf maiden BFF embark on a modern day quest to save the world while struggling to keep their crappy day jobs and pay off their student loans. They are joined in this quest by a thief (a half-Goblin sleazeball and the wizard's boyfriend), an elf (the hot actor-wannabe currently working as a waiter), a cleric (the cute guy from down the hall and the dwarf's occasional hook-up), and a barbarian (the religious fanatic who works in the cubicle next to the ranger).Collects Modern Fantasy Issues #1-4 as well as a bonus sketchbook selection!
