The Oedipal Complex has never been so sexy...Alex Carradine can't believe his father wants to come and visit his ski resort. Could it be that after so many stormy years, "slick Mitch" Carradine wants to offer an olive branch? Maybe the old man is mellowing, settling down with the new lover he's bringing along. Then Alex realizes the acid truth. This is no warm family visit. His father's new conquest is none other than the woman of Alex's sexual fantasies, meant only to dangle tauntingly in front of his face. At least an unexpected blizzard has frozen his father out of the picture entirely.Angeline Kastakis was looking forward to taking the next step in her relationship with Mitch. Too late, she realizes she's been led into a familial battle zone. Now it's Christmas and she's marooned in a blizzard with an insolent, gorgeous hunk of man whose blazing blue eyes tell her loud and clear he wants her in his bed. Preferably tied to it with a bow. There's no escape in sight. But as Alex stirs her secret longing to be mastered by a man, escape is the last thing on her mind...Warning: This book contains scenes of sensual submission hot enough to make you sweat in a blizzard.
