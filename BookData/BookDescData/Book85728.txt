  A sexy new forbidden romance from #1 NYT Bestselling Author Lauren Blakely
It seemed like a good idea at the time…As the team’s publicist, I need a football player to be the face of our charity calendar, and Jones Beckett needs a savvy PR woman to manage his new sponsorship deal. A simple give and take, and I’m sure I’ll have no problem following my iron-clad rule — don’t date a player. And never ever fall for one. No matter how charming, big-hearted and devilishly clever the man is. But you know what they say about best laid plans…Once I start spending my off-season days and nights with Jones, I’m following a brand new playbook, one that has me falling hard for the incorrigible flirt — heart, body and mind.That’s against the rules, and now what seemed like a bright idea has turned into a dangerously forbidden one.***It was supposed to be an I-scratch-her-back-she-scratched-mine kind of arrangement.  And man, did Jillian ever drag her nails down my back on one hell of a hot night. Okay fine, it was several hot nights on the road.Now we’re back in town and it’s time to set the play clock back to when we were simply player and publicist. Given the way the last few years have gone, I can’t risk this deal. Trouble is, I want more than than just another night with her.What’s a guy to do when he's always been most likely to score, but the woman he’s falling for is way off limits?
