Cade “Ripper” DaviesI don’t do attachments. I don’t do affection.I do my job, and it’s all I need. I’m a contract killer, and I’m a bad man.But this girl, Shell, she’s getting to me. She started out as a convenient hostage, a means to an end. But for some reason, I’m keeping her safe, even though it means turning against a man I once considered my best friend. There’s something about her, and not just that she’s sexy as hell. I can’t get her out of my head, and I can’t let her go.Shell BirchThe first thing I notice about Cade is that he’s ridiculously attractive. The next thing I notice is that he’s pointing a gun at me. I’m not one of those girls who gets hot for dangerous men, but let me tell you, the shoulders on this guy… Looking at his hard, broad body makes me warm in all the wrong places.He’s got a filthy mind and clever fingers, and he makes me dizzy when he touches me. I’m at his mercy, completely and utterly.I’ve see another side of him, something unguarded and honorable. That side of him takes me and makes me his. But I can’t be his… not with the kind of life he leads, not with the kind of demons he has.Oh, and I think I might be pregnant.
