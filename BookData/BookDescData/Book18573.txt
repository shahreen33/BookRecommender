I'm Jack. I'm a real pedigree dog, and I've got real papers to prove it. My parents have abandoned me into boarding kennels in the Far North of New Zealand, while they travel the world. I'm not at all happy about that. However, I shall do my best to maintain my dignity while getting on with the job. Among these unruly and noisy mutts, I intend to remain aloof and guarded. And as for that black cat with the skinny tail and missing eye, there's no way she's getting anywhere near me. At all!And I'll keep a diary so when my parents return they can read how absolutely miserable I have been all these months. Yes, I shall keep a diary...
