Shay Gable hated my guts, and I hated hers, too.We went out of our way to avoid one another at all times. When she came my direction, I went the other. When we locked eyes, she’d turn and walk away.All of that changed the day I was presented with a challenge. It started out as a stupid bet: make Shay fall in love with me before I fell in love with her first.That was an easy bet for me to win.I didn’t love, I hardly liked.Yet slowly the game started to shift. Shay made me crave things I never knew I wanted.Love.Happiness.Her.The closer we grew, the more she challenged my darkness, and the parts I kept locked away.The hurts.The pains.The truth.The game between us became too real, our feelings intermixed, and the risks of hurting one another grew higher.But you know what they say...All’s fair in the game of love and war—especially the heartbreaks.(Book one in the L&amp;S Duet)
