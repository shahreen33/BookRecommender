When he finds that he’s been transported to another world that’s exactly like a role-playing game, Mark is obviously overjoyed, but his enthusiasm is dampened as one thing after another seems to go wrong. His propensity towards choosing to play as a girl has placed him in the body of a young woman who isn’t entirely human. What’s more, he doesn’t have any starting gear or money, so he’s forced to trade monster meat for the right to spend the night in the local inn’s supply closet. What he never expected to find in that supply closet was a beautiful, busty elf as his roommate, one who is all-too-eager to join forces with him on the path to becoming a hero.Unfortunately, elves aren’t all they’re cut out to be. These long-lived forest dwellers rely on physical intimacy rather than communicative ability to avoid creating multiple-century-long grudges amongst themselves, so they have lost every speck of eloquence they once had. Their extreme isolationism also means that they never venture abroad or raise their levels. They’re tiny, they sound stupid when they talk, they demand hugs and head-pats as if they were children or perverts, and their only stat worth boasting about is their durability. Even so, Mark’s new friend left the safety of her home village behind in order to become the first true elfin hero and inspire her people. As a lover of both underdogs and heroic adventures, Mark finds himself drawn to this girl, as well as to her strangely familiar way of seeing the world around her.
