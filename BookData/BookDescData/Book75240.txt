Ninja Boy has a secret. It's not that he's flunking out of Ninja Academy â€” his dad knows that. It's that Ninja Boy doesn't like skulking about quietly in the night, clad in black like a thief, leaving no trace of his existence. No, this little Ninja has a different calling. He's a talented musician who expresses himself with a violin. He wants to share that passion with his dad, but is afraid his father will not approve. So what's a misguided maestro to do? Summoning all the courage and passion he has, he plays a loud and beautiful violin sonata for his Ninja dad! In Ninja Boy's Secret, Tina Schneider's lively, amusing illustrations bring her character's struggles and ultimate triumph vividly to life. This Japanese-inspired picture book teaches kids valuable lessons through a fun and inspiring story. With his faithful dog in tow, Ninja Boy makes his way from silence to song in a charming tale about being true to yourself and finding your calling in life.
