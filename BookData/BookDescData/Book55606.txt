Pack your knapsack and get ready, adventurers, we're going on a trip around the world! Make sure you have your compass and hiking boots and are prepared for the coolest and craziest adventures, but most importantly, don't forget to take your Adventurers' Handbook that will serve as a guide for any situation you might find yourself in. You'll learn to say hello in sixteen languages, how to beat jet lag, and properly use chopsticks. But most importantly, you'll get the directions to race a dog team across polar ice, survive barreling over Niagara Falls, and ride a camel across the Sahara Desert. Are you ready to see the world?
