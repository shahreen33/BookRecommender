Despite everything she thought she knew, Winter fell in love, and she fell hard. Living with the security of Cade’s unconditional devotion for the past two years has been a welcome reprieve from the decades of loneliness that came before him. So when he pops the question, she says yes. Of course she does. But two years isn’t long in the grand scheme of things, and certainly not enough time to erase the memories of the past. Sometimes, even the greatest love can’t silence fears. Our Love Unhinged is the final novella in the Reluctant Hearts series, and is best enjoyed after reading books 1-3 in the series.
