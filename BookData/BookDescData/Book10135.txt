Makenna Lewis cringes at any mention of the word commitment. She doesn’t want or need a relationship, but she does like sex (who doesn't). That explains Noah, Sean, and Zander, her three 'friends with benefits'. They know the score, they know they're not the only one, and each of them provide her with a different physical need that she craves and enjoys. Until a late night encounter with the delicious Daniel Winters turns her preconceived notion of no-commitment completely on its head. Soon she finds herself feeling things she vowed never to feel again, and when Daniel pushes for more than she’s willing to give, she falters. What do you do when something that you’ve known to be so wrong in the past feels so damn right?If you’re Mac, you run and hide. But is Daniel the type of man who takes no for an answer?*Disclaimer - There is absolutely no cheating in this book. However, this book does contain descriptive and super hot sex scenes that will make you blush and leave you hot and bothered. Make sure you have your husband, partner, boyfriend or significant other nearby when reading, or else batteries. Lots and lots of batteries*
