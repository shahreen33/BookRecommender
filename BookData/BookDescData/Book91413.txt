The winter doldrums have everybody in a funk, so Coralee decides a pre-spring makeover special is just the thing to lighten the mood. When her high school rival comes back to town, just as catty and mean as she was as a teenager, the first place she goes is to the Clip N Curl, with the sole purpose of making Coralee see red.  When the woman turns up behind the shop with a pair of hair scissors plunged in her back, Coralee becomes the prime suspect.  Can Noelle and her crew clear her good name - without the inadmissible testimony of a ghost - before her next styling gig is in prison?  This is Book 8 in the Witches of Keyhole Lake Southern Mysteries series.
