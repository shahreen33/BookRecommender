My name is Hibiscus Brown, my best friend is a unicorn and my life is going absolutely nowhere.Oh, and I'm a witch. At least partly - the rest is all werewolf.After growling a little to loudly, Hibiscus - Kitty - Brown finds herself in the unfortunate situation of having to move back home to live with her dad /the werewolf/, her step-mom /the werebear/, and all the other creatures living in a small town called Nowhere.Surely it's just temporary? Surely even a half-witch/half-werewolf can figure out what she wants to do with her life? Surely the handsome werewolf who just moved back will ignore her, like he /mostly/ did when they were in high school? And surely the mysterious dark stranger who seems to pop up just about everywhere will help her when she needs it?And what about the missing amulet? Will Grandma Hazel find it? And what does Grandpa Hunter wear on his head?So many questions... let's see if we can bring some clarity to it all, shall we?*** NOTE ***There will be f-bombs. And references to s-e-x. Nothing graphic because it's not my style, but there certainly will be shit that isn't super appropriate for a younger audience. You have been warned.*** This book is a slightly edited version of a story I wrote on Wattpad ***
