The road to hell is paved with good intentions.  What should’ve been a simple fact-finding visit changed in the blink of an eye.  I’m a patriot. A CIA officer. A master at manipulating the double agent schemes.  The straight and narrow path I set out on turned into a hundred winding roads, all leading to the same destination: I’m now aiding and abetting a foreign spy.  Kira Petrov stole something from me the moment we met—my breath, my heart, my allegiance. If I’m caught, I’ll be tried as a traitor. But there’s more to her story than anyone knows, and time is not on our side.  The only way out this tangled mess is to march straight through it.  Staying between the imaginary lines on a map is easy when the boundaries are clearly defined.  It’s that blurred line in real life that trips up the best of us.
