Welcome to Shadow Valley where the Dirty Angels MC rules. Get ready to get Down &amp; Dirty because this is Jag’s story…  The only thing Jag, DAMC Road Captain, loves more than his custom bike is Ivy. He’s wanted her ever since he could remember. However, through the years, he’s had to watch her date anyone but him. Even though she was raised in the club, she avoids dating bikers like the plague. Instead, she gravitates toward the complete opposite: geeks and nerds. Something Jag will never be.  Smart and always independent, Ivy wants to be the property of no man. Growing up in the club, she knows firsthand how they treat women. She regrets the mistake she made by dragging Jag upstairs to his room at the club one drunken night. Ever since then, she’s been doing her best to keep him at arm’s length, though it’s proven difficult. Especially when she finds out his secret, which only endears her to him even more.  Between secrets, lies, and a violent tangle with a rival club, can the passionate, but headstrong pair find the love and solace they’re looking for in each other’s arms? Or will everything just tumble down around them?  Note: This book can be read as a standalone. It includes lots of steamy scenes, biker slang, cursing, some violence and, of course, an HEA. If you like alpha males who like to take charge, this book is for you.
