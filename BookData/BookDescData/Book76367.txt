Once I decide I want something, the greed for it consumes me.I want answers.I want justice.I want vengeance.I want HER.My best friend and his sister—the girl I vowed could trust in me and whom I would always protect—dropped off the map two years ago. My own father pledged assurances that they'd been living a life they deserved.Lies. Lies. Lies. Hell hath no fury like a man who has no fucks to give and a mission to fulfill his promise.
