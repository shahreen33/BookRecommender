Lord Dreypa’s Leviathans continue their destruction of the lost tribe of Sith, searching in vain for an ancient, well-hidden Jedi starship. Beating Dreypa to the ship, a Sith rebel finds himself on the cusp of attaining his dreams- destruction of the tribe and discovery of a way to reach the galaxy. But there could be something that would cause him to have a change of heart, and Lord Dreypa could have found it!
