Life has gotten a bit dicey, lately. Which is a major understatement. My normal gig as a demon slayer turns extra deadly when a group of them attacks my home. I manage to take them out, but not before it’s too late. My sister and I are hit by the deadly fire veins curse. We have only days to find a cure, so we’ve got to split up to cover more ground.I’m lucky to have access to Declan, one of the most powerful fallen angels in the world. Not to mention, one of the hottest. One that I’m falling for faster than I like. But he’s the guy with the skill to help me find the cure, and I need all the help I can get.As we hunt for the cure to the curse that’s killing me, we uncover that threat is far greater than I’d even realized. There’s a mystery here, one that could tear my whole world apart. I just need to figure out what it is.Demon Curse is a fast-paced urban fantasy adventure starring a kick butt heroine, a powerful hero, and whole lot of humor.
