Third in the fabulous series that started with Why I Let My Hair Grow Out Senior year?s coming up fast and Morgan still has no clue about college, or a career?the whole rest of-her-life thing is basically a blank. Maybe it?s because she spent her junior year obsessing about Colin, the hot Irish guy she fell for last summer (that was right around the same time she discovered she?s a half- goddess from the days of Irish lore? you had to be there). She even saved Colin from a nasty enchantment, but he doesn?t know that. Colin doesn?t believe in magic, not even a little.  But then a mysterious message reunites her with Colin, who turns out to be caught up in the biggest faery-made disaster ever. We?re talking the end of reality?not just reality TV. To save the world, she?s going to have to tell Colin the truth about her half-goddess mojo. But if he doesn?t believe in magic, how will he ever believe in her?
