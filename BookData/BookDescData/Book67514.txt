It’s all fun and games to them--especially when someone gets hurt. One god of mischief and mayhem. One god of fur and fang. And the god of death himself. They’ve all been out to get me since the school year began, but this semester, the Rabbit’s got some tricks up her sleeve. It’s time to take these three vicious gods down a peg, or ten, and there’s no better route to revenge than directly through the heart. I just have to make sure I don’t get caught up in the twisted game myself. This is the second book in the Academy of the Gods series, a Paranormal Bully Academy Romance. Slow burn, all characters are 18+.
