[AUTHOR’S NOTE: THE UNFORGIVEN has been canceled by the publisher, but a new book 2, THE TREASURED, will be free to my newsletter subscribers! Coming soon.]Luke Oliver isn’t an ordinary private eye; he’s the Dark Wizard of Bordertown—the dimensional fold in Manhattan between the human, Fae, and demonic realms—and he keeps the peace when nobody else can. But he has fallen in love with the heiress to two thrones, and neither the Fae nor the demon royalty want him near their princess.  On her birthday, Rio Jones discovered that she’s royalty on both sides of her bloodline and inherited the powerful magic of starlight. She’s a bike messenger turned princess, and now she has sworn a year of service to the deadly League of the Black Swan in order to stay neutral between her two battling families.  When Rio inherits an unexpected treasure trove containing an impossibly rare and coveted dragon egg, and a former enemy comes back to life in a startling way, it will take every bit of Luke’s strength and magic, and Rio’s ingenuity, just to keep her alive. As they battle enemies—both strangers and family—Luke and Rio must learn to control the fires of passion raging between them, because a single moment of distraction might be their last.
