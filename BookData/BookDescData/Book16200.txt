For mature readers only. This pulp, cyberpunk, technothriller has profanity, violence, sexual situations, and an atheist protagonist. There are some disturbing scenes that may upset the more sensitive reader. For Jonathan Harkon, living life in exile is never easy. Forced into hiding his true identity and leaving the only home and family he's ever known, Jonathan finds himself halfway across the solar system, smuggling condoms for the religiously-oppressed citizens of an outer-system colony named Sanctity. It isn't long before his cover as a bouncer for a local "bikini-bar" is questioned, and he is quickly embroiled in Sanctity's hardcore, underground, sex-slave trade. With few friends by his side and only his ship, the HMS Mary Rose, to rely upon, Jonathan will need every ounce of the strength and skill that his heavily enhanced, genetically-engineered body can manage, if he means to survive and expose the terrible truth behind Sanctity's "Meat Market." Set in the not too distant future, "The Meat Market" is the first short novel in author James Chalk's "Jonathan Harkon Adventure" series.
