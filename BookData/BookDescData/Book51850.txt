An uplifting story about confronting big emotions from the author of The Night Box, stunningly illustrated by Julia Sarda. Ed's bad mood begins as something really small, hardly a thing at all. But before long it grows, gathers pace, and spreads through the whole town. Can Ed sweep his troubles away? A wonderful bedtime story for children aged 3 years and up, perfect for helping children learn to recognise and deal with big emotions. Louise Greig is an award-winning poet and a children's picture book author with a unique, lyrical voice. Julia Sarda is an illustrator from Barcelona.
