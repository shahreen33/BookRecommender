Lorna can't wait to visit her cousins Callum and Ruth on the remote Scottish island where they live this summer holiday - they always have such fun. But when Lorna arrives things have changed. Callum only hangs around with a new bunch of friends and Ruth always seems so grumpy. It looks like it's going to be a lonely island holiday. Then Lorna finds fluffy ginger and white kitten, Flame, hidden in a basket of wool and suddenly the island doesn't feel so lonely after all . . .
