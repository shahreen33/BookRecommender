"Demons of the Flesh "is a comprehensive and unflinching overview of the erotic initiation and sexual sorcery essential to the mysterious magical tradition known as the "Left-Hand Path."Part exploration of this taboo area, part manual detailing the actual mechanics of sex magic, the book draws on the pioneering studies of Aleister Crowley and Jack Parsons to penetrate the veil of secrecy surrounding the ecstasies and dangers of these practices. Zeena and Nikolas Schreck have collaborated on several musical, written, artistic and spiritual projects together, including the avantgarde musical group Radio Werewolf, Nikolas Schreck's documentary Charles Manson Superstar, and the Liberation in this Lifetime course. Nikolas is the author of The Satanic Screen, Flowers from Hell: A Satanic Reader, and The Manson File: Myth and Reality of an Oulaw Shaman, to which Zeena contributed her iconic art suite "God Bless Charles Manson" as cover art and chapter plates. Zeena is the leader of the Sethian Liberation Movement.
