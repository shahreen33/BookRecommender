Betty Boob is an inspired examination of one woman’s painful, surreal, and oddly humorous journey following a mastectomy. When Betty wakes up alone in a hospital she’s disoriented by the body that greets her. She must face the cruel outside world obsessed with beauty standards, starting with her boyfriend, who’s having a very hard time dealing with her new look. No one seems to know what to make of this new Betty and neither does she.  Embarking on a journey of self-discovery, Betty runs straight into the arms of fellow outcasts familiar with what it means to be on the outside looking in.  An inspiring and surprisingly comedic tale of loss and acceptance told largely through silent sequential narrative, Betty Boob is seminal work from master storytellers Véro Cazot and Julie Rocheleau.
