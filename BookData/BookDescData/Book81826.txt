Mixed breed vampire shifter, Gabe Moncrieff is fighting for his life...and vengeance. He's made a name for himself in the Cage, an arena where only the strongest survives. He's in the midst of training for the fight of his life when Rain Pettis appears. As an Elemental - a supernatural being descended from Zeus himself - Rain holds the key to Gabe’s future in the Cage, but she needs his help to break away from the overwhelming influence of her brothers. Gabe’s the only shifter capable of standing up to them and agrees to give her what she needs – freedom - if she’ll help him train for the next Cage match. But when Rain learns a secret that tests her loyalty to her brothers, she has a decision to make. Does she give it all for love? Or will she allow Gabe to risk his life within the Cage?
