Leadership is the most crucial choice one can make—it is the decision to step out of darkness into the light.    Bestselling author and spiritual guide Deepak Chopra invites you to become the kind of leader most needed today: a leader with vision who can make that vision real. Chopra has been teaching leadership to CEOs and other top executives for eight years, and the path outlined in The Soul of Leadership applies to any business, but the same principles are relevant in every community and area of life, from family and home to school, place of worship, and neighborhood. “At the deepest level,” Chopra writes, “a leader is the symbolic soul of a group.”      With clear, practical steps, you are led through the crucial skills outlined in the acronym L-E-A-D-E-R-S:L = Look and ListenE = Emotional BondingA = AwarenessD = DoingE = EmpowermentR = ResponsibilityS = Synchronicity      After identifying your own soul profile and the core values you want to develop, you can use these seven skills to allow your potential for greatness to emerge. Only from the level of the soul, Chopra contends, are great leaders created. Once that connectionis made, you have unlimited access to the most vital qualities a leader can possess: creativity, intelligence, organizing power, and love.      The Soul of Leadership aims to fill the most critical void in contemporary life, the void of enlightened leaders. “You can be such a leader,” Chopra promises. “The path is open to you. The only requirement is that you learn to listen to your inner guide.” In this unique handbook you are shown how to do just that, in words as practical as they are uplifting. The future is unfolding at this very minute, and the choice to lead it lies with each of us, here and now.
