Vulture sorcerer Horus, a ladykiller? Who knew? Yet, as the first story in this volume shows, he is accused of impregnating a slew of women. The second story takes a much lighter tone starring Grogro the big always hungry goofball seen in many stories before, especially in the Parade series. Here, he’s the hero, or at least tries to be, on a mission to fix a mess with a bunch of beer brewers. Question is: will he solve the problem… or just eat (and drink) it?
