NETFLIX NEWS! The 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN series is being adapted into a steamy Netflix dramedy series called SEX/LIFE, coming soon! Easily my favorite read of 2018, and one I'm going recommend over and over again. Flawless!" -Brittainy C. Cherry, Amazon#1 Bestselling Author Because BB Easton had so much fun writing her best-selling,award-winning memoir, 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN, she decided to give each of her four men his own steamy stand-alone. SUIT is Ken's book--the hilarious, heart-warming tale of how BB finally got over her bad-boy phase and found her happily ever after with ... gasp ...a guy in a tie. “Since when are you into guys in ties? You only like guys who look like they rob guys in ties. At gunpoint.” It was true. By 2003, my type had been well-established. There might as well have been a giant sign on my heart that said, “Good Guys Need Not Apply.” Which is exactly why I had to friendzone Ken Easton. The man was a former football star, smelled like fresh laundry instead of stale cigarettes, and had more ties in his closet than tattoos on his knuckles. Pssh. BOR-ING. But the more I got to know my hunky study buddy, the more questions I came away with. Questions like, why doesn’t he date? Why does he avoid human touch? Why does he hate all things fun and wonderful? The psychology student in me became obsessed with getting inside Ken’s head, while the spoiled brat in me became obsessed with getting inside his heart. In 2003, I found the one thing I love more than bad boys…A good challenge. 
  *SUIT is Book 4 in the 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN spin-off series but can be read as a complete standalone.
