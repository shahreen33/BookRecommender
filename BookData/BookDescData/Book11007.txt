"Revised 2014"Rave Reviews★★★★★  "E. J. Deen has written one hell of a novel. The pacing is relentless, the characters are believable, and the abductions are chilling. There are some seriously disturbing scenes in this book, so I wouldn't recommend it for the faint of heart. The scene where the entity was staring down at Grey, immobilized on a table, was so visceral that I had to sleep with the light on that night... Something I haven't done in years." - TimElliott Grey refuses to believe. As a top-notch journalist for a Seattle-based magazine, he is trained to have an open mind.
