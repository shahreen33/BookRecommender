To the thicket of questions surrounding spirituality, this book brings a clear vision and a thoughtful approach that will help us find our way to the very heart of it.Much is made of spirituality these days-in recovery and in the culture at large-but what, exactly, does spirituality mean? Is it something different to different people? How is it discovered, nurtured, expressed? And, perhaps most important, why does it matter? To the thicket of questions surrounding the subject, this book brings a clear vision and a thoughtful approach that will help us find our way to the very heart of spirituality. Writing simply and directly, Abraham Twerski shows how spirituality-independent of religion-is central to emotional and mental health, and is a key to being truly and profoundly human. Founder and medical director of the Gateway Rehabilitation Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Abraham J. Twerski is a rabbi, psychiatrist, chemical dependency counselor, and the author of many books, including Addictive Thinking: Understanding Self-Deception.
