Winner BEST PARANORMAL ROMANCE Series four years is a row! - Reviewer's Choice Awards, The Paranormal Romance GuildDuff Torquil is heir to Scotia, the kingdom of Fae, who have been at war with the Elves for two thousand years. Fae and Elves are both species who have evolved to respond to one fated lover with whom they will mate for life. Duff Torquilâ€™s predestined mate is perfect for him in every way: beautiful, smart, polished, strong willed and a talented psychic who works for The Order of the Black Swan. The only problem is that she happens to be Aelsong Hawking, talented Black Swan psychic, younger sister of vampire hunter, Sir Rammel Hawking, AND the only daughter of the royal house of Elves. After escaping together to establish a quiet obscure life away from both families and the politics of elf/fae differences, the young lovers are captured, separated, secluded, and left to die as mated pairs of their species tend to do when permanently parted. Fortunately, an angelic intervention persuades the unlikely "powers that be" to get involved. If you love a grand mix of romance, scifi, fantasy, paranormal, tears, laugher, and complex stories - this series is right for you. 17+
