The first book in a new epic fantasy series...Jahna Mornglow is a thief, a liar and an all-around misfit, a half-breed of the loathed and ostracized Narcean race, born with the abilities of prophecy and telepathy. The humdrum days in her beachside home are eased by nights in the outer villages, scamming unsuspecting fishermen out of their hard earned coin. It is the most fun and profit Jahna and her friends, Lilac, a brawling barmaid and Silko, a bullied bookworm, can expect from their lower class lives. But not all is what it seems.Their world is in danger and when Jahna's power starts to awaken, she finds herself the banished heir of a kingdom close to ruin. The land of Ardentia is vast and magical, carved by the Celestial gods and ruled by their mortal descendants. With a once great king now mysteriously ill, a hundred years war raging in the east and whispers of the return of an ancient evil, Ardentia's fate now rests on the shoulders of a group of young outcasts. The ghosts of Jahna's past will call upon her, revealing hidden enemies, precious secrets and a fragmented artifact that will breath new life into the myths of old. Can Jahna keep safe a world that has shunned and discarded her?
