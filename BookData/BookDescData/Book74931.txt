There’s a legend amongst members of the Wicked Throttle MC. Something that’s rooted deep into their DNA. Once a soul finds its other half, there is no going back. Only one option; Love and claim at first sight.  The danger lurking at every turn in her life has left Adley alone and on the run. That is until a certain biker finally tracked her down and is determined to help her.  Quill can’t get the woman who he couldn’t hold onto out of his head and heart. Dead set to pull her out of the danger she’s wrapped in, he stumbles into a web where not only Adley, but others are tangled in as well. Can they take one day at a time to explore their connection and save those around them? Or will a shift of direction spiral into a lost chance in love and life?  Quill can be read as a HEA standalone but does have a cliffhanger involving the next character (book four in this series).
