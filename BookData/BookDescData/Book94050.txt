Bears tumble in! Count teddy bears from one to twelve, name their colors, and even form three primary shapes--square, circle, and triangle. Then count down to zero as the bears trot away. Back matter includes a review of the counting and math skills presented. Perfect for use with bear counters and other classroom manipulatives.
