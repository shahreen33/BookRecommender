The Agency left him for dead.  Jason Trapp was the CIA's most lethal operative. A man of honor; a man whose terrible childhood forged him with an iron sense of right and wrong. His country gave him a career, a partner, and a way to mold that burning anger into righteous action.  And then someone crossed him, ripping his new life from his grasp. His partner's body is pulled from the wreckage, but Trapp's is never found.  Months later, terrorists attack an Amtrak train, slaughtering hundreds, and livestream the attack for the whole world to see. And then more attacks begin. Hundreds die. Then thousands. America is under siege.  It's not Trapp's job to care. Not anymore.  But he can't help it. And when he discovers his betrayal was just one move in a vast conspiracy that threatens to topple the US government...  Trapp vows to take his revenge.  ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯  "Fans of Ryan, Reacher and Bourne will love betrayed CIA operative Jason Trapp, who stars in a pulse-pounding revenge thriller that threatens to be 2019's breakout hit."
