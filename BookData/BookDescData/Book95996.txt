Having a dog in class is always a clue that it's going to be an interesting day, especially when the dog in question-and the one with all the answers-is the insatiable canine gourmand Pete, last seen munching everything from jellybeans to underwear on his way through the alphabet in What Pete Ate from A-Z.  Poppy Wise has mixed feelings about school and her teachers have mixed feelings about her dog, Pete. Pete wreaks havoc in math; causes chaos in science (Mrs. Magma has a meltdown when he swallows her microscope!); and is a star in art (Miss Crumple finds Pete colorful when he eats all the crayons). As Pete gets his fill of knowledge, he also serves as an impetus for learning rules are made to be broken and there is no end to learning. This new adventure is sure to be another "giggly meal for readers who relish ridiculousness, randomness, rambunctiousness and alliteration."-Time Out New York
