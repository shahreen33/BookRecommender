Navigating the landscape of young adulthood is fraught with challenges big, small, and existential that leave even the best of us screaming internally. Guac Is Extra But So Am I: The Reluctant Adult's Handbook explains the realities of life people expect you to know--but aren't usually spelled out--through humorous, biting commentary, illustrations, and guidance from those who have seen it all.Packed with discussions, tips, and advice on everything from the shifting etiquette surrounding modern dating (Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and tolerant of your substance abuse?) to how you should be forcing yourself to save for retirement (We're all just a few breakdowns away from becoming an interior designer or golf pro), job hunting (No, you cannot choose "muse" as a career path), to the highly emotional and physical trials of moving (The road to hell is paved with shag carpeting). These topics, and anything else that might fluster a young adult, are explored and addressed with the author's trademark wit and self-deprecating style. Add in contributions from leaders in their respective fields, including Mad Money's Jim Cramer and editors ranging from The New York Times to Town &amp; Country, and Guac Is Extra But So Am I becomes an illuminating guide to what it means to be a well-rounded individual in a digitally evolving world ridden with student debt and Instagram "models."
