An American journalist returns to Germany, his birthplace, to be a part of the miracle that Hitler is creating. When war breaks out he joins an SS War Correspondents Unit. A futile attempt to stop the SS killing prisoners in France results in a sentence to Mauthausen Concentration Camp. His only escape from the living hell of the camp is to join a police battalion, SS Sonderbattalion Dirlewanger. He is pitched into the maelstrom of the battlefront in Russia, but quickly finds that behind the lines murder on a vast scale is being committed. The wholesale slaughter that Dirlewangerâ€™s men inflict on the innocent civilian population of Occupied Eastern Europe is an evil that almost defies description. His fight is no longer against the enemies of the Third Reich, but a race to prevent some of the worst of the atrocities perpetrated by his own SS colleagues. A superb, fact-based account of the war behind the lines on the Eastern Front in World War Two.
