Trouble! Where did that ravenous little mouse come from who’s disturbing the peace in the hospital? What’s Going On? is the third in a series of books on the adventures of Carlo the mouse. Carlo knew he was not supposed to go near the manager’s office, but when the kitchen staff were chasing him, he made a choice that started a war. This is only Carlo’s first time out, and already everyone is after him. Imagine what could happen when he learns his way around the hospital! He likes to eat, and is growing like a mushroom after the rain. Will this be the end of our curious little mouse, or will Carlo manage to outsmart the clever manager, angry cook, and sneaky exterminator so he can go home safely? You’ll find out in Mrs. D.’s next book on Carlo the mouse, Rules Are for a Reason. Remember, Hospitalia is a strange place . . .
