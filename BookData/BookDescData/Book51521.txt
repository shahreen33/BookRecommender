The fan-favorite super team DV8 returns with an explosive new adventure written by critically acclaimed writer Brian Wood (DEMO, DMZ, NORTHLANDERS) and illustrated by up-and-coming artist Rebekah Isaacs.In their short history, the mismatched, super powered losers, freaks and masochists of DV8 have seen a lot and done even more, but itâ€™s nothing compared to this. As Gem Antonelli (a.k.a. Copycat) is debriefed in a holding cell, the story of how eight troubled teenagers were briefly gods of a prehistorical world unfolds against the backdrop of a cataclysmic disaster.
