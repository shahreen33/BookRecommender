Call it pure desperation, or maybe we’d agree it was the lack of sleep that had me signing six weeks of my life away to be bossed around by a life coach. Either way, I was trying to get my life together, and Logan Woodland was going to help.I thought he’d make me eat healthier, drink more water, and do yoga. What I wasn’t expecting, was to be forced to see myself as I was and how far I’d fallen.But then his program worked.He’d shown me a life filled with passion and desire. A life where I was stronger and could be the woman I’d never known existed inside me.I did have a six-week life-changing experience, but now, I wanted more than I’d signed on for.Him.
