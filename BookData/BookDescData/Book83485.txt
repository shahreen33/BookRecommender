Can stuffed elephants go to kindergarten, too?Sammie takes Ellie, her stuffed elephant lovey, everywhere. But stuffed animals can’t come to Sammie’s kindergarten. Sammie and Ellie are afraid to spend their first day apart until they learn that Ellie gets to go to her very own kindergarten in Mama’s car. In car kindergarten, Ellie works on counting, writing her letters and sounding out words. Ellie has lunch in the cafeteria, and enjoys art, P.E., music and recess. And, just like in Sammie’s kindergarten at school, Ellie even makes some new friends.Through the power of imagination, Ellie’s Car Kindergarten gives children a positive way to feel comfortable spending their school day apart from a lovey or special stuffed animal. Ellie’s Car Kindergarten is also a creative tool parents and educators can use to help children look forward to learning and having fun in kindergarten.Ellie's Car Kindergarten is the proud recipient of a 2018-2019 Reviewer's Choice Literary Award from Readers Views.
