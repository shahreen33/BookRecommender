Long before the specter of terrorism haunted the public imagination, a serial bomber stalked the streets of 1950s New York. The race to catch him would give birth to a new science called criminal profiling.Grand Central, Penn Station, Radio City Music Hall for almost two decades, no place was safe from the man who signed his anonymous letters FP and left his lethal devices in phone booths, storage lockers, even tucked into the plush seats of movie theaters. His victims were left cruelly maimed. Tabloids called him the greatest individual menace New York City ever faced.In desperation, Police Captain Howard Finney sought the help of a little known psychiatrist, Dr. James Brussel, whose expertise was the criminal mind.

The three men hatched a brilliant scheme to catch him at his own game. Together, they would capture a monster and change the face of American law enforcement."
