Hail to the king, and watch him reign, this game was somewhat fun, until the finale came…Now we’re here, with carnage and despair, and the only questions left to answer, are the ones that do not appear...A king loses a war, and a swan sheds her wings, chaos collides with peace, as the crows begin to sing…Enter if you dare, because I swear the end is near, but nothing is as it seems, and everything is so bare.So what the f*ck is going on at Riverside,I think, I think... everyone is about to die....
