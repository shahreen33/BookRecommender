Eons ago, it was prophesied...four distinguished champions would be chosen to lead the universe into a new age of strength and peace. They were expecting warriors; what they got was a little bit...different. Join Amie, an art student, Sandy, a single mom, Kevin, aging athlete and Silas...a goldfish?...as they learn to navigate Earth and each other as the most unanticipated powerful beings in the universe! Created by New York Times-bestselling writer Kate Leth (ADVENTURE TIME, BRAVEST WARRIORS) and illustrator Matt Cummings (BATTLE DOG), POWER UP is a super team-up with a twist...and in the end, finding a family where you least expect it.
