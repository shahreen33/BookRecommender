"Certainly a must-read for anyone involved in politics and government in the Arab world." The Daily StarBy HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum"Certainly a must-read for anyone involved in politics and government in the Arab world." The Daily Star "For anyone who wants to know what is behind the bricks, replicated islands and floods of visitors who arrive from all over the world." The book is "not one of egocentrism and self-glorification...it is no fictional fantasy...simply a personal, humane reflection with a large amount of positive charge and a projection of hope." Asharq Alawsat Focusing primarily on the development and successful management of countries, with Dubai as a role model, this valuable publication gains even further importance because of its authoritative account of the various components of development, based on personal experience and daily involvement, rather than on abstract theories and experiments.While addressing the people of Dubai and the UAE, Sheikh Mohammeds wider audience is the Arab and Muslim World. The success story of Dubai can be repeated in other Arab countries. The book, therefore, represents a message of optimism that a second stage of outstanding development can be achieved throughout the Arab and Muslim World. The proof he provides is Dubai itself.Language:Arabic ISBN No: 18606321492006, Hardback, 240 pages, 24.0 x 17.0 cmPhotographs: 101
