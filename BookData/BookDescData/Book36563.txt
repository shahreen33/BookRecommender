"How would you feel about being between the two of us -- full of Brookedge's two most powerful men? Telling you how good you are, Mitchell. How perfect you feel..."The year has been full of firsts for young cop-turned-bodyguard Mitchell Graves. First political assignment protecting a billionaire senator's son. First time in that same billionaire's bed. And though this won't be his first threesome, what mayor-to-be James Russo proposes to Graves that day is an entirely new way of being taken. Graves can't help but wonder what it would be like to have the two men at once... What starts as a relationship of chance after the bodyguard pushes Commissioner William Marek out of the way of a madman's bullet is about to continue and intensify exponentially under the meticulous direction of Russo.
