Candy Apple books . . . just for you. Sweet. Fresh. Fun. Take a bite! Jenna Sampson, perfectly normal seventh grader and editor of the school newspaper, is mortified. Her parents are opening a super-embarrassing juice bar at the mall. Jenna has to work there . . . and wear a ridiculous uniform. She's pretty sure her life can't get worse, until she finds out that the school paper might shut down. But the gossip Jenna overhears from the juice bar is totally newsworthy, which gives her a great idea. A gossip column could be a huge hit and save the paper --- or cause a ton of trouble!
