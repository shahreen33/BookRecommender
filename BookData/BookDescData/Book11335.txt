Dammit, just how many toes was she going to have to stomp on before people realized she was a Delicate Freakn’ Flower?Naomi doesn't want to follow tradition and settle down with a violence-loving, chest-thumping shapeshifter. She grew up in a household with five testosterone-laden brothers, where none of the dishes ever matched, the ugly-as-sin furniture could withstand any catastrophe, and where Krazy Glue was bought by the case.When fate--with a snicker--makes her meet not one, but two mates, Naomi digs her heels in and refuses to do what her wolf--and her body--demands. No way is she voluntarily allowing herself to get hitched to a pair of dumbass--totally hot and muscled--lacrosse players.Can Ethan, the towering Kodiak bear, and Javier, the sexy, tanned jaguar, convince this she-wolf that life with them won’t be all chaos? And can this delicate freakn’ flower unbend her prejudices enough to recognize she needs a pair of men who can handle her thorns--and her passion?Warning: this is a hot threesome story where all the focus is on her, with pleasurable consequences.
