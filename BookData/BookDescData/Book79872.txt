Most marshmallows are born into marshmallow families, play with marshmallow friends, and go to marshmallow school where they learn to be squishy. Most marshmallows read a book before bed and then fall asleep to dream ordinary marshmallow dreams. But, this book isn't about most marshamallows, is it? No. That's because author Rowboat Watkins knows that, just like you, some marshmallows have big dreams, and just like you, these marshmallows can do anything they set their minds to. This sweet and silly book is an inspiring reminder to everyone that by being true to ourselves, each of us has the power to be extraordinary. Whether for a new parent or a recent graduate, the message here will fit the bill. Another slightly off kilter book from rising picture book-maker Rowboat Watkins. The art (and subversive humor) has nods to Maurice Sendak (with whom Watkins studied), but is unlike anything else out there. If you and your child are a fan of Rude Cakes, Pete With No Pants, and The Legend of Rock Paper Scissors, you will love this book. This book is ideal for:• Read Aloud Book for preschoolers• Early Reading book for toddlers• Parents &amp; Grandparents • Recent high school and college graduate gifts• Anyone looking for an empowering story
