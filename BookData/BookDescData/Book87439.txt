Memories define us, they tell us who weâ€™ve been in the past and give insight to who we are likely to be in the future. But what if you wake with no memory? Tom Gardener faces this very situation when he wakes in a freezing car with no idea where or who he is. As memories emerge, fuelled by music and dreams, so too comes a sense of dread that there may be things he does not want to recall. Is his mind protecting him from something? Who is he? What has he done? Where does he belong? Why can he not remember? VOID: a psychological journey of discovery that forces the question: To what extent can our memories be trusted?
