The LIFE photographer, trusted and intrepid like no other, went to the beachhead, behind closed doors, backstage, into the corridors of power. It was always the photographers who made LIFE great, and this book brings together the best of their work: 698 of the most vivid and exciting images published in the pages of LIFE across eight decades.Here are the defining moments of the twentieth century, including MacArthur wading ashore by Mydans, Capa's D-day landing, and the Omaha Beach, and, of course, Eisenstaedt's sailor kissing the nurse at the V-J Day celebration in Times Square. Here are the first pictures taken from inside the womb and the first taken from outer space. Here are powerful scenes the Tiananmen Square and from the American South during the Civil Rights movement. LIFE helped make icons of Sophia Loren and Marilyn Monroe, the Beatles and Michael Jackson, and those indelible images are here, too.The Great LIFE Photographers encompasses some of the most memorable photographs ever made, stunningly reproduced in black and white and full color. It is a volume of living history, as seen through the eyes of the storied camera-wielding men and women who helped make LIFE the great American magazine.
