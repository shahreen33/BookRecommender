Welcome to Millingham, MA, pop. 5000... 4997... 4993...The sheriff has convinced himself and others that the recent rash of deaths in the town are just suicides. Lysander Shore knows different. He knows the townsfolk are being hunted. He knows they face an evil as old as the town itself. He knows it's something that can't be killed, can't be reasoned with.And he knows that the evil knows about him, too. It's waited centuries for Lysander to come home. Now it wants to make him pay.
