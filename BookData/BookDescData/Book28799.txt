Babies eat in lots of ways…and most of them are messy! Giggle and gurgle together with Baby Food, a charming, inclusive window into all the ways babies enjoy their food: bottle-feeding, nursing, children feeding themselves, families eating together and more. High-contrast, patterned illustrations pair with black-and-white photos of babies’ faces to engage newborns’ interest, while the repeating refrain and simple vocabulary help build early language skills. Baby Food’s rhyming text offers plenty of prompts for caregiver-child interaction to strengthen secure attachment, from snack time to mealtime and every time in between. Also available in a bilingual Spanish / English edition as Baby Food / Comiendo con bebé.For babies to 2 years
