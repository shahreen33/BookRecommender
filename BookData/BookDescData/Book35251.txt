A new story of friendship from Eve Bunting. Mouse lives alone on an island. At night he watches the lighthouse beacon flash across the water, warning ships to stay off the rocks. In the daytime, he dozes in the sun or searches for tasty sea morsels for dinner. Life is good. So why does he have a feeling that something is missing?something that would make it even better? One day a boat sinks near the island, and Mouse swims to the rescue of a strange, furry creature that has been tossed into the ocean. What is it? What kind of dangerous creature has he saved? Eve Bunting's charming tale of an unlikely friendship is warmly illustrated by Dominic Catalano.
