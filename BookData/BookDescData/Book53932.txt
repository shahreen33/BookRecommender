In the near future, the effects of a catastrophic solar flare have left the earth almost entirely submerged, with only the tops of the very tallest mountains remaining above water.Moored to one of these peaks is a flotilla of ships and boats containing all of the planet’s known survivors. One hundred and twenty-five souls remain, but not for long—a mysterious infection is turning the air they breathe and the water they drink into deadly hazards.Twelve volunteers have been sent out to look for help—or even any signs of life—and none have returned. It now falls to Eva, a former cop, and Jim, the flotilla’s elected leader, to keep the fragile peace among the inhabitants. Humanity is depending on them for its survival—together, can they find the answers in time?
