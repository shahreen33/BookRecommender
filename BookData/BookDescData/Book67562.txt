Deadly monsters live in all of us.  The Academy of Six has just never seen a monster as terribly mundane as Izara Castillo. And that is a dangerous problem. She has four semesters to not only understand her supernatural abilities, but harness them as well.  Everything at the Academy is a disaster, from Interdimensional Travels through hell to the other hell they like to call Gym.  Bullies push her, test her, and simply try to kill her. A few broodingly protective roommates and a scary fake boyfriend could help. Or make her life impossibly harder.  Pretend to date the emotionally detached demon, they said. What’s the worst that could happen, they said.  It’s make or break within this prison of a school. If she succeeds, she’ll finally know what she’s capable of, who she truly is, and where she came from.  If she fails…she dies.  This is Reverse Harem series containing M/M themes. Recommended for readers 18 and over.
