This book teaches children ages 4-8 how to handle bullies in an assertive manner. Max and his brothers take a stand against the mean frogs who are tormenting their best pal, Froggie Nelsons, who is timid and afraid. Together, they are able to build Froggie's confidence and instill in him the strength to stand up to them by himself, which he has to do in the book in the event of Max's absence. The approach is assertive, but the message is very clear: Do unto others as you would have others do unto you. The book ends with a special message from Max Bear imploring children to think before they are unkind to others, and to always treat others the way they would like to be treated. The principle is simple, yet fundamental.
