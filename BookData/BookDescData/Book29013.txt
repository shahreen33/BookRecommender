In this brilliantly inventive, absorbing novel, Nicholas Blincoe evokes the realities of civil war through the connected lives of James Beddoes, a 21st-century journalist in Paris and Bethlehem, and Paul-Antoine Brunel, a marine lieutenant caught up in the 1870 Siege of Paris. As both men struggle to make sense of their particular conflicts, passion becomes more urgent and love - between friends and comrades as well as lovers - more precious.
