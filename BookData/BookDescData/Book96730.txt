An all new second chance love story by the New York Times Bestselling author of the Driven series. It all started with the invitation. To my ex-fiance's new wedding. I should have ignored it. Thrown it away. Set it afire. But I didn't. I replied. With a plus one. And then my assistant accidentally mailed it. Enter Hayes Whitley. Mega-movie star. The man who has captured the hearts of millions. But I gave him mine years ago. He was my first love. He was my everything. Right until he up and left to chase his dreams without so much as a simple goodbye. When he showed up out of the blue ten years later, I should have known to steer clear of him. I should have rejected his offer to take me to my ex's wedding. I should have never let him kiss me. But I didn't. And now we're left wondering if the pieces of the life we once shared still fit together somehow. First loves are hard to forget. The question is, do we want to forget? Or do we risk the chance and see what happens next?
