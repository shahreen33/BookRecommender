Going undercover with a fake name to solve murders, shut down bad clubs, and punish people is a ridiculously difficult job even with a team to support her. Using two covers in LA to play the bad guys from both sides to take down an abduction ring using lust demons as sex slaves and getting to the bottom of problems at the club just might get Jasmine Stewart killed.  Especially since Jasmine Stewart is actually one of her covers and one associated with her real life, even though there’s more she’s still hiding from. But she’s not alone, and from the start she finds some new allies to help her, including one who sees a bit too much and how to help her heal old wounds.  However, she’s got four guys already waiting for a chance to be with her for real, so adding more seems stupid. The real question is whether she can balance it all and give others what they need, as the trouble with ISLE wasn’t the end of the demons problems, but the beginning.  Untraceable Succubus is a crime series where the sex is hot and often and the main character kicks some serious ass on the road to finding out if she can have real love in her life even if it comes from multiple men.
