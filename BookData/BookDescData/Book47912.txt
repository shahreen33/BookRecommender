  From New York Times bestselling author Penelope Ward, comes a new, sexy standalone novel.
Growing up, the three of us were friends. He was the nerd. I was the playboy. She was the beauty.Deep down, I only ever wanted her. I kept it inside because Rory and I made a pact that our friend, Amber, was off-limits.He lied.I went off to college, and he got the girl. Amber never knew how I felt. They were together for years--before he broke her heart.Through it all and across the miles, she and I casually stayed in touch. When my job sent me to Boston for a three-month contract position, Amber let me stay in her spare room.Still reeling from her breakup, she'd sworn off men. One night, I opened her computer to find the shock of my life. She'd hesitantly contacted a male escort company. Afraid to date and get her heart broken again, she was looking for sex with no strings. Every emotion imaginable ran through me: protectiveness, jealousy--curiosity. Amber had chosen Gentleman Number Nine and sent him a message. She opened up to him, confessing, among other things, her physical attraction to her friend--me. But she considered me off-limits--and she thought I was a manwhore. (Ironic, considering the circumstances.)Eventually, she set up a date to meet Gentleman Nine at a hotel.  When she showed up several nights later to meet him, she got the surprise of her life to see me standing there--with an offer I hoped she wouldn't refuse.
