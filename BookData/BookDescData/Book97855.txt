Vanessa never wanted to be a contractor, but ever since her husband died, she has been trying to hold together his business. Her attempts are constantly hampered by sexy, charming Joe Coleman, another local contractor who wants nothing more than to buy her out. Now they're thrown together in a job at Eden Manor, a bed and breakfast and huge renovation job that can only be completed if they work together.  Vanessa is willing to be a professional and work with Joe if she has to. But she trusted him in the past and only got burned as a result, so she's never going to let down her guard with him again.  It would be a lot easier if he wasn't so irresistible--and if he didn't seem to want so much more from her than her business.
