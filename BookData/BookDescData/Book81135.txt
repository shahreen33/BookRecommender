When elderly witch Enid Pettywood unwittingly summons a demon to Silver Hollow, it’s up to Issy Quinn and her cousins to send it back before the committee finds out. Summoning a demon is a serious offense and no one wants to see Enid suffer the punishment the committee is sure to hand down.  But a simple plan of vanquishing the pesky demon before anyone notices goes awry when the demon makes the leap from wreaking havoc with the town’s electrical circuits to possessing a human. Even worse, it uses that human to commit murder. When another murder attempt is made, it quickly becomes clear that the demon is looking for a permanent human host… and the Quinn witches have only three days to stop it.  With the town Sheriff investigating the murder, Issy has to avoid casting suspicion on herself while trying to track down the demon and dodge Dex Nolan, the government agent sent to town to study paranormals. Too bad Issy can’t seem to forget the stolen kiss she and Dex shared because she has no intention of getting involved with a human.  When the demon’s evil intentions hit too close to home, Issy is forced to make a sacrifice that may haunt her for the rest of her days. Will she be able to stop the demon before it kills again?
