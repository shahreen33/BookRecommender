Love changes people.I’m the first to admit that I, Keaton Bridges, used to be an immature, entitled ass.Okay, maybe I’m the second to admit it—after Roxy Carter. That loudmouth.But I’ve seen what true love has done for my friends, and I want it for myself.Somehow, I’m the only single guy left.Somehow, she’s the only single girl.The only time Foxy Roxy hasn’t been a loudmouth? That time we were making out at our best friends’ wedding. And every time we’ve seen each other in the five years since then, because she refuses to talk about it.Well, she’s going to have to talk to me now.It’s the dead of winter, and our six best friends were planning a getaway at a Caribbean couples-only resort.One of the couples had to drop out, and I refuse to be left out in the cold.All Roxy and I have to do is pretend to be in love for one week so we can spend some much-needed time with our favorite people.And all I have to do is pretend I’m not dying to kiss her again.
