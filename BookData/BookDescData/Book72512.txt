4 hours, 39 minutesFresh off my Voodoo-tastic vacation to New Orleans, I find myself presented with the first test of my newly discovered magic. There’s been a murder in the neighboring town of Pine Shoals and the victim has decided she’s not cut out for the spectral life and needs a gentle push into the Otherworld.  As it turns out, conjuring some magic and telling a ghost to ‘go towards the light’ isn’t quite good enough, and now the hysterical ghost is stuck in some kind of limbo land.  It’s up to me to solve her murder before the poor ghost goes insane—or, becomes demon food. Whichever happens first.  Reapers creepers.
