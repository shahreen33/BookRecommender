Meet Wordy Birdy, a very chatty bird who talks WAY more than she listens!Wordy Birdy LOVES to talk. "Hello, sunrise. Hello, pink sky. Hello, orange sky. . . ." But does she love to listen? NOPE. One day, while she's walking through the forest, her gift of the gab gets her into hot water: "That's a pretty tree and that's a pretty tree and that's a pretty danger sign and that's a pretty tree. . . ." Will this inattentive bird walk right into danger? Will her faraway thoughts lead her along a path of doom? It's up to her long-suffering, heard-it-all-before pals Squirrel, Raccoon, and Rabbit to save their distracted friend.
