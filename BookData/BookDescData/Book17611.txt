Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion meets Night of the Living Dead in this laugh-out-loud debut YA novel by Emmy Award-nominated TV writer E. Van Lowe
  
  Principal Taft's 3 Simple Rules for Surviving a Zombie Uprising:
  Rule #1: While in the halls, walk slowly and wear a vacant expression on your face. Zombies won't attack other zombies.
  Rule #2: Never travel alone. Move in packs. Follow the crowd. Zombies detest blatant displays of individuality.
  Rule #3: If a zombie should attack, do not run. Instead, throw raw steak at to him. Zombies love raw meat. This display of kindness will go a long way.

When kooky Principal Taft asks the girls to coexist with the zombies until the end of the semester, they realize that this is the perfect opportunity to live out their high school dreams. All they have to do is stay alive....
