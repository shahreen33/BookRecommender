What if everything you knew about faith was wrong?  Isaac doesn’t know how to feel about his sexuality. A preacher’s son shouldn’t be at a gay bar, and he certainly shouldn’t go home with handsome bartenders, but with a broken car and an oncoming storm, maybe it’s time to try something new.  Ben is the only reliable bartender in Texas, or at least, that’s how it seems. Maybe it’s that he works in a gay bar, but when he realizes that the new preacher’s son just asked to use the phone, he figures Isaac is just in the wrong place. He has no idea that his life is about to be changed forever.  Treat yourself to a Taste of Innocence in this steaming hot, adults-only 65,000 word forbidden gay romance from Riley Knight.
