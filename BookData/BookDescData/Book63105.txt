GO BIG OR GO HOME.When Owen Zastava Pitt was given a tip about some hunters who had gone missing in action, he didn’t realize their rescue mission would snowball into the single biggest operation in Monster Hunter International’s history. Their men are being held prisoner in a horrific nightmare dimension, and the only way to reach them is through the radioactive ruins of a monster infested war zone.Except it’s also the home base of the powerful creature behind the attacks on the Last Dragon and Copper Lake. It turns out ancient gods of chaos really hate trespassers, but he picked a fight with the wrong crew, and now MHI wants payback. Calling on their allies, a massive expedition is formed, and with the odds stacked against them, a legion of hunters goes to war.It’s D-Day at the City of Monsters.
