Read the book Piers Anthony called "one wild adventure with unusual twists" in his Mayhem 2016 newsletter!Like most elves, Kyla's first year away from home presents certain challenges: meeting new people, finding a suitable field of study, and learning to yo-yo. Unlike most elves, Kyla runs afoul of Erebus, the god of darkness, who plans to bathe the world in eternal night. Kyla must leave her carefree adolescence behind and master her fears if she hopes to save the Earth and the people she loves within it. This is the first book in a trilogy that explores the hidden world that manages our own, where air spirits carry the winds and earth elementals spin the world on its axis. Inside this world Kyla Nim tries to discover her role against unusual odds.
