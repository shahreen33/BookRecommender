Her blood holds secrets she never knew existed.  Despite the fact that she acts as a parent to her alcoholic father, Gabby Creed feels pretty normal. But her life is turned upside-down on her seventeenth birthday when a bracelet appears on her wrist and sucks her back through time.  Turns out she's not even a little bit normal. She's a Shifter--a protector of humans and of history itself. And she's not alone. The other Shifters believe Gabby is special, even more special than the mysterious Michael Pace. Oh, and the Shades--seriously creepy creatures who feed off of human despair--are determined to capture her.  It's all a lot to absorb. So Gabby's grateful to have Michael as her Trainer--or she would be if she could get her rebellious heart under control. Then again, if the rumors about her blood are true, saving yesterday will be the least of her worries.
