SUBJECT: I’m sorry (Marked Confidential)From the Desk of His Royal Highness Prince RobertAly—I can’t stop thinking about tonight. Why is it that the sex is so good even though we hate each other so much? We say it will never happen again. Still, I can’t resist having you against the wall in our office every time I see you. But tonight I sense that you are serious about us NEVER. HAPPENING. AGAIN. You have your new bloke. And I’m…me. The playboy prince. The one not expected to settle down. But staying away from you is already killing me.I’m not a good man. But for the first time, I wish I were. Maybe then I’d deserve you. You’re gorgeous. Clever. You call me out on my bulls**t. No one treats me the way you do. I adore you, sweetheart.I’m sorry I never had the balls to tell you this to your face. But tonight, it’s the whiskey talking...as they say, a drunk man’s words are a sober man’s thoughts.
