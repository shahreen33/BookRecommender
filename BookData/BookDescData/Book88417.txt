It's a god's life... ...at the Sunnyvoyde Residential Home for retired deities. Everlasting life can be a real drag when all you've got to look forward to is cauliflower cheese on Wednesdays.For a start, there's a major techincal problem with the thousand-year-old traction engine which has been lovingly restored by those almighty duffers Thor, Odin and Frey...the damn thing actually goes.And then there's Osiris, pushed one tapioca too far by a power-crazy godson with friends in very smelly places, and forced to set out on a quest which will test his wheelchair to the very limits.Only one thing might save the world from an eternity of chaos ... dentures. It's true.Honest to god.
