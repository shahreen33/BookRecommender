Librarian's Note: This is an alternate/new cover for ASIN B00EVDFBR4Jack Storm is more than a tour bus bang. He's a secret to keep at all costs--except one. Marissa is a craps dealer, and in one quick second she never wants to remember, her life turns to crap. Her best friend convinces her the cure for a breakup is a hookup, and reluctantly, she heeds this advice. However, Jack (what was his name again?) is not the average girl's revenge fling. Women throw themselves at Jack, toss their lingerie on the stage, and scream his name. Marissa has no idea of his public identity, and while she doesn't initially throw herself at him, she does go on to toss aside her lingerie and ultimately scream his name. Five minutes after parting, she holds no illusions about seeing him again, but does vow a new outlook on her life and herself. Five months later, Jack astounds her with an invitation to Los Angeles. Although Jack is now a star in her very non rock star fantasies, Marissa is concealing a huge secret that prevents her from accepting. Five years later, the secret comes out, and despite the conflicting emotions each feels toward the other, they must bridge their two worlds together. Jack Who? is a one night stand gone awry, and a couple who work together years later for a fix. 'Jack Who?' is the first in the Silver Strings Series (G String Set). 'Weathering Jack Storm' is second, and 'Snow Storms' is third. The Silver Strings Series will contain trilogies for each string on a guitar, and is kicked off with this G String Set.
