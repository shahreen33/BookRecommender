In this world you will have trouble. Count on it! It might be something small or something big, but you know you don’t have an answer.

Following these questions, Bob Beaudine offers seven practical steps to walk courageously, faithfully, and cheerfully through your trouble whether it is a minor issue or a major crisis.
