An earlier alternate cover version of ASIN B00QMGRBDU can be found here. Alexander Sheldon likes order and control in his life. He isn’t happy when his girlfriend invites another guy for a threesome. Alexander believes in monogamy, and he’s never been good at sharing his things. It doesn’t help that Christian rubs him the wrong way from the beginning. But what starts as animosity turns into something else. Something unexpected and very wrong.He was never supposed to touch Christian. He was never supposed to feel possessive of the guy. And he most definitely wasn’t supposed to want Christian more than he wants his girlfriend. It’s a recipe for disaster.Warning: some M/F/M sex.
