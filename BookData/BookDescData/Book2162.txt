"Seaward not only weaves an exceptionally well-constructed story with wholly credible characters, he offers deeper insights and relates more factual information about the disease of addiction than any other writer to date."-Grady Harp, Top 10 Amazon Reviewer"Monty Miller's journey reminds us of the difficult road of acceptance, forgiveness and redemption that we all must take at some point in our lives."-Cyrus Webb, Top 500 Amazon Reviewer"This is a very dark, harsh, unmerciful look at addiction with unrelenting exposure of its consequences."-Dr. Patricia Laster, PhD Psychologist and Author of "Breaking Free"ADDICTION: CUNNING, BAFFLING, & POWERFULIn this gripping debut novel by Andrew Seaward, the lives of three utterly hopeless addicts converge following an accidental and horrific death.Monty Miller, a self-destructive, codependent alcoholic, is wracked by an obsession to drink himself to death as punishment for a fatal car accident he didn’t cause.Dave Bell, a former all-American track star turned washed-up high school volleyball coach, routinely chauffeurs his bus full of teens on a belly full of liquor and head full of crack.Angie Mallard, a recently divorced housewife with three estranged children, is willing to go to any lengths to restore the family she lost to crystal meth.All three are court-mandated to a drug & alcohol rehab high in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.There, they learn the universal truth among alcoholics and addicts:Though they may all be sick…SOME ARE SICKER THAN OTHERS.Based on the author's own personal experience with substance abuse and twelve-step programs, Some Are Sicker Than Others, transcends the clichés of the typical recovery story by exploring the insidiousness of addiction and the thin, blurred line between true love and codependence.With the harsh realism of Brett Easton Ellis and the dark, confrontational humor of Chuck Palahniuk, Mr. Seaward takes the reader deep inside the psyche of the addict and portrays, in very explicit details, the psychological and physiological effects of withdrawal and the various stages of recovery.As Top 10 Amazon Reviewer, Grady Harp, put it:“What sets Andrew’s novel apart from other recovery stories is his deep understanding of the physiochemical aspects of substance abuse and addiction. Seaward not only understands the socioeconomic, psychological and, yes, criminal impact these people create, he also displays such a profound understanding of the physiological/medical aspects of addiction that we are left to wonder if he hasn't been down the path of his characters himself.”
