MY DARKEST SECRET EXPOSED? #check  ABOUT TO BE KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL? #check  EVERYONE WAITING FOR ME TO LOSE MY SH*T? #check  THE LINE BETWEEN FRIENDS AND ENEMIES SO BLURRED I NEED F**KING GLASSES TO SEE? #triplecheck   Wes might be all I have at the moment, good or bad. He’s as wild as ever, and I know it’s my fault. He’s not made for love and I’m not made to be pushed around. Together, it’s explosive – in more ways than one. And when I set my sights on revenge, I have to keep it close to my heart. Except there’s one problem with that. Wes is close to my heart too. And he might not be the only one with the way things are going.   We promised each other no more secrets, but oh well… promises were meant to be broken – just like hearts.
