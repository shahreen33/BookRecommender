The third omnibus edition of Asprin's popular Myth tales contains Myth-Ing Persons, which finds Skeeve searching for his missing partner Ahaz in another dimension where his magic won't work. In Little Myth Marker, Skeeve bluffs his way into a high-stakes poker game, but when he wins, he's saddled with Markie, a pint-sized IOU with a talent for trouble.
