They are the children of England’s aristocracy. Inspector Blackstone, of the Metropolitan Police, seems to be the only man in the country who stands a chance of catching ‘the Northern Slasher’. Can Blackstone find the killer before he chooses his next victim? When Blackstone receives a letter from an old army comrade, he is plunged into the middle of an even darker horror...
