The Bleeding Mayhem MC, where blood, violence, and being a badass alpha reign supreme.  Mayhem has always been used to getting what he wants. And when the one woman he wants won’t give him the time of day, he’s bastard enough to use her troubles to his advantage.  Butters can’t be bought, or she thought she couldn’t. When her brother owes dangerous men money, it seems her only way to help him is to take the twisted offer Mayhem presents.  Mayhem never said he was a good guy. If Butters wants to help her brother, Mayhem can help, but it’ll come with a price. All she has to do is be his for a week. But the more time he spends with her the more he wants her as more than a piece of ass. He wants her to see she belongs with him, and if that means taking out the men that are causing her and her brother problems, he has no issues bringing out his violent beast.
