"An affecting, deeply honest novel; at the same time, a lacerating indictment of our modern health care system."--Kirkus Reviews"A heartrending story of love, loss and the endurance of the human spirit."--Literary Fiction Book Review"Characters are vivid, relatable, and all too imperfectly human." --Jewell Parker Rhodes "Each time I have reread this novel, I have felt rewarded by the connection it offers to the central character, Colleen. I can think of no single page in which her voice is not an irreplaceable gift to the reader." --Kevin McIlvoy "An engrossing account of the impossible choices faced by caregivers..." --Kathryn Shonk
