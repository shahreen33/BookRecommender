Romeo the dog is a much-loved character created by Alain Grée in the 1960s. Always meaning well but sometimes a little bit clumsy and accident-prone, Romeo finds himself on a variety of adventures all of which have a happy ending! Romeo’s Big Book of Clever ideas is the first book in this series to be republished by Button Books. In this delightful story, aimed at children age 4+, Romeo decides to go camping but by the time he has finished packing his suitcase it is too heavy for him to lift. He comes up with a variety of novel ways to move his suitcase, some more risky than others! In the end Romeo decides to use his suitcase as a tent and camp at home! Originally produced in the 60s, the story and accompanying illustrations are timeless and will appeal to a child’s sense of humor as much today as they did 50 years ago.
