When an elephant plants himself in the road and refuses to move, the people of Prickly Valley try all sorts of methods to get him to go-but one thoughtful little girl works up the courage to do what no one else has done: ask him.Balancing both hilarity and sensitivity, Poe Won't Go has the feel of a contemporary classic, reminding readers that there is power in one, power in listening, and power in being a friend.
