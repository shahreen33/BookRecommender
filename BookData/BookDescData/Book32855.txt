No one needs that many hookups! Not even soon to be major league pitcher, Theo Von Bremen.So, I help him by routinely thinning out his contact list—because I’m the best roommate ever. And he’s optimal baby daddy material. For me—not Amanda 1, 2, or 3.But since the man can’t take a hint; I’ll continue to spray his sheets with my perfume and accidentally leave my panties in his laundry. That has to be enough to break a man eventually. Right?
