Ian McMillan 'Nicholas Hogg comes across the pond to show us another side of our selves. With an eye for the American absurd, Hogg tells us how we love now - impulsively, rootlessly, never far from violence.' Rachel Klein, author of The Moth Diaries'From the opening page I was drawn into this fast and furious story. The description of American life is wonderfully authentic, and the dangerous and illicit nature of Sam and Kay s relationship helps to build the tension in a way that keeps you turning the pages.' New Books Magazine'The Hummingbird and the Bear is a timely and moving examination of passionate love, set against the backdrop of the financial crisis. Personal lives implode alongside balance sheets as the action moves from the safe green hills of the Home Counties to the badlands of the US-Mexico border.' Sophie Cooke
