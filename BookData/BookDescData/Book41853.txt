I’m always running, hiding to avoid the reality that has become my life. Hunter didn’t deserve the destruction I left in my wake—I just hope it’s repairable.Because I need him.I need him to love me like he used to, to make me whole again. To remind me that my reality doesn’t have to be like this.Most importantly…I need him to save me.
