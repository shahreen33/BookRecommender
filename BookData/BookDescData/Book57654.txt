If the U.S. didn't expect a woman President in this century, they really didn't expect a woman President with blood on her hands. After the assassination of her running mate, Darryn Austin finds herself Queen of the free world. She appoints Paul, an old college flame, a cabinet member in order to ensure him a seat on the Supreme Court and secure a reliable ally. But after circumstances in his life trigger a radical personal conversion, Paul becomes a threat to the President--a threat she is willing to eliminate. As Paul grapples with guilt and the possibility of God's existence, readers will question truth, faith and the condition of the heart.
