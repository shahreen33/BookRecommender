Why would an English lord want to have part ownership in a New Mexico cattle ranch? And why did it have to be her father's ranch? Kara Jonston has grown up thinking she will someday inherit the family ranch. She has worked the ranch as hard as any man-a k any of the cowboys. Finding out her father sold half ownership in the ranch-and to a soft Englishman, no less-without even talking to her hurts her pride and stirs her anger. To make matters worse, this outsider is coming to inspect his investment, and her father expects her to be nice. Although she promises her father to give his new partner a chance, she vows she will never accept him as her partner on her ranch. Hawke Pryce, Lord Stoneham, is not English, he is Scottish. He is not soft, and he is not coming to the New Mexico Territory just to inspect his latest investment. He's hunting a man. Sparks fly-but will they turn into lasting love for two people determined to hang on to their hearts? Sensuality Level: Sensual
