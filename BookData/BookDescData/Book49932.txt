The Genier law firm's excellent reputation assures him all is well when he accepts the unusual job offer with the Genier's personal friend and client. The mysterious and alluring Augere becomes Jason's obsession.

He had yet to learn the secrets of the decaying house in Savannah and its connection to Augere. Jason rationalizes the occurrences of anything unusual even when events on a trip to Europe suggest a reality quite different from what he knows but has begun to suspect. When a terrifying encounter finally convinces him he has been the victim of a dangerous and bitter betrayal he loses everything in an attempt to save his life. In time he comes to realize that putting his former life back together may not be the easiest or wisest decision. Both harrowing and uplifting occurrences continue to divide and reunite the two as their journey becomes a struggle for understanding, acceptance and friendship on their own terms.
