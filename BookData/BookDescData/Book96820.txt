ANDY - I got a job next door to a tattooed biker named Baker. He was an outlaw, a criminal, a biker, a bad boy, and a thief. I should have run as far and fast as I could. Instead, on the day we met, I let him have his way with me. I couldn't help myself. His intensity and swagger lured me, but it was the crazy sex that kept me coming back, day after day.His sordid ways scared me, but I simply couldn't stay away...BAKER - When she moved in next door, I knew I was in trouble. She was sexy. She was irresistible. She had spunk. She was also the manager of a bank my MC robbed six months prior. She didn't recognize me, because we wore masks during the robbery. If she ever found out who I really was, there would be hell to pay.It would be nothing like the hell I'd be living in if my MC found out I was fucking her. We'd issued an order to kill her on sight. She was off-limits if anyone ever was.So far, the men in the MC hadn't seen her. But, I couldn't keep her hidden forever.
