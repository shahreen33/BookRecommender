If you found this, it means you were looking. If you were looking, it means you were lost. I was lost once, not sure what I was looking for. I believe, in your Era, you call it a voice. Well, now that I have found mine, nothing would stop me. Just like a wild animal, free, out of its cage. I know that out there, I might fall, I might get hurt. I know that out there, I might get bruises out of my own truth. However, I am willing to take that risk. In the name of freedom, I am willing to tell, what they don't want you to know. This is not a story. This is a Secret, I am willing to share. Since they have made so much effort to hide it, I am willing to make the same effort to unveil. This is the secret of hidden Anomaly. "Sun Stealer. Hidden Anomaly" is the first volume of the Sun Stealer's book series.
