Molly Duff watches the clock on the classroom wall--tick, tick, tick. Nearly three o'clock. Time for Pee Wee Scouts! Troop 23 runs out of the classroom and down the stairs--clop, clop, clop.Tuesday is their meeting day. Molly can't wait. Today Mrs. Peters, their troop leader, will show them how to bake cookies to earn a cookie badage. And next week is the big Skating Party!But Molly has never baked or skated before. A cookie badge or a skating badge. Will Molly earn a badge at all?
