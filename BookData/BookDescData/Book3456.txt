She mocks death and suffers for love. Right Fit Wrong Shoes may be Indian to the core, but contains urban language. The humorous book will have you laughing so hard that it will bring tears to your eyes. The book does not have graphic scenes or physical intimacy and the words used are delicate. The funny and romantic book is about a young woman's thoughts about the society she lives in.
