She never expected to be kidnapped by wolves or for six ridiculously hot dragon shifters to rescue her.

Especially while she's living in a mansion with him and his sexy friends.As the sexual tension between them rises like dragon flame, Lead and Brittany will have to navigate the blurred lines of duty and integrity in a world that is only getting more confusing with each passing day. And with a sinister new evil on the horizon, Lead may need to reconsider what honor really means if he wants to protect his mate.
