On an island steeped with tradition there is one story that has been told for generations: the story of the Lady of the Sea. Grandma Antica, the village healer, shares the story with Mareta, an island girl whose name means a wave. Although Mareta loves hearing the story about the Lady of the Sea, something about the story doesn’t feel quite right to her. When a series of omens leads Mareta’s family to make a drastic change, Mareta loses her home, her purpose, and her self-identity. Following omens of her own and learning to trust her intuition, Mareta searches for herself and the true story of the Lady of the Sea.
