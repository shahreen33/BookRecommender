The All-New X-Men continue to chart their own path through a world that hates and fears them! And they live in the shadow of their fate - especially Cyclops, whose adult self's actions are notorious. But together, can these young mutants change their destiny? Beast will try, but will a man of science find the guidance he seeks from the Sorcerer Supreme, Doctor Strange? Perhaps none among them faces the legacy of an older counterpart quite like Evan - aka Kid Apocalypse! Is he damned to become a genocidal madman like his namesake? Or can he somehow rise above? When the Apocalypse Wars begin, he will be tested like never before! They're yesterday's X-Men and tomorrow's, and they're fighting the future the only way they know how!Collecting: All-New X-Men 7-11
