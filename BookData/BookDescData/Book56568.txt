Caught between two worlds, I no longer know who I am.I was one of the Chosen. Four girls, and four boys, destined to have it all: wealth, status, and a future. Now, I find myself on the other side looking for a way back in.My father’s criminal case meant we lost it all. Forced out of our home, our city, our life, we started anew in a sweet country town called Arcadia.Except after one day as “the new girl” I know there isn’t a single sweet thing about Arcadia High. Boys versus girls. Those who have it all versus those who’d do anything to get it.Trouble brews amongst the student body. Love, lies, and betrayal. And when the consequences spill out the decorative gates? These spoilt country kids won’t know what hit them after the city come to collect.
