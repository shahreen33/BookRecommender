 “You have to go to him. Tell him you love him. You have to be with him, Ruby. If you don’t… I’m not sure what will happen.”  --------- FROM NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING &amp; AWARD WINNING AUTHOR SELENA KITT --------- In the not-so-distant future, working at N.A.S.A. has its perks. For Ruby, who isn’t an astronaut nor does she have any aspirations to be, the biggest perk is meeting Sebastian.  The minute their eyes meet, Ruby feels herself attracted to the man—who is a man and yet so much more—before they even exchange hellos. It’s Sebastian’s alien, lavender-colored eyes that draw her in, and their relationship burns so fast and hot, they’re bonded before she even knows what’s happening.  When Ruby sees Sebastian with a very tall, pretty blonde, she suddenly feels just how deeply their bond goes. The pain is so unbearable, she begins wishing she could be taken back to a time and place when the idea of life on other planets was just a dream—when the invention of hypersleep and traveling at the speed of light were nothing but ideas in the minds of fiction writers.  Is she ready to be the human mate of an alien being? Does she have a choice anymore? Conflicted Ruby wallows in her pain until an unlikely someone intervenes—and Ruby comes to fully understand just how unbreakable her bond with Sebastian really is.
