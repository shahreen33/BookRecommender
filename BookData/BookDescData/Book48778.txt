Barry Ween is every boy's fantasy personified. His intellect is beyond any that has existed before. In his presence, Einstein looks like a moron. Working in the secret lab in the back of his house, Barry slowly inches towards dominating the world, and he would, too, if the laws of chaos weren't so strongly enforced. Protecting obnoxious aliens seeking asylum, getting transported to the pedophilic old west, being kidnapped by bungling government agents - it's all par for the course with Barry. It's tough being ten years old and smarter than everyone else, but no one is going to attack the task with as much gusto as Barry Ween. A hilarious experiment mixing mad scientist movies, the Little Rascals, and words little kids aren't supposed to say.
