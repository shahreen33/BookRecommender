Generations ago, Levelers and Summoners depended on a symbiotic bond that was decimated by the Earth man's arrival. On a planet beneath two harsh suns, the Leveler King is left in the wilderness, stranded. His rescue comes by way of Aton, a simple farming Summoner who wants nothing more than to live in peace. Calamity forced Lyndel and Aton together, but necessity might be the only way they endure each other's company.
