Often used to explain Japanese business competition, "Musashi's Book of Five Rings" is more properly a definitive treatise on mortal combat from one of Japan's most formidable warriors - the martial arts luminary "Miyamoto Musashi." Famed martial artist Stephen Kaufman has translated this classic without the usual commercial bias, driving straight to the heart of Musashi's incisive martial arts stratagems. The result is an enthralling combination of powerful technical wisdom and the philosophical elucidation offered to martial artists by Buddhism, Shintoism, Confucianism, and Taoism. From the metaphor of the Four Elements and fundamentals of physical practice and strategy to an offering of Zen wisdom on the "way" of nature, "Musashi's Book of Five Rings" is as profound and important a book on martial arts as you will find.
