Sofronia Wallis knows that proper Black women don't court trouble by upending the status quo, but it's 1961 and the Civil Rights movement is in full swing. Sofie's spent half her life being prim, proper, and reserved - as if that could bring her mother back - but the nonviolent protests happening across the South bring out her inner agitator.   Ivan Friedman has devoted his life to boxing, loving the finesse of a well-delivered punch and the penance of receiving one. His family escaped from Europe before the horrors of WWII, and Ivan decides to help fight injustice in their new country, even if it goes against all his instincts as a fighter.  When Ivan and Sofie meet, they realize that their pasts are intertwined and - with the sparks that fly between them - perhaps their futures will be too. With everything in their society lined up against them, will Sofie and Ivan be able to beat the odds? Or will their chance at love be destroyed by the tumultuous times they live in?
