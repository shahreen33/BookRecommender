Who's just the right size? You are! A sweet story about being tall or being small... and about hugging! For all readers ages 3 and up.Did you know that a frog is small enough to perch on a lily pad? A hippopotamus is not (obviously), but he is big enough to scare a crocodile away! And a kitten is small enough to fall asleep in the flowers, but an ostrich is not. An ostrich is big enough to shade her chicks with her wings. In 'Just theRight Size', Bonnie Grubman teaches children the basic concepts of big and small, and shows that no matter how small or how big, youâ€™re always just the right size.
