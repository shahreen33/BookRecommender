The Chronicles of Quat is a trilogy that records the ancient and universal struggle between those who believe in Science and those who believe in the Unseen World. The highest achievement of a Scientist is to become a Quatist — someone who can change the rules of Science with their mind. The antithesis of Quatists are the Fae — those who, by using an Unseen, non-quantifiable power, are able to change themselves. The brothers, Tad and Etan, are thrust down different paths. Etan studies Quat Theory while happenstance sends Tad into the realm of the old faith. Or is it happenstance? Although the Quatists don't believe in prophecies, one makes them shudder— A resurgence of the old faith that would call the Quatists' very existence into question. The trilogy begins with The Stone where Tad is sent on a mysterious quest by his secretive mother to find the Stone. He has no idea what it is or who to trust. He soon learns that men of untold power, the Quatists, want to destroy the Stone before it can take back its control over the world and that one of the most powerful Quatists that has ever lived, his father, is seeking to destroy him. Tad meets impossible characters who destroy the fabric of the Science he had always been taught as he finds himself caught up in the revolt against Quatist rule.
