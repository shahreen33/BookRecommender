I’ve had a full life: wife, mom, divorcee…and then alien property. All of that’s changing now that I’m on the ice planet. Here, I’m free again, and I’ve found love once more. Vaza’s older and a widower, but he knows how to make a woman smile both in the furs and out of them.  Everyone around me has a baby in their arms or in their belly, though, and it’s hard to be the only one without. I love nothing more than being a mama…and when I hear there’s an orphan at the Icehome camp, I want to adopt him. Vaza and I have so much love to give, but will an alien baby love us back?  (Psst! This story does not stand alone. Start with LAUREN’S BARBARIAN! You’ll be glad you did!)
