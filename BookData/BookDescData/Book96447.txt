His entire life, Weston Novak has been followed by the long shadow of his raven shifter people. He’s kept his distance and settled into the Bloodrunner Crew, but his life has just taken a hard right turn. Not only does he have visions of the future now, but a soft-spoken raven shifter named Avery has just tumbled into his life to shake everything up. He knows she’s here for dark reasons, but he can’t help the bone-deep attraction he feels for her. Avery was born to betray him, and he can see what’s coming for him clear as day, so why can’t he leave the timid beauty alone?  Avery Foley has been connected to the Novak Raven for as long as she can remember. She has lived far away from Weston in Raven’s Hollow, but has never stopped thinking about her childhood pen pal. To escape an unwanted betrothal, she’s lied to the raven council and run deep into the mountains of the Bloodrunner Dragon. She can’t ever meet the terrifying shifters who live here, but their mere existence is protecting her from an empty life.  The Novak Raven doesn’t even know what he’s done for her, and now he’ll save her a second time. He has to because Weston knows better than anyone--you can’t change fate.
