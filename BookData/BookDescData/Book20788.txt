War, political intrigue and passion… heroes… friends and lovers… and the seeds for a new Robin Hood legend await you…Two young knights’ journey to war at Richard the Lionheart’s side sweeps them from England to the Holy Land in this historical adventure set against the backdrop of the Third Crusade.Henry de Grey leaves Southampton in high spirits, strong in his faith and passionate about the mission to take Jerusalem back from Saladin’s army. Stephan l’Aigle’s prowess on the battlefield is well known, as are his exploits in the arms of other men. He prizes duty, honour, and loyalty to his king above all else. But God and the Church? Stephan has little use for either.Henry’s convictions are challenged by loss and the harsh realities of bloody battles, unforgiving marches, and the politics of the day. Man against man. Man against the elements. Man against his own heart. Survival will depend on more than a strong sword arm.This tale includes a m/m relationship with a heat level of 2 (on a scale of 5), i.e., nothing too graphic.
