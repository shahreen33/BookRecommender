Originally titled "Four Seasons, Four Lessons" but revised, expanded, and retitled for the 2nd edition so as to better indicate the subject matter of the book.This book contains a simple, yet profound business parable, and a discussion which relates to the potential value and power that ideas have to create wealth.The goal of the book is both to inspire and encourage the reader to more closely examine their underlying beliefs as to the source of wealth.In it the reader learns four important principles that any budding entrepreneur needs to understand.- your most potentially valuable asset is not your money or your time, but rather something which is freely available to anyone that takes the time to notice.- allow compounding time to act. If you "eat your profits" too soon, you'll have little to show for your efforts.- ultimately leverage is what will get you to your goal. The good news is leverage is all around you when you know how to look.- you've got to believe in yourself, even if no one else does. It's your vision--follow it and make it a reality. Don't give up. See it through!
