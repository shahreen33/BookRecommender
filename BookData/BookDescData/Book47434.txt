PPoetry. Translated from the Swedish by Johannes Goranson. REMAINLAND showcases poetry from four volumes by Aase Berg, one ofSweden's most celebrated and subversive young writers. From the wrecked fairy-tale-scape of With Deer to the pregnancy allegory Transfer Fat, from the sci-fi naturalism of Dark Matter to the catastrophic oasis of Uppland, Berg works language into miniature grotesques which invert the truisms of contemporary society. Her compulsive inventiveness provides an excoriating challenge to all cultures of complacency. "Let yourself be troubled by this terrific poetry#151;this is a place of weird music and visceral delight"#151;Lisa Jarnot.
