Things on my wishlist:  1. Start a new, awesome job 2. Create the perfect dating app 3. Stop dating douchebags  Things that actually happen:  1. Got a job in my dream tech company 2. Created a workplace dating app for said company 3. Was matched with Bennett, who happens to own the company and is also my brother’s best friend  They say when it rains, it pours, but this is some serious BS. It doesn’t help that Bennett was the man I had my last one night stand with. It definitely doesn’t help that he seems to want me just as much as I want him. The issue is, he won’t do anything about it, but then we’re forced to attend a tech conference in Vegas and I think it may just be what I need to turn this thing around.  New goal: get my brother’s best friend out of my system by all means necessary.
