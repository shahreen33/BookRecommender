An alternative cover edition for this ASIN can be found here.I loved him first.  Jake was my best friend in college-my very straight best friend, until one night he was more. He may have ran after what happened between us, but I never forgot him.  When fate puts us in the same place, five years later, he has a fiance by his side. Carina is beautiful, driven, and draws my attention almost as much as he still does.  A game of truth or dare leads to a wild night and a relationship that has our feelings growing into something bigger than any of us intended.  But what happens when our feelings deepen? Can I handle being with two people?  If it means I can have him, Iâ€™ll love them both.
