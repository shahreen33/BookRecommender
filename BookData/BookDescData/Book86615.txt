There are exactly two things that Rafael Torres has always wanted out of life. The first is to see the Golden Gate Bridge in person and experience the sight that inspired his late mother to become a brilliant architect. The second is for his best friend, Henry Wyatt, to finally reciprocate the love that Rafael has held for him for over a decade. For a moment, it seems as if Rafael might get everything heâ€™s hoped for when Henry joins him on a trip to finally visit the Golden Gate Bridge. But all is not as it seems, and Rafael will be forced to confront his complicated history with Henry while learning that in the end, life is never exactly as we want it to be, and we all die trying to get it right.
