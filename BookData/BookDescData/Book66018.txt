Was Jesus just a good man who lived a long time ago? Or was he something more? Just about everyone you ask has an opinion about Jesus. Some believe he was the Son of God, while others question his existence altogether. Some believe he lived but that he was merely a good man. Today, scientists and other people are stating things that can make it difficult to know what to believe. So how can you know who the real Jesus was (and is)---especially when so many people are working to prove him to be a fake or a fraud? That's what Lee Strobel wanted to know. As a former journalist---and a former atheist---Lee went on an investigative journey to discover the real Jesus, one that took him across the continent and into the homes of today's most prominent experts on Christian history. He found all the evidence he needed to believe that Jesus is indeed the Risen Savior. Join Lee's investigation and discover the truth about Jesus for yourself. After you've seen all the evidence, you'll know for certain who the real Jesus is, and you'll be able to help others know him as well.
