They say the dead don’t speak. That’s a lie. They speak to Kat Justice, but most of the time, she chooses not to hear them.I’m a Nightwatch agent, a nightblood charged with enforcing the supernatural laws. Humans can’t know the shit that goes bump in the night is real. It’s sweaty, tough work, with crappy pay, but I love it.Things would be perfect if not for my secret.Pureblood Nightbloods can’t see or hear the dead. The fact that I can exposes my mixed breeding. I’m not meant to exist, and if the council find out about my secret it’s the executioners block for me.Keeping a lid on my ghost whisperer ability is a must.So, when my gramps orders me to head to the arse end of nowhere, a nowhere that just happens to be the most haunted place on the bloody map, I’m a little confused. This transfer doesn’t jive with trying to keep the ghost chat to a minimum.But with my golem partner and gargoyle companion in tow, I’m sure I can figure out why I’ve been sent to this weird coastal town. I mean, they even have a ghost bar.You’d think the local souls would be eager to chew my ear off, right? Wrong.For the first time in forever, the dead aren’t talking.Now I need to know why...A kick ass Urban Fantasy Adventure filled with fey, demons, vampires, gargoyles and golems.
