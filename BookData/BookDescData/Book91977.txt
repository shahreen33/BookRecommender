Take a journey to the top of the world. Settle into the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains, and become a Geshe of time and space through the eyes of a Western professor as he tran­scends into the richly spiritual world of Tibetan monks who, despite having suffered greatly for their religious beliefs and their culture, embrace the teachings of contemporary science. A travelogue suffused with the wisdom of an ancient religious tradition, Humble Before the Void is a modern-day encounter between Western science and Buddhist philosophy. In this narrative, you’ll discover the relationship between ancient Indian philosophical and spiritual tradition and modern science through the experiences of a select group of Tibetan monks. Their stories will transport you to an unusual classroom where the author, Chris Impey, uses active learning techniques and low-tech materials to teach this novice group of scholars. Through his experience with this small cadre of Buddhist monks—the first to complete the Science for Monks leadership program—Impey brings to life a fresh new approach to popular science. You will follow along as he leads this group through a series of lively discussions and witness his approach manifest into success as these students, free of western social pressures, willingly throw themselves into experiments time and again. Fans of the Tibetan monks and science novices alike will fall in love with this tale of one professor and twenty-five monks who lose themselves to the spirit of curiosity and openly test their assumptions and preconceptions through their study of cosmology. With a foreword by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, this nar­rative brings together a dialog between science and religion that captures the Tibetan monks’ personal stories while also presenting state-of-the-art information on the universe.Humble Before the Void provides a counterpoint between the questing and inquisitive tradition of Western science and the humility and contemplation that characterizes Buddhism.
