Mary Kelly lies dead upon her bed... Her sorrowful eyes still hold captive, the agony of her fate. Anger, and fear walk side by side as the populace of London demand justice for the slain. Is it a single mad man or is there a bloody political game being played out in the grime filled streets of the old City? The authorities are powerless to stop the bloodletting and call for a new kind of law. William Harkness, former officer of the 66th Regiment of Foot will join the hunt. His task is not to bring an insane killer to court, his hands are not tied by the laws of the day.William Harkness is the killer of killers, the assassin of evil...Praise For the Reaper's Breath'He delivers a heck of a story that leaves me wanting to know what happens next while cringing in horror at the scene within the walls of the Mops. He shows that you can create true horror without the need to describe every splash of blood from a severed throat!'Stuart S Laing - Author of the Robert Young Mysteries'With fabulous dialogue and a story that keeps you on tenterhooks, one can easily imagine this as a TV programme, in the style of Ripper Street. Someone should call up a producer and refer them to this awesome book! I would love to see it as a movie or a TV series.This book is an excellent start to what promises to be a fabulous series!'Paula Lofting - Author of Sons of the Wolf'Let's get down to the honesty I like to bring to all my reviews... The plot itself seems well planned out.. everything made sense, nothing seemed out of place or had me confused. At one point I was 100% sure I had figured everything out..Then the author throws in some spectacular twists and turns that I just didn't see coming.'-The bookblurg review group -
