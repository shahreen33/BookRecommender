Razzy needs a man… or it’s end game.  Unable to find a mate, her dragon is asleep, and the curvy dragoness is running out of time. In desperation, she makes an appointment with the matchmaker, Geri Wilder. Perhaps Geri can work some of her magic on Razzy and find her a man that will literally save her life. But before she can speak to the matchmaker, Tall, blonde and handsome storms in, kisses her like there’s no tomorrow and carries her off on the wing to his mountain-top lair. She’s been kidnapped… by a wyvern of all things. Not just any wyvern, but Roc, the king they claim they don’t have…  Dragons and wyverns don’t get on. Like, ever. So why does she want to climb her sexy captor like a tree, and what will he do when he finds out she’s the dragon king’s sister?  Roc needs a mate to be king. He needs to be king to save his people from themselves. Because they’re dumb…  Which means he needs a woman, and for that, he needs to see the matchmaker. And she delivers. Barely out of the meeting and he has his arms wrapped around the tiniest, curviest, most beautiful woman he’s ever seen. One breath and he knows she’s his mate. One kiss and his heart belongs to her… forever. Instinct kicks in and he carries her off to his lair. Alone, away from everyone, she’ll have no option but to fall for him.  Just one problem, she’s the sister of his greatest enemy… and he wants her back.
