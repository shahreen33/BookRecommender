  If you could ask Santa for absolutely anything, what would you ask for? 
Samuel Johnson OAM, Australia's favourite skylarker, brother and determined cancer vanquisher, has asked his friends and supporters (who just happen to be some of Australia's best writers, comics, actors, artists, musicians and personalities) to share their letters to Santa.Some letters are naughty.Some letters are nice.Some echo a favourite childhood memory.Some beg forgiveness.Some are angry.Some just want something sweet.Some want to change their own world, others want to change the whole world.Contributors include Helen Garner, Adam Hills, Deborah Mailman, Rove McManus, Leigh Sales, Grant Denyer, John Williamson, Myf Warhurst, John Paul Young, Mia Freedman, Shaun Micallef, Missy Higgins, and many more.This little book of letters is wicked, witty and warm-hearted. It will make you laugh, think and feel and is the perfect Christmas gift for those who speak human.  Illustrations by Shaun Tan
