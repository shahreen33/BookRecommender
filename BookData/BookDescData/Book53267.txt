BUCK  I want two things in life: a woman and a child. When I walk into the diner and see Rosie, I think my motherf*cking dreams have come true. We share one stolen afternoon, but then she’s gone. Eight months later she shows up at my cabin. Her belly swollen, her breasts full, and with the face of an angel. Still, she wants to keep on running. No way in hell am I letting her go. It’s not just Rosie that needs my protection––our babies do too.  ROSIE  Arranged marriages may be fine for some girls, but I’m not some girls. I’m on the run with one goal: avoid my uncle and the plans he has for me. What starts as a reckless afternoon, suddenly becomes a life tethered to a man I barely know. I thought a pregnancy would buy my freedom. But I was wrong. And my uncle is ready to make someone pay.  Darling You,  BUCKED is a stand alone story that is packed with true love and a man who knows what he wants: his woman. He fights for her like a real mountain man knows how to do!
