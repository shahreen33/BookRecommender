Summertime means fresh veggies at the farm stand to pick out and count! This concept book follows a family's stop at the farm stand as they count tomatoes, strawberries, sunflowersâ€”and yes, ears of corn. Felicia Sanzari Chernesky's simple verses are beautifully accompanied by Susan Swan's collage art.
