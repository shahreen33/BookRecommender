Tookie has a unique outlook and zest for life, and her adventures will keep readers enchanted from the first page to the very last sentence.  Tired of a marriage that has been dead for years, Tookie branches out into the dating world. Trying to find a man that can keep up with her lascivious needs is not easy. Tookie is on fire and the men in her life just cannot meet her needs for the long term. When Tookie finds out that her job is going to be axed, she is dismayed because it will be hard for her to find another one. She is in her sixties and feels she will be in low demand. Her interest is piqued however, when she is offered the chance to be a spy. “Tookie Goes Undercover” by George Q. Kaplan is an entertaining novel that starts with a bang and keeps the momentum going until the very end. She is a strong woman who only has one motive in life and that is to move forward….I could see this novel becoming an action movie or a TV series and enjoying great success.
