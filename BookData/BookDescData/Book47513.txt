Red Flags… Too loud.Too clingy.Too much make-up.  I could go on and on. The other guys in the Single Dad’s Club would say I’m obsessed with finding them. But none of their kid’s mothers call a maximum-security prison home either, so their opinions mean shit.Caterina Santora has her own list of red flags… She’s too young.She’s my client’s daughter.She’s my five-year old’s camp counselor. Even after repeating this mantra to myself every morning on the way to Lily’s summer camp, guess what happens the moment I see Cat? Yeah, that mantra turns into ride me, doggie style and reverse cowgirl.  Every. Damn. Time. The fact that she doesn’t remember me from six years before grates on me until I don’t have it in me to leave her alone any longer. I have to have her. But our lives are opposites in every way. In no way compatible. When we’re together all the complications fade away and I have to keep reminding myself, even if I can have her— I can’t keep her.
