My name is Willow AKA Flame. I'm on the run with my biker boyfriend. I'm running from his Satan's Savages MC brothers. How did my life come to this?  My name is Steel. I will protect her with my life. But two weeks on the road is long enough. I need to find her somewhere to hide—a sanctuary—where she will be safe.  She is scared. He is desperate. They are running for her life. Can a helping hand bring a new home?  Running from what scares Willow most, leads them both on a different path, to another life they didn't know existed. A brotherhood that's there willing to protect and provide sanctuary. But will the brothers they left behind follow them to their new haven?  Can Steel continue to ignite the Flame?
