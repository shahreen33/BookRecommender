A nameless character. A faceless figure. A disturbing, thought-provoking journey through the facts of the world we live in that we often refuse to acknowledge.By taking full advantage of their author's lack of identity and extreme levels of introspection, The Unwords cut straight through the pretenses and the fallacies in our language as they unleash a full scale attack on all fronts of cultural and social decay. Written by an anonymous author, it's the only book in the modern market that has neither an author's name nor a publisher's name on its front and back cover; only the title is present.Words are meant to be spoken. In a dishonest world, what remains unspoken can only be the truth. In a dishonest world... all words can go to hell!
