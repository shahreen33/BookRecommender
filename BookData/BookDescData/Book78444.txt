Try to forget.It's easier said than done.My past—violently haunts my dreams.My present—belongs to an MC. My brothers, my support, my family, my life.But what if you left someone behind?You failed them.And set in motion a series of events no one could have predicted.But in deserting him, you found her.A constant. A guiding light. A connection that can't possibly not be right.Or is it? This story isn’t just two souls finding their connection—it’s lust, treachery, misery, and brutality.Vengeance—will thrill you.But will I be able to gain my acceptance?
