At the heart of this novel lies the fictional village of Ulverton. Different voices tell the story of the village over three hundred years: Ulverton: one of Cromwell's soldiers staggers home to find his wife remarried and promptly disappears, an eighteenth-century farmer carries on an affair with a maid under his wife's nose, a mother writes letters to her imprisoned son, a 1980s real estate company discovers a soldier's skeleton, dated to the time of Cromwell...Told through diaries, sermons, pub conversations and film scripts, this exceptional novel reconstructs the unrecorded history of England.
