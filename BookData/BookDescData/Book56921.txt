A tale of two Novas! Sam Alexander's missing father is finally back, and together they're making adventure a family business. With their Nova helmets that enable them to fly and shoot energy beams, they're policing the Milky Way twice as well as before. And, when they get a chance, they're grabbing some dad-and-son catch-up time. With pancakes! Mini-golf! Earthquakes?! What could be responsible for the catastrophic tremors?COLLECTS: Nova (2015) 1-6
