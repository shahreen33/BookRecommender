The journey continues as the crew of the Lost Light confronts a band of rogue Decepticons -- with terrible consequences! Plus, a visit to the planet Hedonia -- and a chance to put recent events behind them. But all the while, locked in a secret cell underneath the Lost Light, hidden from the crew, a Decepticon psychopath is talking...without opening his mouth. And, Rodimus and his crew are confronted by the enemy within -- and not everyone will survive the encounter.
