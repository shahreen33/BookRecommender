Murder is bad for business, especially when the hot local crime writer is garrotted between the shelves!  With grudging permission from Heathcliff, Mina Wilde has transformed Nevermore Bookshop. She’s running author events, hosting Quoth’s art show, and using her creative flair to attract more customers. But when crime writer Danny Sledge is murdered moments before his writing workshop, the bookshop goes from bustling to broke.  No one in the village will set foot inside Nevermore. What if the murderer is targeting the bookshop? What if it’s connected to Mina’s father and the mysterious room? All Mina knows is that if she doesn’t solve the crime soon, she can kiss her livelihood goodbye.  Add in a plague of locusts, an emotional school visit, and a magical visitor from the past, and poor Mina has her work cut out for her. Luckily, she has Heathcliff, Morrie, and Quoth to help… that is – if they can keep their hands off her, or each other...  The Nevermore Bookshop Mysteries are what you get when all your book boyfriends come to life. Join a brooding antihero, a master criminal, a cheeky raven, and a heroine with a big heart (and an even bigger book collection) in this brand new steamy reverse harem paranormal mystery series by USA Today bestselling author Steffanie Holmes.
