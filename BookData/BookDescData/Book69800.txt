Meet Sissy. She's an arse-kicking, smart-mouthed chick from the Aussie outback. In fact, she's anything but what her name implies. She likes her men complex and her life simple, but all that is about to change. You see Sissy's just woken up from a little nap to find she's been missing for five years. Now Aliens from a far off planet are either lining up to hire her or attempting to kill her, and that's all before she's had her morning coffee.
