Troy and Dmitri have worked everything out - well, almost everything. Except for the part where Troy's family doesn't know Dmitri exists.  Troy's been out of the Army for almost a year, and except for a few short weeks, hasn't been back to West Virginia at all.  Now Christmas is coming, and his mother can't be put off any longer, not unless Troy wants to break her heart.  But Troy's biggest fear is that going home, new boyfriend and service dog in tow, is going to break his Momma's heart just as much.
