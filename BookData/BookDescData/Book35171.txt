In 1900, Louis Armstrong was born to a teenage mother in a depressed part of New Orleans. Jazz was born at around the same time. From the moment Louis began playing the trumpet as a young boy, it was hypnosis at first hearing, said another young musician. Louis would go on to become one of the major driving forces behind the development of jazz, one of America's most important native-born art forms. Elish describes the emergence of the Jazz Age in American society and Armstrong's role in its success.
