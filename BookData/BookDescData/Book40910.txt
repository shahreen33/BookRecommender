 
  What was it about her that made him act out of character? What was it about him that made her blood boil? They will find out soon enough. 
   It's Naomi Hart's wedding day but she isn’t heading to the church. She is on a train heading to Idaho. Carl Saunders had asked her to marry him in his letters and also sent enough money for her journey. But when she steps in the handsome sheriff’s ranch, she finds out that Carl didn’t send those letters and in fact, he wasn’t aware of her arrival at all. What is she going to do now? Going back is not an option.  Carl Saunders is mad at his brother for messing in his personal matters, ordering a bride he never wanted in the first place. He is also mad at this creature that looks like an angel but talks fiercely and is stubborn as a mule, refusing to go back.  Neither one of them is willing to put their ego on the side. Neither one of them can stop the addictive need of angering the other. Will that tension between them evolve into a strong emotion or will it drive them away and crash their hearts?  In the meantime, the groom she left at the altar is coming for her and his intentions are not good at all. Will Naomi and Carl resolve their issues or will Carl leave her to this lone shark’s hands?
