I said no. He said yes.I turned him down. He kicked in my door.He told me to stay. I ran as far as I could.I hate him. He adores me.I’m crazy. He’s worse.I want to leave. He won’t let me go.I’m a bitch. He loves me anyway.He’s a killer. I don’t really care.He says I’m strong, beautiful, talented. I say he’s lying.He’s doing everything he can to make me believe it. I’m doing everything I can to resist him.He fights and f*cks as hard as I do, and now...I think I might like him too.
