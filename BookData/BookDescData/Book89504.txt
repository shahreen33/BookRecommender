Having a daughter changes things. Even for God.Jessica McCloud is God’s only begotten daughter, and she’s not super thrilled about that. Sure, she can smite and she knows juicy gossip about folks in her tiny West Texas town, but that’s about where the perks stop. Because add an overbearing Father and a handsome shyster with a knack for founding churches to the already tricky mix of girlhood and puberty, and you’ve got yourself a recipe for ultimate humiliation. After a close call with a demon, Jessica decides that developing her ability to tell good from evil could be an especially useful survival skill for a messiah. But hopefully that can wait until, oh, high school? In the meantime, she must contend with twin bullies, abstinence-based sex education, and intense menstrual cramping (followed by lightning storms), meaning Jessica has a few things to clear off her plate before she can worry about any nonsense with the Devil.Feel like the world's gone crazy? You're not alone. The Beginning is the first book in an epic satire series with unforgettable characters and the fresh take on politics, religion, and feminism that you've been waiting for.
