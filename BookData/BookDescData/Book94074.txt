Slowly, slowly, slowly. That's the way the sloth moves. Slowly, it eats and then, slowly, it falls asleep. "What strange kind of creature is this?" the other animals wonder, "Why doesn't it run or fly or play or hunt like the rest of us?" "Why are you so slow??" the howler monkey inquires. But the sloth doesn't answer any questions until the jaguar asks, "Why are you so lazy??" Anyone who has ever felt too busy will appreciate the sloth's peaceful lifestyle and realize that it's okay to take time to enjoy life. Eric Carle's dazzling collage illustrations introduce readers to the exotic beauty of the Amazon rain forest and the many unusual animals living there.
