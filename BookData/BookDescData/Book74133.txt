The bridesmaid is pregnant...The stuffy air in the church and her queasy stomach are a bad combination, especially since Krystal Graham is trying to hide her condition - particularly from Garret Donovan, the groomsman assigned to escort her down the aisle. The groomsman who just happens to be the father of her baby.Unfortunately, once the "I do's" are over and the newlyweds are on their way, Krystal knows she's in trouble, and she tries to make her exit before she embarrasses herself. But that's the least of her worries. Garret's a smart man and a doctor. What's she going to do once her secret is out?
