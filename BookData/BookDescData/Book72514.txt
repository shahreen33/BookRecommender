 There's a new witch in town... Jealousy is rearing its ugly head in Beechwood Harbor as Holly contends with her new roommate, and popular paranormal soap star, Evangeline Loren. Especially when the new witch in town turns her flirtatious smile towards Adam St. James, Holly's newly minted boyfriend.  But before she can wrench Adam from Evangeline's clutches, she has an amnesiac ghost begging for her help and finds herself smack dab in the middle of another murder investigation in the small town.  Holly has to track down the murderer and save her relationship ... all without landing herself in a witch’s duel.  Twice the Witch is a spunky paranormal mystery set inside the coastal town of Beechwood Harbor, where vampires, ghosts, shifters, and witches all live, work, play, and—mostly—get along. It is book two in the Beechwood Harbor Magic Mystery series.
