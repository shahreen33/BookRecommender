In our age of aggressive evil and apathetic faith, the Gospel of Mark resounds with the dynamic power of the Lord Jesus Christ. Perhaps the most dramatic and action-packed of the synoptic Gospels, Mark's writing continues to inspire increased commitment in the Church at large.Mark's portrayal of Christ as the Servant-Savior takes on fresh relevance in these masterful expositions by respected pastor/author R. Kent Hughes. With careful exegesis, the author draws from the text many practical lessons for everyday living and effective ministry. His numerous illustrations reflect wide interests, extensive reading, and years of experience pastoring and counseling those who seek to know Christ and walk in his ways.This first volume covers Mark 1:1-9:1, the main part of Jesus' teaching and healing ministry. As the Messiah confronts evil spirits, heals the helpless, and challenges the orthodox, a final conflict with the religious establishment becomes inevitable--and we, like the ancient world, must decide if we will acknowledge him as our Lord and Savior.Those who preach, teach, and study will find this book a gold mine of helpful information. With divisions and outlines that are never forced, but flow naturally from the text, Mark will be a great boon to those charged with communicating the Word, and to all who seek to grow in their faith through personal Bible study. Part of the Preaching the Word series.
