Alpha-Mania Adventures is an innovative five-book series that ignites imagination and gives pre-reading children the foundation to become successful readers in the future. These exciting and colorful stories are the perfect tools to teach pre-reading skills through play. Storytime at home or in the classroom becomes fun and educational. Each adventure combines the heroic quests of five intrepid kids with phonological awareness and phonics, the first two components necessary to become a good reader. The Fantastic Floating Feast (Book 3 of 5) practices alliteration. Alliteration is the repetition of the initial sound in a series of words. For example, the phrase "marvelous monkeys munch on muffins" is an alliterative phrase because all four words begin with the sound /m/. The story: In this book, Captain Ray and his band of plucky pirates have returned to Letter Lagoon with treasure, and they invite the Alpha-Maniacs to their ship to celebrate with a fantastic feast! Once on board, the kids quickly determine that their pirate friends no longer speak in rhyme, but rather in alliterative phrases. After much merriment and fabulous food, the gang realizes that the ship has accidentally set sail. The Alpha-Maniacs must help the bumbling pirate crew right their ship and return to Letter Lagoon before nightfall.
