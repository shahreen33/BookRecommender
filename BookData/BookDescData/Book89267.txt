A great evil is being unleashed upon the gaslit streets of London, a blood-drenched shadow reaching skeletal fingers beyond the slums of Whitechapel.We must stamp out this demonic plague for the sake of our Queen, our Country, and our immortal souls. - Cora Drummond, Whitechapel Paranormal SocietyCollecting human souls is a thankless job, nearly as tedious as acting as solicitor to the fae.
