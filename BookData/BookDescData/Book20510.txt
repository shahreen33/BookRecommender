"Read The End First is a wonderful collection of devious and inventive tales about the end of the world. The apocalypse has never before been this much fun!"-NY Times bestseller Jonathan Maberry, author of Dead of Night and Assassin's Code. / "Read The End First is a chilling and utterly unique take-or rather, 24 different takes-on the end of the world as we know it. These stories present a fractured prism of apocalypse served up every way imaginable. Open it anywhere and be afraid."-Joe Schreiber, author of Star Wars: Death Troopers and Chasing The Dead.
