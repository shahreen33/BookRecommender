What Would Machiavelli Do?He would feast on other people's discordHe wouldn't exactly seek the company of ass-kissers and bimbos, but he wouldn't reject them out of hand eitherHe would realize that loving yourself means never having to say you're sorryHe would kill people, but only if he could feel good about himself afterwardHe would establish and maintain a psychotic level of controlHe would use other people's opinions to sell his book!
