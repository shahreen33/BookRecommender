Patricia Blakley's vow to love, honor, and obey...Pleasant Garden, North Carolina seemed like a God-fearing community where simple dreams came true. For Patricia Blakley it was church on Sundays and a loving family. Her prayers were answered in Ted Kimble, a fellow Christian and son of a local preacher. Then one afternoon, Patricia's charred body was found among the remains of her burned-out home. But it wasn't an out-of-control fire that killed sweet Patricia Kimble. It was a bullet to the back of the skull. Soon Ted Kimble's wall of lies came tumbling down......became a pact with the devil...The investigation not only revealed the cold-blooded motive behind the crime, but the startling revelation that Ted Kimble's own flesh and blood helped him. How could a woman of such purity and innocence fall in love with such irredeemable evil? Through Patricia's heartbreaking diary entries and interviews with friends and family, Preacher's Son answers the question in a stunning tale of blind love, deadly secrets, and murder that would forever shatter the security and calm of Pleasant Garden.
