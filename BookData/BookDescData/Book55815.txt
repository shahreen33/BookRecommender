Anya is getting ready to go to college, but she’s sad to leave her bodyguard behind. Sasha has been everything to her over the year, even more than he knows. She’s fantasized about all the ways he could do more than just protect her, and leaving him is making her heart ache. What she doesn’t know is he’s got his own plans, and they include more than she could have possibly dreamed of.  Sasha is the big Russian bodyguard everyone stays clear of. He’s intimidating, rough, and knows how to kill. But there’s a soft spot inside him, and it’s name is Anya. He’s made a promise to her father and to himself that he won’t touch her until he’s fulfilled his duty. But that time is almost up, and her innocence is free to claim.  Warning: We know how our readers love it dirty with a side of sweet so we’ve stolen a book from Jessa Kane, and added our own little sparkle to it. It’s the filthiest ever, so bring a spoon. You guys are going to eat it up.
