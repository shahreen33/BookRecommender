When you're all by yourself, you can (nearly) do anything you want, but when you're playing with other people, they might want to do something different. The more you know what they like, the more fun can be had while playing!Children on the autism spectrum can find playing with other children difficult and they may be highly focused on their interests. This colourful and interactive visual guide will help these children learn how to establish common interests with friends and classmates or family members at home, and use this knowledge to improve their play.With six chapters showing examples of young people trying to get better at hanging out together, before giving problem-solving exercises and activities to help refine this information, this book is perfect for an adult and child to go through to develop their ability to play.
