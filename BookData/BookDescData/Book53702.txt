Rule number one: don't fall for jerks.Rule number two: don't fall for your best friend's brother.Oops. Too late.I’m Luciana Wright.Everyone calls me Lucky, but when it comes to love, I’m anything but.I have a long history of dating the wrong men.You know the ones I’m talking about.The beautiful, charming guys who are quite literally too good to be true.The ones who are impulsive in love and prefer short flings over long-term relationships.I’m talking about the jerks.The guys who taste so good, but are so very bad.After going through the most ridiculous breakup in the history of breakups, I thought I’d learned my lesson. I officially put myself into jerk rehab and committed to changing my ways.But, let’s be real here, love is never that easy.Especially when an arrogant, charming, he-devil of a sexy alpha man gets involved.Aussie accent.Tanned skin.Muscular, surfer bod.Gorgeous brown eyes.And the kind of sexy smile that brings women to their knees.Oh, did I mention that he’s also my best friend’s brother?Yeah. This story, my story, it’s a real doozy you guys.The day I stopped falling for jerks, I met Oliver Arsen—the biggest jerk of all.
