A voyage always begins the same way. With tickets and suitcases, trunks and passports. Then there's the moment: standing on the deck of the ship, surrounded by fellow travelers, watching all that's familiar recede, shrink, vanish. Ahead, open water and possibility of something new, something miraculous. Maiden Voyage charts the restless seascapes of the heart, it swells and troughs, covers and lagoons.It's a journey five years in the making, and the pilgrims are as diverse as any that Chaucer dreamed up. --Martin Achatz, Poet Laureate of the Upper Penninsula
