Murder and ghosts go hand-in-hand and vengeful spectres seeking justice or haunting the scene of the crime or their killers have adored the pages of literature since before Shakespeare. This chilling collection of true-crime tales dating from the mid-eighteenth century to the present day all feature some element of the paranormal. Gathered from across the UK, cases include the discovery of a body by a spiritual medium, a murder solved by a dream of the mother of the victim, and evidence at a Scottish murder trial provided by the ghost of the victim himself. Featuring visions, psychometry, ghosts, haunted prisons, possessions, and spriritual detectives, this book is a fascinating look at criminology and ghost hunting.
