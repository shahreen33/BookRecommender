When Silver Hollow witch Adele Brundage curses the town with a plague of toads until her killer is found, Isolde Quinn and her cousins find themselves thrown into a dangerous world where someone will go to any lengths to keep a decades-old secret. Armed with their witchy powers and unconventional pet familiars, the Quinns set out on an investigation that puts them in the path of a dangerous killer who will stop at nothing to keep their secrets buried.  And when that path intersects with hunky FBI agent Dex Nolan, it’s a blessing and a curse. Issy has feelings for Dex, but can a lawman sworn to prosecute paranormals ever truly fall for a witch?  With the body count piling up—not to mention the toads—Issy has to take drastic action to expose the identity of the killer before they claim another victim.
