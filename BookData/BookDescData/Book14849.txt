Ever feel like someone's watching you? Me, too. But lately it's been happening in my room. When I'm alone.A friend posted a video of me dancing online, and now I'm no longer Alicia Ruffino. I'm dancergirl. And suddenly it's like me against the world. everyone's got opinions.My admirers want more, the haters hate, my best friend Jacy, even he's acting weird. And some stalker isn't content to just watch anymore.Ali. Dancergirl. Whatever you know me as, however you've seen me online, I've trained my whole life to be the best dancer I can be. But if someone watching has their way, I could lose way more than just my love of dancing. I could lose my life.
