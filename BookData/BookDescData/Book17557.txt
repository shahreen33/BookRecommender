Summer’s over and it’s time for Connor Connolly to head back to school to start Sophomore year, the only problem is that the world has changed overnight, with the world now populated with thousands of new metahumans. Now not only does he have to deal with the pressures of being a super-human and training with his mentor Midnight, he also has to balance relationships with his best friends Sarah and Jim, two people who find themselves on different sides of the fence when it comes to feelings about all the new metahumans. As the world struggles to adjust to the events of the past few months, Connor’s alter ego Omni finds work at the now overcrowded Silver Island Meta Detention Facility. When he’s recruited for a job to assist a government agency in disarming one of the most powerful and secretive metas in Culver City he never expects what goes wrong and how it will affect the rest of the world, metas and regular humans alike.
