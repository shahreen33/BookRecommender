King John, a history play by William Shakespeare, dramatises the reign of John, King of England (ruled 1199â€“1216), son of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine and father of Henry III of England. It is believed to have been written in the mid-1590s but was not published until it appeared in the First Folio in 1623.
