Mr. Pack Rat is a particularly acquisitive small mammal with a hoarding problem (sound like someone you know?). Through trial and error, he begins to question whether having more things is really the secret to happiness.Although real-life pack rats (genus Neotoma) build large piles of debris to nest in, Mr. Pack Rat isn’t satisfied with plain old sticks and leaves. He wants novelty and variety, and—unfortunately for him!—he owns a magical magnet that can summon anything he desires.Mr. Pack Rat is always on to the next thing. Lovely flowers will brighten up his sticks and leaves…until they wilt. Colorful seashells won’t wilt, but they aren’t much fun. Games and toys are fun, but only if you have enough room to play with them.This wry, witty fable from Marcus Ewert, author of 10,000 Dresses, will have the whole family laughing, and, perhaps, learning along the way.
