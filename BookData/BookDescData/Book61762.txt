Being arranged to marry a Highlander lord is hardly uncommon.But when he happens to be gorgeous, powerful, dominant, and your best friend’s dad?Well, that’s another story…Lachlan McDougall is a lot of things: powerful, ruggedly handsome Highlander Lord, fierce ex-warrior, my soon-to-be-husband……And my best friend’s dad.I grew up in their castle, under his eye. But secretly, I’ve wanted him since before I even knew what the word meant. On the surface, I’m marrying him for political reasons: to stop a war and save his lands.On the inside, though, binding myself to Lachlan McDougall is a fantasy I’ve dreamt a thousand times.I know this is wrong, and a sin. But once I lose myself in those dark, piercing eyes, and once I feel his big, powerful hands on me, and once I taste those beautiful lips?…Well, it turns out, I might not be the only one with a forbidden little secret.In two days, I’ll be married to a man who I’ve married a hundred times, in my head. The man who’s taken me to bed ten times that number in my dreams.Twice my age, a scandal waiting to happen, and my best friend’s father.…I’m in so much trouble.All the tropes, all the growly af alpha goodness, all the over-the-top fun, and of course, WILDLY historically inaccurate.Warning: not responsible for lost or ripped bodices. Reader beware.As with all my books, this one is safe, with no cheating, and a HEA guaranteed.
