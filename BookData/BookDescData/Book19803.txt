WARNING: This book contains subject material of an adult nature intended for readers over the age of 18.Author's Note: I wrote this book as a dare and intended it to be a standalone. It was written with an "ambiguous" ending. I expected to get raked over the coals for this story, but readers wanted more. They wanted to know more about Jack Stevens, they wanted to know what happened afterward... So, then I wrote a book about Jack Stevens (Not In My Wildest Dreams, Book 2 in the Dream Series). Various characters continued to come to life in my head, and before I knew it, I had a 6 book series, each featuring different characters.Enjoy Book 1.
