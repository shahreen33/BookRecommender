A hundred-year interplanetary war receives little attention from the militaryâ€™s greatest warriors.  Until five of them devise a secret plan to end it.From Midwest Book Review:"Think the classic Ender's Game, but without any attempt to mimic Orson Scott Card's scenarios or success. Think a military battle structure holding the epic confrontations of Lord of the Rings, complete with its promise of multiple series books; yet with an attention to intricate detail that belays the (too-often) hasty series production. There is no artificial division of action felt in Astral Fall.Without providing spoilers, suffice it to say that Astral Fall attempts to identify, address, and turn upside down reader preconceptions of [...] the nature of military sci-fi as a genre. And, it succeeds.Astral Fall is highly recommended for any military sci-fi fan looking for superior writing and fresh, original plots."- Midwest Book Review, Diane Donovan
