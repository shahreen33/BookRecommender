Freak has watched his brothers fall for the women they love time and time again and is more than familiar with the signs of a man about to hand over his heart. When Carnie comes tumbling into the clubhouse asking for help, all it takes is a bat of her innocent stare and sassy tongue for Freak to know what is about to happen. But when he finds out how old she is, he hesitates to stake his claim. As a Fallen Lord through and through, he will make sure to protect her even though heâ€™s promised himself not to touch her. Can Carnie convince Freak age is just a number, or is he on a one way track out of her life?
