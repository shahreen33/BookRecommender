Allie had big plans for the future. Falling for a cowboy wasn't part of it. 1. Get out of Black Falls Texas - aka Redneck Hell (Graduation was eight months away. After that, she was out of there.)2. Avoid Wyatt Holcomb at all costs. (Except he was everywhere and kind of hard to ignore since he was hot-and a really nice guy.)3. Avoid her parents. (Shouldn't be too hard to do since her father hated her and her mother pretended nothing was wrong.)4. Stop thinking about Wyatt. (Which would be a lot easier if he wasn't so sweet... and he'd keep his shirt on.)5. Decide what she really wants.(Instead of holding onto the past and the guilt.)
