“There’s nothing here for me.”  Chase Carpenter has spent his whole life trying to get away from the small town of Baxter Springs. After eight years in the Marines, he’s only back for two weeks before he’s off on his next adventure – a new life working with his brother in New York. He’s never had a reason to stay in one place—but when he runs into his old best friend, Ben, he can’t forget what they almost once shared. Will he be able to come to terms with his sexuality?  “My roots are here. This is my home.”  Ben Harper’s family has lived in Baxter Springs for generations. He’s openly gay, but he’s never gotten over his strong feelings for his best friend, Chase. When his parents died in a car accident, the family ranch became his responsibility. His brother helps run the ranch, but the big, comfortable house that’s seen a hundred years of love and laughter feels cold and lonely now that Ben is the only one who calls it home. A proposition from Chase is too good to refuse.  “Two weeks. No Strings. No feelings. Those are the rules.”  When Ben runs into Chase unexpectedly, sparks fly as they try all the things they were too shy and inexperienced to do when they were younger. This time, though, Ben wants rules and assurances that when the two weeks are up, his heart won’t be broken again when Chase says goodbye.  Love doesn’t always play by the rules, and when it’s time for Chase to leave, Ben will have to choose between his keeping his family’s legacy alive and taking a chance on the only man he’s ever loved.
