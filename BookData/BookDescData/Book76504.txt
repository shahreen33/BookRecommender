In this debut collection of stories, Jim Breslin explores the soul of suburbia; the disenfranchised and the desperate. The characters in these twenty-one stories struggle to mend relationships and find redemption. A man is tempted by memories when his drunk ex-wife pays a surprise visit. A couple wrestles with their fruitless attempts to have children. An eccentric homeowner issues a series of comical concerns to his lawn care company. A husband tests the reciprocity of his wife's love only to find himself in the throes of a dangerous free fall. Sometimes funny, often sad, the unsettling stories in Elephant portray the suburban landscape of loneliness and hope.
