Melanie Blythe has a house, a career, and a cat. She doesn’t need a man.  But she isn’t the only one who’s noticed the gorgeous cop down the street. When her faithless cat prances home from the cop’s house with a note tucked in his collar, it might be the beginning of something beautiful…or it might be Melanie’s death warrant.  Detective Finn DeLuca is stuck at home recovering from a hit-and-run accident, and has plenty of time to wonder about the woman two doors down. There’s something mysterious about the beautiful brunette, and he’s determined to get to know her.  But someone else has other plans.  As the two grow closer, someone is watching—and waiting. Sooner or later, their chance will come.  And the two lovebirds will never see it coming.
