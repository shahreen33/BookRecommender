  Out of the frying pan and into the fire.
   I just dodged one massive mistake, and stepped smack dab into an even bigger one. And it all started with a kiss. One unforgettable, scorching hot kiss with Nate Callahan. Which turned into one unforgettable night. And now the big sexy rescuer wants to win me over. And it’s kind of working. Only I’m keeping a huge secret that could tumble into massive mistake number three. Third times the charm, right?  
  I like my relationships like I like my women, short and sweet.
  Only there’s something about Mikki Russo that keeps me coming back for more. Maybe it’s that sexy southern belle accent. Or all those feminine curves she shows off proudly. Maybe it’s the way she kisses… Or maybe it’s the way she took me in when a rescue went wrong. All I know is that proving to her that I’m a better man is suddenly my top priority. Until I found out what she’s been hiding from me. Now I have to decide if one lie of omission is worth throwing away everything for.
