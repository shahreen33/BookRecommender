Justin isn't a fan of Christmas (or holidays in general) at the best of times. But now his long-term boyfriend has broken up with him, and he's even more gloomy than usual. The hot and unfortunately straight Felix, his partner on the force, keeps trying to help. It's really not working until Christmas Day arrives, and brings with it an unexpected gift...  9,300 words (friends to lovers, buddy cops, sweet gay romance, holiday)   EXCERPT  I thought I was about as excited as I'd ever been for the most wonderful time of the year.  When else would my partner and I get to chase down a robber dressed as Santa?  It was awesome, one for the scrapbook. Vaughn and Santiago taking down a Santa. Felix flying after the guy on foot, me jerking ahead with the car, sirens on, to cut him off. The guy veered, but we knew this town. This was our beat, our patch.  Felix followed without missing a step, and I navigated alleys with quick precision to cut him off at the pass. I could drive when I needed to. The Santa bandit couldn't get by us, not when we were working together. We were in the zone. I cut the sirens so I wouldn't give him any warnings. We'd already called it in.  I jerked to a stop at the end of the alleyway just as Santa-thief zoomed out at top speed and slammed up against the passenger side window, where I normally sat. I swear he squeaked against it as he slid down a few inches, and where was Felix? He should be cuffing the guy right now. I waited a second, then flung myself out of the car, grabbing for my cuffs.  "Freeze!" I told him.  I didn't see Felix.
