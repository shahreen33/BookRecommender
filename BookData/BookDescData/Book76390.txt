A FREE peek into the dark, decadent world of a twisted billionaire and his future captive. Find out what America’s most elite men are hiding...  They’re rich, wild, sexy… and dangerous.  I’m one of the wealthiest men in the world. My reach is boundless, and absolutely anything I want can be mine with the snap of a finger. Including her. Tatum Marris, my newest obsession. She’s young, beautiful, naïve… and hiding many dark secrets. At least she thinks she is. She might have everyone else fooled with her innocent act, but she’ll never fool me. I’ve been watching her for a long time, always lurking in the shadows, and I know the real her. I know exactly what she’s done. Every dirty little secret. She hates men like me, but that won’t stop me from having her, because everyone has a price. Even her. So when the time is right, I’m going to take her away from everything she knows. And then I’m going to make her pay….  Wild Elite is the free prequel to the Dark Dynasty trilogy.
