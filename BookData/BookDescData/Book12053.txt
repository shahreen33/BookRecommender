Hong Mei's (洪梅) debut travelogue, The Farther I Walk, The Closer I Get To Me (走得越远,离自己越近), takes readers on a meditative backpacking odyssey across the length and breadth of the Indian subcontinent over the course of a year.Hong is recognized as the first Chinese woman on record to have backpacked across all of India, for which Asian Age has called her a "modern Faxian."The book's Chinese-language narrative recounts how Hong's adventurous spirit steered her off the beaten path of tourism and deep into the country and its customs. Encountering Maoist insurgents in Orissa, performing in a Bollywood production alongside superstar Aamir Khan, befriending India's Hijra community, and being kidnapped - and subsequently arrested - in the Dharavi slums are among her many unique experiences.Written from the unique perspective of a young Chinese woman of the 1980s generation, and heralding the transformative nature of independent travel, Hong's groundbreaking journey and book have been covered extensively in the international media. Husband Tom Carter, the critically acclaimed photographer and author of CHINA: Portrait of a People, adds a wonderful dimension with his numerous beautiful photographs.《走得越远，离自己越近》是中国女孩洪梅与外国男友背包走印度的深度游走纪行。一年之内四进印度，走遍印度东西南北，我和汤姆以最平和的心态接受了一切。有时被瑰美的建筑震撼，有时被当地人的虔诚感染，有时因为突如其来的遭遇饱受冲击，有时又懒散地躺在海滩边晒太阳。前一刻被半大小子戏弄，在孟买贫民窟遭遇绑架，下一刻在恒河边漫步，在红堡遥看泰姬陵，在圣河瓦拉纳西洗涤尘埃。这一村惊叹悬崖上养蜂人勇敢矫健，那一寨遭遇牛尿液酿饮料骇人听闻。这一端凡间生活生机盎然，另一端生命终结古老圣洁。我们拿笔和相机记录下一路的感受，没有什么真知灼见，要的是真实的自己。
