Women hire me, pay me an exorbitant amount of money, to teach them the art of...oral stimulation. I'm what people have referred to as a "professional blower." In college, it was a great way to make money, needing the extra cash to get me through school. By the time I graduated, I saw the potential to earn more than my degree would ever be able to offer me. I had a good run...until my ex's new girlfriend hired me to teach her how to please him. Or so I thought.
