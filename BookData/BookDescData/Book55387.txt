Tina and Kristian thought their love stories were over. Each on the other side of 60, they have lost a best friend and a wife, the ambitions of their youth, their hopes for a fresh start. Yearning for connection, they strike up a yearlong correspondence, brought together by a shared fascination with the Tollund Man, subject of Seamus Heaney’s famous poem. As they open up to one another about their lives—daily routines, travel, nature, beauty, work, family—these two strangers become friends and then, perhaps, something more.Full of insight, humor, and candor, Tina and Kristian’s letters are a testament to the joy that can come from the meeting of two intensely curious minds. Anne Youngson’s Meet Me at the Museum is a celebration of long letters, kindred spirits, and the possibility of writing a new story for yourself, at any stage of life.
