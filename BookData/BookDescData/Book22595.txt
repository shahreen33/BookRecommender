Kat Stans always knew she wanted to be a doctor. Davd Palfy always knew he wasn't about to get truly involved with anyone. The computer that runs the colony has other ideas for both of them. When Kat is assigned by the head of the Enforcers to hunt down and return a 'shirker'-any colonist who tries to escape the computer's authority-she sets out to complete her assignment. This shirker, Davd, a handsome and mysterious fellow enforcer, is more than she bargained for, and sparks fly when he turns the tables on her, capturing and kidnapping her away from all she knows.
