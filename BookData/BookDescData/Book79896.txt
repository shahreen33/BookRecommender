Angela Thirkell writes of her late Victorian childhood, in which her memory inhabits the three houses which shaped the sensibility later displayed in her beloved Barsetshire novels. First, there is her maternal grandparents home in Fulham, "The Grange," where her grandfather, the celebrated Pre-Raphaelite painter Sir Edward Burne-Jones, set the cultivated tone enjoyed by family and friends alike (such as William Morris). Second is her parents' home in Kensington Square in which the young Angela was surrounded by a bright world of neighbors and acquaintances. At the heart of Thirkell's reminiscences was the Burne-Jones's seaside retreat- North End House in Rottingdean- where Thirkell's grandmother was the presiding genius and her cousin, Rudyard Kipling, lived across the green.
