What’s the saying: keep your friends close and your enemies closer? Guess I’m about to find out just how difficult that really is. I might have my best friend back but his safety and that of my chosen family depends on me doing something I vowed never to do. Join Camden’s crew. Thing is, you don’t turn down the leader of Hackney’s Hackers and then get a second chance without forfeiting something in return. The relationships I was just starting to build, is that too high of a price? Sonny with his joking nature and dimples. Ford with his mysterious dominance and protective instinct. Eastern with his unyielding loyalty and feeling of home. This term at Oceanside Academy, my sanity will be pushed to the limit as I walk the fine line between friend and foe. All I know is this better be worth it because I’m about to learn something important about myself. I was happy being a delinquent, but a reject…? Not so much. **Reject is book two of this new gritty, contemporary reverse harem academy trilogy for 17+ readers and contains foul language and sexual scenes**  **Reject is book two of this new gritty, contemporary reverse harem academy trilogy for 17+ readers and deals with adult themes.
