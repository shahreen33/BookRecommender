What would you do if your best friend was: 1. Still imaginary (and getting into trouble with other “imaginary” creatures, such as leprechauns. That’s right, leprechauns!!)? 2. In danger of losing his home, and the only forest in your town, the magical Field of Dreams? 3. Driving you crazy?!?! (But in a best-friend type of way . . . ) Now you have an idea of what Willie Ryan’s life is like in the third and final installment of the hilarious Dodger and Me series. Only this time, Dodger’s gone and peeved a band of leprechauns; Willie’s sister, Amy, is missing; and class bully James Beeks’s dad wants to build a housing development in the Field of Dreams. It just might take an oversize blue chimp—who may or may not be imaginary—and his two fifth-grade friends, Willie and Lizzie, to step up as environmental activists and save the woods (and still get their homework done).
