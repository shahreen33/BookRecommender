In Beyond the Velvet Curtain, Karen Kovacik illustrates Czeslaw Miloxz's dictum that "the purpose of poetry is to remind us how difficult it is to remain just one person." Peopled with such diverse characters as Richard Nixon, Nikita Khruschev, Kafka's father, Dorothea Lange, William Carlos Williams, Lawrence Welk, Robespierre, and a feisty Catholic saint, this original collection of poems takes us on an amusement-park ride through world history and art. Kovacik's poetry places us in the strange drama of cataclysmic events and ordinary life.
