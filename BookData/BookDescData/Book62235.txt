Rescued as a child by her grandpa, the powerful Vampire Malachi, Emma has been on the run for nearly forty years from a Vamp determined to see them both dead. When he enlists the aid of assassins from the Vampire Council, their luck runs out. Forced to separate, Malachi sends Emma to a trusted VampLycan for protection.  Redson knows trouble when he sees it, and sure enough, the gorgeous, mostly human female seeking shelter immediately disrupts his future plans. His father swore a blood oath to her grandfather, and Red is honor bound to protect her. He’s surprised when his instincts demand so much more—protect…claim…mate.  Their attraction is explosive, but Emma refuses to consider mating while her grandfather is in danger. She needs Red’s help…but is he Malachi’s savior? Or his biggest threat yet?
