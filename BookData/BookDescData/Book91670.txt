If men would open up to you would you really listen? Meet author, Barbara Silkstone. She traveled the country for six years armed only with a tape recorder and a quirky sense of humor, listening to men talk about women, love, commitment, and male hopes and fears.Women will enjoy this book for the insight it gives them into the male mind. Men will immediately compare themselves with the 527 Naked Men to see how they stack up. Both genders will gain a new and often humorous perspective on the opposite sex.
