Luba creates an Altermere by combining the Aurameres that finds Cornelia after jumping out of Irma's window and merges itself with her, granting the power of all five elements. Cornelia then feels exceptionally powerful and has a feeling that she can transform Caleb, who is in a delicate flower state, back into his original human form. Meanwhile, Will, Irma, Taranee and Hay Lin go to great lengths to prevent Will from moving back to Fadden Hills.
