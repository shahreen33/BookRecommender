From the author of The Chaos of Longing comes a powerful second collection in which Robinson uses the metaphor of water to tell a story about achieving wholeness through letting go. Organized in three sections, Submerge explores immersion in and release from trauma, mental illness, and loss. Part one, “Immerse,” reflects on birth and beginnings while exploring themes of love, self-discovery, and cultural history. Part two, “Drown,” examines mental illness, trauma, and loss. Part three, “Emerge,” takes lessons from water and begins a journey toward healing through self-care and gratitude. Throughout the collection, Robinson’s disarming candor, vivid imagery, and supportive message inspire and empower.
