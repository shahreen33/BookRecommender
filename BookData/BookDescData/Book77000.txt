In Visualization for Weight Loss, Jon Gabriel expands on the most talked about tool in his best-selling book, The Gabriel Method: visualization. This powerful technique helped Jon drop 220 pounds without dieting or deprivation because it didn’t depend on calorie counting or extreme exercise—rather it changed his biochemistry and neural pathways. In turn, this helped lower stress and its associated inflammatory chemicals in his body, allowing him to lose weight easily and naturally.Examining the importance of visualizing for weight loss, Jon takes readers through the latest research on the power of the mind in order to show why this technique works. And then he lays out concrete, unintimidating advice about how to implement visualization into their lives. In addition to teaching readers how to move into the most powerful brain state for enacting change, Jon includes visualizations to help readers:Overcome disempowering beliefs surrounding food and weight lossMelt away stressConquer fears of losing weightRediscover the joy of movementCreate healthy new habitsKill food cravings and addictionsAchieve better sleepJon not only provides readers with these visualizations but also teaches them how to create their own personalized visualizations that can be even more powerful. He then presents a four-month visualization strategy that can be easily included in anyone’s life—no matter what time constraints they face.As Jon found in his journey, the biggest challenge in weight loss is not finding the perfect diet or the perfect exercise routine; the biggest challenge is convincing your brain that your body needs to be thin.
