The fae have been loosed upon the world as they begin their wild hunt, a nightmare from fable and legend made flesh. At Hesk, in the heart of the Barren Isles, Ylsriss must confront a reality she never could have imagined when her son is stolen from her by the fae. Her desperate attempts to reclaim him lead her far from her own world and deep into the Realm of Twilight, where a still darker truth awaits her.
