A fascinating and entertaining account of a trek along Spain's ancient pilgrim trail - the five hundred mile long Camino de Santiago. Replete with interesting snippets and anecdotes about the rich ethnic, cultural, military and religious history of Spain, Strangers on The Camino is no ordinary travelogue - but a very readable book that gives the reader a meticulous insight and perspective of a challenging journey by a father and son along the Camino. Strangers on the Camino will be of interest and of use to those who are thinking of setting off on their own Camino. The detailed descriptions of The Way - and of the refugios and other accommodation which Sanjiva and his son Shivantha used - give a real sense of what it is like to make a six week journey by foot over a five hundred mile trail that traverses the mountains, mesetas and mists of Spain.
