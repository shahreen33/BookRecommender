She barely sees her kids, her boss is trying to sabotage her, and her marriage is falling apart.Burnt out, Hayley goes to sleep wishing for a different life. When she wakes up married to her first boyfriend, one she has not seen in over twenty years, she realizes there might be some truth in the saying “be careful what you wish for”.

But is the grass always greener, and will she ever want to go home?
