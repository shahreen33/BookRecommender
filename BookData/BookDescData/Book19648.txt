"A lovely lilt of language slides between the horrendous and hilarious in these poems." -Penn Kemp, author of 25 collections, celebrated foremother of Canadian sound poetry. "Readers of Where the Butterflies Go will already be expecting accomplished, fresh and lively work from Heather Grace Stewart, but even they will be surprised by the strength of this new collection, this genuine Leap, so direct, political and feminine by turns that it can take your breath away. A must for new and already hooked fans." -Sally Evans, poet and Editor, Poetry Scotland. Heather Grace Stewart is an Ottawa-born author, poet, and photojournalist now living in Montreal.
