If she steps in as surrogate model for this expert suspension rigger, will her demons remain hidden behind the alpha wall she's managed to erect, or will Roane use his rope like an extension of those sexy fingers to strip away every protection until nothing is left, but Ava's naked truth?ALPHA SUBMISSIVE was previously published in the Not Vanilla series. This version has an updated cover and series name.
