After watching a young boy die, college freshman Atancia Clark begins to have panic attacks. Her heart flutters, her breath catches, and she can’t control her emotions the way she always has. She wants to be strong, but lately she just hasn’t been living up to her own expectations. When she meets Ben Althaus, her breath starts catching for entirely different reasons. He helps Atancia discover the cause for her odd emotional reactions and the history she thought was lost when her mother left her. Like Ben, Atancia is Durand, an immortal who survives by transferring energy from other living things. He wants to help her hone her emerging abilities, but her focus is threatened by life-altering events. Thrust into a culture she never knew existed, Atancia will have to decide whom she can trust with her secrets and with her life.
