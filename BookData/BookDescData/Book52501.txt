PatchThe smallest caskets weigh the most. I lost myself the day I buried my daughter.Her death was only the beginning of my downfall.I will not play God. As a doctor, the oath I took bound me. As a father, only blood could set me free.Pain is my prison. With guilt my only companion, I bought myself a life, silenced by sin.  AlaskaYou are not defined by your mistakes.I refuse to regret the choices I've made. I embrace them. I will bow to no one. Fear does not make me weak. In the face of fear, I find my true strength. I will rise. With fire in my veins and embers in my soul, I will give my daughter the life she deserves.
