Illustrator, animator, teacher, and comic artist Fran Krause has touched a collective nerve with his wildly popular web comic series–and subsequent New York Times best-selling book–Deep Dark Fears. Here he brings readers more of the creepy, funny, and idiosyncratic fears they love illustrated in comic form-–such as the fear that your pets will tell other animals all your embarrassing secrets, or that someone uses your house while you’re not home-–as well as two longer comic short-stories about ghosts.
