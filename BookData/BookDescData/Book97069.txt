 Some call him a rock god. Others a celebrity bad boy.Me? I call him the arrogant bastard who stole my concert venue. His apology? To take me and my violin on tour with the band. It's an offer I can't refuse, even if it does come with strings attached. Because Rey Thomas isn't who he seems. Life isn't pretty behind the deviant frontman's facade. It's raw, ugly, and at times downright painful. But it's real. And far better than the lie he presents to the world. The man behind the face of Dark Tide is beautiful in his chaos. All I have to do is keep him alive long enough to see that too. PLEASE NOTE: DOWN BEAT deals firmly with the subject of mental illness and its associated effects on not only the sufferer, but those around them. If this is something you feel may be a potential trigger for you, I advise you stop, consider if this book is right for you, and if you decide yes, ensure you have a support person available. Rey's story is an immensely personal one for me and I would love for you to experience it, but not at the cost of your own health and wellbeing.
