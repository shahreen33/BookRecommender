Banned upon initial publication, the now-classic Candy is a romp of a story about the impossibly sweet Candy Christian, a wide-eyed, luscious, all-American girl. She chronicles her adventures with mystics, sexual analysts &amp; everyone she meets when she sets out to experience the world. Maxwell Kenton's (pseud. for Terry Southern &amp; Mason Hoffenberg) bawdy masterpiece, 1st published by the Olympia Press in 1958 &amp; the subject of innumerable lawsuits, piracies &amp; bad film adaptations since, is a modern take on Voltaire's Candide. Candy Christian, a beautiful girl who just happened to be born on Valentine's Day, writes a paper on Contemporary Human Love for her instructor, Prof. Mephesto, saying that "to give of oneself--fully--is not merely a duty prescribed by an outmoded superstition, it is a beautiful &amp; thrilling privilege."
