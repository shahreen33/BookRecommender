Most people see Sawyer Cargill as a gorgeous but cocky guy who doesn’t take anything seriously including the trail of hearts he’s left behind.But there’s so much more beyond the jokes and the sexual innuendos; behind the mask he so carefully wears. It’s in the way he takes care of others, including me. It’s in the glimpses of the pain he carries in his soul.I see him for who he really is. I know his heart is capable of changing from thorns and ice to love and flame.It’s more than a little hero worship. I’m in love with him.But, I’m not the only point of this triangle. Someone else who is important to us loves him too. How can there be joy if he chooses me when I know the other person will be hurt?Together he and I will have to figure that out because when I have him, I won’t let him go.
