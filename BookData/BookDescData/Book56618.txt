One tall, dark, and broody professor + One overachieving college student = Chemistry they can’t erase.  When I was asked to babysit for a single father, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Two months with Mr. tall, dark, and broody didn’t seem like a bad trade-off for the money he would pay me.  As the weeks go by, our attraction grows and I realize what a concerned and caring father he is. And he learns that not every woman is untrustworthy like his ex-wife.  We both agree to walk away from our fling when I leave for college at the end of summer.  And reluctantly, we do.  Until my first day of classes when he crashes back into my world. “I’m Professor Decker. Welcome to King University.”  Depravity is part of the King University series, but can be read as a complete standalone.
