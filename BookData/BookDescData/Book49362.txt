One cabin. One bed. And the man of her dreams…  Four friends. Four seasons. Four ways to fall in love.  Book 2: Tempting Autumn  For most of his life, Hitch has put his family’s needs before his own. Finally able to pursue his career as a nature photographer and travel the world, he’s determined to make the most of his freedom. And then he discovers that one of his best friends needs help.  Fashion designer Rowan thought she’d accepted that marriage and babies would never be a part of her life, but when her muse abandons her she realizes she hasn’t come to terms with it at all. Lonely and miserable, she accepts Hitch’s tempting offer of an autumn adventure in the hope that maybe, in the peace of the mountains, she’ll find the answers she needs.  A city girl to the core, she’s never been camping in her life, and what seemed like a great idea soon threatens to turn into a disaster. But in spite of the blisters, insects, and geckos, it’s not all bad. It turns out that their friendship is only a thin veneer covering a deep attraction to one another, and in the isolated cabin it’s not long before the cold mountain air turns sizzling hot.  The time they spend together suggests that with the right man the future she yearns for is a possibility. Hitch has shown her the path to love, but she discovers she doesn’t want to walk down it with anyone else. The problem is, does Hitch feel the same way?  Warning: this is a forced proximity story. If it makes you nervous to think about being stranded in a secluded mountain hut with a gorgeous guy who’s looking at you the way a tiger looks at his lunch, maybe you should buy another book.
