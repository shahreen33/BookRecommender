Vowing that her next book will be her last--since she no longer believes in a "happy-ever-after" tale--romance novelist Rebecca Reynolds makes a research trip to a small Texas town, where she uncovers secrets about the town and those who ran it. When Rebecca is mysteriously transported back to 1876, she encounters a handsome stranger--and is given a chance to rewrite history.
