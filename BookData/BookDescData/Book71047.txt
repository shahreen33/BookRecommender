Cagney Wilkins Strange or not, I'm starting to fall for the invisible presence that follows me around, picking on me. He's funny, he's kind and he's protective. Every day I grow more and more attached. Even with the complication of him being invisible, things seem to just fit. When I start seeing a beautiful blond man around Terra Mortis, I'm devastated to realize I'm attracted to him. How can I be so drawn to two men, especially when it becomes clear that my invisible friend is my mate.  Guthrie Bourne  I'm beautiful. I'm not bragging. It's what I am. If my brother is to be believed, it's all that I am. The best part about being an elf for someone like me who hates being the center of attention is the ability to be invisible whenever I want. And I always want. The gargoyle Cagney intrigues me. I didn't set out to mislead him, but I don't want him to be like everyone else, so distracted by my looks, he doesn't see the person I am beneath it all. Unfortunately, staying invisible all the time takes a lot of energy and when I accidentally reveal myself a few times, I inadvertently hurt the man I'm falling hard for. Will he understand my reasons?  Warning: Mpreg elements! (Though the MCs in this book aren't and cannot get pregnant, this is a spin-off series from my Chosen series. Occasional Mpreg characters might have cameos. You've been warned!)  Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama.  Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses::
