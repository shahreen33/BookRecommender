For Pagans and witches, Halloween, or Samhain, is the most important and sacred holiday--a day to honor the dead and to celebrate the birth of a new year. The number of Wicca practitioners is rapidly growing--especially among young women--and popular media has embraced Paganism on television, in movies, and on the internet. This book guides Wiccans, Pagans, and curious non-Wiccans alike in incorporating some of the original meanings and rituals into their Halloween festivities. It explains the rich Pagan/Irish roots of the holiday and includes ancient legends, divinations for telling the future, spells for finding a mate, and potions for gaining knowledge--not to mention detailed instructions for performing the traditional Halloween ritual and delicious Halloween recipes! Written by a woman who has devoted her life to educating the public about the Old Religion, this handbook reveals the uplifting spiritual energy that people can experience by celebrating a traditional Pagan Halloween.
