"It's a big, big world  It's easy to get lost in it..."--Justin Bieber, "Up"I love those lines in the lyrics. Sometimes I feel like that's what everyone's expecting. My world got very big, very fast, and a lot of people expect me to get lost in it. I grew up in a small town in Canada. I taught myself to sing in front of my bedroom mirror and to play guitar on a hand-me-down. My mom posted my first videos on YouTube. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that I'd sell millions of records, sing for the president of the United States and sell out a massive arena tour. So no, I'm not lost. Not at all. If anything, onstage in front of my fans, I'm home. I'm found. And that's what this book is about: my journey, from singing and busking on the sidewalk in Stratford, Ontario, to performing and showing my appreciation to millions of fans all over the world for making this dream a reality.My music and lyrics give a glimpse of what's in my heart, but I think this book is a window into my world. In here are hundreds of pictures of me that no one's ever seen before, and I'll tell you about who I was before I joined forces with Scooter Braun and Usher and got a record deal, and who I've become since I've been blessed with the opportunity to share my music with the world. This is my gift to you, the fans who've supported and been with me on this amazing journey every step of the way.
