From National Book Award finalist and New York Times bestselling author Jason Reynolds comes a novel told in ten blocks, showing all they different directions a walk home can take.This story was going to begin like all the best stories. With a school bus falling from the sky. But no one saw it happen. They were all too busyâ€”Talking about boogers.Stealing pocket change.Skateboarding.Wiping out.Braving up.Executing complicated handshakes.Planning an escape.Making jokes.Lotioning up.Finding comfort.But mostly, too busy walking home.Jason Reynolds conjures ten tales (one per block) about what happens after the dismissal bell rings, and brilliantly weaves them into one wickedly funny, piercingly poignant look at the detours we face on the walk home, and in life.
