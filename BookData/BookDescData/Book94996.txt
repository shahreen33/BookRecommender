The world will end.In a myriad of ways.Meet Allan, harvester of souls.Witness rebirth in an old junkyard.Behold murder and chaos and revelation.Nightmares swirl and bait. Insects scurry.The dominoes are all in line.The world will end.In bloodstains and beauty.Watch sweet little children in sacrifice.Gaze up at the living clouds.Follow the St. Vitus dance of the damned.Screaming sights and faithful mutiny.The dominoes are falling down.Dominoes is a Little Horror Book, the perfect bedtime read for strange parents and bizarro children, a book not only meant to be read but also experienced.
