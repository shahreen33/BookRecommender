Darwin's Moving introduces readers to the colourful characters who populate the furniture moving trade, a male-dominated world of labour with relatively high pay and no need for education of any sort. Movers have a unique window into the private spaces of the city as they perform their difficult and delicate job inside all manner of homes, from government-subsidized housing developments to multi-million dollar McMansions.Taylor Lambert intriguingly explores class and work in a city that would rather focus on the wealth and prosperity brought to it by the oil and gas industry. Darwin's Moving shows us the Other Calgary, a world populated by transient men and women struggling to survive in a boomtown's shadow.Darwin's Moving takes us behind the scenes of a business that is almost completely undocumented in Canadian literature.
