Returning home one night, Nicholas Picard is attacked by a wildcat. But when his body is found, the claw marks are accompanied by a laceration that only a human could have made. His death complicates a difficult land dispute that Ralph Delchard and Gervase Bret are settling in Exeter. Two women think they are the obvious benefactor, and so determined is each to prove her claim that the commissioners begin to wonder if this land could have driven one of them to murder.
