Stillwater - a story of life, love and lost innocence. Set in a time when the earth is covered with water. Anna Apsley has created a legend about a society where the sexes live separate lives, only coming together once a year. Everyone lives on rafts that float around the sole island. Only women visit the island for provisions. Males never visit - but things are about to change forever. The story follows one woman's epic and unusual journey through this time of upheaval.
