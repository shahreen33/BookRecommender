UNKNOWN TO THE WESTERN WORLD. . . THE TIBETAN LAMA UNLEASHES HIS MYSTICAL POWERS. At the age of seven the Day of Prophecy arrived, and the court astrologers pronounced their findings. It was proclaimed that T. Lobsang Rampa was to enter the lamasery to be trained as a clairvoyant and as a healer. Many predictions were made about his life, including the fact that his work would be heralded around the world. While still very young the author's Third Eye was opened increasing his mystical powers, as well as his ability to view the human aura, and to read the thoughts of others. This volume -- part of an extensive series -- discusses karma, the other side of death, the silver cord, the seership, crystal power, ghosts as well as astral projection. This book is highly recommended for students walking the Spiritual Path in search of Enlightenment.
