The Jackson Moores have been tilling the land of Hope House Farm on the West Coast of Cumbria for many generations, but they have been harbouring a dangerous history of dark and sinister secrets for far longer: cancerous secrets, that have slowly eaten away at their family, their sanity and their very existence. Nemesis comes in the shape of P.C. James Henderson, when he first spies Danny - youngest son of the family - on his way to commit a crime - or at least to conceal one. This pivotal moment sets Henderson on a doomed road of infatuation and addiction, ending in ruin and, ultimately, death. For Danny is no ordinary boy and he belongs to no ordinary family. Until now, the Jackson Moores have managed to keep their skeletons firmly inside the closet, but when Henderson unwittingly uncovers their twisted House of Usher, the whole rotten construct starts to sink into the mire, dragging everyone with it in a spectacular display of ruthless revenge.
