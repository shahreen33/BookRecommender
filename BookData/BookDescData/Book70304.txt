What possibly could an Ex-Major, an Ex-College Professor, a bookstore manager, and a college student have in common? Has fate brought them all together to rekindle some old flames or to start an entirely new one?The Time Is Now is a short, sweet, unusual, un-cliched, and a mature love story. With just four main characters and one locale, the story is like a leisurely walk around the park on a pleasant summer evening that relaxes you and recharges you at the same time. It is sure to leave you with a mirthful feeling in the end and possibly moist eyes too.
