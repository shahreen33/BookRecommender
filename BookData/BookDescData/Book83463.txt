A Monstrous, Mystical Thriller. In the fog enshrouded, mysterious Grey Canyon, loggers Jason Ibsen and Sam Kloss fall the wrong tree and unleash a primordial violence into the Oregon wilderness. Amongst the floored redwood tangle an object about five feet long and three across lay entwined. It was fresh fir branches, but somehow crisscrossed and tightly interwoven. Jason reached to touch it and both men jumped back when it moved slightly. He picked up a stick and lifted one edge. "Oh hell," Sam said, "it's a baby bear. I told you something was up there." It was small, black furred, face down and barely breathing. Jason put the stick under one side and lifted it toward him. "Oh God, Jason! Not a bear!" They looked down at a face. A dark face with open eyes and blood seeping from its nose and mouth... Join with Michael, a man seeking to spark his restless spirit by camping the woods and visiting old friends, and ride with Nicole and Ian, college sweethearts on a mission to save the trees in their beloved forest. They will encounter the mythic, giant man-beast of the deep woods, finding themselves in a primitive, terrifying battle for survival.
