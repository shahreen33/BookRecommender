 Finding my teammate in bed with my wife made the decision I had been fighting with for years easier. It’s time to move on. A fresh start and a new NHL team in a big city. Most importantly, it’s my son Jack’s best shot. It would be both of our best shots.

 After a bad childhood, I made sure I would succeed.The problem is I die a little with each patient I lose. It’s part of my career at Hudson Children’s Oncology Hospital, but it doesn’t make the sting of loss any easier. Seeking anything other than a life saved isn’t on my agenda until a NHL player walks into my hospital with his son. We’re officially off script the moment we meet. If this love is anything, it’s unscripted.
