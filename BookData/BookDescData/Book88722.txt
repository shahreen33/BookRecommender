Three women, one shared ambition: to join the ATS and do their bit for King and country. Bea has grown up part of a large, boisterous East End family. But her sweetheart is missing in action, and her mother is controlling her life. She needs to escape. Edie inhabits a world of wealth and privilege, but knows only too well that money can't buy happiness. She wants to be like Mary Churchill, to make a difference. Joan can't remember much of her past or her family, and her home has been bombed in the Blitz. Desperate, she needs a refuge. Each one is a Gunner Girl: three very different women, one remarkable wartime friendship of shared hopes, lost loves and terrible danger.
