"I've left clues for you, and clues for the police. They'll be searching for you. The evidence at the scene of Officer Knight's death is enough to send you both to jail."  "Who am I searching for?"  The Voice laughs. That strange, dangerous laugh. "Me, of course." *** It was supposed to be just one more ridealong, a night when high schooler Melissa Latham accompanies her father on his patrol. But when a psychotic killer targets them for a wicked game, the night turns into a high-speed chase where there is no prize for second place.  They have to find a killer before he murders the next one of their friends.  They have to find a killer before they are caught and charged for the murder of the men he's already killed.  They have to find a killerâ€¦ before he finds them.
