  In Lost Falls, nothing ever stays buried.
  
Look, I'm a reasonable guy. When the ghoul came to me, shaking and sweating and claiming that he'd been cursed, I did what I could to help. After all, as Lost Falls' resident cunning man, breaking curses is my specialty.But when the ghoul took advantage of my good nature to steal some very valuable equipment from under my nose, I stopped being such a nice guy. Now I'm hunting his ass down. Except I'm not the only one. Because the ghoul awakened something deep beneath Lost Falls. Something old. Something better left buried.And now it wants revenge.
