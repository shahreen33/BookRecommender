Bailey Hoskins has just discovered that he's a mutant. For someone who's never been special, never stood out, this could be his big moment. But as he gains entry into the halls of Xavier's School for Gifted Children, what exactly is his gift? He's used to being hated, but is he anything to be feared? Bailey struggles to find a place alongside his fellow students, but the X-Universe is a big one - perhaps Mystique will see his potential. Or could Magneto have just the mission for him? Max Bemis, front man of the band Say Anything, makes his Marvel debut with the story of a misfit among misfits, just trying to fit in. Bailey Hoskins? Worst. X-Man. Ever.COLLECTING: X-MEN: WORST X-MAN EVER 1-5
