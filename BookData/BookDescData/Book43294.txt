What if Fitzwilliam Darcy refused to approach Elizabeth Bennet when he observes her upon the grounds of Pemberley? What if Elizabeth permits Mr. Darcy to think her the one ruined by Mr. Wickham? What if love is not enough to bring two souls together? FITZWILLIAM DARCY's pride makes the natural leap to ELIZABETH BENNET's ruination when the lady appears, without notice, upon Pemberley's threshold to plead for Darcy's assistance in locating his long-time enemy, George Wickham. Initially, Darcy cannot look beyond the pain of lost hopes, but when Charles Bingley demands that Darcy act with honor, Darcy assumes the task. Even so, the idea of delivering Miss Elizabeth into the hand of Mr. Wickham leaves Darcy raw with anguish. Yet, Darcy loves Elizabeth Bennet too much to see her brought low. He sets his heartbreak aside to save the woman he loves, but it is not long before Darcy realizes Elizabeth practices a deception, one Darcy permits so he might remain at her side long enough to convince the lady only in each other can they find happiness. Their adventure takes more twists and turns than does the original "Pride and Prejudice," but the reader will enjoy the devotion displayed by Darcy and Elizabeth as they bring Wickham to the line in Lydia Bennnet's defense, as well as their working their way through multiple misconstructions and vulnerabilities. Darcy's final wooing of Elizabeth brings two very private individuals to a very public declaration of their love.
