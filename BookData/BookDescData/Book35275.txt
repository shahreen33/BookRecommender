This is a wacky story from the author and illustrator of The Teacher from the Black Lagoon, The Principal from the Black Lagoon, The Gym Teacher from the Black Lagoon, and The School Nurse from the Black Lagoon.When the class plans to visit the library for the first time, the students prepare themselves for the worst -- a dark dungeon of rules and misery, run by creepy monster-like creatures who laminate children if they even whisper. Imagine their surprise when they are welcomed to a warm and friendly place, where a smiling librarian invites them to explore some of the fun and funny books they have to offer.
