Kidnapped and ripped from a life of brutality, thrown into a life of depraved pain and learning the real meaning of family.My brother is the evil incarnate, and I am molded by his hands. He has taught me every twisted desire I hold dear. My only goal is to please him. Do not think you know what happens behind closed doors because the truth will not set you free- it will only rip your insides out. Family ties can be deadly, but is it wrong I enjoy the pain?I am an Iniquity- a wicked act or thing because that is what pleases him.
