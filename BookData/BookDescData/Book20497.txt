Slowly, she fills every corner of his gloomy house with light and when she wants to leave, Aidan is no longer able to let her go. Soon his research, which was only a form of entertainment up to now, gains new meaning and Aidan desperately tries to complete it in hopes that it will keep Hazel with him. But it may already be too late because no one is given a second chance.Almost no one.*Warning: This ebook contains situations that some readers may find objectionable.This edition is no longer available.
