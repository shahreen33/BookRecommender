A part of DC Universe: Rebirth!Aquaman, the King of Atlantis, has never found a true home in either of the worlds that he was born of. In his undersea realm, Aquaman is both King and outsider. And in the surface world, he's a hero and an outcast. In this brand new series by fan-favorite writer Dan Abnett (Titans Hunt) and all-star penciller Brad Walker (Sinestro), the King of Atlantis attempts to broker a peace between Atlantis and the surface, but this noble quest might force Aquaman to finally choose whether to live his life above the waves, or below them. Plus, Black Manta makes his bloody return and seeks to destroy everything and everyone Aquaman loves! Collecting: Aquaman 1-7, Rebirth
