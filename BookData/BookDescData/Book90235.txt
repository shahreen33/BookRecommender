Set during the Panchayat regime, it is the story of a Newar girl of Kathmandu Indramaya (Garima Panta), who falls in love with Pitambar (Dhruba Dutta), from a Brahmin family. Though inter-caste marriage was not socially and culturally acceptable then, the duo get married. Also a political activist, Pitambar is then jailed for going against the Panchayat System and the king.
