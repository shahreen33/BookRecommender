A bit early to get swoony knickers but I have got them on.For Georgia, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Just when she thought she was the official one-and-only girlfriend of Masimo, he's walked off into the night with the full hump, leaving Georgia all aloney on her owney--again. All because Dave the Laugh tried to do fisticuffs at dawn with him!Two boys "fighting" over Georgia? It's almost as romantic as "Romeo and Juliet" . . . though perhaps a touch less tragic.It's time for Georgia to get to the bottom (oo-er) of this Dave the Laugh spontaneous puckering business once and for all. It's like they always say: If you snog a mate in the forest of red bottomosity and no one is around to see it, is he still a mate? Or is he something more?
