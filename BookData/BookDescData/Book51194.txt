The best of friends.Two men. One woman.A sinful playground called The Wicked Horse.I’ve been known to get my kicks at The Wicked Horse, and I have no shortage of beautiful women waiting to get a shot at me. Driven to succeed no matter if I’m in the boardroom or the bedroom, I am not one to back down from a challenge. What started as an idea has evolved into a multi-million-dollar enterprise I share with my two best friends, Avril Carrigan and Andrew Collings. Avril isn’t the type of woman to take risks in her personal life but after a broken heart and too much liquid courage, she decides the best way to get over one man is to get under another. Looking to experience all the debauchery she’s heard about, Avril makes a request—that Andrew and I take her to The Wicked Horse.The request seems simple. Friends helping one another in their time of need. But now that we’ve crossed the threshold, things aren’t as easy as they once seemed. Now I see Avril in a new light, and I suspect Andrew feels the same. As my attraction grows, I have to wonder if I made the right decision when I agreed to introduce Avril to my wicked world.Now that the lines of friendship have blurred and boundaries have been crossed, I’m not sure our friendship will survive the jealousy threatening to tear it apart.
