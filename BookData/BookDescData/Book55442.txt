Four years ago, when I left him in the dust as my car sped away, I thought I’d never have to see Nick Andrews again.That is, until I was called to my mother’s deathbed to say goodbye.I wasn’t ready to lose her. I wasn’t ready for the man who broke my heart to tell me my mother had cancer, that she only had days left to live. Seeing Nick after all this time—hot as ever and completely off limits—ripped open the scars he’d left four years ago. The pain. The heartache. With our complicated past, I wasn't sure I could let him in again. How can you love someone after they shatter your heart and leave it strewn all over the ground, only to want to do it all over again?  ~~~~I thought when she left me in the dust four years ago, I wouldn’t see Violet Moore again.That is, until she came home to her sick mother—my patient—who only had days left to live.I was the one who took care of people when they needed it the most, but here I was struggling to keep my heart rate down watching Violet lose everything that mattered to her most. And I was one of them.But I wouldn’t let her lose me again. With our complicated past not yet settled in the ground, I was going to do anything it took to have her back again.Even if it meant opening old wounds.Because there was still a fire.Under The Scars
