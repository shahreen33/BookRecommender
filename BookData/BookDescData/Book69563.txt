Read one that will make you think twice.  "There’s a blooming in my chest that spreads like calla lilies clutching at sunlight. The change is underway." From ‘Calla Lillies’ by Stephen Jackman  "Outside is black, the blackest we’ve ever seen. We look out the window for any lights that aren’t the moon, aren’t the stars." From ‘Girls’ Night In’ by Cathy Ulrich  "I’ve drunk too much. I don’t usually drink. Vodka veiled in orange juice. ‘Let your hair down, it’s a party,’ a stranger says. We share more than just a dance." From ‘1 for Sorrow...’ by Lee Hamblin  "Yesterday you were still zero, a not-person, a tiny ghost made of promises, human in the making. Today you are one." From ‘Scar’ by Victoria Richards
