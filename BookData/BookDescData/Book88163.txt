Warning! This is a taste of horror not for the squeamish...The evil begins at an ordinary house in the suburbs. When neighbors see lights burning they call to investigate, and what they find is beyond their wildest nightmares - the hideous remains of a cannibal feast.A car prowls the city at night, in search of fresh victims. In a lonely mansion diabolic house-guests are waiting for new arrivals. Now a sickening terror creeps across the country. And ancient practices of death are revived to glut the loathsome appetites of The Tribe.
