Now that I've claimed her, she's mine to protect.Cora Swan must regret the day she met me; a beast of a man, easily capable of crushing her. Instead, she gave herself to me. Mind, body, and soul. My job was to hand her over to a man I've never met, a man tasked to protect my princess. But none of this feels right. Cora is mine, and I can't leave her in another man's care. Especially a man as ruthless and violent as Javier Martin.
