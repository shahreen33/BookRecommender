Ezra Maas is dead. The famously reclusive artist vanished without a trace seven years ago whilst working on his final masterpiece, but his body was never found. While the Maas foundation prepares to announce his death, journalist Daniel James finds himself hired to write the untold story of the artist's life - But this is no ordinary book. The deeper James delves into the myth of Ezra Maas, the more he is drawn into a nightmarish world of fractured identities and sinister doubles.A chilling literary labyrinth, The Unauthorised Biography of Ezra Maas deftly blends postmodern noir with pseudo-biography, letters, phone transcripts, documents, emails and newspaper clippings to create a story like no other before it."A brilliant, genre-defying debut novel from a major new talent.. a haunting and enigmatic noir and a stylish, multi-layered biography.. a future classic." - Bryan Talbot, Eisner Award-Winning writer and artist (Grandville, The Tale Of One Bad Rat, Alice In Sunderland)
