I’ve kissed a lot of frogs, just to be covered in warts. I’ve been lied to, cheated on, and used more times than I can count. I don’t have it in me to keep going. I need a break from it all. I need time for the wounds to heal, and the scars to fade. Wouldn’t you know it’s my luck, to meet a gorgeous man, after declaring my self-imposed break? He’s charming, sexy, and determined to change my mind.I wasn’t looking for her, but when I overheard her conversation, I had to add my two cents. Within minutes of talking to her, I knew she was unlike anyone I’d ever met. Bruised from past relationships, she’s built a fort around her heart. Doesn’t she know the prince always rescues the princess?I think about her all the time. The more I’m around her, the more I want to be. I’ve made my choice. It’s her. Now, all I have to do is prove to her that I’m the difference.
