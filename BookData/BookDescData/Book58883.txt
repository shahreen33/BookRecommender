4 girls creating 1 voice . . . will anyone be heard?  Paulina, Miko, Tally, and Ivy are four extraordinarily different seventh-graders. Paulina is 100% Type A. Miko is a fashionista. Tally is a theater queen. And Ivy - well, Ivy's the new girl at school. The four girls get tossed together to create a school magazine - by girls, for girls - in a competition to get funding for a new school program. But it seems like they'll never agree on anything. And just when they begin to make headway, their biggest rival - the athletes - threatens their progress. As the four girls try to complete the first issue of their magazine, and create a corresponding blog, they start to wonder if they can get past their labels and give all the girls in school a way to speak up.
