Bestselling poet r.h. Sin, author of the Whiskey, Words, &amp; a Shovel series, presents a poetry collection that illuminates the transformative power of emotional pain.Algedonic is an aesthetic outlook on pain and pleasure. Complex emotions simplified into poetic interludes as only r.h. Sin can express. With his trademark of giving simplicity to some of the hardest of emotions, Sin reminds us all that there are often two sides to an emotional story and sometimes the pain transforms into something beautiful, something less problematic and maybe something that reignites a feeling of pleasure.
