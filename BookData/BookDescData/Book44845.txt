Feelings are messy; they're painful; they hold you back. When the going gets tough, Kyla can deal. But when the going makes her try to feel...she gets going. When she is abducted and presented as a gift to Tristan, a bored vampire prince who is destined to become something akin to a king, she has no choice but to face a few facts. Beyond facing that vampires are real Kyla has to face emotions that Tristan won't let her run from. Tristan is a gorgeous but arrogant vampire with a ravenous appetite. For ten years he hasn't had his hunger sated despite feeding constantly, looking for satisfaction.From the second their eyes lock he knows there's something different about her. When he tastes her blood, the world is turned on its axis for both of them. There are secrets, lies, and agendas at play here. Wait 'till you see where this story goes!
  Blood. Sex. Lies. Captivating suspense. Deceit. Deep, true, immeasurable, symbiotic love.
