Approaching Oblivion is a collection of short stories by author Harlan Ellison. The short stories had appeared in various magazines throughout the early '70s with the exceptions of "Paulie Charmed the Sleeping Woman" which originally appeared in '62 &amp; "Ecowareness," previously unpublished. According to the introduction, the book was originally conceived in '70 as a call to action that would contain cautionary tales from previous books. Over the next four years the book changed to include previously uncollected stories with underlying themes of disillusionment &amp; futility in rebelling. Classic examples along these lines are the dystopian "Knox" &amp; "Silent in Gehenna". Other notable stories include "One Life, Furnished in Early Poverty" which depicts a man meeting a younger version of himself as a child &amp; finding himself unable to ease the pains of childhood. The story takes place at Lathrop Grade School in Painesville, OH where the author himself attended &amp; experienced many painful encounters with antisemitic prejudice recounted in the introduction.Forward: Approaching Ellison by Michael CrichtonIntroduction: Reaping the WhirlwindReaping the WhirlwindKnoxCold FriendKiss of FirePaulie Charmed the Sleeping WomanI'm Looking for KadakSilent in GehennaErotophobiaOne Life Furnished in Early PovertyEcowarenessCatmanHindsight
