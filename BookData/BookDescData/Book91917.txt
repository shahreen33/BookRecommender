“Once upon a time there lived a beautiful princess. . .” All my favorite childhood fairy tales began that way. But, what if the princess wasn't so beautiful? And, what if no one really wanted her? This is how Princess Keita’s story begins. While she is the wisest princess in all the Two Lands and princes journey long distances to seek her advice, King Meriot cannot find a husband for his daughter. Then, a prince from across the sea arrives and asks for Keita to accompany him back to his home so they can ultimately be married. Once they depart on their voyage, Keita is haunted by dreams of an unknown man enticing her and calling her name. She also can’t seem to forget the face of her father’s guard who escorted her safely into the hands of her prince. Her journey begins to take an unexpected turn, and Princess Keita finds herself having to choose between a prince who only wants her based on rumors and his own desperation, a dark wizard who speaks to her through dreams, and her father’s guard who seems to be harboring a secret and wishes for the princess to forget him. Princess Keita’s troubles, as daunting as they may seem, are overshadowed by a threat that endangers the lands. Someone is trying to re-unite the Two Lands that were separated many years ago, which will ignite war between power hungry kings. As Keita realizes her place amongst this struggle, she begins to learn the truth about the kingdom she now calls home and the people surrounding her.
