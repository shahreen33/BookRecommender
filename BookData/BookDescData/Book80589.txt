In this concise yet information-packed book—which you can listen to on the included audio download or read at your leisure—bestselling author LOUISE HAY shows you that you “can do it”—that is, change and improve virtually every aspect of your life—by understanding and using affirmations correctly. Louise explains that every thought you think and every word you speak is an affirmation. Even your self-talk, your internal dialogue, is a stream of affirmations. You’re affirming and creating your life experiences with every word and thought. Your beliefs are merely habitual thinking patterns that you learned as a child, and many of them work very well for you. But other beliefs may be limiting your ability to create the very things you say you want. You need to pay attention to your thoughts so that you can begin to eliminate the ones creating experiences that you don’t want. As Louise discusses topics such as health, forgiveness, prosperity, creativity, relationships, job success, and self-esteem, you’ll see that affirmations are solutions that will replace whatever problem you might have in a particular area. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to say “I can do it” with confidence, knowing that you’re on your way to the wonderful, joy-filled life you deserve.
