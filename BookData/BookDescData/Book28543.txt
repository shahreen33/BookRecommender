From the sumptuous private drawing rooms of 18th-century Paris to the decadent estates and chateaus of the French countryside, La Marquise de Merteuil and Le Vicomte de Valmont hatch a long-distance plan of vengeance and seduction.Valmont is determined to conquer the famously pious Madame de Tourvel, whose husband is abroad on business. However, Merteuil has other plans. She enlists his involvement in the seduction of a young convent girl, Cécile Volanges, the wife-to-be of the Marquise's former lover. But as they race toward the culmination of their plans, events start to spiral out of control, and they realise that they might not be as in control of their hearts as once they thought.Starring:Madame de Volanges: Adjoa AndohLa Présidente de Tourvel: Elaine CassidyCécile Volanges: Morfydd ClarkLe Chevalier: Danceny EdwardHolcroft, Marquise de Merteuil: Janet McTeerVicomte de Valmont: Dominic WestMadame de Rosemond: Una Stubbs.With announcements by Simon Kane.
