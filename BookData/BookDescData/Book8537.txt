Claudia Grant has officially been called to face her trial. To stand for the Savannah Coven and complete the task that has been set for her. When the antique items she touches show her more of history than she bargained for, she realizes her special talent has taken a dangerous turn. Evil thrives in the present but is also alive and well in the past.And it's been waiting for her.Cole Lonergan is strong-minded detective, a reliable man, and a good friend. And that's exactly where Claudia wants him to stay. In the friendship category. As an established bachelor, he has no problem attracting the ladies, but when Claudia's trial begins, fate keeps pushing them together. He will do anything to help the coven in their war against the Amara, but frankly, he's not looking to settle down, either. Not just yet. Claudia keeps telling him how absolutely, positively certain she is that they aren't meant to be together. That he is not what she wants. And if there's one thing Cole enjoys more than solving a puzzle... it's a challenge from a worthy adversary.
