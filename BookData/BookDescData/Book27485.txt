STAGE WHISPERS is an omnibus collection of novellas featuring Timmy Quinn, who made his first appearance in the Bram Stoker Award-winning story THE TURTLE BOY in 2004. Over the course of thirty years, we follow a boy cursed with the ability to see ghosts and doomed to serve them, into adulthood, as he battles murderers and monstrous revenants in his struggle to find those responsible for violating the veil that separates the realm of the living from the land of the dead. From the sunlit banks of a pond in the American Midwest to a haunted, wind-ravaged island off the coast of Ireland, STAGE WHISPERS represents an epic voyage through the darkness both supernatural and all-too human. Included in STAGE WHISPERS, you'll find all four novellas in the series: THE TURTLE BOY, THE HIDES, VESSELS, and PEREGRINE'S TALE, the short story "Genesis," and a new introduction by the author.
