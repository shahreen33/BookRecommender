Four self-contained magical crimes, ripped from the streets of supernatural London. From the million-selling Rivers of London novel and graphic novel series by writer Ben Aaronovitch comes this unmissable next chapter in the saga, as PC Peter Grant faces his gruelling Detective exam, forcing him to relive the strangest cases of his career! From foling an aspiring god to confronting a Virtual Flasher, Peter's police history has been anything but conventional; whether that's chasing down 'Falcon' crimes with the aid of modern technology, or confronting timeless villainy with his magical skill-set. Does Peter have what it takes... or will DI Chopra judge him unsuitable for a badge?
