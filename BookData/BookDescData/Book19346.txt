Recalling memories of his early twenties, Eric M. Black takes us through hardships, losses, experiences of early adulthood and eventually true love. This collection of poetry describes not only the life of one young man as he moves his way into adulthood but of a soul that is tried and tried again, only to come out clean and professing love. This collection discusses what God is to an unbelieving society, what thoughts go through the minds and souls of a twenty-something generation, what is funny, what makes us happy and what is love?These poems are inspired by classical poets but also by a modern world of tragedy, apathy and hopes. These poems describe an eight-year progression from an uncertain young man to the world of business, marriage, children and beyond.
