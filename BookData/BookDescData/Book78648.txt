2018 INDEPENDENT PRESS AWARD, RELIGION FICTIONTHE WIND THAT SHAKES THE CORN is a story of genuine love, but also a story about the very human cost of nursing hatred.Nell Dugan's hatred, as well as her love and determination, are indigenous to the Irish, both Protestant and Catholic, who bring to Revolutionary America their age-old grudges against longtime domination by the English crown.On Nell's wedding night in Ireland, English soldiers abduct her from the arms of her principled Scottish Lord and throw her on a ship, slave-fodder for a West Indies sugar plantation. But Nell uses her beauty and cunning to seduce the plantation owner's stoic son who sneaks her away to pre-revolutionary Philadelphia where she agrees to marry him, keeping secret her marriage to the Scottish lord she loves, and swearing to pay back the English not only for her own kidnapping but also for her mother's hanging two decades earlier. Beginning in eighteenth century Ireland, and then set against the background of a burgeoning America, THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE CORN underscores the feistiness, heart-held faith, and courage of Scots Irish immigrants in their struggle toward individualism in America.This story is based on the life of the author’s eighth great-grandmother, who for ninety-nine years lived through it all. Of course, much is necessarily imagined. But England’s subjugation of Ireland’s people, the American Revolution, and some of the real players in both, are factually told.
