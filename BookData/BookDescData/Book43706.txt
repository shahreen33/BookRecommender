When significant events take place the dramatic scenes can be trapped inside the stone and brickwork of surrounding buildings. When a series of very specific conditions are met, those images are released – rather like old magnetic recording tape – and the whole event comes back to life. This is when people see ‘ghosts’.It is also the basis of the Stone Tape Theory and a young Scottish aristocrat, Findo Gask, and his business partner and friend, Andrew McCubbin, have discovered what it is that triggers the release of those images frozen into the stone and brick. They call their computer-based system Findo’s Mousetrap.Mousetrap was the name given to the camera used in 1835 when Henry Fox Talbot took the world’s first photographic negative at Laycock Abbey in Wiltshire in England.By applying their science Findo and Andrew are able, quite literally, to turn back the pages of history.But the drama of Findo’s Mousetrap plays out against a thoroughly 21st Century love story. Findo’s very traditional Scottish roots contrast sharply with Dympna Doyle’s Irish/American upbringing. This creates a highly charged and deeply emotional passion.Mousetrap continues to amaze as it solves a very modern robbery and relives the moment when Dympna’s grandfather lands at Ellis Island in the United States as a penniless Irish immigrant, almost 100 years ago. It solves a very British Royal mystery and captures the moment when the very first photograph was taken.Findo’s Mousetrap is a fast moving story set on both sides of the Atlantic that examines the emotional turmoils of the two central characters as they battle with their different backgrounds, beliefs and feelings for each other.But the ability of Mousetrap to rewind history and relive events as they actually happened is the strength of Findo’s Mousetrap.Join Findo and his friends on an unforgettable journey.
