Leah is still waiting for that one special guy to walk into her life. She's shy and inexperienced with men but that doesn't stop her from fantasizing about the sexy guy who owns the bike shop next door. She keeps her distance and admires him from afar...until the day he walks into the flower shop where she works and tempts her to be his Valentine.
