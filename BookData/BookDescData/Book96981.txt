The odds against reinstating the Corps are nearly impossible...but doing the impossible is exactly what an astronaut like Hal Jordan was trained to do.From creator Gabriel Hardman, the critically acclaimed author of INVISIBLE REPUBLIC, comes a soaring new epic original graphic novel in the tradition of the best-selling WONDER WOMAN: EARTH ONE VOL. 1 by Grant Morrison and BATMAN: EARTH ONE VOL. 1 by Geoff Johns!
