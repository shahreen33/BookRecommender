If you long for something more, even if you don't know what that something is, then open this profound book. The Sacred Romance is the story of our lives; it is God's story. It is His invitation to experience His unfathomable love for us. Before long, you will find yourself eagerly turning the pages to find out what happens next.The Sacred Romance strikes a chord in us because more than in any other age, we have lost touch with our hearts. We have left that essential part of ourselves behind in the pursuit of efficiency, success, and even Christian service.From childhood on, something or Someone has called us on a journey of the heart. It is a journey full of intimacy, adventure, and beauty, but like any fairy tale it is also fraught with more than a little danger. To ignore this whispered call is to become one of the living dead who carry on their lives divorced from their most intimate selves, their heart. The Sacred Romance calls to us in our fondest memories, our greatest loves, our noblest achievements, even our deepest hurts. The reward is worth the risk.
