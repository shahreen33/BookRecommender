It relates a little known but crucial episode in the Revolutionary War, one that inspired the fictional motion picture, The Patriot in 2000. With no pay and little ammunition, a small band of backwoodsmen carried on a private war with the British redcoats in South Carolina during the American Revolution. Led by Francis Marion, these guerilla fighters struck fear into the hearts of the English as time and time again they ambushed soldiers and knocked out a string of forts before disappearing mysteriously into the swamps. Marionâ€™s unorthodox tactics demoralized and terrified the Redcoats so much that they were eventually driven from the South.
