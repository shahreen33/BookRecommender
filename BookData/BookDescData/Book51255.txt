Dear Author,I had such a good feeling about this year. It’s my last; I’m on track to graduate near the top of my class, I’m working towards a degree in a field I love, and I even managed to score one of the coveted singles in the nicest upperclassmen dorm. There’s only one problem. Him. The guy whose single is attached to the other side of the connecting bathroom. The mess I could maybe ignore, it’s the singing I can’t take. Every night while he takes a bubble bath— yes, a bubble bath! It’s only a few weeks into the year and I don’t think I can take it anymore. Actually, I know I can’t. I’m gonna go over there and say something before I lose my mind!So, how’d we get from there to the picture above? And what happens after that?Photo Description: Two young men are engaged in a sweet and tender kiss. One is naked, the other wears only a towel. They seem to be in a bathroom, and are silhouetted by light from a window.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "Love is an Open Road" event.
