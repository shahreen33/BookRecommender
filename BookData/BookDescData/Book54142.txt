One Sage is dead. Five remain. For Kole, Linn and the newly-minted heroes of the Valley, their victory is short-lived in light of new revelations. The King of Ember is alive. But the man who once led his people against the forces of darkness is changed. His path now takes him to the north and a land called Center, where he intends to bring his power to bear against another would-be God. While Kole and Linn gather a small company to follow the King, another group heads for the northern deserts, intent on discovering what power the Emberfolk left buried in the sands. The Dark Months have faded, but the light cannot last. The time for hiding is over. Itâ€™s time for the World to meet the Landkist.
