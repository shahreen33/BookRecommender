The sheer variety of fly-fishing environments and experience covered in this book make it a worthy addition to a fishing library. Fishing a canyon stream with midges, Hughes teaches the basics of presentation. Fishing stair steps, Hughes covers strategies to prevent drag. Fishing bank water, Hughes teaches how to cast upstream near the bank for the trout there. Fishing slicks, deciphering whether trout are feeding on the surface of the water or subsurface, the benefits of spike camping away from the base camp in order to fish less congested waters-all are covered in the book. Readers will learn from an experienced fisherman and talented fly-fishing author, who himself admits he is still learning how to take trout.
