Cynthia “Cyn” Robinson has only ever wanted three things: the approval of her stepmother, to save lives as a firefighter, and the attention of her dream girl, Marigold Grimm.  A socialite who most of the town refers to as Grimm Falls royalty, Marigold is so far out of Cyn’s league that even dreaming about her could be considered inappropriate.  And Cyn has all but given up on her stepmother, who refuses to accept a daughter who does not delight in wearing dresses and working in her clothing boutique. Cyn tried to be that girl ever since she and her father moved to Grimm Falls, but sooner or later, she always turns back into a pumpkin.  One thing Cyn does have is her job. She’s a great firefighter, and when an arsonist strikes her beloved town, she’s ready to forget the unfulfilled parts of her life and throw herself into work – until Marigold Grimm’s beloved garden becomes the firebug’s next target.  Cyn puts out the blaze, but there’s more than one type of spark flying as Cyn and Marigold meet. Is her dream girl really within reach, or will it all go up in flames?  Cinders is a contemporary fairy tale based on the original Grimm Brothers’ Cinderella.
