December 2018, and free-spirited influencers Bo Loxley and her partner Zac are living a life of wanderlust, traveling the globe and sharing their adventures with their millions of fans. Booked to spend Christmas in the Norwegian fjords, they set up home in a remote farm owned by enigmatic mountain guide Anders and his fierce grandmother Signy. Surrounded by snowy peaks and frozen falls, everything should be perfect. But the camera can lie and with every new post, the "perfect" life Zac and Bo are portraying is diverging from the truth. Something Bo can’t explain is wrong at the very heart of their lives and Anders is the only person who’ll listen. June 1936, and 14-year old Signy is sent with her sister and village friends to the summer pastures to work as milkmaids, protecting the herd that will sustain the farm through the long, winter months. But miles from home and away from the safety of their families, threat begins to lurk in friendly faces. The mountains keep secrets—Signy knows this better than anyone—and as Bo’s life begins to spiral she is forced, like the old woman before her, to question who is friend and who is foe.
