Poor judgment: knowing better yet doing it anyway.  Flint Stone is a professional in every way.  He’s a police officer with the K-9 unit and works at Gun Barrel High as the school resource officer. In his spare time, he’s working his heart out to create a successful gym from the ground up.  He’s loved by every single person he ever encounters—student, faculty, and employees—Everyone but Camryn Elvis Presley.  The only thing they have in common is their mothers’ poor excuses for names. Period. The end.  So why is it every time she crosses his path that he has the urge to mess up her perfectly curled hair? Or unbutton a few of her prim and proper buttons?  He knows he should stay away, yet like the high schoolers he’s around every day, he has no choice but to react first and think about the consequences later.  Side note—bad decisions are made, leading to lapses in judgment that threaten both of their jobs. Yet when the time comes, neither one can seem to find the wherewithal to care. Why? Because being bad feels so good.
