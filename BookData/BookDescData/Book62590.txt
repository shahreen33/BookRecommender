He wrote on philosophy, ontology, poetry, plays, journalism, public lectures and debates, literary and art criticism, biography, Christian apologetics, and fiction, including fantasy and detective fiction. Chesterton is often referred to as the "prince of paradox". Whenever possible, Chesterton made his points with popular sayings, proverbs, and allegories—first carefully turning them inside out.Chesterton is well known for his reasoned apologetics and even some of those who disagree with him have recognized the universal appeal of such works as Orthodoxy and The Everlasting Man. Chesterton, as a political thinker, cast aspersions on both progressivism and conservatism, saying, "The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of the Conservatives is to prevent the mistakes from being corrected." Chesterton routinely referred to himself as an "orthodox" Christian, and came to identify such a position more and more with Catholicism, eventually converting to Roman Catholicism from High Church Anglicanism. George Bernard Shaw, Chesterton's "friendly enemy" said of him, "He was a man of colossal genius".Included Books:Non-Fiction:ALARMS AND DISCURSIONSALL THINGS CONSIDEREDTHE APPETITE OF TYRANNYTHE CRIMES OF ENGLANDTHE DEFENDANTEUGENICS AND OTHER EVILSHERETICSIRISH IMPRESSIONSA MISCELLANY OF MENTHE NEW JERUSALEMORTHODOXYA SHORT HISTORY OF ENGLANDTHE BLATCHFORD CONTROVERSIESTHE SUPERSTITION OF DIVORCETREMENDOUS TRIFLESVARIED TYPESTHE VICTORIAN AGE IN LITERATUREWHAT I SAW IN AMERICAWHAT'S WRONG WITH THE WORLDFiction:THE BALL AND THE CROSSTHE CLUB OF QUEER TRADESTHE FLYING INNMANALIVETHE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCHTHE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAYTHE NAPOLEON OF NOTTING HILLTHE TREES OF PRIDETHE INNOCENCE OF FATHER BROWNTHE WISDOM OF FATHER BROWNBiography:APPRECIATIONS AND CRITICISMS OF THE WORKS OF CHARLES DICKENSCHARLES DICKENSEssays:UTOPIA OF USURERS AND OTHER ESSAYSPoetry:THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE HORSEPlays:MAGIC: A FANTASTIC COMEDYPublisher: Catholic Way PublishingWe hope you enjoy this release!
