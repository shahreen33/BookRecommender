A TOUCH IGNITES. A FIRE BURNS. AND THE HEAT HAS JUST BEGUN. Deep in the cool green mountains of the Adirondacks, wounded firefighter Connor MacKenzie has come to rebuild the 100-year-old MacKenzie family cabin - and to be alone. A horrific blaze has left him scarred inside and out and certain of two things: He'll get back on his hotshot crew no matter what it takes, and any woman who ventures too close will not stay long. Ginger Sinclair has been burned by a different kind of fire. Having just escaped from a bad marriage, she's retreated to the safety of the lakeside vacation town in upstate New York to start a new life. She's done with men, with relationships, with the danger of desires that can rage out of control - until she unexpectedly encounters Connor MacKenzie. As a hot summer on the lake grows ever hotter, they find themselves sharing a cabin and a romance that will swiftly engulf them both.
