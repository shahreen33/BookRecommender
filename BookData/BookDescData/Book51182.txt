When I was nineteen years old, I was faced with a choice that changed my life.Keep the safety of what I already knew or risk losing everything with the young, hotheaded soldier who stole my heart.I chose the wrong man, and for seventeen years, I paid in tears, blood, and shattered dreams for that decision.Now, there’s a man in my house, holding a gun to my head on the order of my ex-husband—given from his prison cell. That hotheaded soldier I was too afraid to choose? He’s now a six-foot-three wall of muscle who works at the country’s most premier bodyguard agency. I’ve always wanted him, but now, I’ve never needed him more.It’s the call I’m terrified to make. I’m sure he still hates me… Even though I’ve never stopped loving him.
