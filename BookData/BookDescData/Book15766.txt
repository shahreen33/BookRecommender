In 1964, just as the Vietnam War is launching America into the horror of death and destruction, Airman Austin Mars is shanghaied in Saigon by a crooked colonel and forced to fly illicit cargo. After fighting his way out of a bloody attack at a remote jungle airstrip, Mars realizes he will be killed next time if he doesn't escape the colonel's vicious clutches. That's when he meets an exotic young woman with a plan to free him and possibly make them both rich if he can stay alive. But it means taking the kind of impossible chances found only in the darkest nightmares.
