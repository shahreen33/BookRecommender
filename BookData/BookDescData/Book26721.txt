Rio Blanco is a dying town, until a snakebit prospector collapses in the street, clutching a chunk of gold and gasping last words about the Lost Doubloon mine. Word spreads like wildfire, and a cutthroat contest to find the mother lode begins. From a beautiful Mexican heiress to a Russian revolutionary, from a love-struck Yankee tinhorn to a ruthless tycoon, this rogue's gallery of desperate characters is soon hot on the trail of the dead man's find. Driven by their passions and their lust for riches beyond their wildest dreams, they're in a race that can only have one winner. Because among them is a murderer who will stop at nothing, and awaiting them in the mountains is a mine guarded by a viper's nest of treachery few can pass through unscathed.
