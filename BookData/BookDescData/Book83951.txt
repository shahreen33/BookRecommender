'Mr. Peader O'Donnell has, as Mr. Robert Lynd truly says, brought a family to life in his novel Islanders... The curtain is lifted on the rough heroic struggle for existence of a community of Irish fishermen off the western coast, and we are privileged for a brief space to join them in their griefs and pleasures as one of themselves.. It is excellent to find a book in which there is no more straining after effect than there is in the best of Wordsworth's sonnets. There is no hint of mere cleverness from beginning to end' Daily Telegraph
