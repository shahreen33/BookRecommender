I don’t have a damn thing in common with the beautiful rich girl who walks into my bar; she’s southern class, fancy cars, and designer shoes.I’ve got a drunk for a mother, a cheater for a father, and a reputation for trouble I’ve more than earned.I look the other way, pretending I don’t notice how perfect she is. She wouldn’t give me the time of day anyway. Until she shatters that first impression and shows me she’s so much more—everything I never thought I deserved.After a lifetime of being a disappointment, I want to prove to her that I’m better than my past.We have one tragic thing in common, and the thread that binds us together will tear us apart as it unravels.Are we strong enough to break through The Bars Between Us?
