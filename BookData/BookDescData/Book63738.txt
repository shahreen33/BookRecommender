Author and pastor Craig Groeschel helps you uncover who you really are—a man created in the image of God with a warrior’s heart—and how to fight the good fight for what’s right. You will find the strength to fight the battles you know you need to fight—the ones that determine the state of your heart, the quality of your marriage, and the spiritual health of your family. Craig will also look at examples from the Bible, including our good buddy Samson.  Yep, the dude with the rippling biceps and hippie hair and a thing for Delilah.  You may be surprised how much we have in common with this guy.  By looking at his life, you’ll learn how to defeat the demons that make strong men weak.  You’ll become who God made you to be: A man who knows how to fight for what’s right. And don’t you dare show up for this fight unarmed. Learn how to fight with faith, with prayer, and with the Word of God It’s time to fight like a man. For God’s Sake, FIGHT.
