Dylan lives in a domed city. Her life is regulated by rules and routine, a life that never really knows any conflict. Her future seems written for her. In a week, she will take the final test that will decide what her role will be in society. Will she be a nurturer or a historian? Will she teach or will she lead?  She plays by the rules and hopes that she will be allowed to become a guardian, to watch over a group of children from infancy to adolescence like her own guardian, Davida. However, on testing day, Dylan is shocked when she is taken outside the dome that protects her beloved city, Genero, and told to survive three days on her own. It doesnâ€™t take much survival knowledge to know that two bottles of water and a few boxes of protein crackers will not last three days. Dylan has been brought outside the dome to die.  As she struggles to survive, Dylan learns things about herself she had never known before. Like the fact that she desperately does not want to die. Or the fact that she has the power to heal herself. And worst, she learns that there are more lies the council of Genero told her when she meets a creature she has never seen before. A boy.  As Wyatt and Dylan struggle to survive together, Dylan also begins to discover that there are those who want her dead, and others who will do almost anything to capture her. Alive.
