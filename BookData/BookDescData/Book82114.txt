***This is the COMPLETE serial, with parts 1 - 4. Now included is a BONUS story- Fobidden, Part 1!*** From NY Times and USA Today bestselling author Cali MacKay... From the moment Greyson sets eyes on Juno, he knows her for what she is—his fated mate. There can be no other for him, which poses its own set of problems when he finds her standing over the dead body of a bear shifter from a rival clan. With the dead man’s family seeking revenge, the only way to keep her safe is for them to get married, making her a protected member of his wolf pack—but that’s going to take a whole lot of convincing, especially when Juno looks panicked and ready to bolt. Juno has a massive problem and accidentally killing a man in self-defense is just the start of it. She’s still rattled after finding out about a world she never knew existed, especially when she’s hiding a huge secret of her own. Though Greyson is sexy and sweet, and she could really fall for him, sticking around just isn’t an option, since she’d only be putting him in danger. And marrying him? That’s definitely not a solution to her messed up life. With Juno’s life on the line, can Greyson convince her to take a chance on him, knowing he’ll not only keep her safe but make her happy or will she risk it all to keep him from the curse she has no control over?
