I couldn’t do broken. Broken is what he was. Broken is what I will always be.To his eyes, that held so much despair, I couldn’t look for long. To his fist, that clenched so tightly, like he was locking away the sorrow. To his lips, that never uttered a word, from the years of heartbreak. And despite it all, I couldn’t stay away from him. It was like he was drowning in an ocean, and I wanted to grab his face, and whisper to his lips, “Don’t forget to breathe.”This was how I fell for a man. A man who was so lovesick, I was afraid he would drown me in that same ocean he was lost in.***Standalone***
