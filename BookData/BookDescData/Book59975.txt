"Battleship Scientology: Exposing L.Ron Hubbard's Dangerous Religion" contains 33 articles (&amp; over 50 photos) from Tony Ortega's popular blog ("The Underground Bunker) with intros to the 5 sections by Paulette Cooper ("The Scandal of Scientology." )  At last two of the best-known Scientology exposé writers team up to tell the whole story... from Scientology celebrities, (and how the church uses and abuses them) to the Sea Org (Scientology’s highest level where members who join sign billion-year-contracts to work for them throughout their entire lives) to mysterious deaths, to fair game (from the viewpoint of the attackers as well as the victims) to how Hubbard got some of his (weirder) ideas, to Scientology today (including signs of their decline) and much more.  This book was written for people who (think they) know just about everything there is to know about Scientology, to those who know nothing; the stories range from early Hubbard to what is happening today. The chapters were chosen to appeal not only to former Scientologists, but also never-Scientologists, as well as to people who never bought a single book of theirs to those who spent most of their lives [and some believe, even their past lives] in it.  The 360+ pages and photos reflect not only that what's interesting, but also what's important in understanding what has happened in this church, right down to what's happening today.  Tony Ortega has been chronicling events in Scientology since the early ‘90’s and Paulette Cooper wrote the first major exposé of Scientology ("The Scandal of Scientology") in 1968. She then spent the next 15 years exposing them while they went after her with vengeance. This is chronicled in Tony's first book, "The Unbreakable Miss Lovely."
