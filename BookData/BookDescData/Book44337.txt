A disgraced athlete. A tortured soul. A man betrayed. This is NOT your typical fighter story. In this arena where fame and glory are at stake. One man seeks to find the humanity he once possessed. He fights not for honor but for redemption. He lives by these rules. Break. Bleed. Fight. Live. For love.
