The actions starts in the first paragraph and doesn’t stop until the last with no slowing down." ~ Tony-Paul ('A Splash of Scarlet' Blog)."‘Star Wars’ meets ‘Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon’ is a fine description of Veterans of the Psychic Wars, as long as you realize that the hero isn’t a wimp like Luke Skywalker and that the amazing warriors of Crouching Tiger would be toast before this story hits its stride." ~ Clayton Clifford Bye (Professional Reviewer)."‘Veterans of the Psychic Wars’ is a ‘heroic monomyth’ as described by Joseph Campbell in his book ‘The Hero with a Thousand Faces’; as such, fans of ‘Star Wars’, ‘The Matrix’, or ‘Dune’ should enjoy it. I highly recommend this book." ~ The Dark (Smashwords Reviewer)“Veterans of the Psychic Wars was a real thrill to read… It has everything a good story should have with various sub-plots, conflicted characters, interesting twists and edge-of the seat alien encounters.” ~ Sonya Iovieno (Amazon Reviewer)"I highly recommend this book if you are a Sci-fi lover for it has everything you are looking for; Star Wars meets Enter the Dragon. Be prepared to be hanging off the edge of your seat wanting more." ~ Rayven ('Darkiss Reads' Blog).“This is a well written and well thought out book… [It has] some of the imperialistic feel of Dune (Frank Herbert), the ideas from the Matrix (training within dream worlds), the Primes within the Talents (Anne McCaffrey), and the technology of Babylon 5 and Star Wars.” ~ Mike Thompson (Amazon Reviewer)“I was thrilled to come across Veterans of the Psychic Wars. It really is a sweeping, old style space opera in form, but with a depth of detail and personality development beyond anything I have read in a long time… The evolving personal interactions, not always positive, between friends, mentors and ambiguous allies old and new all serve to ground the narrative convincingly. It also has to be said, the ultimate enemies here are stomach-churningly gruesome.” ~ Oana (Amazon Reviewer)About the Author:Wayne Gerard Trotman is a British writer, filmmaker, artist, photographer, composer and producer of electronic music.
