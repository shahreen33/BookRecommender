The truth shall set you free.My name is Calla Price and I’m drowning.My new world is a dark, dark ocean and I’m being pulled under by secrets.Can I trust anyone? I don’t know anymore.The lies are spirals. They twist and turn, binding me with their thorns and serpentine tongues. And just when I think I have it figured out, everything is pulled out from under me.I’m entangled in the darkness.But the truth will set me free.It’s just ahead of me, so close I can touch it. But even though it shines and glimmers, it has glistening fangs and I know it will shred me.Are you scared?I am.
