When Bekki gets asked to work in a salon on a cruise ship she jumps at the opportunity and asks her best friend Sammy to join her. They are excited to be going on a cruise together especially since Sammy and Morrisâ€™ relationship is in murky water.  The last thing Bekki and Sammy expect is one of the staff on the cruise ship to be murdered. With the ship out at sea and the murderer still at large Bekki goes searching for the murderer. But is the case as clear cut as it seems.  Has Morris lost interest in Sammy and moved onto someone younger? Will Bekki and Sammy ever get back on dry land? Or will this be their final voyage?  **This is book 10 in the Bekki the Beautician Cozy Mystery Series but they do not have to be read in order**
