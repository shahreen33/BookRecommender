Every year Jack Creed returns home for one night. Unhappy as a vampire and forever stuck at age 17, he dreams of a life without fangs. So when a freak event gives him back his mortality, he sees it as a second chance to be normal. But what's normal about a werewolf English teacher, a girlfriend who is the werewolf hunter, and a brother that can't decide if he should welcome Jack home or stake him through the heart to be on the safe side?  Vampires just got fun again.(Alternate cover edition can be found here.)
