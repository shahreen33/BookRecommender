Ready to wear. . .Nightmare!!!Have you ever been sent far away from home, all alone to a place you've never known? Where the wind wears phantom pants and very ugly ties. Well, that's just the spot Patricia and her brother Sam found themselves in one bright sunny day. It was bad enough that they had to stay in a strange city with their even stranger aunt, but when they find that dusty trunk full of old clothes--they travel back to a time tailor-made for terror! It's a fashion flashback wrapped in a frightening mystery and nothing to wear by horrible hats, scary shirts, and terrible turtlenecks. Will they ever be able to look in the mirror again? BUTTON UP FOR FEAR!!!
