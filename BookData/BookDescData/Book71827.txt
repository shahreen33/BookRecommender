After a fiery disaster claims the lives of several teammates, costumed crimefighter Empowered stumbles upon an ugly little secret of the masks-and-tights business: a growing number of ill-fated superheroes have found out the hard way that, while their bodies are still mortal, their superpowers are not. Now, only our downtrodden but doggedly determined heroine can save the (semi) living superdead from a very genuine "fate worse than death," while simultaneously grappling with the challenges of vengefully vacationing ninja clans, car-trunk carpet burn, superhero-fantasy-league drafts, excessive bedroom chatter, and deals with the devil both figurative and literal! All this, plus Emp's not-so-secret origin is revealed at last! From Adam Warren - writer/artist of the English-language The Dirty Pair comics (the original "Original English-Language Manga") and writer of Livewires, Gen13, and Iron Man: Hypervelocity - comes Empowered, a kickass long-john lampoon that flies to new heights of hotness and hilarity.
