Librarian's Note: this is an alternate cover edition for ASIN B00QOSJZJO.It is the wedding day for Poppy Shillington, a young, American woman. Everything is perfect: the white dress, the veil, the orchestra, except for one thing. Who is the groom? She stares into the mirror in her dressing room, and reminisces about her relationships with the three men she dated in her twenties: Dax, Mike, and Simon. A good-looking guy with bad manners, a straight-forward sensitive soul, and an adoring intellectual.  She remembers the passionately devastating trip to Paris, her humiliating adventures in the Great Outdoors, and a traumatizing game of Scrabble with the in-laws. As she shares the embarrassing, funny, and romantic stories of each man, it becomes increasingly challenging to predict which man she will end up with. This is another romantic comedy filled with flirting and fun by Sophie Sloane.
