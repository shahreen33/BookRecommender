I never thought the vengeance I so desperately needed would be the reason I ended up in a place like this. A place I didn’t need to be. I’m Damon, world class MMA fighter, and I was at the top of my game when he stole her from me - my light, my sunshine. He had to pay for his crimes. But now I’m stuck in rehab, while he plays the victim, waiting to swoop in and steal my Number One title. I am who I am, I don’t need to be here. But maybe someone else needs me to be.  Love can be found in the strangest of places.  Rehab is not the place for me - Ford Matthews. I never thought I would end up here. Sure, I loved the thrill of placing a bet, but I didn’t have a problem. At least, that’s what I thought. Little did I know that with each bet I placed, I moved ever-closer to destroying my life - and all those in it. Now I’ve been forced into rehab to get a handle on the addiction. Who knew that in taking this path I would find the one person who sees the real me. A person that would make me be honest with myself and realise that defeating the odds will make me a better person.
