This charming, best-selling board book introduces eight adorable baby animals, featuring high-contrast black-and-white illustrations perfect for babies from birth to age two.  Research has shown that infants respond more readily to contrasting black and white images, making this book an ideal choice for the youngest of eyes. Up-close images of a playful Dalmatian puppy, a cuddly panda cub, a striped zebra, and other loveable animals grace each page. A final two-page spread completes this charming book with a clever surprise.
