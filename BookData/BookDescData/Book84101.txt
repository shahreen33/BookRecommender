  One charm bracelet. Three generations of women. A whole world of precious gifts waiting to be discovered. . .
Lose yourself in the magic of Viola Shipman's The Charm BraceletOn her birthday each year, Lolly’s mother gave her a charm, along with the advice that there is nothing more important than keeping family memories alive, and so Lolly’s charm bracelet would be a constant reminder of that love. Now, seventy years old and starting to forget things, Lolly knows time is running out to reconnect with a daughter and granddaughter whose lives have become too busy for Lolly or her family stories. But when Arden, Lolly’s daughter, receives an unexpected phone call about her mother, she and granddaughter Lauren rush home. Over the course of their visit, Lolly reveals the history of each charm on the heirloom bracelet and, one by one, the family stories help them to reconnect in ways that bring each woman closer to finding love and passion, faith and forgiveness.“Readers will be charmed.” —Good Housekeeping
