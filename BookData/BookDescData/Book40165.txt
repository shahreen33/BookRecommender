Building a DevOps culture requires more than installing a configuration management system, using a source code repository, and telling your teams "Ok, now we are all doing DevOps." Organizational culture is comprised of a shared set of values and behaviors. Tools help us create process, which in turn influences our behaviors. Unfortunately, tools alone aren't enough to create a stable culture for collaboration that we now think of as DevOps. Building, or in many cases rebuilding, our team cultures to reflect changing goals and values is a challenge faced not just by teams transitioning to DevOps, but by organizations large and small as they try to keep up with current business practices and customer expectations. This article outlines strategies for building a DevOps culture, including aligning incentives, defining meaningful and achievable goals, and creating a supportive team environment.
