Former Major League baseball player. A guy who now hangs out on his farm, sweaty and shirtless, as he nurses a shoulder injury.If the rumors are true, he also likes to work up a sweat behind closed doors. A total MVP in the sack.Just the take charge guy I’m looking for.With Luke and I, it’s game on. And it’s all good until Luke decides he wants forever, and he wants it with me.I’m just not convinced I can trust Luke. Will he keep playing the field? Or is he really ready to hang up his cleats for good?SOUTHERN PLAYER is a full-length, STANDALONE romance that will release on February 28, 2019!
