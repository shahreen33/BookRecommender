Starship Repo is a fast-paced romp through the galaxy from Patrick S. Tomlinson.Firstname Lastname is a no one with nowhere to go. With a name that is the result of an unfortunate clerical error and destined to be one of the only humans on an alien space station. That is until she sneaks aboard a ship and joins up with a crew of repomen (they are definitely not pirates).Now she's traveling the galaxy "recovering" ships. What could go wrong?
