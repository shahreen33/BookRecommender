Having championed an ancient darkness and brought calm to the Far East, Dorian Benoit is enjoying peace at last. Life has not been easy for the young hero, and serenity is an increasingly rare commodity for those of his kind.Supernatural beings often lead a tumultuous existence, but their human counterparts could argue the same. Mortals live such fleeting lives, which are filled with violence, turmoil, and adversity. Each new generation has its own share of issues, and none of them are unique. History repeats itself—this much we know—but why is the most intelligent species on Earth so slow to learn from its past?Deep within us all, there is a fire: raw, primal, and unyielding. It cannot be tamed, and it should not be. This fire is our passion—our driving force—which, when channeled, can unlock a wellspring of creativity or a superhuman compulsion to thrive. But this flame has more to offer than the inspiring embrace of its warmth. When left unchecked, our passions can disfigure us. Feeding these flames with aggression and vitriol can cause a backlash that no longer empowers but consumes all it touches.Dorian’s days may soon be over, as the world around him begins to ignite in an inferno of hatred. Human terror campaigns run rampant, claiming large swaths of victims across the globe and threatening even the mightiest supernaturals. With Dorian’s own flame only recently rekindled by the promise of peace, will he be able to extinguish the rising hostilities before they raze all he loves to the ground? Or will he, too, be swept up in the madness?
