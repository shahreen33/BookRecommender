T'Challa, chieftain of Africa's Wakanda nation, is known to most of the Marvel Universe as the Black Panther and sometime Avenger. Being the Panther is more than just being a super hero, it also represents something sacred to the Wakandan people. The demands on T'Challa are great but despite his best efforts, Wakanda and its mineral wealth are dragged more and more into the public spotlight. When T'Challa comes to America, government agent Everett K. Ross is assigned as an escort. He figured it would be easy work and just tailed along with the King's entourage. However, when the bullets start flying and the super-villains come calling, and political intrigue is discovered back home, Ross is in for the adventure of a lifetime. The Client, Ross's description of the Panther, befriends the befuddled agent but that may not be such a good thing.
