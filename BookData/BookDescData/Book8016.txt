I Know an Old Woman Who Swallowed a Fly is a classic children's folk song. The original author is unknown, but it has been sung and retold many times and many ways. This picture book beautifully illustrates the original version. Nikki Smith combines watercolor, collage, and graphic design to illustrate the animal chase. Children will love to read and sing along with this book, but will we ever find out "why she swallowed the fly?" FULL INTERIOR PREVIEWS AVAILABLE AT www.NikkiSmithBooks.com
