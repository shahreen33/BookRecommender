   Nothing is certain in Araxes. Not even death. 
Stolen from the widow’s clutches, master thief and ghost Caltro Basalt must learn new ways to survive the cutthroat society of the Arctian Empire. His one hope for freedom and justice? A gift from the dead gods, who continue to beg for a saviour.“This book swings for the fences with a potent mix of political backstabbing, religious symbology, and tense action.”– Adam Weller, Fantasy Book ReviewBreaking a soul takes time, and Caltro’s spirit is far from broken. Many try to weave him into their plots, but he is set on salvation by no means but his own.“A heavy hitter, this follow-up to a gruesome, sometimes funny, and riveting tale, Grim Solace is a runaway winner.”– GrimmedianAs Caltro finds himself ever ensnared in Araxes’ cruel games, Nilith fights to survive the Dune Plains in her quest for redemption, Sisine continues her game of claiming ruler, and Temsa works toward his reign of chaos, one noble at a time“A brilliantly grim and funny follow up to Chasing Graves. Bring on book three!”– Laura M. Hughes, Author of Danse MacabreThe board is set. The players chosen. Who will win the great game of Araxes?————Praise for The Chasing Graves Trilogy:“Galley’s descriptive prose is simplistically beautiful.”– Fantasy Faction“There’s serious grounds here for building something spectacular.”– Emma Davis, Fantasy Book Review"To say that the concept of Chasing Graves is grimdark would be an understatement... The world building is fantastic and reminiscent of Michael Moorcock’s Elric series.”– Grimdark Magazine“Chasing Graves might well be one of the best releases not only for December but for the entirety of 2018.”– BookNest"The writing was smooth, fluid and beautiful at times. It never failed to create an awesome atmosphere. 90/100.”– The Weatherwax Report
