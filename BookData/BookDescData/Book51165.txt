I’m a bad girl.I was sent away.New house. New rules. New school.Change was supposed to be…good.Until I met him.No one warned me Principal Renner would be so hot.I’d expected some old, graying man in a brown suit.Not this.Not well over six feet of lean muscle and piercing green eyes.Not a rugged-faced, ax-wielding lumberjack of a man.He’s grouchy and rude and likes to boss me around.I find myself getting in trouble just so he’ll punish me.Especially with his favorite metal ruler.Being bad never felt so good.
