From USA Today bestselling author Willow Winters comes a HOT mafia, standalone romance.I was innocent before him, and he wanted nothing more than to ruin me. And if I’m honest, I wanted him too, even knowing I shouldn’t. I knew he was a bad man, it doesn’t take more than a single look to know it. Dark eyes and a charming smile that’s made to fool girls like me. Still, I caved; I gave into temptation. And then I saw something I shouldn’t have. Wrong place, wrong time. The mafia doesn’t let witnesses simply walk away. Regret has a name, and it’s Vincent Valetti. He won’t let them kill me, but he’s not going to let me go either.
