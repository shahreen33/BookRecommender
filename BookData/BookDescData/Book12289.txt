The inspiring account of one man's campaign to build schools in the most dangerous, remote, and anti-American reaches of Asia.In April 2011, the CBS documentary "60 Minutes" called into question Greg Mortenson's work. The program alleged several inaccuracies in Three Cups of Tea, and its sequel, Stones into Schools, as well as financial improprieties in the operation of Mortenson's Central Asia Institute. Questions were also raised about Mortenson's claim that he got lost near K2 and ended up in Korphe; that he was captured by the Taliban in 1996; the number of schools the CAI claimed to have built; and whether CAI funds had been used appropriately for Mortenson's book tours. Jon Krakauer, who had supported the CAI to the tune of $75,000, also questioned Mortenson's accounts, and released his allegations in a lengthy article titled Three Cups of Deceit.
