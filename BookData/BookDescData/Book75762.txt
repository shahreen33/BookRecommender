Featuring new character options, adventure hooks, campaign seeds, and ready-to-use villains, creatures, droids, and vehicles, this Star Wars Roleplaying Game supplement covers the classic Star Wars films (A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi), and includes material from the Expanded Universe as featured in the novels and comic books.
