Andrew Murray served as the first president of the Young Men's Christian Fellowship (YMCA), was the author of over 240 books, and was also a man of great prayer. Through his private devotion with the Savior, he learned that laughter and fellowship were two of life's most important activities. He often prayed, "May not a single moment of my life be spent outside the light, love, and joy of God's presence and may not a moment without the entire surrender of my self as a vessel for Him to fill full of His Spirit and His love." Abiding in Christ was the cornerstone to Andrew Murray's life and ministry. He writes: "Abide in Jesus: your life in Him will lead you to that fellowship with God in which the only true knowledge of God is to be had. His love, His power, His infinite glory will, as you abide in Jesus, be so revealed as it hath not entered into the heart of man to conceive."  Murray is one of the most beloved Christian authors of all time
