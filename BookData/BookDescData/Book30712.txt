Meet Christy. She's all about Palouse. She was born in the town of Palouse, in the Palouse region of Washington State. Her family name is Palus, and her father is a descendant of the Palouse tribe. Watered down to a few drops. Still, it's something she is proud of. If someone had told her that she will become a predatory lender, betray her best friend, fall in love with a thief, and help her bosses bust up the bank she works for, she would have laughed out loud. This is the summer of 2006, and everyone knows you can make a killing in mortgage lending. Christy and her BFF Megan moved to the big city of Seattle to do just that. While Megan is already dreaming of hot cars and designer clothes, "good girl" Christy's ambitions are more modest. At first! So how is it her fault that she lands in the world of subprime lending; you know, the stuff that lost families their homes and wrecked our economy? When Christy is accepted into loan officer training, she realizes quickly that she doesn't have the job unless she can pass. But before the class ends, Big Lou turns everything upside down. A new day has come to mortgage banking, and every American family deserves to own a home. With the real estate market "hotter than a hot air balloon," how can homeowners lose? Or the bank, for that matter? Hello, NINJA loans! Leaving Megan behind, Christy climbs the corporate ladder, all the way to her very own corner office. Watch her squirm, attempting to hold on to what's right while being assaulted morally from every direction. And when the bubble bursts, her world comes crashing down! Is Christy the predatory lender?
