Winner of the 2012 FutureCycle Poetry Book Prize. DEAD WENDY is a sequence of elegiac poems, reflections on broken relationships and unlikely friendships, lyrics—sung, shouted, wept—of life’s raw drama and ultimate tragedy. At heart, it is a love story. The narrative a tapestry of memories brought forth in three distinct voices as each character recounts events, the poems chronicle the last days of a young woman and the two men who loved her—and pursued her beyond death.
