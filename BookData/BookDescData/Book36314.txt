Kyle goes very quickly from being a staunch skeptic to a reluctant believer after he is attacked by an angry spirit shortly after psychically experiencing the last victims deaths. What he can’t quite figure out is why the ghost knew the name of his missing brother.   Looking for answers, and maybe a glimpse at Tyler’s fate, Kyle returns for what seems like the hundredth time, to the forest where Tyler went missing. But this time, he goes at midnight, and he brings along unwanted company.   Answers might elusive, but there is something lurking in those woods. And Kyle, along with the Stepfather he could never accept and stepbrother he could never stop arguing with, are about to find out exactly what.
