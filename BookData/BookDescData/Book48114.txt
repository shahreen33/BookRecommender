In 1889, Saskatoon was no more than a few wooden houses and false-fronted shops. There were no bridges, no railway, or even a school. There was little reason to believe Saskatoon would be much different than any other Prairie town. Saskatoon not only survived, it thrived. Saskatoon tells the story of the dreams and determination of the people that built this city into the most dynamic city on the Prairies.
