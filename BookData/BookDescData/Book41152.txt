You've probably found your way to this page because you follow reviews here on goodreads. Whether or not you've had time to write your own reviews, here's a chance to review your entire 2016 reading and post it under this title so that others can see what your reading year was like. Together, all the reviews of 2016 on Goodreads should make an interesting and varied catalogue of books to inspire other readers in 2017.For those of you who don't like to add titles you haven't actually 'read', you can place 2016 on Goodreads on an 'exclusive' shelf. Exclusive shelves don't have to be listed under 'to read', 'currently reading' or 'read'. To create one, go to 'edit bookshelves' on your 'My Books' page, create a shelf name such as 'review-of-the year' and tick the 'exclusive' box. Your previous and future 'reviews of the year' can be collected together on this dedicated shelf.Concept created by Fionnuala Lirsdottir.Cover choice and graphics by Kalliope and Matt.Cover painting by CÃ©zanne.
