 A young drifter is in deep trouble, his sister is his only hope...  Lucy’s younger brother has gone missing. When she sets out to find him, the trail takes her to Night Town. It’s a rural backwater deep in the forests of south western Australia.  Lucy tries to enlist the help of the local police, but she is met with hostility. She befriends a man who might help her cause. Yet he is not quite who he says he is.  As the locals begin to resent her presence in the town, danger quickly mounts. The town has secrets and they seem to centre on the enigmatic Samuel Nightmesser, its wealthy benefactor.  What connects her missing brother to this grim boondock? And why do the townsfolk want rid of Lucy?  As the story unfolds we are immersed in a creepy, claustrophobic drama in which everything is at stake.
