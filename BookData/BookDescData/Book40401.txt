Time travel to London, 1810 — TIME MEANT NOTHING WHEN SHE WAS IN HIS ARMS...1990 -- The vacation in London was exactly what Andrea Wells needed. Restless with her life back in Minneapolis, disillusioned with her fiancé, she found herself drawn to the sites of her favorite reading: Regency romances. As she gazed at where... more » Almack's or White's used to be, and strolled along Rotten Row in Hyde Park, she could almost imagine herself transported back some 180 years to an age of elegant balls, routs, and soirées. And as she stared up at the portrait of Richard Westmont that hung in Greythorne Court, Andrea felt a shock of recognition so intense that she forgot everything except that she had to go back -- back to Regency England, back to the man she somehow knew she was destined to love....1810 -- Richard Westmont, Viscount Grantham, was more than a little intrigued with this "cousin from America" who had turned up on the doorstep of Greythorne Court. That she was damnably attractive did not escape his notice; indeed, he was hard pressed to keep his hands off her. But the mysterious Miss Wells had a few preposterous notions -- no doubt picked up in the savage wilds of America -- such as expecting him to treat her as his equal. His lovely "cousin" would soon learn that he was not a man to be trifled with. He would get to the bottom of her background in short order -- and teach her a lesson about the proper relationship between a man and a woman into the bargain!
