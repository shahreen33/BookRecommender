A powerful and deeply moving coming-of-age drama from Carnegie Medal-winning author Tanya Landman, inspired by the life of infamous sharpshooter Annie Oakley.After the death of her beloved father, Maggie and her family are thrown into a life of destitution. With little income and no way to live off their poor land, Maggie tries to provide for her family the way her father always had – with his hunting rifle and whatever animals the forest would provide. But when her mother is confronted with her 'unladylike' behaviour, she abandons Maggie to a life of unthinkable cruelty and abuse. With no one to care for her and only the hope of escape, all Maggie can do is survive.A profoundly intimate and masterful reimagining of one woman’s fight for survival.
