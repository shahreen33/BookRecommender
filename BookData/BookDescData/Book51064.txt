ASIN B00IQEP5Z2 was re-used for the Three Book SetSERENDIPITY FALLS Romance blooms in the small town of Serendipity Falls, in the foothills of Mammoth, California. There’s a wedding a month and divorces are non existent. Out-of-towners are flocking in on weekends to visit, and perhaps find love, speculating on whether it’s the natural spring water or something in the air. Whatever it is, they hope to find it. Tara Reynolds is a new pastry chef for the mountain resort, and love is the last thing on her mind when she arrives for the winter, but the handsome Olympian skier who owns a local bar has become quite irresistible. Can the mysterious forces in the town unite this couple who are fighting it every step of the way?  WEDDING FEVER  Mila O’Reilley owns Wedding Fever, a bridal boutique in Serendipity Falls Mall. She sells more than dresses, she sells dreams along with the belief in happily-ever-after – a sentiment she personally doesn’t share. Chase Carlton is a young news reporter from San Francisco with big ambitions and dreams of his own. They don’t include interviewing the local residents about a love bug in their spring water, or discovering why there’s such a frenzy to rush toward the altar in this small mountain town. Can a jaded bridal consultant and a cynical news reporter uncover the true mystery of Serendipity Falls without being swept away in the madness?
