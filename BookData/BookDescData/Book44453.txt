It was the reason why he brought Allie Wallace into his life in the first place after she turned to him, pregnant with his brother's baby and with nowhere to go. He didn't expect to fall in love with her, but now that she's his, he's not going to let her go.  However, after the unexpected death of a gang member, the town descends into chaos as the leader of the Syndicate gang is on an avid search for the one responsible. And when Heath begins to take matters into his own hands to protect the ones he loves, he's torn at the double life he leads. The trust he once offered to the one woman that ever loved him is jeopardized as he begins to lose himself in a dark and dangerous world of lies.
