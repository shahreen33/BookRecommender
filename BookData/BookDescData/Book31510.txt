An omega who wants nothing to do with Alphas meets an Alpha who feels he’ll never measure up.  Myron has never fit the mold of a typical omega. For one thing, he has no interest in settling down with anyone other than another omega. When the woman he loves leaves him for a far more conventional mate, he takes a job he’s hardly qualified for just to get out of the country.  The last thing he’s expecting to find in London is a mate. Especially not the eccentric Alpha CEO of the infamous Futurus Initiative.

Meeting his destined mate leads to the revelation that he may not be a defective Alpha at all, but rather something else entirely. Now if only Myron felt the same way…  This is an approximately ~68k-word story featuring a most unusual Alpha-omega pairing. Contains steamy scenes meant for adult audiences only.
