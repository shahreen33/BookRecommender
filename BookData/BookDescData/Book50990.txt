Here is the first book in the ‘Hardcore’ Series, a seriously hot and provocative romance by Lucia Jordan, written in her signature style of high passion and emotion.  Josslyn Turner is more interested in living vicariously through the exploits of the police officers she works for than fixing her own love life. There’s just something about their stories of crime and adventure, something exciting about their power that turns Joss on. Working late one night at the station, Joss meets Vincent West, a local politician who is both handsome and enigmatic. Her attraction to him is immediate and he seems to feel the same way. They secretly become involved and new experiences soon escalate to sexual surrender as Josslyn starts to realize that she’s been hiding her true nature. But as much as Joss is excited by Vincent’s raw, dominant sexuality… is she also a little afraid of handing over too much control?  Only mature readers should download this book.
