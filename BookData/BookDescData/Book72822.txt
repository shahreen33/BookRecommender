Andy must now not only locate the second ingredient, but also retrieve the stone. Will he make it in time to save the King?"LRW Lee has constructed a wonderful world full of adventure, daring deeds, and remarkable action tempered with the right dose of humor. This wildly addictive series will entertain middle grade students, who, like I, will anxiously await the release of book three."                                                       - Sue Morris, Kid Lit Reviews"There is a strong good versus evil theme underscoring the plot making it a clean story with no bad language but lots of exciting action and suspense. If you adore fantasy books with a medieval theme including knights and dragons, this story definitely fits that bill."                                                       - Wayne S.
