“Why haven’t we had sex?”When Jesse Gunn one of the biggest stars of World Class Wrestling voiced that million dollar question, yet again, I was stunned. After countless times of turning him down, I thought eventually he'd give up.Unexpectedly thrown together for a work project, my mind went to places I’d never allowed. Dirty places where sweaty, naked bodies take center ring and names are rasped out in the heat of the moment.Now, my time is spent wondering if a certain part of him could possibly live up to his last name, distracting me from my full time job - as his boss.Can I continue to keep things professional or will I give in and tussle? Tussle is a full length sports romcom.
