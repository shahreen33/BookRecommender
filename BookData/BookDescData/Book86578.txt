For the last six months, shy, nerdy, English teacher Carter Bennett has been crushing on the brand new PE teacher.It doesn’t matter how many months in the school year there are, Carter knows that cool, laid-back, college baseball star Nolan returning his feelings is hopeless.Until they’re both called in front of the Principal and given an impossible task: take over the spring musical from the MIA choir director.Carter knows all about literature and plays, but had to give up his college theater major because his shyness was too crippling. Nolan knows even less. But despite lapses in choreography, terrible acting, a complete lack of sets, and costumes from the eighteenth century, they’re going to have to hit all the right notes, together.
