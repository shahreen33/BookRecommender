Regarded by literary historians as the play that signaled the start of modern Mexican drama, this enthralling play is set in 1930s post-revolutionary Mexico and was censored by the Mexican government in its first years of the late 1940s. It centers around César Rubio, a failed history professor who is mistaken for a missing revolutionary hero by the same name, but instead of an error he sees an opportunity and attempts to capitalize on the other man's fame. He quickly becomes disillusioned with his new false identity and gets swept up in a campaign for governor, leading him to realize there is more to politics than famous names and just exactly what happened to the real César Rubio.
