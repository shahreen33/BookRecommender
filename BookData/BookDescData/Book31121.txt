  For fans of the Zombie Apocalypse genre, Cat’s Eye will have you holding your breath and fearing for the life of Catherine, a teenager with more guts than most and a will to live stronger than Death.
Cat’s life is pretty predictable, much like any other teen girl’s, until the short walk home from school becomes a battle for her very survival. In a single breath, everything she knows is torn away, and her world is overtaken by a tidal wave of rot. She embarks on a harrowing journey to search for the one person that means the most to her. The very same person she might have to abandon if she wants to live.
  A Zombie Apocalypse Short Story and the first book in the Death’s Children Series, a chilling look at the outbreak through the eyes of kids and teens.
