Out of the Frying Pan...  When one of Sara's new friends and a fellow competitor in the broom flying competition is killed, Tina and the squad are immediately on the case. After all, the Chief Enforcer in Desert Plains seems more interested in his town's reputation than actually finding the killer. And with Tina honing in on the identity of her coven, she finds that she's getting more questions than answers.  Tina's trying to convince herself that everything is fine, even as she feels like she's wading through a minefield. And how are the citizens of Western Woods going to react when they find out she and Kyran are seeing each other?  Will Tina be able to find the killer - and unlock the secrets to her own past - before the killer decides she's getting too close to the truth?  
  Five Charm Fire is the fifth book in the Western Woods mystery series of full-length, humorous paranormal cozy mystery novels.
