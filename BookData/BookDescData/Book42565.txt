In this volume, a surgeon implants part of Tomie's regenerating anatomy into a young patient, with macabre results. In "Painter," Tomie becomes the object of competition between struggling artists looking for the perfect muse. Their art suffers, among other things. "Murder" is a (relatively) whimsical story of a hapless young man who must house a particularly demanding piece of Tomie while she is regrowing.
