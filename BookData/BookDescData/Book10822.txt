Craig Claiborne – A fascinating work, an indispensable volume for anyone who cares about Italian cooking. The variety is extraordinary! One of the finest Italian cookbooks ever to appear in English. … Mrs. Hazan not only introduces a wide range of unusual new regional dishes, but she persuades the American cook that the essence of her native Italian cooking lies in the are of Italian eating. She shows how no one course dominates, how meals have a natural flow, how dishes are designed to complement others, and with each recipe she offers a variety of menu suggestions so that the American cook can create a perfectly composed dinner and enjoy it the way Italians would.
