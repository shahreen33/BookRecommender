Hap and Leonard may never go fishing again.  A rustic get-away turns into a life or death dash through an East Texas cypress swamp.  They encounter a victim of camo clad hunters that classify sport in a whole different way.  A head start is as fair as it gets as Hap and Leonard are thrown in the woods and must run for their lives. Their wise-cracks may be sharper than the hunter's arrows, but not as deadly.
