France’s leading nutritionist Dr. Jean-Michel Cohen pinpoints why you struggle with weight loss diets and offers a plan for achieving your ideal weight while embracing life’s pleasures. Dr. Jean-Michel Cohen, France’s most popular dietician, has helped over two million patients worldwide reach their ideal weight and stabilize long term, all while savoring healthy, balanced meals. His progressive three-step weight loss plan includes 325 easy-to-prepare recipes, helpful hints, and practical checklists to get the weight off and keep it off. Strongly opposed to "extreme" diets and the inevitable weight gain that ensues, Dr. Cohen proposes a holistic approach that addresses the physical, psychological, and cultural factors that impact our ability to control our relationship with food. Once we understand our behavior, it’s easy and rewarding to see the pounds melt away. His diet proposes food substitutions to adapt recipes to your personal preferences and allows you to indulge in the occasional craving as long as you compensate beforehand and afterwards. With Dr. Cohen’s foolproof supermarket tactics and the diet’s inherent flexibility, you’ll find it easy to continue until you reach your goal weight, losing up to 30 pounds in three months. The simple, delicious, and satisfying menus offer a wide variety of choice, and emphasize the best-practices of the French way of eating, from using fresh produce, to balancing your intake throughout the day, to the pacing of mealtimes. The Parisian Diet is not a flash-in-the pan diet, it’s a new approach to food and a way to celebrate life, helping you look and feel your best.From the Hardcover edition.
