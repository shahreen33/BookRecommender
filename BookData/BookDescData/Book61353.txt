"God knows I've put up with your shenanigans...""It isn't what you've done," Lam told her, "it's what I've done.""What have you done?""I've got in a jam where I'm going to lose my license.""You sound as if you've been talking to the police.""They've been talking with me," said Donald."I see," Bertha said; and then added after a moment, "I'ma cantankerous old bitch, but I don't leave a partner on a sinking ship. Now, use that noggin of yours to get this thing straightened out."
