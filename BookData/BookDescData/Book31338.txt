It's all fun and games until someone loses a hand.Dixon has been dying to introduce Yuri to Uncle Fonzo, the Hand of his family, and now he'll finally get that chance. All they need to do is meet him at a traveling carnival with an unused piece of Spellcraft. Easy peasy, right? Not even a little. And even worse, they might encounter a clown.Uncle Fonzo has left a trail of magical destruction in his wake, but he claims he's been helping people. Spellcrafters are a slippery bunch, and it's hard to say if he's stretching the truth or telling an outright lie. One thing's for sure, he's between a rock and a hard place now, and if he doesn't deliver an outrageous ransom to Strange Manor by midnight, all deals are off.From a lackluster carnival with a booby-trapped tour bus to the decrepit mausoleum behind an old mental asylum, the Spellcraft leads Dixon and Yuri on a goose chase that's not only wildâ€¦but deadly.
