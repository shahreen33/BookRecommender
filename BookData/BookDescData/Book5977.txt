“I’d seen enough of Creed Gentry to know he might be the worst thing I could do. Yet one lustful glance from him scrambled every piece of sanity I owned.” Truly…My life hasn’t been uneventful and a few things should have sunk in by now. I’m a tired age twenty one with a laundry list of heartbreaks. Most of all I know what carnage comes from carelessly risking the heart. So what drives me to jump into bed with a brooding player who can barely carry a conversation? It was supposed to be just one night. One night of weakness, of passion, of every impulse I’d struggled to contain. Yet I can’t stop myself from going back for more. Creed…Violence had always found us Gentrys but this time I’d put the price on my own head. It was my cross to bear. No flinching allowed. There was only room for me, my brothers, and the resolve to survive. That’s all there ever had been. There was certainly no reason for more than than a quick and dirty time with any girl, no matter how much she turned my head around. I shouldn’t hold on to her for more than a few hours. I shouldn’t even think about it. This thing could finish us both. It doesn’t matter. She’s all I want.Warning: This book contains explicit language, sexual situations, and violence that may be upsetting to some.
