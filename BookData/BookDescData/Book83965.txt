Mystical, gentle, magical . . . as if. You’ve obviously never seen a unicorn in his natural habitat—those guys are jerks. Cartoonist C. W. Moss reveals the less-than-wonderful side of the world’s most wondrous creature in his hilarious series of single panel comics, Unicorn Being A Jerk. Take a gander at what these fantastical creatures are really like, in comics like “Unicorn Being a Stalker,” “Unicorn Trying to Peek at Breast-feeding Woman’s Nipple,” “Unicorn Denying the Holocaust,” and more. Readers of Moss’s online strip will love the significantly expanded book, which features what Moss describes as “a whole bunch of new illustrations,” in a collection perfect for fans of The Book of Bunny Suicides, Cyanide &amp; Happiness, Penny Arcade and The Truth about Chuck Norris.
