A perennial favorite. This short treatise outlines the history of the Bible in complete, yet simple terms. Shows how the Catholic Church has determined and proclaimed through her infallible rulings just which books are actually part of Sacred Scripture, and how she has preserved and maintained the Bible throughout the centuries. A real eye-opener, especially for anyone who thinks the Bible is a Protestant book.
