Eff This Meditation is a Shamata (mindfulness-awareness) practice rooted in radical compassion for self presented in 108 tips, tricks, and ideas. They are all centered on the idea that, as humans, we might not be "finished"; but we are complete. Everything you need to attain enlightenment is already contained within you—and you can use meditation to connect with it. Yes, yes. You already know that you should meditate, and that meditation will make you happier and healthier. But you're tired and irritated and every time you try to meditate, your mind races and you can't stop thinking about that jerk at work. You've tried meditating, but are pretty sure that you're bad at it. If this describes you, then this might be just what you need. This is not a joke—this is real meditation, for real life. Using humor, love, and a deep respect for the foundational teachings of Buddhism, Eff This Meditation is a practice designed to get you out of that storm swirling around in your head, and into your throne (if even for a moment). Learn to celebrate the small victories in life with a "To Done" list. Release yourself from phone addiction with a digital detox plan. Get your body out of stress mode by practicing diaphragmatic breathing. Be transported and open your heart with a pick-me-up playlist. These are just a few of the simple strategies that will help you find your center. Take any path into the practice that works for you.
