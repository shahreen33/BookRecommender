When a tea leaf reader, Rose, is performing readings at Sage Gardens, Samantha is too curious to resist and arranges a reading for her and her three reluctant friends. But it is not smooth sailing when a reading goes horribly wrong.  Then things go from bad to worse when someone is murdered. The ‘Sage Gardens Sleuths’ cannot resist a good mystery and they decide to see if they can put together the pieces of the puzzle and find the murderer. But their investigations lead them down a path they didn’t expect and they land up in hot water.  Did Rose predict the murder? Did something that Rose saw in the tea leaves cause this disaster? Or was it all an elaborate ruse that ended in murder?
