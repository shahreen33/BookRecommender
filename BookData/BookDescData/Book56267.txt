Librarian's Note: this is an alternate cover edition for ASIN B00QORX032.Daisy, a young, American woman, has moved to Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England. Amidst the hustle and bustle of the town centre at Christmastime, she rather clumsily falls to the ground. She looks up to see the most handsome face she had ever seen. Nate. It was love at first fall. He is a gardener at Friar Park, but things donâ€™t seem to add up, as he is constantly jumping into black sports cars, using code names, and hiding her from his friends. At other times, he is the perfect gentleman; wining and dining her at fancy restaurants, zipping around on their scooters, and wooing her with his British wit and banter. Will he tell her the truth, or will she end up alone at Christmas? This is another romantic comedy filled with flirting and fun by Sophie Sloane.
