A fresh beginning. A new threat. A Reverse Harem Paranormal Romance.   Elizabeth is finally safe, tucked away in the lair of her four dragon protectors. Now, she must learn to cope with the grief of losing her parents, her home, and the Southeastern White Tooth Pack, including a wolf her heart still yearns for.  Her four dragon protectors might keep their distance while she mourns, but they make it clear they desire her completely. Body, heart and soul. Despite her grief and the guilt clawing at her heart, Elizabeth’s feelings for the four men grow. She can see the future they are offering her. A fresh start... with them.  But a new challenge arises when the Shifter Authority forbids their relationship. The Authority claims wolves can’t mate with dragons, and certainly can’t conceive dragon babies.  Refusing to give Elizabeth up, each man is prepared to fight any battle to keep her and to prove that she’s their fated mate. They embark on a quest to find a legendary dragon. The dragon is rumored to have defied the orders of the authority, mated with a wolf and sired dragon children. If Elizabeth and her men can find this elusive dragon and his family, they can prove that they are meant to be. That their union will bring about the birth of dragon children.  The journey is fraught with danger and Elizabeth must learn to trust her dragons. Her life depends on it.
