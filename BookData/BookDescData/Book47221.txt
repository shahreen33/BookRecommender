When God was a Rabbit is an incredibly exciting debut from an extraordinary new voice in fiction.Spanning four decades, from 1968 onwards, this is the story of a fabulous but flawed family and the slew of ordinary and extraordinary incidents that shape their everyday lives. It is a story about childhood and growing up, loss of innocence, eccentricity, familial ties and friendships, love and life. Stripped down to its bare bones, itâ€™s about the unbreakable bond between a brother and sister.
