Joan is a lot of things, a pie-maker, a veterinarian’s assistant, and an orphan, but she never expected to find out she was a wizard too.  But when the eccentric headmaster casts a spell to find the mythical dragon tamer, she’ll find herself with an all-expenses-paid scholarship to the worlds greatest magic academy and not only that, she has a white wolf for a familiar.     There’s just one catch. She’s caught the eye of the devilishly handsome and heartlessly cruel headmaster’s son, which, okay, isn’t that bad, assuming, of course, her pies can melt his frozen heart before he throws her to the ogre who lives beneath the school.
