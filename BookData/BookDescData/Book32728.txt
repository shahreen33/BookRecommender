“No eligible bachelor wants to marry a bluestocking…especially not those frightful Chadwick girls.” – Lady Jersey, Almacks Patroness.  Amelia’s writing was often prone to getting her into trouble. Hence why she eventually took on a penname. But it seems, once again, her unthinking need to spill out everything onto paper will land her in hot water.  After her sisters persuade her the only way to get over her love for Lord Nicholas Wentworth is to write about him, Amelia devotes hours and hours of ink to the subject. However, she never expects for Nicholas to end up in possession of this information. How could she admit her affection for him when she knows full well he is still in love with her now married sister?  To save herself embarrassment—and more importantly to keep her penname hidden—Amelia must find a way to intercept these letters, and if she cannot, she must persuade Nicholas it was all some awful jest and that she is certainly not A. Hardwick—purveyor of stories so scandalous that it would mean utter ruination for all the Chadwick girls should the truth come out.
