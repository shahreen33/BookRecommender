A Doctor in the House is the hilarious story of a young woman who gets all she ever dreamed of. Bhavna's days in medical college make her who she wanted to be. The man who makes her heart beat faster gets down on bended knee. But in the ever after, a storm begins to brew. An old flame shows up, uttering words she would have killed to hear all those years ago. Now, will they move her heart? Bhavna remembers the shy glances and the painful anticipation. No one can ever forget their first love. A generous sprinkling of mother-in-law problems, a pinch of regret, and a dash of harsh words-the cauldron boils over. Life is not like an M&amp;B nor is it a Hindi movie-all songs and happy endings. Her best friend, Monika, is facing an ugly divorce. Do all relationships end up bitter? You ride off into the sunset and then realization dawns?
