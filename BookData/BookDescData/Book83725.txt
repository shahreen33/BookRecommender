 
  The only thing more shocking than getting sold by my boyfriend? Who he sold me to...
    JUNE: Over the years with Razo, I've learned to keep my mouth shut. Learned not to fight back. Learned that talking only makes it bad…fighting only makes it worse. I shut down my feelings long ago. Because it’s the only way to survive.   But then Razo sells me…   …to a dangerous biker with zero morals and a sick upbringing. A psycho who makes me feel like I have a flock of ravens inside my stomach. He never hesitates to remind me: I belong to him now.    And he'll do just about anything to keep me.    Crazy. Psycho. Killer.   MASON: I know I'm crazy. I know I'm scary. And I definitely know I don't got no business buying some girl off a gang leader I'm supposed to be selling guns to. Fact is, her kind and my kind…we ain't never supposed to mix.   See, I know all this. But I don't care.    She belongs to me now. Don’t matter how I got her, only that I'm keepin' her. And no matter what it takes, I'm going to make her mine in all the ways that count.    Nobody and nothing is going to keep us apart.    You ready for a super intense love story?
