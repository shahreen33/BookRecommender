Three things in my life were fact. I needed Sarah to survive. I needed sex to remain sane. And I could never mix sex with Sarah.  I just knew—deep in my marrow—that if I did, I’d somehow lose her. All my deepest darkest secrets would crack open, bleed out, and ruin everything between us. I wouldn’t unleash the shit inside me on my worst enemy, let alone her. So she stayed strictly in the friend zone.  People probably thought I never went there with her because of her cerebral palsy, but f*ck them. She knew she was the most important person in my world, and I wasn’t about to risk hurting our relationship just to make my c*ck happy.  Until the moment she begged me to take her virginity. Now it’s all about to hit the fan, because how the hell do you resist the one person forbidden to you when she says please?  --Brandt Gamble  *Recommended for ages 18 and up due to explicit scenes and language* New Adult Romance, Can be read as a standalone.
