Kitten's Preparation (a carnal account of cages, cooters &amp; cleansing ablutophilia) (bdsm book 2) by Evelyn Bliss  "Come lap at this, little kitty".  Kitten's lover has left her in the hands of two lesbian mistresses for a week of training and discipline in the ways of the obedient and constantly aroused submissive feline companion. Kitty's first night in the cathouse brings a mix of experiences, from servicing her two mistresses, to comforting herself adjusting to her new caged life. But her own carnal desires bring Kitty undone and next day she must endure a thorough dressing down and cleansing ritual by her leash-holding lesbian doms.  This literature contains graphic descriptions of FF sex acts including cunnilingus, masturbation, vaginal insertion, orgasm denial, disciplining, domination, humiliation, light sadomasochism and dubious consent. It's a filthy, fun crescendo of adventure for lovers of imaginative amoral literature.  WARNING: Reader Discretion.
