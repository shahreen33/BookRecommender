First Keeper tells the story of the first Ember of the northern sands, and the nightmarish scenario that led to his awakening. It serves as a prequel that takes place roughly 15 years before the start of The Landkist Saga, and features cameos by many of the main characters whose trials are chronicled beginning with Valley of Embers.
