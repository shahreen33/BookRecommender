She believes in duty, not love…. As the illegitimate sister of the Duke of Raven, Emily knows only too well how society judges a woman like her, and what a debt of gratitude she owes her family. She also knows the vital importance of maintaining independence, and how cruel fate can eclipse good intentions anytime. Certainly she’s not going to let her head or heart get fooled by the devilishly annoying Cambridge Sinclair, her family’s protector, and London’s notorious rake… who also happened to save her life… more than once. He’s a reformed rake seeking redemption…. Cam has been intrigued by the mysterious Miss Emily Tolly for years, even though theirs is a turbulent relationship. With her family and others, she’s shy and timid, but with him, she’s anything but. He knows this kitten has claws beneath the quiet exterior and a whole lot of other secrets she’s hiding. But her passion and intelligence draw him irresistibly to her, so when he’s given the opportunity to rescue her once again, he grabs it with both hands. This rescue, though, takes the form of a hastily arranged marriage, which Cam enters into willingly for her sake and her family’s. What he doesn’t count on is the closer he and Emily get, the stronger their passion burns, and Cam finds himself wanting not just her body, but her heart too. A destiny written in the stars... It was meant to be a dutiful betrothal from the start, but it soon becomes something more. As Emily sees the real man beneath the roguish reputation, her carefully guarded heart begins to believe and hope. Dare she trust the one man who could destroy her? *All books in this series are standalone stories with an HEA.
