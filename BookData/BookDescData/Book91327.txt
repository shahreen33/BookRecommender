Defeated and down on her luck, recently heartbroken witch, Shay Graves, seizes the opportunity to pack up her daughter and moves back to the enchanted island of Spellbourne to work for her family's funeral business. With a teenage daughter about to come into her witchy powers, a family of eccentric witches only a stone’s throw away, and a job where the dead always have a say in their funeral arrangements, Shay's got her hands full. Her first job as the cosmetologist for Graves’ Funeral and Crematorium is readying the Witch Council’s High Priestess after a tragic accident. But in a strange turn of events, the ghost of the High Priestess latches onto Shay’s daughter and claims that her death was no accident. With no witnesses and no evidence, local law enforcement is less than helpful. In order to free her daughter from the whims of the callous old witch and possibly bring a murderer to justice, Shay is forced to investigate on her own. Lucky for her, she has a family of capable witches ready to help and a few new friends she can enlist. Throw in the ghost of a thousand-year-old vampire for a roommate, a cat with an attitude, and murderous mayhem brewing up all over town. If you thought your family was crazy, meet the witches of Shadow Lane.
