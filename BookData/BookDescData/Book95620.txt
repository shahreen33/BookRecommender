The supreme text of Antinatalist despair! Norwegian philosopher Peter Zapffe re-imagines the human condition as a continuing state in which the human organism has over-evolved and over-lived its own biological necessities through its over-sized, superfluous brain...Tragic lyricism and sublimation result! Something suspiciously Buddhist here as well.. (4 ignoble truths?)Fans of Nietzsche and E.M. Cioran will devour this text greedily. A short essay, but hits hard, leaving a lasting impact.Enjoy!
