"Sentenced to Shakespeare" is a contemporary young adult novel set in suburban New Jersey. The story revolves around Leah, a smart and sensitive 15-year-old girl who is pushed too far by a bully and snaps. Arrested for assault and battery, Leah is sentenced to an unusual form of rehabilitation-she must take and complete a Shakespeare workshop or else risk incarceration. Ostracized by her classmates, abandoned by her only friend, Leah finds comfort and solidarity with the other juvenile offenders in this same program, with one offering her something she's never experienced before--love."Iris Dorbian is the rarest talent as a writer--the writer with a heart of gold. Her sensitivity in creating the character of Leah, and in realistically infusing empathy into every corner of Leah's plight and growth as a person, makes this book a must-read for the pre-teen, teen and adult audience. SENTENCED TO SHAKESPEARE is an inspirational, deep, illuminating and wonderfully enjoyable read that makes you think, page by page, of what you would do if in a similar trying circumstance as this complex and fascinating character. Leah's very unique journey of self-discovery rings true on every level; it's so heartening to see a story about a young girl finding her power and strength through creative exposure and expression. Yet her growth will universally resonate with anybody who is or has ever been an adolescent feeling in over his or her head--and that's everyone. The perfect summer read for teenagers and those who support them." --- Lisa Mulcahy, best-selling author of "Building the Successful Theater Company" and "The Essentials of Theater"
