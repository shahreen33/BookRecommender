Listening Length: 5 hours and 24 minutesFrom New York Times Bestseller, Kendall Ryan, comes a sexy new standalone novel.My tempting, and very alpha friend Sterling Quinn is someone I consider off-limits.It's not just that we're friends, he's also a cocky, confident, and British, which means he's a walking aphrodisiac.But lately he's been giving me the look. You know the one. When he thinks I'm not paying attention, and his gaze lingers for too long.And then we start working together, and that's when the sexual tension between us gets so thick, I want to hack through it with a machete. I want to make all these deep feelings I've harbored for him disappear, because there's no way this can end well.The lines between business and pleasure become irrevocably blurred, and I'm stuck between a rock, and Sterling's very, very hard place.Rather than keep a level head about our growing attraction, Sterling wants to go all in, showing me just how explosive we can be together.But I've been around long enough to know that this British bad boy is more than my heart can handle. I'm not about to be cast aside like yesterday's underwear when he's done having fun.Sterlingâ€™s never been told no, and he's not about to put his ego aside and play by my rules. But I never thought he'd fight so dirty.*This is a spin-off from the HITCHED series, but can be read as a standalone.
