Twenty-five years ago, nine partners signed the Declaration of the Convention of Brussels (July 9, 1981), thus founding the EUROPEAN FREE ALLIANCE (EFA). Today, EFA is a European political party and we are proud to present the first book chronicling a quarter century of history. In a solemn session on the 11th of May (15-18h) in the plenary meeting room of the European Parliament in Brussels, EFA also looks towards the future. EFA advocates a Europe that respects more diversity and that implements subsidiarity by bringing about more decentralisation.The main focus of EFA, always was and still is, building a Europe of the Peoples, who are to have their own identity and inalienable rights. The Alliance became a political party that persues its political goals like the respect for cultural diversity by peacefull means. EFA always focussed on peace issues and on the current evolution in the Basque country EFA repeatedly declared to support this process and sincerely hopes that the weapons will remain silent forever.The Scottish National Party (SNP) and Plaid Cymru were in the nineties the driving forces behind the establishment of, respectively, the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments. In Belgium, the VU was able to exact new concessions with regard to increased autonomy for Flanders and the other regions every time the party participated in government.The solemn session will be attended by more than 500 participants coming from all around Europe. The book of the first 25 years of EFA will be presented to the public. The history and the future of EFA will be the main focus of the solemn session, where former MEPs, honorary members of EFA as well as Ministers from different regions and nations will take the floor. The agenda is enclosed to this press release.
