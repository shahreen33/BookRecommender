Redmond Grimlock is eighteen and full of himself. He’s just finished probation and is officially a full-time reaper. He’s also the on-call babysitter when his parents decide to go out for a kid-free evening, which means he has to watch his four brothers and sister (and Jerry) – all teenagers – while holding down the fort and making sure they don’t destroy Grimlock Manor. It looks to be a normal night until Redmond gets a call. It seems there’s an emergency soul that needs to be reaped and he’s the one who has to do it. Since he can’t trust his siblings in the house without a chaperone, he has no choice but to take them with him. Instead of an office building or a quiet death, Redmond finds himself at a rave in a rough neighborhood … and none of his charges will stay in the car. It’s a typical Grimlock adventure, with Aisling going missing and tripping over trouble while Redmond has to find her, collect a soul, and stay out of jail. It’s a night full of antics … and maybe a little danger. It might be one for the Grimlock record book, which is well and truly something given the trouble that always seems to find them.  Note: This is a 30,000-word short set in the Aisling Grimlock world. It’s set back and can be read at any point in the timeline.
