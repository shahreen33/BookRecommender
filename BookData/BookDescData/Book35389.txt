Touching the Rock is not a story of coming to terms with loss, but a unique exploration of that distant, infinitely strange "otherworld" of blindness. "Staggering . . . the most extraordinary, precise, deep, and beautiful account of blindness I have ever read".--Oliver Sacks, author of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.
