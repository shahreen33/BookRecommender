Her name was Kathryn Chase, sensuous and powerful lady-in-waiting during the scandalous reign of Henry Tudor. She was the friend of Catherine of Aragon, confidante of Anne Boleyn, and lover of John de Gael, sworn enemy of the English crown. As proud King Henry defied the Church to take six very different women as his brides, Kathryn was there to share their sins, secrets, and adventures, and to play her own role in weaving the colorful tapestry of English history.
