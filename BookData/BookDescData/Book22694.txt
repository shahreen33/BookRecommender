In 1664, Marquise Athénaïs de Montespan returned to the Court of Versailles. At twenty-three, she was young, beautiful, and highly intelligent, but burdened with a young son, a mad husband, and big debts.The way to power and prosperity at Versailles was through Louis XIV, well known for his susceptibility to pretty ladies. Athénaïs befriended his current favorite, dazzled everyone, and bided her time. Soon Athénaïs was a power in the glittering, dangerous court, and the sinister La Voisin, abortionist, witch, and poisoner, whispered that with a little help, Athénaïs could maintain her influence forever. With a cast of characters ranging from the royal family and their dissolute courtiers to defrocked priests and poisoners to the Police Lieutenant of Paris, All the King's Ladies captures a turbulent and ruthless and glamorous society.
