From the universe of the Until the End of the World series Book two of The City Series is here! (Note: The City Series can be read before or after the Until the End of the World series)  Months into the apocalypse, the zombies show no signs of dying, but it’s clear everyone in Sunset Park will die without enough food to outlast the undead. Add in the less-than-sociable new neighbors only blocks away, and the hunt for sustenance has come to feel more like a race than a ramble.  Sylvie is happy in her new home with the people who’ve become like family, though she’s still working out how to let them into her heart. Eric wants in, and he wants to find his sister, but he can’t do both at the same time. If he can do the second one at all—getting into the city was hard enough, getting out may prove impossible.  Despite setbacks—and a couple million zombies—it seems fortune is working in their favor. After all, food, security, and family are extraordinary when just being alive is a notable accomplishment. But fortune can turn on a dime, and all it takes is one misstep.
