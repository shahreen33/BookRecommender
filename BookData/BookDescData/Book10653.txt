(Alternate cover edition of ASIN B07BSKG3L7.) After Chris’s best friend Joshua died during a two-year mission, the once devout Mormon lost his already crumbling faith. Ostracized from his family and the only community he’s ever known, Chris had no choice but to find his way on his own. Now he’s going to school and loves his job as a bartender at Wilde’s, and four years after Joshua’s death, he’s moving on.  But Joshua isn’t dead, and now he’s back in Chris’s world. Returning to Seattle to make peace with his dying father, Joshua has a new name, a new accent… and old feelings for Chris that are alive and well.  Forgiveness doesn’t come easy for anyone, but just as Chris is accepting that the man he loves isn’t going to run away this time, their families threaten to pull them apart all over again…  Contains two lost boys who’ve finally found each other again and need to make up for a hell of a lot of lost time. There’s also a military uniform, a tuxedo, and a knife. In the same scene. And yes, it’s that kind of scene.  This 57,000 word novel was previously published.
