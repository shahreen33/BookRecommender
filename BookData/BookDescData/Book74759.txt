Understanding and applying the wisdom of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez! In an incredibly short time, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has galvanized the country on issues of national importance. This young member of Congress has motivated Democrats to confront climate change and income inequality and is upending conventional wisdom about how young women, especially women of color, are supposed to behave.  Her background, including a family that fell out of the middle class due to health care challenges, has driven her to champion those on the margins, such as low-wage workers, immigrants, people of color, and younger people who face a future of climate disruption and instability.   This book takes life lessons from the rising star known as AOC and offers readers a chance to apply them to their own lives.  In five chapters, The AOC Way weaves substantive issues and AOC’s experiences to understand how she so quickly came to dominate media coverage in America but also to drive real change in what seems like a lightening flash. AOC has demonstrated some key values and commitments on her way to success, such as believing in yourself and not letting haters take you off course; working hard and being prepared to prove your talents; bringing your experiences to your work by not forgetting how you got where you are; challenging the status quo; and staying true to your friends and allies.
