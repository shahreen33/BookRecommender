He never knew what creatures would emerge from the snowy night to threaten him next. He knew only that at the end he would die on Trenzalore.Some of what happened during those terrible years is well documented. But most of it remains shrouded in mystery and darkness.Until now.This is a glimpse of just some of the terrors the people faced, the monstrous threats the Doctor defeated. These are the tales of the monsters who found themselves afraid - and of the one man who was not.(Tales of Trenzalore documents four of the Doctor’s adventures from different periods during the Siege of Trenzalore and the ensuing battle:Let it Snow by Justin RichardsAn Apple a Day by George MannStrangers in the Outland by Paul FinchThe Dreaming by Mark Morris)
