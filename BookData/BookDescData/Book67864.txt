Meeting Jack was the best thing that ever happened to Channon. The dominant older man gives him confidence, boundaries, discipline, everything Channon needs, and all Channon has to do is be the obedient submissive Jack wants. But Jack's glamorous life in the city is intimidating for a sheltered eighteen-year-old, and Channon can't help worrying that he won't be good enough to keep Jack's interest. Will Jack break things off when he realizes how deep Channon's insecurities run? Or will the older Dom take care of him, the way he's always promised?  Sucked deep into a world of dominance and submission, pain and pleasure, Channon gives himself in willing service to the only man he's ever wanted to call Sir. And Jack? Just might accidentally fall in love.
