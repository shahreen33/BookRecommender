Professional hockey player Sergei Petrov has had a rough time after the tragic loss of his beloved wife. Playing hockey and taking care of his son are all he has time for; getting traded was not on the agenda. Neither was a sexy, hockey-playing nanny to further complicate things.  Star college athlete Danielle Cloutier may dominate the rink, but off the ice, she’s an amateur. She’s been trying to get rid of her virginity for years, but guys are always intimidated by her strength. That changes when she meets her new boss. Chemistry between them sizzles, hot enough to melt the most frozen of hearts, but Danielle can’t afford to get attached.  Sergei doesn’t know what to do with the beautiful, stubborn woman, but watching her turn his new house into a home gives him a few ideas. Can he come to terms with his feelings before she skates out of his life for good?
