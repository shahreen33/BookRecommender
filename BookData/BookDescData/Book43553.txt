Alternate cover for ISBN 9780380754328.This autobiography is detailed, showing how the Russian-speaking youth moved from being an English-illiterate to the self-taught genius that all came to know. It relates how he heard people pronounce street names, examined the street signs &amp; figured out how to read before he began his formal education. This is the story as told when he didn't feel that he was running out of time. It has a sense of fun (cf. The Endochronic Properties of Theotimoline 'practice paper' he wrote prior to his Ph.D examination). Ranging widely, it includes whole stories as examples.
