Hope is dying. Hope Jackson has lived her short life to the fullest, but her four closest friends are dangling on the brink of disaster. Right before dying of a rare heart condition, Hope sets up a scavenger hunt across New York City using her graffiti art. The directions she leaves her friends are simple: Solve the clues hidden in her art, and they'll solve the problems haunting their lives. Hope is dead. Two days after her heart fails, Hope's friends are thrown together: Aiden, her best friend, whose plans to attend college have been scattered by his OCD. Kali, her foster sister, whose last ties to sanity are as razor-thin as her anorexic waistline. Erik, her high school crush, whose success as an athlete is based on a lie with no end in sight. And Sam, her online pen-pal, whose perfect life exploded into chaos in the aftermath of a school bombing. Together, the four teens take to the streets of New York to complete Hope's scavenger hunt and fulfill her dying wishes. But in order to unravel the clues hidden in Hope's graffiti, her friends will have to confront their personal demons head on. Hope is within reach.
