  “I wasn’t ready for this. Hannah deserved a man who was whole, not a broken shell. But I couldn’t resist her. Couldn’t resist this. It felt too good.And would that be so bad? To have something that felt good for once?”
My name is Leo Miles, and I’m not a hero.I came home broken—wounded and scarred. It’s been five years, and I haven’t left my family’s land. Not once. It’s not much of a life, but with the way I look now, I prefer to stay hidden.My only reprieve is her voice. I put on my headset, log in to my game, and she’s there. We talk while we play, sharing everything but our personal details. She’s my best friend—my happy place—even though I don’t know her real name.Until one day, I hear a voice I recognize. She’s here, at my family’s winery. Meeting Hannah Tate in person rocks my world. And discovering she’s in trouble—serious trouble—changes everything. Hannah is my every fantasy come true. And this badass gamer girl is determined to break through my defenses. But between the mess that is my life, and the threats to my family’s safety, I can’t be anyone’s hero, least of all hers.But maybe we both need saving.
