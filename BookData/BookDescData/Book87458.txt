Butters Comes Home is the true story, with a few fantasy elements thrown in, of a little Holland Lop bunny who finds his forever home. Beautifully illustrated by Rachel Montreuil and lovingly written by Claudette Melanson, follow Butters as he makes his journey from the cold and lonely breeder's shed to his warm and loving forever home. Rabbits are highly intelligent creatures with unique personalities and Butters is a very unique bunny indeed. Children will enjoy the heartwarming story of how this loving little rabbit's fate changes one day, leaving behind a life of discomfort and fear and trading it for a home where he can be emotionally and intellectually stimulated, receive the proper feeding and care and most importantly...be loved. The first in a series of Butters' adventures, Butters Comes Home is not only an enjoyable, feel-good story, one which teaches compassion for animals, but also serves as an educational source for rabbit care--furbabies who have special needs which differ greatly from other species of pets.
