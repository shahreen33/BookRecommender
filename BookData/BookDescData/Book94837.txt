Only a few months have passed since the day Kester Lanner forced an angry ghost through the spirit door, but business prospects for Dr. Ribero's supernatural agency haven't improved. Things are looking grim when the agency lands a contract which they must share with a rival agency headed by Dr Ribero's sworn enemy, Larry Higgins. Desperate for the job, the team accepts and begins to investigate the seaside town of Lyme Regis, where elderly victims are dying. The same mysterious clue links the horrendous deaths: the victims all see a double of themselves before dying. The teams wonder if they are dealing with a rogue doppelganger, one that isn't content just predicting deaths, but carrying them out as well. The victims' connection to an ancient grave site leads to speculation that they may have disturbed a spirit more powerful than the two agencies can handle. One thing is certain, the won't stop unless Kester and the others can overcome their rivalry and stop this deadly spirit.
