This book is an update of the ongoing Bluegrass, Bluegrass Brothers, and Forever Bluegrass series. If you haven’t read the books in those series, then it is recommended that you start with Bluegrass State of Mind.   You’re invited to the Rose sisters’ Surprise Hundredth Birthday Party!  What do the people of Keeneston do when they find out the Rose sisters’ one hundredth birthday is only days away? Try to throw one heck of a surprise party that even John Wolfe couldn’t see coming!  Come back to Keeneston for a visit with each of your favorite couples and their children as they all try to pull off the seemingly impossible—surprise the Rose sisters. Will the Rose sisters be too distracted with all of the other gossip to notice the biggest happening in Keeneston’s history or will they blow the surprise?
