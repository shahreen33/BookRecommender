If life really was a fairy tale, Zakara would never be the damsel in distress. She’d be a thief, and Prince Charming wouldn’t have a clue how to steal the heart of the conniving criminal.  Zakara saves not one, but three men locked inside the tallest tower. Her first instinct is to ditch them as soon as possible, but they have one thing that intrigues her more than wealth:  Magic.  Fae magic once ruled the world, until it disappeared without a trace. Only myths of the magic wielders linger in their destroyed society.  The three prisoners claim to be fae, but she doesn’t trust them.  She doesn’t trust anyone.  Can Prince Ryder convince the pretty thief to lead them to the Hopeless City? Or will she kill him before they even arrive?  This is a reverse harem serial. Recommended for readers over 18.
