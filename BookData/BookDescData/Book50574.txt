As writers, we all want to tell stories and keep the readers engaged. In this book you will find 60 prompts. This is not like the other prompt books that you find in the market where they just list one liners as a prompt. In this book you will be given prompts or plots and ways to develop them into various genres. These prompts will not just create a spark in you to create your own story but also guide you to twist and turn them into a story you will be comfortable writing.
