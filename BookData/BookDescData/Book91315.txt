I had everything I’d ever wanted — a successful business with a second bakery in the works, a sexy fiance who I adored, and good friends who loved to laugh almost as much as I did.So of course it couldn’t possibly last.Unfortunately, this time the trouble was homegrown in Vancouver, threatening my own backyard and those who were under my protection — whether they wanted to be or not.I was, after all, the wielder of the instruments of assassination.Apparently, cutesy cupcakes and being nice only stretched so far.
