1952, Brighton. When eighteen-year-old Rose Bellamy Gore goes missing in a seedy Soho jazz club, the prime suspect is a young sax player, Lindon Claremont. He hightails it to Brighton to seek the help of his childhood friend Vesta, who works with ex-Secret Service backroom girl Mirabelle Bevan. When London is taken into custody, the two women dive into London's underworld of smoky nightclubs, fast cars and lethal cocktails to establish the truth.
