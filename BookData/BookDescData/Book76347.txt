Blurb :Not all killers are natural born.Some are manmade,purified through the fires of hell,moulded by circumstance,created in darkness.RavenI am Raven, heartless, unfeeling.My story is one of redemption.Though I’m not blameless,I’ve been ruthless in my pursuit of justice.I was created by the devil himself,And he was about to meet his greatest aberration.This may be the story of my undoing,But I won’t go down without a fight.AceThey call me Ace. I miss nothing.There isn’t a case I haven’t solved --until her, my nemesis.She intrigues me, tests me, tempts me.I want to unmask her, know her.Get into the mind of this mercenary,Without losing myself in the process.
