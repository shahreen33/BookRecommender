Dr. Tony Evans' Kingdom Man: Every Man's Destiny, Every Woman's Dream is a 6-session Bible study for adult men. This study is designed to empower men to exercise the God-given dominion they were created for by giving them a Kingdom understanding, vision, and perspective on their identity and responsibilities along with practical steps on how to become a man who rules his world well. Our culture has redefined manhood by emasculating men through a repositioning of the role. Men are portrayed as weak, self-serving, and unfocused. The Bible clearly communicates that man was created to exercise dominion over the various areas of his life, taking responsibility for himself and others entrusted to his care. When a man functions within the principles of biblical manhood, those around him benefit from his leadership and care. This men's Bible study is designed to empower men to exercise the God-given dominion they were created for by giving them a Kingdom understanding, vision, and perspective on their identity and responsibilities, along with practical steps on how to become a man who rules his world well.Following the similar teachings of the Tony Evans' Christian book for men, this Bible study guides men through personal study segments, group sessions and workbooks. The study will help men understand how to study the Bible as a Kingdom Man as individuals, with the corresponding Bible study kit for group studies and alongside daily devotionals for men.Member Book includes:Six weekly group experiences following the Bible for discussion, sharing, and viewingDVD sessions featuring author Tony EvansIndividual study five days a week, including content to read and learning activities to help men
