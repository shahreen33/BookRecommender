The definitive, lavishly illustrated history of the Green Bay Packers, commemorating the team's 100-year anniversaryNot only are the Packers the only fan-owned team in any of North America’s major pro sports leagues, but Green Bay — population 104,057 — is also the smallest city with a big-time franchise. The Packers are, in other words, unlikely candidates to be pro football's preeminent team. And yet nobody in the NFL has won more championships. The story of Titletown, USA, is the greatest story in sports.    Through extensive archival research and unmatched insider access to players and team officials, past and present, Mark Beech tells the first complete rags-to-riches history of the Green Bay Packers, a full chronicle of the most illustrious team in NFL history. The People’s Team paints compelling pictures of a franchise, a town, and a fan base. No other team in pro sports is so bound to the place that gave birth to it. Here is the story of the Packers and of Green Bay — from the days of the French fur traders who settled on the shores of La Baie in the seventeenth century, to the team’s pursuit of its fourteenth NFL championship.     Featuring essays by Peter King, Chuck Mercein, Austin Murphy, and David S. Neft, The People’s Team is a must-have for fans, old and new, and the definitive illustrated history of the most important team in the NFL.
