Arrogant, brooding, domineering, possessive, dangerously handsome, and a playboy. These are all of the characteristics on Rebecca Gellar’s Run-Like-Hell list for men, but she’s about to meet the man who’s the epitome of these and more…  After breaking off her engagement with Hollywood actor Miles Storm, Rebecca is ready for a change of scenery in her life and in her bed. So when the opportunity to work for StoneHaven Publishing, one of New York City’s most respectable publishing empires presents itself, Rebecca doesn’t hesitate moving to the Big Apple.  Convinced she can show the owner of StoneHaven Publishing that she has the "right stuff,” Rebecca agrees to a six month trial as the personal assistant to the owner’s playboy son, Nicholas StoneHaven. This is her big chance. If she can just get through these six months without strangling Nicholas with his Armani tie, she'll be okay – easier said than done. Nicholas is the last person Rebecca thought she’d find herself pining for, especially when he hits every category under her list.  Get ready for a battle of the sexes…  *This novel includes all three volumes combined.
