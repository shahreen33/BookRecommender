El, a clinical psychologist, helps those worst affected by the fogs, while her sister, who’s just lost her own baby, cares for the abandoned infant. Meanwhile, Caradoc, an American neuroscientist, seeks a scientific explanation for the fogs while coping with florid hallucinations about his past life as a medieval saint. As the relentless fogs cut the city off from the rest of the world, resources become scarce, paranoia rises and the military argues for a counterattack on England.The Night Fogs is a sharply topical, funny, satirical, and moving story that explores divisions between communities, friends, family members and even parts of ourselves.
