Once upon a time my brother and I found a magic mirror...Tonight the mirror swept us into Cinderella's fairy tale. Now, we are NOT messing this story up. No way. Cinderella is going to marry her prince just like she's supposed to.Uh-oh.Cinderella broke her foot, and there's massive swelling. The glass slipper won't fit, the prince won't know she's the one for him, and they won't live happily ever after. And it's all our fault!To save the day we'll need to:- Learn how to use a dustpan- Stay out of jail- Find Cinderella a job- Make sure true love finds its wayWe just have to get it all done before the clock strikes twelve and the chance for a happy ending is gone . . . forever!
