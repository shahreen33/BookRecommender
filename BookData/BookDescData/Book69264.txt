Carolâ€™s husband, Jon, went missing while hiking in the extensive Harob forest. Searches over the following five days failed to find him, and he was assumed dead from exposure.Two weeks later, Jon knocks on the front door of their home. Carol wants to accept his return as a miracle, but there are too many unanswered questions. Why is he so hostile? Why didn't he contact her sooner? How did he get the bloodstains on his shirt?And the most disturbing question: is the man sleeping next to her really her husband?
