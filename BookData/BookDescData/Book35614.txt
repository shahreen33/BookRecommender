Drawing from diverse personages -- Goethe to Churchill to Woody Allen -- Robert Byrne has mined a collection of wit and wisdom that deserves a special place on every humor lover's bookshelf. These unique, witty, and outrageous quotations, previously published in four separate volumes, are now gathered together in a seemingly limitless trove of pithy and often irreverent one-liners, retorts, put-downs, jokes, and last words that cover every conceivable subject and will appeal to every taste. Highlights include:  "Start every day with a smile and get it over with." -- W. C. Fields  "Men read maps better than women because only men understand that an inch can equal a hundred miles." -- Roseanne Barr  "Happiness is having a large loving family in another city." -- George Burns
