Blue and white ironstone dinnerware has been collected for many years, and the introduction of the Liberty Blue pattern in 1975 by Enoch Wedgwood of England, with its fifteen different historic scenes of colonial America, brought forth keen interest. Here the Old North Church, Minutemen, West Point, Independence Hall, Mount Vernon, and many more historic sites are shown. The Liberty Blue promotion coincided with America's Bicentennial celebrations, causing more people to become interested in owning a set for themselves. Color photographs beautifully illustrate all the pieces in a complete set, and interesting facts are given about each historic scene. Updated prices are included in the captions and the associated glassware and ceramic pieces are carefully described. Original advertisements and brochures are included to provide extensive accurate information. This is the first book about Liberty Blue dinnerware and is sure to become a valuable reference guide for collectors trying to build a complete set.
