Salem U. is buzzing with holiday activities. Annie loves the holidays, until two of her friends have horrible accidentsâ€”and she may be next.What Annie doesn't know is that one of her friends has a dark past. He has murdered a girl and now his mind is split in two. One part that of a student, the other that of a guilty killer.He listens to "the voice in the mirror" that tells him that each new girl he meets is actually a reincarnation of the girl he killed, returning to expose him. The voice tells him he has no chance, unless he can eliminate the problem...permanently.
