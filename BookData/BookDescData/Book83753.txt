I needed money. He wanted my virginity. So I sold it. If I don't pay off my piles of debt, I'm going to lose the one thing I care about-- my grandmother. She needs a place to live, people to take care of her, and there's no way I can afford it anymore. But I only have one thing worth any money. My virginity. It was a shot in the dark to put it up for auction online. What kind of person would even bid on something as perverted as this? Pierce Pinewood, that's who. He outbid everyone right away, making it clear he wanted to win. I was relieved and terrified all at once, but I figured it was fine, we'd just sleep together and I'd go on my merry way. So why, even after meeting me, is he waiting to claim his prize? Pierce is exposing me to money, glamour, a life I never dreamed of. He's also telling me what lingerie to wear... and what to do with the parts of my body no one is allowed to see. No one but him. I thought I was selling him one night with me. I couldn't have guessed how much of me he really wanted. This is a standalone novella with a HEA and NO cheating! Penny Wylder writes just that-- wild romances. Happily Ever Afters are always better when they're a little dirty, so if you're looking for a page turner that will make you feel naughty in all the right places, jump right in and leave your panties at the door!
