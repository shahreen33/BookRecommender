The main After The Fall storyline is back in the crosshairs in this third hardcover volume of the latest Angel series! Now that we've seen not only what happened after that epic, show-ending alley battle, but also experienced the First Night that Los Angeles went to Hell, it's time to find out what comes next. But it's not going to be easy. Long-time friends-turned-enemies Angel and Gunn are on a collision course with destruction, and when Gunn's master plans get exposed, well, let's just say things get chippy. Experience all the action, drama, deception, and demonic humor you've come to expect from Brian Lynch (Spike: Shadow Puppets), joined this time with artist Nick Runge in the exciting continuation of Angel: After The Fall!
