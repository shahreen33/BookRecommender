Matthew Dow Smith (XÂ­FILES, HELLBOY) tells the epic Irish folktale of 'The Phantom Isle.' When a young man shipwrecks on a mysterious island ruled by a council of witches, he has the choice of freedom or staying on the isle where he does not age. The lure of immortality is hard to resist, but it comes with a price he may not be willing to pay.
