The Law of Henna and Bodhi: When love breaks, fall inward, fall together, and fall hard. Then let time pick up the pieces.  Everything feels temporary when you’ve experienced tragedy—until Henna Lane meets Bodhi at a music festival.  Young and spontaneous, they have a lust for seizing the moment, falling hard and fast.  When Bodhi is forced to leave without a goodbye, Henna thinks she’ll never get over him. But then she meets Mr. Malone, her sexy, new guidance counselor.  They are reckless. They are forbidden.  When their secret is discovered, Henna has to choose between finishing school—banned from seeing Mr. Malone—or dropping out to follow her nomad dreams.  Henna chooses her dreams.  Over time, she learns that life is not a destination or a journey, some things are more than temporary, and the forbidden can never be ignored. But if she returns for him, will he still be hers?  A Place Without You is an emotional story of young love, shattered dreams, and impossible decisions.
