With the police hot on their trail, Rachel soon realizes there are darker forces hunting them—a group of mortals recruited by the gods who will stop at nothing to preserve the power of the Hedonesses—not to mention Eros himself, who is desperate to reverse the curse...Rachel must learn to do what no Hedoness has done before—to resist her gift—or she'll turn the person she's grown to love into a shadow of himself... forever.
