From USA Today Bestselling Author Meghan Quinn, comes a hilarious romantic comedy that will touch your heart and cause you to roar with laughter as you escape into Rosie Bloom's attempt to write a romance novel.Her bosom heaved at an alarming rate as his rough hand found its way down to her soft, yet wiry briar patch...Can you say briar patch in a romance novel? What about breasts? Do bosoms really heave? Goodness, I have no idea what I'm doing. I’m a virgin attempting to write a romance novel and I'm having an impossible time trying to write a passionate and swoon-worthy love scene worthy of being published, thanks to my lack of experience. My two best friends encourage me to drop the pen, step outside my comfort zone, and gain some real life experience through multiple dating facets such as blind dates, online profiles, and random hookups. But losing my "flower" is proving to be much tougher than expected… This is the story of my awkward, humiliating, and slightly terrifying life, but like all romance novels, I know it will end in a happily ever after. At least that's what I keep telling myself. **WARNING: READ IN THE CONFINES OF YOUR OWN HOME DUE TO RANDOM OUTBURSTS OF LAUGHTER.
