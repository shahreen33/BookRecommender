Kimberly seems distraught but also defensive and uncooperative. Is it fear and mistrust of the police that are putting her son at risk, or darker motivations? With Riley's life in peril, Goodhew needs Kimberly to make choices, but she has to understand that the one thing she cannot afford is another mistake.
