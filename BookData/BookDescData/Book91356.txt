A mother who violated her deepest needs - to keep her deepest promises. The daughter she has never been able to love. The four who wait for what comes in the dark.  And a few more things I didnâ€™t know were going to end up in here until I wrote the book. :) The final book in the Fixers of KarmaCorp. If you haven't read this far, don't start here. Go find Destiny's Song and start at the beginning.
