"A wild, visually engrossing journey." —Paste Magazine   "A surreal, deeply personal tale." —A.V. Club "A smart and unforgettable book." —SyFy Wire Caroline Sharp gave up her humanity to gain incredible shape-shifting abilities—powers she used to save the world time and time again as the superhero Chrysalis. But as the years wore on, she began to lose control of the elemental forces coursing through her body, making her dangerously unstable and forcing her removal from ALPHA 13, the covert government agency that created her. Now, although she can barely hold herself together, Caroline's unique condition also means that nothing can kill her. Isolated, alienated and profoundly alone, she's determined to break the curse of her immortality—by any means necessary. Enter the villainous Madame Atom, with the offer of a lifetime: to end her suffering, all Caroline has to do is undertake one final, dimension-spanning mission, with one simple objective—the destruction of the entire universe.  Written by Eisner and GLAAD Media award-nominated writer Magdalene Visaggio and illustrated by Eisner Award-winning artist Sonny Liew, Eternity Girl collects the unforgettable six-issue miniseries from the groundbreaking DC's Young Animal imprint.
