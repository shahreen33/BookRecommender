I’ve always been a good girl. I work hard, I follow the rules, and I always achieve my goals.But sometimes good girls want things that aren’t good for them. Or someone who isn’t good for them. Like their new boss.And sometimes they do very bad things to get his attention. Like sell their virginity in an auction. Who knew he’d be so very, very mad?Maybe this was not my best laid plan…
