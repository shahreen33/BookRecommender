Juno Beck is trying to step out from the long shadow of her father and make her place in the music industry. But this bear shifter’s days are numbered and she’s running out of time to make her mark on the world. When she stops for a day trip to visit an old friend, she discovers the hiding place of one of country music’s bad-boys-who-got-away. But everything she thought she knew about Rhett Copeland from interviews is wrong, and he’s hiding a mountain of secrets. And as she struggles with the decision to do what’s right or what’s necessary, she begins discovering who she really is, and what she really stands for. And that singer she’s crushed on for all these years, is about to show her how it really is to live.  Rhett Copeland threw away his destiny. The white lion shifter left his Pride to become a touring musician, but something important has sent him into hiding in a last-chance Crew of lumberjacks. His accounts are frozen, his muse is crippled, his fans are on the hunt for him, and his new Rogue Pride Crew gets on his nerves at every turn. All he wants to do is stay hidden, avoid as much logging work as possible, and pester his new Crew, but Juno Beck is going to expose him and all of his secrets to the public if he isn’t careful. Too bad she’s too interesting for her own good because his songwriting muse only wakes up around her, and now he can’t leave the mesmerizing stranger alone. But the more he lets Juno in, the more she threatens the life he’s carved out here in the wilderness of Rogue Pride territory.  He has nothing but time, and she barely has any days left. He has lost his passion for the music, while she’s more driven than ever to make her mark on the industry. Lions and mole rats and bears, oh my! Two worlds collide in T. S. Joyce’s second installment of the Daughters of Beasts series.   Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. Intended for mature audiences.
