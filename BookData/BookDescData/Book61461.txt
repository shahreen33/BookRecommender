Dead Man's SwitchArmed with weapons of mass destruction, three anti-American groups prepare to unleash a deadly war against the United States. Mack Bolan is sent in to stop the attack before the killing can begin. And he knows every second counts. There's only one problem: the weapons are hidden in different locations around the world.With millions of innocent lives at stake, Bolan has no choice but to accept the help of an ex-Hezbollah member who claims to have insight into the terrorists' plans. Keeping one eye on the informant and the other on disarming the threat, the Executioner knows it's time for him to do some massive destruction of his own.
