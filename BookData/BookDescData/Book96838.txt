Mason Kade is the dream. He is the promise. He’s offering what so many would fantasize about, and it’s not that I don’t want it/him/us. It’s the opposite. There might be ghosts haunting me, but this man who's my soulmate is asking me for forever. How can I say no to someone who already gave me my happily ever after?
