A debut poetry collection from actor Nico Tortorella exploring “all of it,” from the smallest cells in our bodies to the outer limits of our universe.  Nico Tortorella's debut poetry collection presents a singular voice honed through years as an actor, podcaster, and advocate, one colored with love, wonder, and endless curiosity. But it is also more than just words on a page – it is a sensuous journey into who we are and how we relate to the world around us, showing how the connections we make are vital to understanding why we are here.  Provocative, enlightening, and emotionally charged, all of it is you. is a poetry experience like no other.
