It was supposed to be the beginning of a new life—not a replay of her old one . . . For eight years, Kris was the property of a brutal slaver captain. Now she’s free and a brand-new cadet at the Nereidian League’s military academy. All she brings to this new life is a unique set of skills, a profound ignorance of ‘civilized’ society, and a large chip on her shoulder. But Kris isn’t quite sure what to make of the Academy, and the Academy isn’t at all sure what to make of her. The medical staff thinks she’s homicidal, her fellow cadets think she’s crazy, and her instructors don’t know what to think. So when she’s approached about helping capture a terrorist warlord, she’s more than happy to leave the halls of academia behind for awhile. Kris knows she’s not signing up for some pleasure cruise. What she doesn’t know is that the key to the mission’s success is reliving her very worst nightmare . . .
