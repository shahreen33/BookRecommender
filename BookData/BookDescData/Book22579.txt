When Nate and Josh's father gets a teaching position at a new college and the boys are forced to move to a new town, a strange gift from a sickly old neighbor changes their lives forever. Given the magical power to reanimate dead things, the boys are suddenly drawn into other-worldly battles. Will the boys use their power to defend their neighborhood? Or will they use it to get into trouble? With the help of Billy, their funny friend, they go about creating a Monster Army. But what is that army and what is its purpose? A strange woman—is she a goddess?—is supposed to be in charge of the good side, but she's full of too many secrets. Nate and Josh need to find out the truth. They need to protect their mom and their little sister, Lilly, while doing it. And what about Dad, the college professor? Can he help them with all his smarts? It ain't easy being kids with power. It started out fun, but then got real scary. Nate and Josh want to do the right thing. If they can survive.
