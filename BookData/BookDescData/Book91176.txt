When professional gardener, Liam Walton, falls and hits his head on his way home from work one cold, frosty, winter's night, he is rescued by a beautiful yet mysterious young man with ice-blue eyes, white blond hair and very cold hands.This story contains scenes of an adult nature involving physical intimacy between two men. There is also an awful lot of weather, a pretty white fox, a vicar that tells ghost stories and some very dangerous behaviour on a frozen lake (do not try this at home).
