It is time to confront a strange new reality. Of the eighty people chosen to escape earth's final destruction, only a handful remain. They're all that's left of the human race. They've traveled 500 years into the future, and about as far as possible from the life they once knew. Now, marooned on a strange planet, they break into groups to explore. Jobs's and Mo'Steel's group discover what looks like a recreation of the Tower of Babel. Inside they find an alien creature -- wounded but still a potential threat.Meanwhile, another group discovers the tower, only they don't want to explore. They want to capture -- using violence, if necessary. Soon, the Remnants are arguing over what to do, and that could be a major problem. Because a ship of people five hundred years away from home should not be a ship divided.
