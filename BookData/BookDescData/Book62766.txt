Unsure. That's how I'm feeling about my entire life. Just when everything's good and I have it all under control, my girl Chelsea decides she's going to leave me for the summer. Despite my disappointment, I have to support her. It's what she wants, an opportunity she can't say no to and no way will I be the one to stop her. I love her too much to hold her back. Opportunities are happening for me too, though. A big one that my brother-in-law Drew says I can't pass up. I'm working extra hard. So is Chelsea. It's like we don't have any time to get together. We keep making the same promise--only five more days until we see each other again. But we keep breaking that promise. Is our relationship strong enough to survive all of these changes?
