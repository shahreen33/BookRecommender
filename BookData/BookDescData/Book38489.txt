A hot new erotica series for readers of 50 Shades and Sylvia DayIn S∙E∙C∙R∙E∙T there are…No judgments. No limits. No shame. Cassie Robichaud’s life has been filled with regret and loneliness since the death of her husband. She waits tables at the run-down Café Rose in New Orleans, and every night she heads home to her cat and solitary one-bedroom apartment. But when she discovers a notebook left behind by a mysterious woman at the café, Cassie’s world is forever changed. The notebook’s stunningly explicit confessions shock and fascinate Cassie, and eventually lead her to S∙E∙C∙R∙E∙T, an underground society dedicated to helping women realize their wildest, most intimate sexual fantasies. Cassie soon immerses herself in an electrifying ten-step journey through a series of rapturous fantasies with gorgeous men who awaken and satisfy her like never before. As she is set free from her inhibitions, she discovers a new confidence that transforms her, giving her the courage to live passionately. Equal parts enticing, liberating, and emotionally powerful, S∙E∙C∙R∙E∙T is a world where erotic fantasy becomes reality.From the Trade Paperback edition.
