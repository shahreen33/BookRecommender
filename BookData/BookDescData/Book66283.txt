Relationships are complex.Love ever-changing.And when it comes to rules of the heart,they were made to be broken…That’s what Robert Antonio Bianchi was telling himself, anyway.Otherwise, he really had no excuse for what—or who—he’d done.No excuse, except for his lonely heart, a pitcher of margaritas, four Bitter Bitches, and the apparent need to confess all his weaknesses to the two men he knew would bring him nothing but trouble.But trouble was nothing new.Just ask his crazy sisters or any of his friends, and they’d be the first to tell you:If there was a bad decision to be made, Robbie always had a knack for making it.And thus begins the story of the priest, the princess, and the prick.
