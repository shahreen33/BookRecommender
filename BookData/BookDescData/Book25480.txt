Empowered Living offers bold and enlightening concepts to strengthen our whole being. Instead of relegating emotional and physical protection to separate areas of expertise, Tori M. Eldridge treats them as one issue with the same challenges and strategies for success. A strong believer in personal responsibility, she guides her readers through honest introspection and hard facts to stop passing the buck, the blame, and the power. Her book includes specific exercises and visualizations to teach practical skills like effective communication, overcoming fear, and sensory assault, as well as to affirm self-worth and attain emotional equilibrium. The chapter devoted to physical defense thoroughly details strategies, techniques and precautions applicable to people of any age, gender or size. The personal stories and examples shared throughout the book make this an enjoyable read as well as serving to remind us all of our common fallibility and power.
