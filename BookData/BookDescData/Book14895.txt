In 1978 Sandra Scoppettone, who would soon become a well-known mystery writer, published the story of Peggy and Jaret, two high school girls madly in love but find themselves the target of a violent plot to punish them for who they are. Part mystery thriller, part love story, Happy Endings Are All Alike was only the third young adult novel featuring lesbian characters and was a commercial and critical sensation.
