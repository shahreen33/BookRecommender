Tucker Winslow and Gracie Madison, two strangers trying to survive a staggering loss. Both hop in their cars and set out on a cross-country adventure, hoping to leave the hurt behind. But, when Tucker's car breaks down, and he is forced to hitchhike the rest of the way, fate intervenes. When these two meet, the bond is instantaneous. Their losses connect them in a way that's impossible to ignore, and they form a friendship that helps soothe wounds that go far too deep to heal. They laugh, they cry, they blast 80's music and sing off-key, and they stop at every tourist trap they can find along the way. Then, as it always does, one night their laughter turns to lust and they both give in, knowing it will change everything they've come to rely on.Losing someone you know and love can be the hardest thing in the world. So why does losing someone you've just met, yet have come to depend on, hurt twice as much? Join Tucker and Gracie as they embark upon the adventure of a lifetime, and end up on a journey toward finding happiness in a world that was once filled with pain.
