If a boulder rolls down the aisle of a bus, sending the entire carload careening; if a visitor to the hospital leaves even the staff psychiatrist baffled; or if a hostess discovers her surprise dessert is "baked elastic," you can be sure that Paddington is somewhere close at hand. Still wearing his floppy old hat, he causes trouble wherever he goes. Even a wedding is hardly traditional with Paddington in attendance. Paddington fans will be delighted once more as their favorite bear turns things merrily, unpredictably topsy-turvy in this revised edition of Paddington Goes to Town.
