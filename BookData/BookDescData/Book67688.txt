You can’t choose your family. Just like you can’t stop the whispers of your heart.  When Fflur’s parents' divorce, she has to find her place in not only her new family, but also the world. Her mother’s deception and secret life cuts deep. Deep enough for Fflur to taste the bitterness of hate. But her connection to a boy that may or may not become her new stepbrother could well cause the deepest hurt of all. I’m Fflur—Flower to everyone who knows me—and this is the story of broken homes, shattered hearts, and stolen dreams. It’s the story of weeds and wishes, and the definition of a flower.
