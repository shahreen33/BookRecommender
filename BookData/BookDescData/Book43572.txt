Pulp fiction's legendary Man of Bronze returns in two of his most engrossing adventures. In "Resurrection Day", first published in 1936, the Man of Bronze perfects a method for resurrecting a dead human being -- but only one person can be revived. Who will Doc choose? In "Repel" (1937), a strange new element is expelled in a South Pacific volcanic eruption, but falls into the hands of Cadwiller Olden, Doc Savage's most formidable foe. This volume includes a foreword by Peter David ("Star Trek", "The Incredible Hulk"), the original pulp covers by Robert Harris, interior illustrations by Paul Orban, and historical articles by Will Murray.
