“My name is Harriet Manners, and I am still a geek.”Harriet knows that modelling won’t transform you. She knows that being as uniquely odd as a polar bear isn’t necessarily a bad thing (even in a rainforest). And that the average person eats a ton of food a year, though her pregnant stepmother is doing her best to beat this.What Harriet doesn’t know is where she’s going to fit in once the new baby arrives.With summer plans ruined, modelling in Japan seems the perfect chance to get as far away from home as possible. But nothing can prepare Harriet for the craziness of Tokyo, her competitive model flatmates and her errant grandmother’s ‘chaperoning’. Or seeing gorgeous Nick everywhere she goes.Because, this time, Harriet knows what a broken heart feels like.Can geek girl find her place on the other side of the world or is Harriet lost for good?
