Cold Case Detective, Ronan O’Mara, has set sail on the honeymoon of his dreams to sunny Bermuda. He’s looking forward to a week of fun in the sun with his husband, Tennyson, but nothing is going as planned. From a fight between Truman and Carson that’s threatening to break up their marriage, to Captain Fitzgibbon’s on-again, off-again lover not showing up to meet the ship, to dealing with his always challenging mother-in-law, to frenemy, Jude Byrne, showing up with a suitcase loaded with sex toys and lube, Ronan has all he can do to stay sane.  Psychic, Tennyson Grimm, is on the ship to work as well as honeymoon. The cruise ship line has hired him to be the “celebrity” on their celebrity cruise. In between private and group readings reuniting family members with those who have crossed over, Ten is running himself ragged attempting to put the pieces of Truman and Carson’s marriage back together and trying to keep Jude from horn-dogging after the ship’s captain, all while trying to squeeze in a few stolen, passionate moments with his husband. He isn’t having much luck.  During the return trip to Boston, Ronan and Tennyson are enjoying a performance of Murder Mystery Night staged by the ship’s crew. When the crewmember playing the murder victim turns up dead for real, Ronan and Tennyson must set “fun in the sun” aside when the ship’s captain allows them to investigate the crime.  Putting the clues together, the Boston detectives corner the cagey killer who takes someone close to them hostage. Can Tennyson and Ronan save the day before they end up dead in the water?
