Self-published authors are coming to realise that a stable career is about a backlist of titles and keeping that backlist selling.  But how do you do this?  Invariably, advice given by other authors includes holding promotions and lowering the price of the first book in series, or even making it free. However, few people mention one of the most powerful ways to keep your backlist selling: the author mailing list.  This is where Mailing Lists Unboxed comes in. It shows you:  --The different types of author mailing lists --How to recruit people to sign up --What to do with your list once you have one --Attitudes about mailing lists, including those that stand in your way --Warnings and precautions --And much more  This is not a book for beginners. If you know little about self-publishing, read Self-publishing Unboxed first.
