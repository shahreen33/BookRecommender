A love story for crip culture! By turns playful, unsettling, raw and moving, Cripple Poetics: A Love Story is an immersive and sensual correspondence that builds and heats by accretion-one keystroke at a time. The dance of courtship is reflected in language that alternately snakes and darts, declares and obfuscates, reminisces and forges-finding freedom within its limitations. Cripple Poetics preserves and unfolds the artifacts of an original and timely love story that might otherwise have remained shrouded in a small, forgotten corner of cyberspace.
