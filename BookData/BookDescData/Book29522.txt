This is the story of a first love.This is the story of a first heartbreak.And this is the story of two people who simply couldn't rewrite the stars.sb. Maamari debut poetry book deals with first intimacy experiences, emotional abuse, trauma, survival, and how love can change a person, for the worst or for the better. Each chapter serves a different story. Each chapter is set in a different time. But all chapters lead to the road of surviving the impossible. Sometimes love can be magical, and out of this world, but can lead to nowhere. This is the road of us.
