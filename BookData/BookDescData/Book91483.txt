A horse is a horse, right? Of course not. Just when Noelle thinks she has her ducks in a row, a woman brings her horse to Flynn Farm for boarding. At first, everything is just peachy keen: the woman is wonderful and the horse is mannerly and full of personality. Then, par for the course and much to Noe's chagrin, things start to go sideways. Mysterious men start showing up in town looking for a woman matching the boarder's description, trinkets start missing from her shop, and someone close to her gets some shocking news.  Is it going to be murder and mayhem in Keyhole Lake again, or is Noelle finally going to enjoy some R&amp;R? It's likely a safe bet to put your money on the mayhem.
