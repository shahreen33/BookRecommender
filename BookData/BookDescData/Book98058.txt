When Geena, Amber and Jazz's school is desperate for funds, the girls' formidable young auntie steps in with a fantastic idea for a fundraising Bollywood party. Swept up in the plans, the girls plot to deliver a real Bollywood actress for a live appearance. Sure their aunt will be thrilled with their plan, they've only got to overcome the fact that their would-be guest of honour is a penniless, faded recluse with a foul temper who decamps to their house and insists on being treated like a star. A superbly entertaining sequel to Bindi Babes by an up-and-coming star of our own list.
