What started as a chance encounter between the two in Puerto Vallarta, a weekend full of hot sex and mindless passion, has led to something more.Something deadly.Because Derek isn't the type of man to fall in love. He's not a man who sticks around.And he's definitely not in Mexico on vacation.Derek is a mercenary, a killer-for-hire, a man who does the ugly jobs for the highest bidder.Unfortunately for Alana and Derek, the highest bidder has the power to destroy whatever worlds they have created for themselves.The highest bidder can destroy everything.*This is a romantic suspense book, #2 in the Dirty Angels trilogy but can be read as a standalone novel*
