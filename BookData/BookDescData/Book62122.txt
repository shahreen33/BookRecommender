The purpose of this book is to show that the Apocalypse is a manual of spiritual development and not, as conventionally interpreted, a cryptic history or prophecy. The reader will find the complete solution of the Apocalyptic enigma, with proof of its correctness. As it is intended for the many, rather than for a few scholars, the author has kept within the limits of a small volume, avoiding everything mystical, scholastic and controversial, using plain, concise language, and employing technical terms only when they are required by the nature of the subject.A new translation of the Apocalypse is included which attempts no more than to reproduce the meaning of the original accurately and clearly in modern English. While this translation differs radically, in some respect, from the authorized version, the interpretation here offered is not based upon any peculiarities of the translator's work, or upon any mere matter of details, but rests broadly upon the undisputed meanings of the Greek text.
