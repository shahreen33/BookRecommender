I did it. I married a billionaire. My reasons are my own, but the last thing I expected was to feel owned. I may have taken vows, but I'm still determined to be me. Now his rules are taking over my world, but I'm not the kind of girl to just obey. There's only one problem: I might actually be falling for him... I have no idea how this marriage is going to go, but holding onto a piece of myself while succumbing to his dirty pleasures is shaping up to be the ride of a lifetime. Dirty Pleasures is the second book in The Dirty Billionaire Trilogy and should be read following Dirty Billionaire. Dirty Together, the conclusion of this filthy trilogy, will release on 1/12/2016.
