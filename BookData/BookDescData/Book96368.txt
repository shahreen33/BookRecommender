Multi-Award-Winning and Best-Selling Author, Speaker and Writing Coach.Willow is just your average sixteen-year-old girl. Okay, maybe not so average. She can heal animals. For her own safety, her veterinarian parents have made her promise not to use her powers. But sometimes her compassion just takes over, and she can't help ... well ... helping. Willow is a Droit, but hides her Droitism because people like her are feared and hated by those without special abilities. Two of Willow's schoolmates, rumored to be Droits, have simultaneously disappeared. When Willow's non-Droit friend, Rain, is targeted, Willow wonders whether she should get involved--even if that means putting herself in the line of fire. A mysterious new friend, Trae, just might be the key to unlock her courage.In the end, she has a choice: she can deny who she is or declare her ability to heal, but either way, her life will never be the same again.
