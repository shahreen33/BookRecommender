Internationally renowned Bible teacher Joyce Meyer offers encouragement and practical insight for overcoming life's problems and challenges by dealing with them according to God's Word.Have you ever felt you tried every solution on earth to solve a problem, but nothing worked? Have you ever wondered where the difficulties you face are coming from? Joyce Meyer has answers.In Your Battles Belong to the Lord, Meyer explains that once you recognize the devil--who is real and active in the world today--as your true enemy and the source of many of your struggles, you can overcome them and live a life of peace, freedom, faith and victory. When facing life's battles, there are certain things you must do for yourself, such as being diligent to study and apply God's Word, trusting Him, praying, helping others, and maintaining a positive attitude and a thankful heart. But there are other things only God can do. When you do your part, God does His-and He is always ready and eager to defend you and help you.In this fresh approach to the subject of spiritual warfare, Meyer focuses not only on the nature and strategies of the enemy, but also on the power and love of God, who always defeats the enemy and leads you to triumph. No matter how difficult your challenges are, if you have God with you, you have all you need to win every battle.
