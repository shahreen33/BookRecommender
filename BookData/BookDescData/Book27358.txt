Eclipse Series Limited Hardcover #11Hell freezes over......in the modest lakeside resort in the small town of Blissful Point, Massachusetts. Katherine has lived there for years with her husband James, a poet, and their cat Barney. Their lives are uncomplicated, happy and quiet—or so Katherine thought—until one summer morning when the dead body of a young boy is found floating in the lake. From the moment the child accidentally drown, Katherine watches as her husband slowly begins to lose his grip on reality, spiraling down helplessly into insanity. And then he's gone...Are there others out there, in the woods, in the snow, in the lake, waiting and watching and luring her toward the same madness that claimed James?
