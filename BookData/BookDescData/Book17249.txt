An honest and real re-telling of the adolescent struggle: blindly trying to understand the world, the people in it, our own place in it and ourselves whilst still trying to make as few insane, idiotic decisions as possible. This coming-of-age tale spliced with a tumultuous romance is told for young adults by a young adult. Though young readers particularly will love this book because it illustrates the problems, emotions, and decisions taken directly out of their own world, others outside this demographic will enjoy this book because, though we may age, we perpetually long for the same things we search for as teens: love and acceptance.
