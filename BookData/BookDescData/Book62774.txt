I named myself. I took the word animal out of their mouths, wore it like a badge of honor, then shoved it down their throats. I've fought for what I have. I see you coming before you even know you want a piece of me. In a city riddled with warring families, I'll rise up between them. My people, the broken souls I gather, will have power by the time I'm done with them.I protect mine.Him. My brother, Nix.Her. The girl that is the only home I've ever had. She knows me.I'm coming at you, sweetness. Stay ready.
