  
    Betrayal has taken Taylor far beyond my reach.
  
I can feel the bond stretched and twisted until itâ€™s on the verge of snapping. But I will find her. She is mine as I am hers, and nothing will stop me from recovering my queen. I will always come for her. If she is hurt, I will heal her. If she is scared, I will wrap my arms around her, my embrace her safe harbor.
  
    And as for the ones who took her?
  
I will destroy them all. Crossing the frozen heart of winter will be their final mistake. My fury will end the king beyond the mountain, and I will return to the winter realm with my queen by my side. A solid plan. One that would have worked. But when I reach the Gray Mountains, nothing is as it seems, and my mate faces a danger from the most insidious of foes - herself.
