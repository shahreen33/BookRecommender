'At 16, I pretended to fall in love with Alyssa.'Meet James and Alyssa, two teenagers facing the fears of coming adulthood. As their story is told through chapters which alternate each character's perspective, however, this somewhat familiar teenage experience takes a more nihilistic turn. With James's character becoming rapidly more sociopathic, they are forced to take a road trip that owes as much to Badlands as The Catcher in the Rye, and which threatens both their futures forever.One of the most talked about graphic novels of recent years, The End of The Fucking World marks Charles Forsman's UK debut.
