The Matchmaker’s Curse says if the mutant accepts the match, then his fated mate must die. If he doesn’t accept it, then he must die…  No one has yet survived the curse.   ~  The threat coming for Selena Irving has been stalking her family for years, ruining her parents’ lives and pushing her onto the warrior’s path. She’s the only female yet to qualify for the elite dark ops unit in the Army called the Red Team, and while that shielded her for a little while, the nightmare’s begun again. Now she’s caught the eye of an alpha male with super powers—her definition of trouble. Sexy-as-hell Bastion loves easily, laughs often, and cooks like a master chef. He’s also the only man to see through her defenses to the person she used to be…the woman she might have become had her past been different.  Bastion, changed against his will into a mutant warrior, is on a mission to find those responsible for stealing his life, intent on stopping their plans to unravel humanity. He wasn’t looking for a mate, but he bonds with Selena the first time he sees her, activating a curse neither of them can escape. His only chance to break it is to ruthlessly burrow into her secrets, forcing her to face her hidden scars, helping her heal before the danger headed her way can use her past to take her down—and everyone she loves with her.
