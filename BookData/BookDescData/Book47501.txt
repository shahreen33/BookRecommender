Oliver Ice, one of Boston University’s notorious hockey players, has been on my radar since I slammed into his rock-hard body during my first week of college, three years ago. He helped me to my feet, muttered an apology, and ran off after his girlfriend, dashing my hopes of a happily ever after.  Now, he’s the bartender where I work, and this time, very much single. Night after night I watch the tall, broad, and sexy right winger mixing drinks and being Mr. Personality, while I remind myself how horribly my last relationship ended.  But when Oliver overhears a private conversation, he offers to be the one thing I need more than anything--my pretend boyfriend at a dreaded family reunion.  One weekend was all it was meant to be.  How do I protect my fragile heart when the lines between fantasy and reality blur with our first kiss?   ICED can be read as a standalone.
