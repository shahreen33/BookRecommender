When Oliver is sent to Jackson State Kennel, he faces threats from the guards, the other dogs, the cats...and from his own mind.Oliver is a good dog. A family dog. But without warning, he’s sentenced to Jackson State Kennel, where he’s instantly placed on Death Row with the rest of his fellow inmates, awaiting a lethal appointment if salvation doesn’t come. He’ll need help escaping the Kennel, but when the stress of prison life builds, he starts escaping reality instead, imagining a fantasy world of cartoon friends. It’s time to break out . . . into a musical number? From the imaginations of writer Ryan Ferrier (Sons of Anarchy, Curb Stomp) and artist Daniel Bayliss (Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Jim Henson’s The Storyteller: Dragons), Kennel Block Blues is an inventive, heartfelt journey that explores themes of loss, mental illness, and the horrors both humans and animals endure when incarcerated.
