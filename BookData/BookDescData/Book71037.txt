Loving omega/beta couple needs help establishing a more alpha-like dynamic. Please reply ASAP.  Asher Townsend is big, sweet lug of a beta. When he's not running heavy equipment in his job at a local rock quarry, he’s spending his time romancing his omega boyfriend, Dakota, and trying to find ways to make their relationship stronger. All Asher wants is to love and be loved—romance is king, and he longs to make his partner feel just like royalty.  Dakota Coleman isn't your typical omega. He doesn't want hearts, flowers, or any of that other mushy sap. All he needs is a trusting relationship filled with good companionship and hot sex. Other than that, he’s happy in his high-pressure sales job and doesn’t need much else, although he has dreams of starting a family.  After Dakota's failed attempt to get his too-vanilla boyfriend to be more dominant and creative in the bedroom blows up in their faces, Asher suggests they contact Rent-a-Dom for an alpha who can teach him the skills he needs to fulfill Dakota's fantasies.  Guy Daily has three firm rules—no kissing, no cuddling, and no overnights. When he finds himself breaking all three with his intriguing new clients, he's not very happy about it. And yet, he also can't stop thinking about the two men who've caught his attention.  This 61k MMM book contains mpreg, D/s elements, and is intended for 18+ readers. Warning: Don't read unless you like sweet books about hot Doms, three people finding their way to make a family, heartfelt stories that make you smile, and a triple-sized amount of steam-filled passion. But then again, this is a Susi Hawke and Piper Scott collaboration—you already knew to expect that, didn’t you?
