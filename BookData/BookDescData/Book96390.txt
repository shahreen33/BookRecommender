Billy Bloo is stuck in goo. Who will help him, tell me who? Who'll unstick him from this goo? Would you? With madcap mania, a troupe of merry volunteers attempt to rescue poor Billy Bloo, only to find themselves stuck in goo too! Oh, what to do? This spry, slapstick comedy of errors will have you rolling with laughter (but hopefully not into any goo!).
