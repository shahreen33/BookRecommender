In this the final prequel to the blockbuster series, the story features the Rapture three-quarters of the way through the book and then follows characters such as Irene and Raymie (and others) up to heaven, where they are able to see events in the Tribulation from heaven's perspective. The story alternates between events on earth immediately after the Rapture (covering lots of things the authors wished they could have covered in the original volumes) and characters in heaven and how they view the chaotic events on earth.
