A marriage of convenience ... a crisis of faith ... a talking cat. What could possibly go wrong?In idyllic little Dumont, Wisconsin, the historic but financially troubled St. Alban's Episcopal Church has a new rector who plans to turn things around, a woman named Joyce Hibbard. Local architect Marson Miles puts two and two together and figures out that Mother Hibbard's husband is none other than his long-ago college friend, Curtis Hibbard, who is now a prominent New York attorney. And unless Marson is mistaken, Curtis and Joyce must have a marriage of convenience.Mother Hibbard wants to build a fabulous new church to replace the crumbling St. Alban's. Local philanthropist Mary Questman wants her friend Marson to design it. And Mother Hibbard's husband really wants the hunky young choir director, David Lovell. But then, in a god-awful development, someone turns up dead.It was murder, all right, and suspects abound. Once again, Marson's dashing husband, Brody Norris, steps into the role of amateur sleuth and sidekick to Sheriff Thomas Simms. And once again, Brody himself gets a bit of help--from Mary Questman's exotic cat, a chatty Abyssinian named Mister Puss.
