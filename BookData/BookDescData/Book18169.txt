"As I lay there being taken by two men, my orgasm swept through me, yet it was for another who had pleasured me only in the realm of my mind."Giuliana never dreamed life would lead her to where she is now-- serving as a courtesan in the swanky vampire theatre Sanguelascivia in Venice, Italy. Some days, she hates to admit, she loves her job-- what woman wouldn't enjoy being sexually pleasured in a variety of new ways every day? She has been serviced by some of the most mouthwatering men she has ever laid eyes on. And still other days, she cannot believe she has lowered herself to this. Then there are the Vampire patrons to whom she is expected to submit and service privately after the shows. Her life at Sanguelascivia is in severe contrast to the simple life she once knew with her husband and child. But she no longer allows herself to think of them. It is too painful to face the loss.Giuliana vowed she would never love again. That is, until she sees Vincenzo her first night at the theatre and something stirs deep within her. Night after night she aches as she watches him with other women, wondering when she will finally have her turn to be pleasured by him. The only way she is able to endure her performances with the other men-- and oft times women-- is to fantasize about him pleasuring her.Will she ever feel him against her skin, feel his lips hot upon hers, feel him moving inside of her?
