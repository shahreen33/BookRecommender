After an unusual and generally unhappy childhood, writing is all he has - apart from work. After his ninth book he is still getting rejection slips from publishers. No one likes rejection, least of all Reece. He hits on a plan, write a first person account on the inner workings of a Serial Killer's mind. Especially while the memory of the killing is still fresh. All it takes is Research! See for yourself why this book has had so many positive reviews - you will either love it or hate it but you won't forget it. Reece rocks!
