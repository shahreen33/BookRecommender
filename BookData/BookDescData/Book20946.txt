When Lana Matthews, a psychology major at Seattle University, is reluctantly dragged by her roommate to an exclusive S&M club called The Looking Glass, she is mesmerized by the displays of lust, curious about the unconventional props such as a wooden throne, a giant steel spider web, and a giant birdcage, and intimidated by the exhibition portion of the evening, a time when each Dom displays his unique talents. She unexpectedly wins an evening with the club's top performer, the elusive Dom 241, who satisfies her carnal desires and unleashes a primal urge deep inside her, a dark side of her that she never knew existed, and leaves her craving more of him.Enzio Salazar has been Lana's best friend since they were young, and although he confessed his love for her numerous times, she reaffirmed each time that she wanted to remain friends.The two of them are now attending the same university, but Enzio seems different at times, and Lana cannot figure out what has changed. When she notices a partially opened package in front of Enzio's dorm room, curiosity gets the best of her, and she takes it to her room, discovering a leather garment inside. She puts it on, silently complaining of its tightness, and notices two metal latches. Connecting them, she hears a chime and the latches become locked in place, making the outfit impossible to remove. Wondering why Enzio would order such an outfit, she is stunned to learn that he dabbles in S&M, and she realizes how little she actually knows about him, like where he works, or who he may be, other than her beloved Enzio.
