What do you do when your past comes back to haunt you? Fight back...  Life at Redwood Supernatural University is about as predictable as you could imagine a supe college would be- mean girls, douchebags, drama, and a lot of studying, but things are looking up. The Bitch Crew has started to leave me alone, and Justin has been expelled. With that nasty mess out of my way, it looks like I can finally focus on figuring out what is going on with my guys and our budding relationships and getting a hold of my powers.  That is until the nightmares that plague my dreams come to find me in my new life.  At least this time when I face my tormentor, I won’t be alone. I’ll have the support of my friends, a powerful supernatural, and six guys who are determined to keep me safe from my past.  I got this...I hope.
