   With devoted fans and a panty-melting gaze, Jayce of Feral Silence is an untouchable rockstar god. 
 Although she tries to be unbiased in her online reviews, amateur music critic Ailey can’t help swooning over Jayce’s musical genius. That doesn’t escape the notice of Neil, the guy Ailey’s been flirting with online. Ailey reassures him: She would never chase after a rockstar like some desperate groupie.  But when Ailey gets a summer internship at Jayce’s music label, her resolve is tested. Although she has strong feelings for Neil, she’s finding it impossible to resist her attraction to Jayce.  What happens when a rockstar god meets the one girl who sees beyond his cocky facade?  Feral Gaze is a sexy ménage rockstar romance. It is the first novel in the Feral Silence series but can be read as a standalone with a HEA.
