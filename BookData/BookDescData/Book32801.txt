The 35 patterns in Mindful Crochet include specially designed elements of repetition, color, and texture, which will help you relax, refocus, and unwind.Anyone who’s ever tried to master a new stitch or work out which granny squares should go where on an afghan will appreciate how crochet can totally engage your attention and harness your creativity. Being “in the moment” is an essential part of following a pattern, keeping your yarn on the hook, counting stitches, and remembering which color to use next. Emma Leith shows how these qualities can become a form of mindfulness practice, bringing you peace, calm, and a greater sense of well-being. There are projects you can make for yourself or your home, and others designed to be given as gifts. The satisfaction you’ll get from creating these lovely makes and seeing others appreciate them is another important way in which crochet can encourage a positive outlook and bring happiness. This book uses US crochet terms.
