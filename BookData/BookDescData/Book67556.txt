Yara Parmstone, Queen of the Dragon Shifters, is at war. Two of them—one among those she’s supposed to rule and an even darker, deadlier one.  The plan? Panic. The other plan? Steal back the goddess of the dragon shifters like the thief Yara has always been. If she doesn’t, the war will be lost and all shifters will die.  Even her three hot-as-sin favorites. That just won’t do.  With the help of a strange woman, Yara must stay one step ahead of the wars raging all around her to stay alive, to save the shifters, and to keep riding those horny dragons of hers.  Fans of T.S. Joyce and Thea Harrison will love QUEENS RIDE HORNY DRAGONS, the last book in Holly Ryan’s new scorching hot reverse harem series. Scroll up and one-click this book now for some serious heat!
