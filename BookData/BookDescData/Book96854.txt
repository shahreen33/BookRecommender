PermanentAn indefinite, everlasting and imperishable stamp.Like a tattooOne that would forever be with you to remind you of a single moment in time, or a person that touched you in some way.That was exactly what Jenny was to Sean.And no matter how hard he tried, he could never forget the one girl who would forever have his heart.A lifetime of friendship, shattered by one irreversible mistake.A choice that Jenny would forever regret, but only because it pushed away the one person she truly loved.A love so deep that they felt as if they were one.Years passed, and still that love remained deep…stamped with an unfading ink.When their paths cross after six years of longing, they are faced with a choice.Forget the past and let go of the heartache…giving in to the temptation that was always there.Or continue to torture themselves by avoiding what was always meant to be.Tattooed Hearts of endless love…Will it be enough or will the memories of their past create an unbreakable wedge between them.
