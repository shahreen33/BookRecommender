Time is not on Vince Indigo's side, but it should have been, since he practically invented it. Life had once been easy as one of the world's richest men, living on the luxurious island colony of Atopia, but lately the universe had found a rather nasty way to frustrate Vince's expectations. Something in his future had begun relentlessly hunting him down, and to live another day, Vince must figure out the ghost-in-the-machine that is trying to kill him, and why it is that his own creation has trapped him in a deadly spiral of death. His time is running out.All of the Atopia stories are 'sidequels' that begin at the same moment, running side by side in time, so that you can start by reading any of them and then read the others in any order you choose to slowly reveal the mystery and terrifying danger that connects them all. Atopia is a near future world without borders that balances on the brink of post-humanism and eco-Armageddon.
