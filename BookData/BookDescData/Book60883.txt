Nancy is a beautiful dragonfly. In fact, her friends say that she is the most beautiful dragonfly ever! Her friends are Freddy Tree Frog and Little Blue Baron. Together, they are best friends, and they always have fun. Nancy thought her life would be perfect forever, until one day ... While diving to catch a mosquito, Nancy doesn't notice Blackie the Widow Spider's web. Her wing gets caught, and in a panic, Nancy pulls herself loose. A piece of her beautiful wing is left behind, so she flies away and hides. She doesn't think her friends will like her, so she remains hidden. She expects her friends to laugh, but her best friends make her realize something important. They don't love Nancy because she's beautiful on the outside but because of a different reason altogether!
