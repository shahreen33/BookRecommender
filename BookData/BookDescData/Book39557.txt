Navigating this new landscape of deceit and manipulation is paramount if she is to stop hordes of blood-thirsty Faeries from invading Earth.Now that Ronan’s motivations are clear, Becca looks to Lochlan for help, but the sweltering tension between them is a dangerous distraction. He draws her in, like no man she has ever met, and lives his life by rules she never knew existed. He takes her deep into the treacherous Shadow Lands, where both her knowledge and courage will be tested—but will it be enough to take on a centuries old enemy hell-bent on death and destruction? To keep those she loves safe, Becca is willing to risk it all. In this captivating sequel to book 1 of The Fae Games Series, Jill Ramsower takes her readers from the streets of Belfast on a harrowing journey to the most dangerous corners of Faery, where fear is a lethal enemy and trust is a luxury few can afford.Author Note: In theory this book can be read as a stand alone novel, however, books 1 &amp; 2 of The Fae Games Series are a single story told in two books, and I would highly recommend reading both books in the proper order to appreciate the full story. Warning: This is NOT a Young Adult novel! It contain elements of graphic violence and mature sexual content.
