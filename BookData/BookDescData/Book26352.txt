Xana  I've never needed a guy to be happy. A few close friends were all I really needed.  Until him.  From the moment we met, he was all I could think of. I let him into my world more than anyone else, giving him all of me.  Sometimes life doesn't go according to plan. Sometimes we're left picking up the pieces. But even broken, I'll never stop loving him.
