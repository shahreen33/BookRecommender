"I want you to be my Valentine."  Ingrid Harris has been friends with her housemates Ade Olatunji, Choi Ye-Jun, and Boyd "B. B." Bigelow for years, so she thinks the request a safe one to ensure, for once, she has a date for the day of loveâ€”no pressure, no expectations beyond the day. But the three men call her bluff and reveal they've been ready for the word "go" for a very long time, challenging her to determine if she, herself, is ready and willing to do something a little more dangerous: give her heart to all three men, and for longer than a night.
