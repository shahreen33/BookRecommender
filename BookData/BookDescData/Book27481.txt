Just when they thought it was safe to leave the drive-in, the survivors of the Orbit's weekly All Night Horror Show discover that their old world has been reduced to a single cracked highway surrounded on all sides by a prehistoric jungle filled with man-eating dinosaurs. For a while, Jack and his friends are content to make the best of life in the Stone Age—until they meet a sexy martial arts expert from Nacogdoches, Texas, named Grace who wants to find out what's at the end of the road.  Now things really get weird as they encounter a town where public suicide is encouraged, a forest of old movie posters, movie mags, and carnivorous film, and Popalong Cassidy—a man-monster cowboy with a television head and a taste for human munchies—whose church of film and pain is presided over by the alien drive-in gods: the Producer and the Great Director.  Even more outrageous than the horrifying original, The Drive-In 2 is a delightfully down-and-dirty romp through the dark backcountry of our own imagination, the kind of stuff that nightmares—and B movies—are made of it truly is not just another one of them sequels.
