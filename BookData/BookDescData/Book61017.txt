They say everything's bigger in Texas. But these Irish brothers beg to differ.  My brother Keenan and I haven't seen Aunt Molly in years. My father’s beloved, but eccentric younger sister had moved from Ireland to Texas, of all places. But now, we’re saddened and surprised to learn that Molly has passed away and left the two of us her Texas ranch. Animals and all.  We have no idea what to do to maintain a ranch. But the truth is, Keenan and I are bored. We’ve worked our ways up in the world and make tons of money in our shared business, and the idea of doing something so wildly different sounds like it could be fun. After all, what do we have to lose?  Well, the answer turns out to be our hearts. When our stunningly beautiful and curvy new neighbor, Delia, drops in with a homemade pie, we’re both swooning. And when she rescues us from an incident involving a chicken and a Pez dispenser, both of us are tripping over ourselves to win hers in return.  But this feisty brunette filly seems to have no interest in being corralled by one of us. In fact, she seems to want both of us to take a ride…  This 30,000 word MFM menage romance is a standalone with no cheating, no cliffhangers, and a happy ever after. Both guys are all about pleasing one lucky lady this St. Patrick's Day - there's no m/m.
