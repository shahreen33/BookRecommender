It should’ve been so easy…  Blissful Breneaux has spent her career catching troublesome ghosts for a covert government agency. But all that changes the day she is fired.  She has one shot to redeem herself— track down the biggest, baddest spirit the agency has ever known and haul him in.  Too bad that ghost resides in the one place Blissful despises—Haunted Hollow, Alabama. It’s the tourist attraction from hell. Blissful is knee deep in a foreign place—and it’s not just the deer head trophies and the giant pickup trucks that are throwing her for a loop.  When a local reveals he has information that could save her career, Blissful is all ears. But when he winds up murdered, Blissful becomes a suspect.  Thrust into a murder mystery, Blissful teams up with a pair of amateur ghost-hunting grannies who know more about town dynamics than hunting spirits. Then there’s the handsome bed and breakfast owner who’s keeping more secrets than he’s revealing. But Blissful is determined to discover what the murder victim knew. She’ll hunt for clues all over town. Will the hunt save her career or place her in the clutches of the Haunted Hollow murderer?  Find out now!
