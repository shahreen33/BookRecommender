The whole family--19 cousins and their parents--descends on a rented house in a strange town for the holidays. And then their frightening and mysterious Uncle Herkimer arrives. Each night for twenty-four nights, he returns and tells his nieces and nephews a Christmas story: the Christmas he won the lottery; the Christmas he was conscripted to work in a bean factory; the Christmas he was evicted from an ancient Anasazi ruin. The incredulous cousins meanwhile try to discover the truth behind Uncle Herkimer's absurd stories...and end up with ridiculous Christmas stories of their own. Funny and irreverent, "Twenty-five Christmases (More or Less)" is a delightful book that can be appreciated any time of year.
