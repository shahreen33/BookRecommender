Exclusive Extra: Newsletter Exclusives E-BookThis exclusive collection of short stories is set in three of Nalini Singh's worlds:Psy-Changeling: A world inhabited by Psy, who have phenomenal powers of the mind, but are forbidden to feel emotion; changelings who can shift into wolves and leopards and more, and who are as wild and emotional as the Psy are cold; and humans, caught between the two powerful races but with an important role to play in the world.Guild Hunter: A dark, dangerous world ruled by archangels as cruel as they are beautiful, with vampires as their servants, and human guild hunters trained to bring home vampires who seek to break their contracts with the archangels.Rock Kiss: A contemporary rock and roll world featuring the band Schoolboy Choir.These are slices of life that show us glimpses of the characters and worlds away from the main storylines, a peek through the curtain of their ongoing lives. (Put together for Nalini's fans, a number of the stories do stand alone if you'd like to try her worlds).
  Note from Nalini
I've written many short stories for you over the years, so many in fact that not every reader has managed to read every story. They've been scattered over multiple newsletters and the website.When we began to put them together into a single file, we discovered the stories came to roughly 275 pages. Forty-one different stories in the Psy-Changeling, Guild Hunter, and Rock Kiss worlds.While I was checking the file, I ended up reading some of the stories and they left me with a smile on my face. I hope you enjoy the collection just as much, and that you now have an easy way to read your favorites - and if you've missed a story, it should be in there.If it isn't, I'm sure it'll make it's way into the next volume in another few years time. Also, we didn't include the deleted scenes in this volume, as the collection was already a big one. They may turn up as a surprise another year. :-)
