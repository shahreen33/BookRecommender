He is the one that never looks her way.He is handsome and strong.He is rough around the edges and mean.He is everything she’s ever wanted.He doesn’t even know she exists.Her life is a joke.She doesn’t step on cracks in the sidewalk.She laughs at inappropriate times.She talks when she shouldn’t. She is clumsy and trips on air.She is finally on his radar.God help her now.
