Derek is slowly beginning to crack, the pressure piling high as the bodies begin to fall, all out war is at his door as Ridgmont seeks his restitution at the barrel of a gun.His allies are dwindling as the world begins to fall into the hands of the growing army of Infected, the once safe embrace of the British Isle now a teeming stagnant waste, awash with the blighted and the bodies of the dead.As London begins to crumble so too does any hope of a new dawn bringing salvation as the world falls ever deeper into an infectious embrace.Will Britain and Broadhead survive the Quarantine, or like America and China before them, will it spell their destruction.
