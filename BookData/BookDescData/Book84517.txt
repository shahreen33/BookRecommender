Ari is fat, ugly and unlovable. At least that’s what she thinks. Ari’s father left when she was twelve leaving her mother emotionally unavailable. When Ari was a high school freshman, she was raped; and since has developed depression, anxiety, and an obsession with death and suicide. Sarah is Ari’s cousin and only real friend, and though still a teenager, she could easily pass for twenty-five—which she often did, until she was arrested for selling drugs. Newly released from prison, Sarah struggles to adjust to legal weed and reconnecting with her cousin. But old habits die hard, and when Ari’s mother is called out of town, Sarah sees an opportunity to unload a bunch of E by bullying Ari into having an epic party. That night sets off a chain of events that exposes secrets, lies, and thought-to-be buried truths as Ari and Sarah embark on a drug-fueled, hormone-driven, chain-smoking journey of self-discovery, enlightenment, and revenge.
