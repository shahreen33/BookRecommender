  Every day, my cage gets smaller.
If I’d fought harder before, maybe we wouldn’t be in this mess now, with enemies on every side and my sugar being rationed.
  I won’t make that mistake again. From now on, it’s only badassery for me.
First, I need to solve the Ringmaster’s riddles and survive the Council’s tests. Then, I have to break my Qilin free but avoid letting the monster loose.
  Our future is balancing on the tip of my horn, and I still don’t have my shift together.
Good thing I have six sexy men to help me with that. I’ll need magic from all of them if we’re going to stop this war before it starts.
  I’m Carlyle Licorne, and I have some shanking to do.
