The event that shook one small town to its core was never solved. The domino effect of one person’s crime going unpunished is beyond measure.  He’s no saint.  Dover ‘Collector’ Ragnes rides with only five brothers at his back. Nomads with no place to call home, they never stay in one place too long. Together, they are the Devil’s Due MC, and their only purpose is to serve justice their way for unsolved crimes everywhere they go.  She’s not afraid to call herself a sinner.  Emerson Flint still remembers the loss of her elementary school best friend. She is all grown up, but the memories still haunt her of the missing girl. Surrounding herself with men at the tattoo shop, she never questions her safety. Her life is her art. Her canvas is the skin of others.  However, danger is at her door.  Will Dover overcome the history he shares with Emerson in time? Will Emerson lead him to the retribution he has always sought?  Love, hate, anger, and passion collide as the time comes, and the devil demands his due.  Each book in the Devil's Due MC is a stand alone, full length novel. Contains adult content, language, and violence not suitable for readers under the age of 18. This is not an exact depiction of life in a motorcycle club, but rather a work of fiction meant to entertain. (Paperback page count is 324 in a 5x8 sizing)
