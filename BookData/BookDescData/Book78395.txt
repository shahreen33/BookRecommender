I had to step up, take over,Save her from herself,From him.A jerk who didn't deserve her.But I sure as Hell don't eitherShe's too sweet, too soft, too kind.A broken shell of the woman she once was. But now, there's more on the line,She's in too deep.And I'll be damned if I ever give upOn putting her back together,Piece-by-piece,Owning every ounce of the woman,Who stole my heart.
