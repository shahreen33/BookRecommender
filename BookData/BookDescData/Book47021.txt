A chance encounter with a green-eyed stuntman sets off a chain of events that turns her perfect, little world upside down.Short on options and desperate for adventure, she joins the traveling carnival for the summer.Thrust into a world full of drama, deception, and secrecy, Evangeline tries to find herself and protect her heart in the process. Sebastian McAllister is cursed.He knows better than to think otherwise. He’s content to live out the rest of his life traveling the country as one of the four Sons of Eastlake, seeking thrills the only way he knows how. The one thing he doesn’t see coming is the spoiled blond with stars in her eyes. The only problem is, the more time he spends with her, the more hope starts to stir in his dormant heart.Too bad hope is a dangerous thing when you’re a McAllister.
