LOVE STRUCK &amp; HEART BEATEN Poison Ivy's long charmed the men of Gotham City, but now she's the one losing her mind. Captivated with a plant-based alien inside S.T.A.R. Labs, she weds her cause to his and undertakes a Plantifest Destiny that leaves no room for humans--not even her sisters-in-crime. Catwoman and Harley Quinn try to tear their friend's heart away from the alien menace, but they'll all find out how slowly the threat of love dies.An underworld plot to kidnap Catwoman and pluck her beloved Batman's identity from her mind shakes the Sirens. As the sworn enemy of Ivy and Harley's ex the Joker--whom she swears she's over--the Dark Knight will always divide the three, and Catwoman's feelings have been barely tolerated to this point. So when Talia Al Ghul and Zatanna rush in to help save Selina, it's not exactly clear who's doing the saving and who's doing the hurting.Collects GOTHAM CITY SIRENS #14-19
