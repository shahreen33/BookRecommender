Somos para siempre. Juntos somos una locura One’s my salvation, the other the captor of my heart. Love shouldn’t come in threes, so why is this happening to me? They say love is spilled from the veins and onto the skin of lovers. Bleed, bleed, bleed until they set you free. My blood will shed until one wins. They’re destined to destroy one another, and I’m caught in the middle. Will there be anyone left?
