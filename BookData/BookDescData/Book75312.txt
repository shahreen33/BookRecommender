The mixed-up fairy tale fun continues in book five of the Fairy Tale Reform School series by award-winning author Jen Calonita! With Rumpelstiltskin still on the loose and the citizens of Enchantasia on high alert, things at Fairy Tale Reform School have been a little...stressed. So when Maxine finds an old lamp that turns out to house an overly-enthusiastic genie, she knows exactly what to do; wish for everyone to be happy! But the wish doesn't manifest itself the way she expectsâ€¦suddenly, ex-villains are singing, trolls and ogres are getting along, and the whole school is more focused on putting on a musical than figuring out how to deal with Rumpelstiltskin. Can Gilly help Maxine break the spell before it's too late?
