My feisty neighbor confronts me on the street, accusing me of spying on her with my telescope.If only I’d known I could’ve been watching her in her bedroom, I hate a missed opportunity.But I’m not about to let this beauty past me now.Her curves are calling out to be touched by me.Turns out she’s working for my ex and will try to stand between me and what’s rightfully mine.She can try all she wants, I always take what I want.And right now, I want her.
