They really aren’t on the same page; hell, should they even be on the same book?  Alice is tired of being Ms. Boring; the stigma is affecting her personal life as well as her career, so she takes the proverbial bull by the horns and asks Colt Colburn to help her get through her audacious bucket list. Colt isn’t the playboy everyone assumes him to be; actually, he’d love a relationship – if and when he finds a woman who can accept his hectic schedule. He has every intention to ask Alice for a date – as soon as business needs permit, of course. She isn’t a good option; as a friend of the family, she shouldn’t even be on his radar, but he’s prepared to give it a try…  But then she shocks the hell out of him by asking him to become her sex toy for the sake of an article she needs to write.  Everything should be ideal, as long as neither of them wants more…  --  On top is an (hilarious) adult romance, with sexual situations and strong language. It’s part one out of two.
