Thatâ€™s right: Charlie has it in his head that heâ€™s going to get hitched. That is, unless Charlieâ€™s irascible aunt, her sixteen-year-old niece, and their visions of a dead womanâ€”her throat slit from ear to earâ€”have anything to say about it.With a bit of romance and full measure of murder, Snake Dreams, the thirteenth in James D.
