Secrets can’t hide in daylight…  Hudson, Valen, Sylvain, and Marcus revealed their secret to Briar Hale, and she astonished them.  The four vampires hadn’t expected her to handle their revelation so easily, but Briar is a scientist and recognizes there are all manner of creatures in the world—some benign, some predatory, and some, like the brothers’ maker, pure evil.  Caught in Asher’s sights, Briar fights not only to stay alive, but to stay sane. Asher is in her head, whispering doubts and bringing to light her vampires’ hidden pasts. He shows her everything—every bloody, terrible, heart-wrenching moment.  But she is stronger than Asher and the horrors stalking her vampires. Briar loves them, and she won’t give them up, nor will she let them give up on each other.  With war on the horizon, Briar, Hudson, Valen, Sylvain, and Marcus will have to fight Asher and the secrets threatening to rise up and destroy them.  ***Shadow of Thorns is the second book in the Midnight's Crown Trilogy.***
