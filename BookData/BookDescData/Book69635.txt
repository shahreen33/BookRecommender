It all came down to me.  The one who followed the rules, never went looking for trouble – I kept to myself. I just wanted to take care of my family. To not constantly look over my shoulder, worried about the things that went bump in the night.  I just wanted to survive.  But that wasn’t meant to be.  As luck – or fate, or something – would have it, the trouble found me.  I followed a rabbit through the wreckage of a half-ruined world to get back what was mine, and wound up at the end of it.  In Wonderland.  But there’s nothing magical about it.  (While Wonder does feature a central love story, it is not a contemporary romance novel)
