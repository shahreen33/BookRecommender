Plato's dialogues, updated for the age of social media and short attention spans. Socrates hangs out with his old gang - Plato, Glaucon, Thrasymachus and the rest - but also meets new characters including Madonna, George W. Bush, Richard Dawkins, Hamlet and an extremely well-meaning robot.Don't count on it teaching you any philosophy, but it might make you laugh if you have a sufficiently warped sense of humor.
