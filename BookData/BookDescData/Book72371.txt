Bait.That's all she is.Nothing more.Nothing else.And that's why she's wanted,And in danger.Lauren Owens is so much more.She's everything.Falling for her was never my intention.But, I couldn't resist,Her charm,Her vulnerability,Her spirit and drive,And her unimaginable innocence.And that's exactly why my father wants her, For his own gain.Now, it's up to me to take him down,Stop him once and for all,Protecting her every step of the way.Saving her would mean only one thing:I won't get to love her.
