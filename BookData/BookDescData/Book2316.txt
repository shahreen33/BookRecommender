It was supposed to be simple...Boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl. Girl, slightly more cynical, takes a little longer. And they lived happily ever after, right?It definitely wasn't supposed to end the way it did. For fans of Colleen Hoover, Jojo Moyes and Eleanor Rowell, Charlie and Pearl is a breathtaking story of unconventional love, of finding that spare part you never knew you were missing and what happens when love simply isn't enough."This is an incredible story. As long as you don't mind getting kicked in the gut, shedding a few tears, and having your heart squeezed at the pain the characters go through, you'll love this book. It's simple, yet elegant. Painful, yet heartwarming. It is put simply, an incredible story told well." Mark Paxson
