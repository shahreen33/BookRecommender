Hadley Hunter is learning about life, love … and being a witch. She has a hot and hunky boyfriend, new friends, and family she didn’t know existed until recently. Her plate is full. Life gets even busier when a Detroit grim reaper named Aisling Grimlock hits Moonstone Bay for her honeymoon. Aisling is loud, brash … and pregnant. Unfortunately, she’s not one of those women who gets happy and develops a glow at the notion of a new baby. When a body turns up on the docks, Hadley decides to help her boyfriend Galen investigate. All she knows for certain is that the murder looks ritual thanks to the tiki mask left behind … and the gaping wound in his chest. Since she’s bored and limited, Aisling latches on to Hadley and volunteers to help. That means zipping around the island and investigating the local cult that lives in the forest. Aisling has specific ideas about what should be done. Hadley has her own ideas. And Galen wants them both to steer clear of his investigation. Things are bound to collide … and they do in spectacular fashion. What happens when Detroit’s mouthiest reaper and Moonstone Bay’s newest witch collide? You’re about to find out. The stakes are high, death is in the air … and a few more secrets are about to be unveiled. Strap in, because things are about to get freaky.
