In the wake of Vine's death, Milk and Vine arose to satiate our desire for this timeless, authentic comedy. Following in the footsteps of its predecessor, Milk and Vine II expands the Vine-poetry canon to include over 100 more vines, as well as a foreword by Karl from Online, a Viner who amassed hundreds of millions of vine loops and created many viral vines like "F*ck me Jerry" and "I'm quitting vine because someone commented on my post saying that I look like a piece of broccoli so goodbye forever." Several classic vines grace these pages like oovoo javer, cam &amp; colin, ninki minjaj, chicken strips, jessie and ari, x games, michael with a b, and more! Milk and Vine II is perfect for your coffee table, rainy days with friends, or as a gift for any teen. Grab a copy today, and RIP Vine. NOTE: Explicit language inside, as well as credit to all the viners!
