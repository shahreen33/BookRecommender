CASEYI’ve been putting my son first for so long that I’ve forgotten how to be me. Each monotonous day bleeds into the next, and I feel like I’m struggling to keep my head above water. But a kiss at the top of a Ferris wheel with a man I barely know changes that.Jay reminds me that I used to be bold. Vivacious. Funny.Strong.Now if only I could convince him his past mistakes don’t define the man he is today.JAYI can perform over a dozen illusions with a simple sleight of hand, but I can’t make the felony on my record disappear. The last thing I should be doing is hanging around a young single mom and her kid.But Casey doesn’t know that I’ve been watching her. That I want her for myself. That I’m addicted to her dimples, her tenacity, her fierce love for her child.If I was a better man, I’d leave her alone, but she pulls off the biggest magic trick of all time: making me believe I’m a good guy.
