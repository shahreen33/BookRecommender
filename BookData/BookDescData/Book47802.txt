For 30 years, FoxTrot cartoonist Bill Amend has been injecting his quirky brand of family humor into America’s newspapers and bookshelves while earning a reputation as an authority at signing overly well-read, dog-eared paperbacks.With Mother Is Coming, the first FoxTrot collection in more than two years, fans young and less young will get 144 crisp and pristine color pages featuring the latest in Fox family chaos, with the usual forays into math, science, gaming, geekdom, and pop culture. Fox children Jason, Paige, and Peter, parents Andy and Roger, and pet iguana, Quincy, all make appearances as they battle such challenges as schoolwork, family dinners, social media, and how to climb theater stairs in a BB-8 costume.
