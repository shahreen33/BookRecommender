Panther shifter, Winter Donovan, has her life all planned out: claiming marks, marriage, cubs, and pledging to the Red Havoc Crew. But when the man she cares for chooses another, her life gets caught in a tailspin. A new crew announcement could mean a change in her stars, but there is a catch. It’s the Blackwing Crew, and is run by fire-breathing dragon shifters. Not only that, but when she finds her bravery to travel to the Smoky Mountains and apply, the crew has somehow attracted the most damaged and terrifying shifters in the world. And one of those has his sexy eyes on her.  Logan is decisively deadly when it comes to protecting the fledgling Blackwing Crew, but the grizzly in his middle is a monster. He’s here for one reason, and one reason alone – to go out fighting. But the quiet beauty, Winter, has him wishing he could be saved. When the alpha of the new crew, Dark Kane, finds out what Logan really is, the choice of life and death may not be up to him anymore. And now he and Winter will have to go to war if they want a chance at forever.   Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets.
