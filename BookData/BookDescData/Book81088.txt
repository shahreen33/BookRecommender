But then the son of a prominent and influential farmer is found dead and an old acquaintance of Ally’s is suspected of the murder. Ally’s investigative nature takes over and she goes on a search to find the killer. She tries to tread carefully so she doesn’t step on Detective Luke Elm’s toes, but her investigation leads her down a path straight towards danger.  Will Ally be able to see through the cracks and reveal the murderer before it’s too late? Or will her sleuthing alienate Detective Luke and ruin their developing relationship?
