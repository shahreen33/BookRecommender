Cami Richardson is good at chasing away the men in her life: first Gavin Kinkaid, a former classmate she'd helped to bully, and later, her husband who left her widowed and a single mom. Now all she wants is to bring a smile back to her eight-year-old son. What she doesn't expect is for Gavin to become her new neighbor. Gavin wants to settle down after serving in the Air Force and mend the separation between him and his dad. What he never counts on is his changing feelings when he sees Cami as a kind woman instead of his former adversary. When Cami's son blindsides them both during the Christmas season, is their reunion at risk or will it grow stronger? The Kindred Lake Series, in which Christmas Love Year Round is Book 1, is about rediscovering the beauty of love especially in unexpected places, strengthening family ties, and finding harmony in the small town of Kindred Lake.
