Its name is Doomsday. It came from the Phantom Zone, where the Man of Steel had banished it once before. Bigger. Deadlier. Capable of killing life on Earth.   Only Superman can stop it. But even that is not the end. Evil is in its blood. And when that blood is spilled, the innocent will fall — and Superman himself will discover the monster within. The Last Son of Krypton may become a destroyer of worlds himself, leaving the Earth without its greatest protector.   Superman and his allies each must make a choice. If they unleash the monster, will they lose the man? Is this Earth's last shot at salvation, or are Superman and everyone he cares about…Writers Greg Pak, Charles Soule, and Scott Lobdell with artists Tony S.
