An urgent call brings Rachel Falconer, naturalist and TV presenter, from her Yorkshire home to manage Kestrel House, her father Paul-s botanical research institute on Dartmoor. There she meets Michael, her old rival at grammar school and now a respected archaeologist; the hostile Daniel, once her colleague and lover; the truculent forester, Colin; and Leo, computer wizard and Don Juan. As Rachel puts Kestrel House back on its feet, and she and Michael begin a new, adult, loving relationship, her past returns to haunt her. One phone call, made several years before in Brazil, has set off a devastating chain of events. On Dartmoor an unknown enemy is closing in - someone who knows her secrets, a bitter adversary skilled in deceit and armed with an intimate knowledge of fire.
