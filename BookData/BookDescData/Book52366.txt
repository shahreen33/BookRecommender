Twas the weekend before Christmas, when all through the North End Not a Walsh had his life together, not even his friends;  The parties were planned by the foodies with care, In hopes that Wes and Erin would soon find their way there;  The men were stressing over last minute shopping lists and plans, While the ladies were busy with work and nesting and finding the right paella pans;  When out in the dining room there arose such a clatter, The Halsted dogs sprang from their beds to see what was the matter;  They whistled and shouted and called each other names, While the secrets and announcements and surprises quickly came;  So onto another adventure they flew With the sleigh full of Walshes, and the Commodore tooâ€”  As they continued arguing and clamoring around, Down the road an unexpected visitor came with a bound;  But it wasn't long until couples were all nestled snug in their beds, With new memories of steamy holiday nights dancing in their heads.
