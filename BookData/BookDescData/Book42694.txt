Miss Wilkinson lives with her adored cat, Tommy Douglas, whose eyes glow a brilliant orange. But Tommy Douglas is 17 years old. When he becomes ill and dies in Miss Wilkinson’s arms, she buries him in the garden and plants a rosebush on his grave. Despite her determination to keep busy, grief and loneliness make it difficult for Miss Wilkinson to enjoy life. Then one morning, after a particularly troubled night, she discovers that the rosebush she planted has bloomed with brilliant orange flowers — the color of Tommy Douglas’s eyes.
