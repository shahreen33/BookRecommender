Before they met with Luke and Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine, the closest Han Solo and Chewbacca came to galactic politics was a few choice maneuvers around Imperial blockades. Instead, their life was spent rambling through the Outer Rim, flying fast, and taking quick jobs to get from place to place-along with a few close calls along the way This new series follows Han and Chewie throughout this time in fully-illustrated, easy-to-read lighthearted adventures, created especially with young readers in mind.
