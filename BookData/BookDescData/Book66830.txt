I’ve always heard that you should marry someone that loves you more than you love them – that if you do this, you’ll always be happy.Did I follow that advice? No. Am I happy? No. And is Finn happy? No. I’m stuck in a marriage with an ex-Marine suffering from PTSD. I’m not sure we’re in love anymore. We have a baby who brings us both joy—but it’s not enough. I feel like my life is crumbling around me and I’m struggling to keep the pieces together. Someone from my past has sauntered back in quietly, unknowingly. To my surprise, the attention is what I was craving.I have to make a decision. Do I stay and fight, or leave, when the idea of escape is beautiful and tempting?I’m always the one who loves more.
