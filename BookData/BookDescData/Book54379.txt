Love that says something, instead of just looking like it.  Love you can always trust to feel like home.  For both of them, it’s something that has always been just outside of their peripheral, something to be observed rather than experienced. A depth of feeling reserved for people who were “into” that, those with a different outlook, those more… deserving.  Until their paths cross.  Lines are crossed.  And maybe the stars are crossed too, because the connection and chemistry are so off the charts that they can’t stay away from each other, can’t avoid it... even if they think they should.
