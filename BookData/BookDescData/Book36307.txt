“Given Cameron Waters’ history of traumas in and outside of foster care, we believe he was acting in self-defense toward his foster parent’s abusive behaviors…We see a great potential of rehabilitation in him. He’s a good kid,” Garry argues."Good kids don't hit their foster parents and destroy other people's property."My stomach drops as I look down at my fingers, twitching like spiders, wishing they could climb up the walls and disappear. I don’t remember everything that happened. It was self-defense. Wasn’t it? He started beating on me first. Right? Would they believe that?At what point does flight become fight? Cameron has reached his threshold. Will he run? Or will he fight back? On a journey of finding family, peace, and love, he must first learn to win the battle in his head.
