"I'm Sadie and I'm nearly nine. Mum's a childminder, but she doesn't have to mind me. I can mind myself, easy-peasy." But when Sadie's mum goes down with flu Sadie finds herself spending her half-term holiday not only looking after her mum but helping to mind the babies too. There's three-year-old Gemma, two-year-old Vincent, baby Clive and Sadie's own baby sister, Sara. But, "us girls have got to stick together", so with Sadie's help all the mums take a turn. On Wednesday Gemma's mum takes them to her police station, on Thursday they go to an office and on Friday they go to Clive's mum's chocolate shop.
