Sam Vives is a normal boy who lives with his family in Barcelona. Then one rainy day he suddenly finds himself fighting for his life aboard a pirate ship in the early 18th century. Book 1 of the “Displacers” series for Teens / Young Adults.Author's note -This tale was my first attempt at serious writing. It started life as a short story, written for the son of a friend and simply named after him. It was first published as the novella "The Pirate's Diamond" some years after that. As my writing style developed so too did the book and in time it became the novel "The Pirate's Challenge". "The Pirate's Heir" is the result of expansion and improvement, and it is finally the book it should be.
