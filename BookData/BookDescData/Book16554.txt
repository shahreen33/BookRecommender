Thunder Canyon NuggetA Season of Thanks and GivingNext time you pass Major Forrest Traub on the street, make sure you give him a real Thunder Canyon-style welcome! The handsome soldier hasn't smiled much since moving here from Rust Creek Falls, but this hasn't deterred our favorite do-gooder, Angie Anderson. Angie's convinced she's met the man she's going to marry.Forrest sees Angie as a rosy-eyed optimist, too young and innocent for a man who's lived through Iraq. Yet her irresistible warmth may actually be thawing his hardened heart. Suddenly she's got him volunteering with teens, arranging holiday events, even—gasp—smiling. Can Angie's unwavering faith rescue Forrest from himself? Give thanks, loyal readers, for your many blessings—and hope that Angie and Forrest can find theirs!
