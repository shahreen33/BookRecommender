God Hates Astronauts is back with a new story perfect for new readers. NASA has sponsored a group of small-minded, self-centered, and incompetent 'super heroes' to help them regulate illegal space travel by wayward farmers. Unfortunately, these 'heroes' are very bad at their jobs and their negligence leaves the planet Earth on the brink of intergalactic invasion! Now it's up to a guy with a ghost cow head, a Chicago cop with robot arms, and an ex-bartender with a magic ring to stop the invading space crab army!
