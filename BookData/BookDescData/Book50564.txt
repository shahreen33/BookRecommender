In this major new book John Limon examines the various ways American authors have written in an age increasingly dominated by science. He focuses in particular on Charles Brockden Brown, Edgar Allen Poe, and Nathaniel Hawthorne--three highly articulate and alarmed witnesses to the great crisis in modern intellectual history, the professionalization of science. It was, Limon argues, especially difficult for American writers to face this crisis because, since America had been born in an age of expanding scientific consciousness and thus no appeal could be made to traditional, pre-scientific values.
