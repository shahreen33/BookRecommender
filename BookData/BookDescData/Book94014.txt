A mom indulges her son’s fantasy play while gently steering him toward bedtime in a raucous ode to imagination."Dinnertime!" calls Mommy. Well, dinosaurs don’t have dinnertimes! They eat whatever they like (gobble, crunch!), make a dreadful mess, and hate to take baths and wear pajamas (where would their tails go?). Dinosaurs are much too big to play nicely—they rampage and stomp around and knock things down! But maybe they’d listen to a bedtime story, if it’s ROARY. . . . With exuberant illustrations merging bedtime routines with a little boy’s fantasy world—and showing Mom’s role in both—this ode to dinosaurs, wild imaginations, and cleverly won bedtime snuggles is sure to get roars of approval from kids and parents alike.
