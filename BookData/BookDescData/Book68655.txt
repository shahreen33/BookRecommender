The National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh has been described as one of the most distinguished of the smaller galleries of Europe. It houses the national collection of European and English paintings, drawings, prints and sculpture, from the 14th century to 1900, as well as the national collection of Scottish art in the same categories. Since 1946 it has also exhibited 31 masterpieces from the Bridgewater House collection, which have been deposited on loan by the Duke of Sutherland; these include notable groups of works by Raphael, Titian, Poussin and Rembrandt.The 48 colour plates in this volume illustrate works by all these painters, as well as other outstanding pictures from the Gallery's own collection. The notes on each picture, by the Director of the Gallery, should help to increase a visitor's enjoyment of these splendid paintings.
