Bev and Carol are back and looking for a new adventure! This time, they fly off to the Seychelles to teach students of the National Youth Service. They are provided with a beautiful house on Mahe and commute to work on the tiny island of Ste. Anne in a World War II landing craft. Lush, sunny and colourful, the Seychelles is the perfect setting for two girls on the lookout for inspiration and fresh experiences, so why not join them? See the sights, find out about life in the Indian Ocean, and enjoy the madness. Fuelled by fish, rice and South African rum, Bev and Carol tour the islands on an ancient motorbike in their free time, discovering paradise and what lies beyond. There are giant spiders, heart-stopping bus rides and a tangled expatriate community, against a volatile political backdrop. Put your feet up and dive into Bev and Carol's chaotic world, where common sense and spontaneity are often at odds. You'll see what makes them tick and probably have a lot of laughs along the way. 'Stranded in the Seychelles' - could it be this much fun?"
