Sequel to Bridal Pact Andi signed up for the Bridal Pact, but what with having to dissolve her possibly sabotaged mismatch and being kidnapped by extremists determined to wreck the Earth-Phaeton warrior alliance, her space adventure sucks big-time. But before she can catch the next shuttle back to Earth, she's claimed by two new suitors, the dominant Rodin and the happy-to-try-it Tamin. The doctors come as a pair, one warrior providing the discipline she didn't know she craved and the other lightening her bruised heart. But bonding to not one but two alien warriors? If only Andi dares to try. Reader Advisory: This story has graphic sexual language and scenes-no closed bedroom doors (or other rooms) here! An adult scifi romance from Ellora's Cave Publisher's Note: This story was previously released in the Alien anthology.
