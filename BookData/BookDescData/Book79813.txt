Say, are the eyes on that painting following me? Is that a ghost under the stairs? Why is there an octopus in the sink, and is he really washing the dishes? No, I don't want to look in the closet-and I certainly do not want to go into the attic!  Welcome to Jan Pienkowski's Haunted House. In the twenty-two years since its publication, hundreds of thousands of readers have taken this scared-silly tour of one of the best-selling pop-up books of all time.  And what a tour it is. Intricate pop-ups, lift-the-flaps, and pull tabs on every page lead readers through delightful surprises that will keep them coming back again and again. A smaller trim size and a nice price make this the perfect Halloween treat for the whole family.
