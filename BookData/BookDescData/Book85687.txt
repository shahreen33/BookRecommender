Every day, my neighbor tells me to have a good morning.Every day, I tell him to f*ck off. Kyle Lane is the town’s hottest cop. He’s also the man I’ve despised since high school. Each morning, he stands on his porch with an annoying smirk on his perfect face.He’s made it his life’s mission to get under my skin. Until one day, he’s no longer on his porch but on mine. He claims he wants to redeem himself for ruining my reputation. My instincts tell me to stay away, but with each morning he shows up, it becomes harder and harder to resist his charm.I was never supposed to fall in love with my neighbor and once he finds out my secret, we’ll forever be enemies.  (An enemies to lovers romance.)
