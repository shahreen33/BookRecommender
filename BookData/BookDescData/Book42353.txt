But Dragon doesn’t seem to fit in with the other campers. He overturns the boat, ruins the puppet show, and even sets the tent on fire. Then, just as his buddy is about to give up, Dragon comes through in a pinch. This sweet, funny picture book teaches an important lesson in the true meaning of friendship—and in accepting the strengths and weaknesses of others.
