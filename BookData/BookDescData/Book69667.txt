Camilla Donati doesn’t do relationships—it’s just not her thing. She wants a fun time, not a long time. She might be exactly what Tommaso Rossi needs to make his vacation from the responsibilities as a Capo, a break worth taking. He didn’t expect to find a woman like her with a mind full of filth. She didn’t expect a man who would shatter all of her rules with only a grin. Chicago keeps calling Tommaso home, and further out of reach from the one thing he wants more than ever. Camilla’s restless heart keeps getting in the way even when it’s stuck between what is, and what could be. This should have been easy. It didn’t have to be messy. Falling in love is effortless. It’s people who make it hard. Effortless: A Legacy Novel is a standalone contemporary erotic romance.
