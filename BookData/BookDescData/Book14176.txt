The ancient forgotten prophecy of the Runes is about to be fulfilled; a child will be born to save the world. But his cherubian protector must keep him alive against the threat of a cherubian conspiracy and that of their evil nemesis, the malevolent hordes of the mornachts, who are eager to harden his spirit and possess him. It's up to Major Davian and his unit of elite warriors to foil the conspiracy and prepare for war with the mornachts- the third great Battle for the City of Ezzer. For seven-year-old Tommy, he's just trying to survive the second grade, persecution from bullies, and the strain of his parent's divorce. He has no idea he could be the chosen one, or of the spiritual forces at work surrounding him. "M. B. Weston captures the hearts of the reader with her wonderfully crafted world of Elysia with deep imagery, rich characters, and great emotion. A must read for all fantasy fans. Think City of Angels meets Lord of the Rings meets Terminator 2 and you have a small taste of this new reality. Can't wait to see it on the big screen " Stephen J. Burton, Director/Screenwriter "Inspirational fantasy at its best. Filled with heart-wrenching drama, humor, and breathtaking adventure, which makes for a page-turning saga that will sweep you off to the mystical Elysian City of Ezzer, in Heaven's Realm, where good and evil fight to the death." Robert Gelinas, Author of The Mustard Seed "M. B. Weston has created a fantastical realm that bridges seamlessly into today's world with a powerful yet hopeful, warning message. C. S. Lewis would be proud " Sandy Lender, Author of Choices Meant for Gods
