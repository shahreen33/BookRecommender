For Tanpopo Yamazaki, life at the elitist Mei么 Academy seems way out of her league. The daughters of wealthy families snub her; other students make light of the fact that she actually tested into Mei么 instead of relying on family connections, and the cute boy she saw tending a dandelion the day before wouldn't even acknowledge her existence. Hoping to make friends and have some fun, Tanpopo starts up a gardening committee, but will this help her survive in a school where superficiality and nepotism reign supreme? IMA DOKI follows the trials and tribulations of a budding horticulturist as she makes her way down the winding road to friendship. From Y没 Watase, one of Japan's most beloved sh么 jo artists, IMA DOKI packs comedic charm and heartfelt antics into an adorable bouquet of whimsical fantasy.
