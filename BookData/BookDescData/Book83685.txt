Emery’s obsession with Clarke started out totally innocent. Abandoned in an orphanage at a young age, the energy mogul she read about in all the glossy magazines would someday come rescue her. Her own, personal knight in shining armor. But waiting for the fantasy to become real got harder. So when a chance to get much closer to the man of her dreams presents itself, how can she resist? Clarke can’t explain the feeling that the woman of his dreams is just outside of his reach. A mysterious scent lingers in his bed sheets, her irresistible voice whispers in his hallways. When he finally lays eyes on Emery, his life is complete. And if his angel thinks she’s obsessed, she hasn’t seen anything yet.
