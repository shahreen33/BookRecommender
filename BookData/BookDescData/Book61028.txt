A few months after escaping the coven that drained my magic, life is golden. My little sister Maddie is safe and happy. I have my pack. I’m in love.  But nothing gold can stay…  Maddie’s violent, dangerous birth pack wants her back.  My four men and I face dozens of wolves, intent on taking my little sister by force. If we keep fighting, my pack will be destroyed all over again.  There’s only one sacrifice I can make to end this pack war.  Myself.  But you know me. I won't let that be the end of my story.
