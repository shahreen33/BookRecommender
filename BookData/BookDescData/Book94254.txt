Impossible adventure.Lost with her ship and crew in an unfamiliar land, Min’s first command could be her last.Nothing here behaves the way it should:The magic that powers her skyship has been drained, rendering it immobile.The sky is an endless twilight, lit by the luminous fish that swim in it. Off starboard, there’s also the country-sized dragon that is looking particularly hungry.It will take all of Min’s training and experience to get her people safely back home, but as the truth about the Darkstar Dimension begins to be revealed, Min will have to prove to her crew - and to herself - that she is still the best person for the job.From the twisted mind that created the ‘delightfully weird’ Yarnsworld series comes a fantasy adventure like no other.Grab it now, to set sail on a journey you’ll never forget!
