Chicago Cubs ABC is the ultimate alphabet book for every young Cubs fan! A is for at-bat (Ryne Sandberg), F is for the Friendly Confines, I is for Ivy on the outfield wall and, of course, W is for Billy Williams and Wrigley Field! Toddlers will love learning their letters with all the great symbols and players of their favorite team. The book is even shaped like a baseball jersey and features the home game jersey as the cover.
