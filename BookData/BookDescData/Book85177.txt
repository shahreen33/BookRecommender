In the second novel in national bestselling author Veronica Wolff's Highlands series, a woman goes back in time and finds the man of her dreams...  One minute, she's New York heiress and art curator Magda Deacon, enraptured by the striking Highlander captured in an old portrait. The next, she's falling through time to 17th century Scotland--and embarking on the most erotic journey of her life...Infamous playboy James Graham, First Marquis of Montrose, doesn't know what to make of the strange woman who's tumbled--literally--into his life...and his bed. Her accent may be foreign, but Magda plays golf and rides like a red-blooded Scotsman--not that James could ever mistake her succulent lips and curves for anything but deliciously female...  But war rages in the Highlands, the land for which James and his men will lay down their lives. And when Magda faces a terrifying enemy and a daunting choice, only the legendary Sword of the Highlands will be able to set things right...
