“Stop pretending there’s nothing between us and kiss me already.” ~JohnnyI don’t know what made me so bold, but I can’t find it in me to regret it. I know he’s my brother’s best friend and I know he’s a little too old for me, but he’s the only thing in my life that makes me happy. Between assholes at school and my dwindling self-esteem, when an online friend suggests I try some pills to take the edge off I’m willing to try anything to stop the pain. But every day I feel like I’m falling further down the rabbit hole and I’m not sure even Gage can pull me back up.“I'm getting ahead of myself, but there's no falling slowly with someone you've known your entire life.” ~ GageMy feelings for Johnny were unexpected, but once I see them for what they are I can’t deny them. I know Adam might hate me for falling for his younger brother and I know Johnny’s been going through some things lately, but love can conquer anything, right?WARNING: if you’re already a reader of the Heathens Ink Series this goes without saying, but this story is full-on ugly cry and a HEA isn’t in the cards.
