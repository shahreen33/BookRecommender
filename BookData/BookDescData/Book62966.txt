The choices we make decide our fate.When the “storm of the century” severs all power and cell service to Little Bridge Island—as well as its connection to the mainland—26-year-old Sabrina “Bree” Beckham isn’t worried . . . at first. She might be on her own, but she’s got a landline and plenty of supplies.But Bree does become alarmed when she realizes how many islanders have been cut off from their beloved pets. Now it’s up to her to save as many of Little Bridge’s cats, dogs, and birds as she can…but to do so, she’s going to need help—help that arrives in the form of an entirely different super storm: her boss’s sexy nephew, Drew Hartwell, the island’s most notorious heartbreaker. But when her ex shows up just as Bree starts falling for Drew, she has to ask herself if their steamy connection was only a result of the stormy weather, or something that could last during clear skies too.
