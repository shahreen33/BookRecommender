Eden saved Az. She went up against pure evil and won.  But at what cost?  With loyal friends suffering, and her chance at a future with Az disintegrating, new enemies are the last threat Eden needs. Especially with the Fallen after revenge. But when mortal paths start breaking apart, Eden knows the game has changed and all of humanity is now at stake.  Kristen stayed out of the battle. She gave Eden the headstart she needed to save Az, and faced Gabriel’s wrath when he found out. All because she couldn’t chance her own secrets being exposed. Now, without intervention from Gabriel, madness slowly claims Kristen’s mind. When desperation forces Kristen to consider a path she swore she’d put behind her, her only hope rests with a temptation too wicked to resist a second time. Because the only one who can save her sanity may cost her soul.  Be swept into the dark and haunting sequel to A Touch Mortal, a paranormal romance Publisher’s Weekly called “cryptic” and reviewers referred to as “smart and sexy” with an ending that leaves readers “dying for more!”
