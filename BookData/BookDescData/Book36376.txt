Four blood-sucking princes. A beautiful anarchist. One dangerous mistake.  To the vampires who dominate each quadrant of the Lydian Dynasty, I’m only known as “Blackbird”—a masked vigilante who, at nineteen, is already public enemy number one.  To what’s left of humanity, I’ve been called a superhero, a title I neither welcome nor deserve. My only objective is to offer the enslaved what was stolen from us …  Freedom.  However, a failed plan lands me in the last place I imagined, at the mercy of all four Dynasty princes—Julian, Levi, Roman, and Silas. They’re monsters, each with a heart rumored to be as cold as his icy skin. And what’s worse, thanks to the slip-up, my fate is suddenly theirs to decide.  It’s up to them whether I’ll swing from the gallows, and I’ve given them every reason to sentence me to such a fate. Yet, I felt something unexplainable when our paths first crossed.  Something that gives me hope.  We should be one another’s worst nightmare. Only, I’m beginning to wonder if, somehow … these four princes might be my saving grace.  *** This is BOOK ONE in THE VAMPIRE’S MARK series. Series order is as follows: The Vampire’s Mark 1: Dark Reign The Vampire’s Mark 2: Hell Storm The Vampire’s Mark 3: Cold Heir The Vampire’s Mark 4: Crimson Mist  Note: This is a slow-burn, upper young adult/New Adult, RH series. You have my word there’s no insta-love between these pages whatsoever. Instead, you’ll be immersed in a rich plot and an imaginative alternate-reality where vampires don’t just exist. They rule. The eventual connection between Corina and these four sexy, vamp princes will be well-deserved and intense. There are certainly sexy times in this series, and the heat level is synonymous with the young adult/new adult genres. Thanks for checking out the series and enjoy!   THE VAMPIRE’S MARK is an action-packed, paranormal romance involving vampire royalty and the humans who fear them.
