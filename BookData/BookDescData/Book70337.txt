Mike, the sheriff of Beaver County, Oregon and his wife Kelly, the owner of Kellyâ€™s Koffee Shop, have just returned from a fly fishing trip to Cuba. On the drive home from the airport Mike gets a call informing him that the owner of Doggie Love Kennel, where they had boarded their dogs when they were in Cuba, has been murdered. To make matters worse, all of the dogs in the kennel, including Rebel and Lady, have been released and are running loose in the surrounding area. They immediately begin to search for their dogs as well as trying to determine who killed Mary Barnes.  They have plenty of suspects to choose from: the druggie kennel employee; the owner of the award winning Yorkie that was impregnated while staying at the kennel; the disgruntled head of the Pit Bull Sanctuary who was instructed by the owner of the kennel to get his pit bulls off of the property within twenty-four hours; the impoverished woman whose property is next to the luxurious kennel and is jealous of the dogs being boarded there; the kennel manager; and her husband who has anger issues. Will Mike and Kelly find the killer before the killer comes after them? And what about the dog named Skyy? Is she cute enough to make Mike rethink his decision to only have two dogs? Can she worm her way into his heart?
