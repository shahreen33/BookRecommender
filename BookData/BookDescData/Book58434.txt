On her escape from home, General Dominia di Mephitoli has discovered many strange things, but nothing could be stranger than an interdimensional Void populated by an infamous mystic and a fictional saint of death. Nothing, perhaps, except finding the Hierophant there, too--the parent she can't escape, and the cult leader she can't shake, back to threaten her again.But she should have expected that. With the diamond of her wife's compressed cremains wrenched from her grasp and far too many friends turning out to be enemies in disguise, the Hierophant seems a better father all the time. Only memories of THE GENERAL'S BRIDE can keep her on track to Cairo, where Dominia must meet the Lady heading the infamous Red Market cabal of prostitutes and reclaim the stolen diamond. Stalked at every turn by a vile fiend in her dead wife's form, the General struggles to avoid temptation and cut a clear path to reality. Of course, as she stumbles across a strange Kingdom settled in the event horizon of a black hole, she's forced to wonder if "reality" even exists.Maybe Saint Valentinian will tell her, once he proves he's not a figment of her imagination.
