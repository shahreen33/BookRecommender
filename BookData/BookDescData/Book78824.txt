Two lost boys, Black and White, wander the mean streets of Treasure Town, a surreal metropolis of mimes, freaks, crooks, cops, drifters, and down-and-outers. The boys must mug, steal, and fight to survive, especially after a yakuza called the "Rat" and his sadistic assistant return to town. But Black and White have a secret: they can fly.
