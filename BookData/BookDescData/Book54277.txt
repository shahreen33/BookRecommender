Jaclyn Love is a magnet for trouble - it seems to follow her wherever she goes.  Unfortunately for Kadan Davenport, she also seems to be a magnet for him - even after a disastrous first impression that leaves him - literally - black and blue.  Jaclyn is busy trying to find some sort of balance, and Kadan is just trying not to get swept up in the chaos.   In a small city like Blakewood, it's hard to avoid each other... especially when each additional encounter makes them wonder if they really want to.  "I Think I Might Love You" is a first-in-series novella.
