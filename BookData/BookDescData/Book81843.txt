Just beyond human perception, divinity and evil bear witness to both good and bad events in the mortal world. Transcendental law demands the separation of these dark forces and they are forbidden to communicate with one another.  Sarenah is a devoted and strong Warrior Angel who, while obediently watching over a human incident, meets an evil presence she is inexplicably drawn to. She knows he is a demon and is well aware of the rules, but something about him causes her allegiance to waver and the strength of a warrior angel is no match to the pull of love … or is it lust?  Draco is her opposite, a Warrior Demon and highly regarded in Hell. He, too, feels the pull toward Sarenah and desires her without any clue as to why. He mistakes her true identity because of her appearance—dark hair and black wings—and unbeknownst to him at the time, he falls for an Angel.  During their brief meeting they share a passionate kiss and, the instant they connect, everything changes. Heaven and Hell will stop at nothing to keep them apart, which raises more questions than the two have answers for. Draco is thrown into prison and Sarenah undertakes a relentless search for him which leads her to a realm she doesn't belong. With the protection of the light about to cease, her heart and mind repeat one word incessantly, one she cannot ignore … Draco.  Will the truth about their mysterious pasts be revealed in time for her to rescue him? Or will outside powers intervene and destroy her in the process?
