On her first day at military academy, Carol Danvers is told: let yourself learn. If only it were that simple - as defiant as she is driven, Carol has never quite adhered to the rules. All she's ever wanted to do was fly: why would she be dissuaded by the fact that in the military, female fighter pilots don't exist?But beneath Carol's swagger lurks a persistent fear that she is never quite enough. At first, the academy appears to agree, overwhelming Carol with a rigorous schedule, demanding officers, and the looming possibility of joining an elite fledgling flyers' program that has never counted a woman among their roster. Then she forms a friendship with fellow would-be pilot Maria Rambeau, and what seemed impossible becomes tantalizingly within reach for them both. Will Carol and Maria achieve their dream in the face of constant challenge? And at what cost?
