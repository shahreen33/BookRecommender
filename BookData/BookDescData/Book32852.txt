Two weeks.No strings.No commitments.Those are the terms Mila Lawson offers Roman Gregory when they find themselves living together in Santa Cruz.With a violent gang gunning for him and a cartel threatening to go to war, the last thing the ATF agent should be thinking about is claiming his daughter's twenty-two-year-old best friend. But after four long years of lusting after the gorgeous little blonde from afar, once Roman has her, he's not willing to give her up. She may be off-limits, but something about Mila drives him wild. There's nothing sweet about the things he wants to do to her, and nothing gentle about the way he takes her. She makes him crave a future he never envisioned for himselfâ€¦one so much better than he ever dreamed was possible.To keep her, he'll be forced to face the daughter he adores. To save her, he'll break every rule in the book.Nothing will stand in his way. Not his daughter. Not the gang hunting him. Not even the law itself.Deny Me includes the first three novellas in Ayden K. Morgen's Her Best Friend's Father series, plus 40 pages of bonus content. No cheating, with a guaranteed HEA.
