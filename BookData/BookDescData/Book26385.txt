My name is Tobias Thomas Sheffield.  I would like to tell you a story about the girl who changed my life forever. This is deeper than a love story, this is a connection that most never find; something that occurs once every few lifetimes or so. I was written in her, she was written in me, we were written in the stars. Before you invest your time in our story, I should warn you. If you don’t believe in love at first sight or you rely on an unbending system to give your life a false sense of security and meaning, you should probably skip our story. On the contrary, if you can get to know us with an open mind, pretend for a little bit that you may have been systematically lied to your entire life, then my hope is that Tristan will have the same impact on you as she did me. I’m a better man because of her, and I hope that you find something potentially life-changing in her as well. She made me someone I didn’t know I wanted to be. For her. For me. For humanity.
