More than 400 recipes, forty-eight menus, entertaining tips, table decorations, and sumptuous photographs make this the most engaging and ambitious Junior League collection to date.  At home for members of the Junior League can mean anything from a Mother's Day brunch or an elegant dinner for six to a Labor Day backyard barbecue or a Pumpkin-fest celebration. The menus and recipes in this all-new collection reveal the diversity of the members of the Junior League and their close connection to ethnic, regional, and family foodways handed down and refined from one generation to the next.  From appetizers to desserts-and all the courses in between-The Junior League at Home features favorite home-tested recipes drawn from League cookbooks and members. Each of the twelve chapters offers a selection of seasonal menus with advice for planning and food preparation. The book also highlights ideas for stress-free entertaining, as well as innovative tablescape and decorating suggestions-including a fully illustrated section on the lost art of napkin folding.
