Emmaline Harris is a beautiful and brilliant Wall Street financier in the nineteenth century - until the crash of 1893 wipes her out completely. Without friends, family, or money, she takes a risk and joins Dr. Larence Digby in his search for the treasure-filled lost city of Cibola. Emmaline is used to getting her own way, but Larence has ideas of his own. Chasing impossible dreams, Larence is pursued by a deep secret that he has shared with no one. And Emmaline is contemptuous of Larence's ideals, despising the man for revealing her weakness. Somehow, in a world of enchantment, each will have to learn to believe - to trust the other with their lives, their secrets, and their hearts.
