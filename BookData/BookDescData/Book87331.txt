  "Uncle,” Crossaint said, “the fridge is in trouble! 

  A mystery stench turned a whole shelf to rubble! 

  I’m the last hope or the fridge will be lost! 

  Help me or else we’ll be cooked, served, and sauced.”

A fetid fish lurking in the bottom of Corn Chowder Lake? Featuring the same delectable wordplay and delicious art that won critical raves for Lady Pancake &amp; Sir French Toast—there’s even an actual red herring—his fun follow-up is an absolutely tasty treat for kids!
