Matthew Hansen is the kind of handsome that has grown women whispering behind their hands and giggling like schoolgirls.Dark, tall and mysterious, he’s a newcomer to our little town. He’s a gritty, grease-covered mechanic, and a single daddy.Sweet, right?Plus he’s looking for a nanny – and I am desperately looking for a job.Sounds like the perfect deal.Only he’s a jerk. An uncivilized, hulking brute. Zero manners. Zero interest in making me feel welcome in his home. Downright rude.But oh so sexy.And I need the job. I can do this.One thing is for sure: I can’t fall for the Caveman. No matter how sexy he is. How mysterious. How tortured.That’s the only rule – and one I’m about to break.(Librarian Note: This story is loosely connected (as a sort of sequel) to Zane (Inked Brotherhood, #3).)
