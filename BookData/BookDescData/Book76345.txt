After ten years away, Marcie finally ventures back to where she grew up. She isn’t in town for twenty-four hours when she crosses paths with Hook and Striker, the two boys who kept her safe and happy as a young girl. Only they aren’t boys anymore. They are fully grown, muscular, alpha men. Members of the No Prisoners Motorcycle Club. All through her teenage years, Marcie’s heart belonged to Hook. Not that he ever seemed to notice. And it appears that as an adult, not much has changed with regard to her feelings toward the sexy biker. But a bossy, alpha man is not what independent Marcie is looking for.  The moment Hook lays eyes on Marcie, it’s as though the last ten years apart never existed. Back when she was off limits, he wanted her, and it doesn’t take long before he realizes he still wants her. Marcie’s changed, though. She’s no longer a frightened teenager in need of a haven. Now she’s a beautiful, confident woman, and a bit too independent. Will Hook be able to convince Marcie a life with him wouldn’t stifle her freedom? Their relationship is tested when Marcie clings to her hard-won life and when an aspect of that life threatens not only their future together, but their safety as well.
