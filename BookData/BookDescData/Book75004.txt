Sometimes the risk truly was the worth the reward.  Rylynn I knew pain. I knew my pain. I knew his pain. I knew our pain. He sparked a fire inside me I couldnâ€™t put out.  Crow I was strong. I was fearless. The biggest mistake my enemies could make would be to assume she was my weakness. Rylynn made me stronger, harder, and more determined to protect what was mine.  Friend or foe, I would never let another person get between us. No matter the risk, she was mine to have and hold.  We were connected in pain, fueled in fire, and the world would test us, only to show we were sealed in strength.  In the end, nothing could keep us apart.
