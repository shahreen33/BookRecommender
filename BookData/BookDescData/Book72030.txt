Most people are dying to lose a few pounds. Not so in Slashing Mona Lisa, were it's the weight-loss advocates who are losing their lives...Whenever Terry Mangel's body acceptance revival meeting rolls into town, local diet execs and "fat shamers" turn up dead, often in grotesque, ironic ways. All single murders in small suburbs, no one's noticed a pattern--until rookie journalist Camarin Torres takes a closer look. Torres is a crusader against discrimination, partially to assuage the guilt she feels over her involvement in the suicide of her obese, bullied twin sister. She reluctantly accepts a job offered by handsome publisher Lyle Fletcher, a widower with a vendetta, who sees the recent college grad as salvation for Trend, his fledgling fashion magazine. Torres, however, detests everything the publication stands for, and joins solely to transform its judgmental, objectifying content. As an unexpected romance blossoms, the overconfident, justice-hungry reporter defies orders and infiltrates Mangel's world--only to find herself in the crosshairs of a vigilante group targeting the $60 billion diet industry. Unmasking the killer may save her life but shatter her heart: every clue seems to implicate Fletcher, her mercurial mentor and lover, as the group's mastermind.Slashing Mona Lisa explores body shaming and its victims: the disenfranchised who don't conform to society's arbitrary norms, and the lengths they will go to for love and acceptance.
