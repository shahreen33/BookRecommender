  "Schools are not intentionally equitable places for English learners to achieve, but they could be if the right system of support were put in place. Diane Staehr Fenner and Sydney Snyder recommend just such a system. Not only does it have significant potential for providing fuller access to the core curriculum, it also provides a path for teachers to travel as they navigate the individual needs of students and support their learning journeys."

   --Douglas Fisher, Coauthor of Visible Learning for Literacy   A once-in-a-generation text for assisting a new generation of students
