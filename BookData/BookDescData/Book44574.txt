A tale of hope set amongst the hyper violence of the 19th century, RED RANGE tells the tale of Red Mask, a tough vigilante that rides against the tragic racism of a klan-dominated Texas. Written by Joe Lansdale and illustrated by the legendary Sam Glanzman, RED RANGE offers an unerring ear for exotic period and regional dialect, racial unrest and strange happenings that find their mark 18 years after its original publication.
