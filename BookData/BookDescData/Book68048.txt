A is for apple, B is for ball, C is for cat... but not in this wacky alphabet book! In author/artist Mike Lester's slightly warped world, A is for salad, B is for Viking, and C is for hot dog. What's that all about, you may ask? It's a fun way for kids to learn as they figure out what each alphabet letter actually stands for. A is for alligator, shown on the page eating a healthy salad. B is for beaver, wearing a very handsome Viking helmet. C is for cat, pictured munching on a foot-long hot dog.
