The conferring of academic degrees to the accompaniment of the phrase, "with all the rights, privileges, and immunities, thereunto pertaining," has become so commonplace a proceeding in American colleges and universities that the significance of the accompanying phrase is lost to view. Otherwise this bestowal of peculiar rights, privileges, and immunities upon university graduates, who would thus be set apart from the ordinary run of the population, would be denounced as an anachronism in an age of equalitarian ideals. However, the continued use of these terms, now so obsolete in their practical application, illustrates cogently the persistent force of tradition, even in a world of rapid physical and material change. Such verbal symbols of a bygone era preserve at least the memory of a past in which such rights, privileges, and immunities were the usual concomitants of the scholarly status. They may also serve to whet our curiosity as to their nature and history.The history of the rise, development, and decline of these scholarly rights and privileges is such a long and varied one and is so intimately bound up with the social and political events of the centuries which saw their development and decline that an adequate historical account of them would require a much more extensive consideration than is here possible. Nevertheless, in anticipation of the fuller treatment which the history of these rights and privileges merits, current interest in them would appear to justify a brief summary of their Roman origins and of some instances of their expression in Europe in the Middle Ages, the time of their fullest development.This paper was read before the Faculty Humanities Club of Hunter College on April 27, 1953. It is an outgrowth of work on a longer study now in preparation, "The Rights, Privileges, and Immunities, of Scholars and Universities in the Middle Ages," and serves as a forerunner to 
  Scholarly Privileges in the Middle Ages.
 Much of the material for the study was gathered in European libraries during the year I950-5I under a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Scholarship.
