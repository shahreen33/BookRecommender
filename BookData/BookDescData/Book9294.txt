The adventure of a lifetime might just be their last. Filled with curiosity about the jungles of Vietnam from his fatherâ€™s war stories, Mick and a group of friends set out on an adventure trip near the Cambodian border countries. But the brochures had neglected to mention the bandit groups who plied their slave trade around the region. With most of the group taken captive Mick escapes and with the help of a local farmer he makes a dash for Ho Chi Minh City to find help. Only once there he discovers he is being hunted by the police as well. With both sides closing in on him Mick soon realises he has become embroiled in a local drugs war where nobody is to be trusted. King of The Mekong is a racing adventure through the jungles of Vietnam, a race against time and last desperate stand against a relentless enemy.
