A stranger in a strange land, Elise is still trying to come to terms with the difficulties attached to being a dispossessed Earthling on an alien world. By all logic, she should have been terrified when the tall, muscular, cat-like humanoid rose from the water to capture her, be he ever so fascinatingly handsome. Instead, she discovers she is unable to resist when bombarded by the potent pheromones of his desire. Unfortunately, the fires of passion can not burn eternally and the moment it's quenched and their senses return, they discover they have a serious problem-Elise is no lioness, maned or otherwise, and she refuses to accept Ja-rael's insistence that they are now mated for life. Rating: Contains explicit sexual content and graphic language.
