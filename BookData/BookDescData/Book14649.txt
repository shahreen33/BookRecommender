Jules won't risk her career for mind-blowing sex, no matter how much her body and her damn heart keep arguing with her. Nate McKenna could give a shit about the no fraternizing policy.

He's not a man to be taken lightly, and Jules Montgomery is about to find out just how he responds to being pushed aside after the best night of sex he's ever had. She can fight all she wants, but he'll have her in his bed in the end.FIGHT WITH ME is the second novel in the With Me In Seattle Series.
