Have you ever been on a train, bus, metro/subway -- or any other shared space with strangers -- and started to wonder what that person right next to you is thinking? Did you ever start to think or hope that maybe your temporary neighbor was somehow sharing your thoughts and/or desires? Ever sensed some sort of romantic connection or sexual tension and wished you could get into the individual's head, to know for sure?  "City Solipsism" will take you on a journey into the mind of one commuter on a New York City subway car, riding next to and thinking about a person standing awkwardly close...The man and woman are total strangers but their proximity is almost intimate, as their hands share the same metal subway pole...  NOTE: Readers seeking the over-top-hilarity of "Sex in the Title" should know that "City Solipsism" is written in a very different style. Rather than a comedic series of misadventures in New York, this short story takes more of a philosophical and psychological walk through the mind of one New Yorker observing and speculating about another.
