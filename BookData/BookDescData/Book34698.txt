Fiction. Short stories. Lasana M. Sekou is the author of 20 books of poetry, monologues, and short stories. He is the leading writer of St. Martin and is considered one of the prolific Caribbean poets of his generation. "LOVE SONGS MAKE YOU CRY stirs emotions that lie too deep for tears."--Joyce Peters- McKenzie, St. Martin Newsday "Following one of the principles of Modernism, Sekou reinvents his prose. The depth of his discourse and the scope of his subject matters give his short stories [...] a universal, yet unique, character that goes well beyond the boundaries boundaries of a Caribbean readership."--Michela A. Calderaro, University of Trieste, Italy
