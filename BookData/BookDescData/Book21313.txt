When Professor Nathan Troy walks into his cabin and finds a naked man in his bed, he figures his one-man vacation to snowy Lake Tahoe can't get any worse. It's not that Nate doesn't appreciate the view...he'd just prefer he knew the man in question.Kyle Harper has come to Lake Tahoe to escape the memories of his former life -- one where he was a star hockey player until a career-ending injury shattered his dreams forever. All Kyle wants is peace, and he certainly isn't going to get it with a prickly, stubborn man waking him up, insisting that Kyle is in his cabin.An accidental double-booking and a wary compromise puts the two in close quarters. Attraction heats things up, but Nate's not about to let his libido lead him into making the mistake of getting involved with his unexpected roommate. Kyle, however, seems determined to get under his skin at every turn. Both men soon learn that they can't outrun desire. But lust is easy; it's opening their hearts that's hard. Each will have to let go of the past before they can take advantage of the future the two of them could have together.Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Male/male sexual practices.
