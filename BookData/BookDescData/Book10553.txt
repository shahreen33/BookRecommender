Dru Rayne and her uncle fled to L.A. after Hurricane Katrina; but now, five years later, they face a different danger. When Joe Pike witnesses Dru's uncle beaten by a protection gang, he offers his help, but neither of them want it -- and neither do the federal agents mysteriously watching them.As the level of violence escalates, and Pike himself becomes a target, he and Elvis Cole learn that Dru and her uncle are not who they seem -- and that everything he thought he knew about them has been a lie. A vengeful and murderous force from their past is now catching up to them... and only Pike and Cole stand in the way.
