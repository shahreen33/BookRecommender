A demographic expert and longtime pollster to national and international political stars explains why the Republican party, despite Trump's election, is about to collapse. In the mad rush to document the tangled, confusing, raucous present of the United States government, a little thing is lost in the shuffle: the future. How long can this last? What happens next? Where do we go from here?Stanley Greenberg argues that the election of Trump is in fact the dying gasp of the Republican party. Rejecting the urging of their own consultants to build bridges and embrace new voters across the lines of identity politics, the GOP has constricted. It has retreated to what seems to be the safety of the evangelical white male voter.The problem for them is that this won't be a safe zone for long. Try as some might to drag the United States backward with reactionary movements and a politics of division, the country marches steadfastly on into the 21st century. The power of democracy will soon prevail, and unless the party adapts, America will bury the GOP the way it did the Know Nothings.
