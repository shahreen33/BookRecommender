Even the Spider can’t escape a ghost’s web . . .  I’m being haunted.  As Gin Blanco, aka the assassin the Spider, I’m used to being haunted by all the bad things I’ve done over the years. I suppose it was only a matter of time before an actual ghost came back to haunt me. But for once, I’m not the bad guy, and I wasn’t the person who sent this ghost—this haint—into the afterlife.  But this haint definitely wants something from me, and I can’t help but think that it’s revenge on the person responsible for her untimely demise.  Good thing revenge is my specialty, whether it’s among the living or the dead . . .  Note: Haints and Hobwebs is an 11,000-word story that takes place after the events of Tangled Threads, book 4 in the Elemental Assassin urban fantasy series. Haints and Hobwebs first appeared in The Mammoth Book of Ghost Romance in 2012.
