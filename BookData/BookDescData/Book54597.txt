Award-winning historian and biographer William Manchester, author of The Last Lion, an epic three-volume biography of Winston Churchill, brings us an evocative and powerful exploration of the American way of life from 1932 to 1972. Covering almost every facet of American culture during a very diverse and tumultuous period in history, Manchester's account is both dramatic and surprisingly intimate--with compelling details that could only be known by a dedicated historian who lived through and documented this fascinating time in history.  For several decades, William Manchester was the most popular and highly regarded historian and biographer of his time--and this book provides the reader with a powerful example of the reason for that reputation.  "There is no fiction that can compete with good, gossipy, anecdotal history--the inside story of who said or did what in moments of great tensions or crisis... I think you ought to read this history and weep, read it and laugh, read it and don't repeat it." --Anatole Broyard
