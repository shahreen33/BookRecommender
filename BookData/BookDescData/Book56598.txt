Maybe.Dark brooding eyes trying to devour me? All the time.There's just one little thing...Wes's eyes aren't the only ones on me.And I think I've started a war.Oops.I didn't ask to be put in this position as I find myself gravitating toward Wes.He says he'll protect me from Hidden Creek High.But who's going to protect me from him?***WARNING: Hidden Creek High (#hch) is a young adult / new adult series filled with everything you've been asking for in a series that's wild, hot, fun, and crazy... it's recommended for mature readers because of cursing and 'certain scenes' ;) In other words, if that sh*t bothers, stay away. But seriously... you're already here, don't stay away. START READING NOW.
