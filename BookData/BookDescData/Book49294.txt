 
  Dark. Gripping. Sci-fi/Paranormal Romance.
 There’s a place from my nightmares. A place where bad things hide.The memories kept me awake for most of my life. But it’s not what keeps me awake anymore. 
  
    It’s her. 
  
She calls me, desperate and pleading. Like a shining star I can’t quite find. I feel those men from my nightmares coming for her. Only she can’t sense them—she can’t see. 
  
    Not the past. 
  

  
    Or the future…unlike me.
  
Until one day as I stood in a doorway in the barren wasteland in Afghanistan with my squad at my back…my star dimmed, and sputtered out. I have two holes in my chest now. One which bears her name. 
  
    I have to find her. I pray I’m not too late. First I have to find the others, two more guys like me. 
  
Together we seek a North Star.  One we were born half in love with.Leading us back home. Without ever knowing we were lost at all. SIXTH is the enthralling 45,000 word prequel to Oleander. The reverse harem romance comes together in the next book.
