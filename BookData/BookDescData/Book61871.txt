Ennay is a man without a god. Bud is a god without a human. Together, they might just survive.In 1958, the laws of physics stopped working: ignition, electricity, and combustion. But an alternative was provided, and people found themselves each accompanied by their own personal god, the new fuel and currency of the world. Varying in shape, size, and influence, these companion deities changed everything. Ennay, however, was born without a god and he’s not alone. Men and women like him are Godshapers, godless but with the ability to mold and shape the gods of others. Paired with Bud, a friendly god without a human, he goes on the road looking for food, shelter, and a paying gig. Despite their efforts to keep a low profile, Ennay and Bud stumble upon a mystery that will have lasting ramifications for god and man alike. Written by visionary author Simon Spurrier (The Spire, X-Men Legacy) and illustrated by breakout talent Jonas Goonface, Godshaper introduces a vast world teeming with bold ideas exploring ownership, freedom, and the pettiness of possession—both physical and spiritual.
