Previously titled Pistols for Two, this edition includes three recently discovered short stories. A treat for all fans of Georgette Heyer, and for those who love stories full of romance and intrigue.Affairs of honour between bucks and blades, rakes and rascals; affairs of the heart between heirs and orphans, beauties and bachelors; romance, intrigue, escapades and duels at dawn. All the gallantry, villainy and elegance of the age that Georgette Heyer has so triumphantly made her own are exquisitely revived in these wonderfully romantic stories of the Regency period.Contents:SnowdriftFull MoonPistols for TwoA Clandestine AffairBath MissA Husband for FannyTo Have the HonourNight at the InnThe DuelHazardPursuitRunaway MatchIncident on the Bath Road
