In Taiwan, the Mid-Autumn Festival is a time for prioritizing family. When 25-year-old Jing-nan s gangster uncle, Big Eye, asks a favor, Jing-nan can t exactly say no, especially because two goons are going to follow him around to make sure he gets it done right. The favor is this: Big Eye s 16-yearold daughter, Mei-ling, has a biker boyfriend from the wrong side of the tracks in Big Eye s gangster opinion and Big Eye wants Jing-nan to bring her to Taipei, away from the bad influences, and straighten her out. It doesn t take Jing-nan long to discover Mei-ling is even more trouble than the average bratty, rebellious teenage girl. She s been spoiled rotten and doesn t know how to take no for an answer. She has her father s thugs wrapped around her finger and quickly becomes the miniature dictator of Jingnan s life. But Mei-ling is also hiding a secret one that puts her in harm s way. If he wants to save his cousin from her own demons, he has to figure out the truth, even if it tears his family apart again."
