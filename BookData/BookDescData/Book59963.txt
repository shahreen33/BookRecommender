"The Amitabha Sutra is a popular colloquial name for the Smaller Sukhavativyuha Sutra. The Amitabha Sutra is a Mahayana Buddhist text, and it is one of the primary sutras recited and upheld in the Pure Land Buddhist schools.The bulk of the Amitabha Sutra, considerably shorter than other Pure Land sutras, consists of a discourse which the Buddha gave at Jeta Grove in SravastÄ« to his disciple Sariputra. The talk concerned the wondrous adornments that await the righteous in the western pure land of Sukhavati, as well as the beings that reside there, including the buddha Amitabha. The text also describes what one must do to be reborn there." -Wikipedia
