A chilling exploration of a mother's unspeakable betrayal from the author of Little Face Sally Thorning is watching the news with her husband when she hears an unexpected name—Mark Bretherick. It's a name she shouldn't know, but last year Sally treated herself to a secret vacation—away from her hectic family life—and met a man. After their brief affair, the two planned to never meet again. But now, Mark's wife and daughter are dead—and the safety of Sally's own family is in doubt. Sophie Hannah established herself as a new master of psychological suspense with her previous novel, Little Face. Now with accomplished prose and a plot guaranteed to keep readers guessing, The Wrong Mother is Hannah's most captivating work yet.Published as The Point of Rescue in the United Kingdom
