Yara Phillips is a wandering muse.She dates men who need her, but always moves on to something new, never staying in one place for very long.David Lisey is in need of a muse.A talented musician lacking lyrical inspiration. When he first sees her, he knows he's found what he's been looking for.Yara believes she can give David exactly what he needs to reach his full potential:A broken heart.David’s religion is love. Yara’s religion is heartache.Neither is willing to surrender, but religion always requires sacrifice.
