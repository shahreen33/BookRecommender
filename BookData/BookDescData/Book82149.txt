The first stand-alone romance in New York Times bestseller Marie Harte’s small town, shapeshifter series: Cougar Falls. Mountain man or mountain lion? In his case—one and the same. When Rachel arrives in Cougar Falls for a reading of her aunt’s will, she finds herself in a strange little town. The fantastic tales that the townsfolk tell about a clan of people who can shift into animals are nothing but folklore. Aren’t they? Burke is taken with sexy Rachel, even more so when she shows signs of possessing Ac-taw blood. But this puts her in more danger than she knows, danger that only increases the urgency to mark her as his own. Rachel comes to realize she’s inherited much more than just property. She has also inherited a destiny to protect her newfound home, and her new love. For the Ac-taw aren’t just legend-they’re real. This title has been previously released. Warning, this title contains the following: men who growl, a sexy three on one, and hot, steamy encounters between shifters in love  “This was a fun although short read with plenty of chemistry between Rachel and Burke, very hot read. Good start to the series. I look forward to reading the rest of the books.” Bookaholic
