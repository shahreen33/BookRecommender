Timothy is very excited about starting school--until he meets Claude. Claude sits next to him, and he wears all the right clothes, says all the right things, and garners all the praise from his teacher and classmates. Timothy is feeling down, until he meets a girl who's having the same problem with her seatmate...."Children will easily relate to this tale, in which humor and realism effectively mesh." --Booklist, starred review
