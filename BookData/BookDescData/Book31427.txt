Valentine's Inc. Book 4.  I always bolt after a hookup, so why can’t I stop messaging Oliver for seconds…and thirds...   Austin  I should’ve thrown the invitation to my ex’s wedding straight into the trash. Who gets married on Valentine’s Day anyway? Gross. When my best friend does me a solid by getting me a date through Valentine’s Inc. dating service, the last person I expect to show up on my doorstep is the vibrant man with the lace panties and a belly button ring who I hooked up with and ghosted six months earlier. But the more time I spend with Oliver, the more I find myself craving his presence. Normally, I’d kiss and run, but I’m dying to see where things might go.   Oliver   I don’t like schedules or expectations. I live for the sheer experience of each day. And if there’s anyone who could use a good dose of my carefree philosophy, it’s Austin. I didn’t expect to see him again after he disappeared off the hookup app, but the chance to be his fake boyfriend for his ex-boyfriend’s wedding is way too much fun to pass up, especially since I’m getting paid for it. Neither of us are looking for serious, but that doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy a little fun before he bolts again.  ***This is a 30k low angst, high heat novella***
