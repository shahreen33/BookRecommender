The NHL’s most charming player is ready to score a hat trick on and off the ice...As the star forward for the Boston Blades, I’ve earned a reputation for no-strings attached hookups and a mean slapshot that has all the ladies purring -- but it’s never been the one woman I want to see all fired up and ready to score.Boston’s own Ice Queen Gwen James has had my emotions all tangled up for years. I’ve played the games. I’ve sat on the sidelines.No matter her reasons, I’m done being benched. When she approaches me for a second chance, I accept on one condition: she’s got to prove she’s all in.No kissing. No sex. It just might kill me to keep my hands to myself, but it’s time Gwen knows what it’s like to beg. At the end of the day, I play to win, and I want what no other man has ever had…her heart.
