Warning: There are reports of readers flinging their devices (one reader allegedly threw her Kindle three times) and ignoring their lives while reading Wormwood. The author does not assume responsibility for such awesomely reactive responses.Angels. Demons. Love. Deceit.It appears as though every task Tiamat is ordered to carry out tears at his soul; but how can I know if that’s true? How can I trust him, if he’s the very one who destroyed this planet in the first place?Tiamat and his brothers, a legion of one hundred half-angels, have orders to send all humans on to their final judgment. Yet in a moment of weakness, Tiamat risks his life to rescue a hiker named Kali from the very destruction he initiated.Kali, thrust from the surety of her world into the boundless hell of Tiamat’s, must try to find a way to survive in the Earth’s vast, devastated landscape. Plagued by a legion of Nephilim bent on sending her on, she is forced to trust the one being who could prove to be her greatest enemy.“The lines will be blurred between good and evil, truth and lies, and hero and antagonist. When I finished Wormwood, I closed the book with a WOW on my lips. Extraordinary storytelling, D.H. Nevins. You blew me away. Absolutely 5 stars.” – Beth Hoover, Tome Tender Reviews
