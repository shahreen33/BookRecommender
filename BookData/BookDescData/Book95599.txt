This is a cycle of six thematically linked stories, droll renditions of the nightmares ensuing upon misplaced, or excessive bibliophilia. A writer encounters a web site where all his possible future books are on display; a lonely man faces an infinite flow of hardback books through his mailbox; an ordinary library turns by night into an archive of souls; the devil sets about raising standards of infernal literacy; one book houses all books; a connoisseur of hardcovers strives to expel a lone paperback from his collection. The Library was the winner of the 2003 World Fantasy Award and long-listed for the 2004 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award.
