He's a British rock star.And my stepbrother.What can go wrong?He called himself Spider. I just knew him as the sinfully gorgeous guy with eyes of fire that fate sat next to me on the airplane. I didn’t know who he really was…rock star…my stepbrother.He kissed me because he thought we’d never see each other again. We would.Everyone warned me about him. They said he was ruthless and cold and screwed up.They said he’d leave me with a hole in my heart.Maybe I should have listened.Maybe I should have built up a fortress to keep him out.But I crumbled instead.Some have said there's an unbreakable thread that connects those who are destined to meet. If that’s true, then the moment he sat next to me, we were bound together forever.He just had to figure it out before it’s too late…
