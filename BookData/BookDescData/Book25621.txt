ASIN B01M08QTJ6 has been moved to the latest kindle edition, as per guidelinesA cursed druid, blackmailed by a faery queen to find a missing magic rock. Let's just hope they don't hack the druid off... for everyone's sake.Name's Colin McCool. Folks call me the Junkyard Druid. I hate that name.Despite my last name, I'm not "cool" like the other hunters in town. I don't run an occult bookstore, I've never owned a Harley, and I didn't inherit a family fortune passed down through generations of hunters before me.And I kind of have this curse on me that's messed up my life.So, things have gone to hell since I was cursed. I live in a junkyard, my mentor Finn is a heroin addict, I've got the Cold Iron Circle breathing down my neck, and the local Fae Queen Maeve is blackmailing me into doing her dirty work.Now I'm in way over my head trying to retrieve Maeve's stolen magic rock, all while helping my friend Belladonna solve a series of murders that may or may not involve the local werewolves.And did I mention that my girlfriend is a ghost?If I can just get the Faery Queen's tathlum back, and help Belladonna solve the murders...Then I just might live long enough to finish my first year of college.
