All Lily wanted was to be a normal high school student. Well, the most normal a six foot, three inch tall girl who was bigger and stronger than the average football player could be. And it really was wonderfully normal...until a Goblin fell in love with her. Now Lily is dodging Goblins, Ogres, and table cutlery in this amusing misadventure of awkward high school romance.
