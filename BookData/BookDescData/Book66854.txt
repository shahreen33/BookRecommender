My sister Bianca and I have two rules governing the dispensation of our trust funds.  One. I get married first. Two. She gets married second.  Neither of us will see a penny until we are both “properly cared for.” My father had a terrible sense of humor.  I turn to the only man who can help me. Even when the last time I saw him he said he hated me. Even when I love him as much as I loathe him. Even when he’s all wrong.  Liar. Thief. Killer.  Those are just a few words whispered about him in back alleys. To me he’s Pierce, to everyone else, he’s Pierson St. James, local mobster and second in charge of the infamous Wild Dogs.  He may be disreputable, but desperation calls for extreme measures. A long time ago, he promised to marry me. Now I’m going to hold him to that promise.  And we are both going to regret it.  This isn’t your high school Shakespeare...and you've never read The Taming of the Shrew like this.  This is a standalone romance with alpha heroes, alpha heroines, and a whole lot of foul language.
