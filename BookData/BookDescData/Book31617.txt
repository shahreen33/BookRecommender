Young rancher Wade Devlin, as boys will, carves his true love Molly Faro's name on a post but never gets further than mollyfar. Young Molly, who has taken the surname Faro for the game she likes to play, loves Wade, but stands with her friend Heeshi, whose true gender is often debated, to make a go of their saloon and pleasure palace while struggling to keep their independence in the changing times of Texas in the 1880s. Through misunderstandings, misadventures and misfortune, including the lies and brutal acts of a dangerous con man who nearly costs Wade his life, Molly and Wade fight to keep their love alive and find a future with room for them both.
