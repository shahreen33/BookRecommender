From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Kristen Ashley comes a new story in her Dream Man series…  Charlotte “Lottie” McAlister is in the zone. She’s ready to take on the next chapter of her life, and since she doesn’t have a man, she’ll do what she’s done all along. She’ll take care of business on her own. Even if that business means starting a family.  The problem is, Lottie has a stalker. The really bad kind. The kind that means she needs a bodyguard.  Enter Mo Morrison.  Enormous. Scary.  Quiet.  Mo doesn’t say much, and Lottie’s used to getting attention. And she wants Mo’s attention. Badly.  But Mo has a strict rule. If he’s guarding your body, that’s all he’s doing with it.  However, the longer Mo has to keep Lottie safe, the faster he falls for the beautiful blonde who has it so together, she might even be able to tackle the demons he’s got in his head that just won’t die.  But in the end, Lottie and Mo don’t only have to find some way to keep hands off until the threat is over, they have to negotiate the overprotective Hot Bunch, Lottie’s crazy stepdad, Tex, Mo’s crew of frat-boy commandos, not to mention his nutty sisters.  All before Lottie finally gets her Dream Man.  And Mo can lay claim to his Dream Girl.  **Every 1001 Dark Nights novella is a standalone story. For new readers, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.**
