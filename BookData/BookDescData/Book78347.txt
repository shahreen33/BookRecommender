When all that you want, is all that’s forbidden...  I’ve known him my entire life. Before marriage. Before fatherhood. Before betrayal. Now, he’s one of rock’s bad-boys trying to be good. Trying to be the best father he can for his daughter. He’s my brother’s best friend. He’s my boss. He has a wife. Max isn’t mine to have, but I want him all the same. And I haven’t survived all that I have to not go after what I want.  Her story is a tragedy, mine’s a publicity disaster.  Just when I needed her most, she walked back into my life, and the timing couldn’t be worse. With a newborn baby, a divorce, an album to record, and a world tour to plan, I don’t need the distraction. She’s off limits. She’s my best friend’s little sister. She’s my nanny. Billie’s a golden drop of sexy sun on a grey autumn day, tempting me into the light and a life full of possibilities. A life not meant for us.
