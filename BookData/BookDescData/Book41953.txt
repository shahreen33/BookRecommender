"What are you doing now that your team is out of the running for the Stanley Cup?"Forget.I need to forget. I need an escape.Only one person isn't falling for my reputation as the NHL's Golden Boy; she captured my attention the minute she called me out for snooping through my best friend's house. She didn't want to hear my reason — she only wanted to playfully give me a hard time.Adalyn is bold, sassy— and the perfect escape.She's everywhere. In town and in my dreams, and suddenly I need to spend every waking moment with her.And I do, making this summer the best off-season I've ever had.But in the midst of getting lost in Adalyn, what I don't expect is to get her pregnant. And what I definitely don't expect is having to fight for her affection.
