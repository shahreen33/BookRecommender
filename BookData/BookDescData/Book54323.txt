My bio might speak for itself, but I still have everything to prove. Everything to gain. Everything to lose. On the field, and off.  I’m here for a reason, and Nate Richardson isn’t one of them… except, he won’t let me relegate him to a non-factor. Even knowing what’s at stake, he won’t let me pass him off.  So I’ll adapt. Open myself up. Dominate my position. Defend my right to be here.  Who says a woman can’t have everything? Or, better yet… who says a woman can’t be a King?
