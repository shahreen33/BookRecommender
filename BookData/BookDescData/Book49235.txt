In her most charming book yet, three-time New York Times Best Illustrator Barbara McClintock has created the Cinderella that every little girl will want to savor -- over and over again.Poor Cinderella, who is relegated to a dingy garret room by her duplicitous stepmother and beleaguered by her nasty stepsisters, never gives in to hostility or revenge. Instead, this sweet heroine remains steadfast in her kind, gentle ways, and her generosity flows like a mountain stream. This tale of virtue rewarded is as charming and rich as any prince. McClintock's warm, humorous, and lucious artwork that reflects the story's French roots, coupled with her disarming text will insure that this book will be loved and cherished -- happily ever after.
