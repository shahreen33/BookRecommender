Flaky PI Devlin Haskell continues making bad choices and ending up in the wrong bed. Now he's hired by Weldon Sofmann, a ruthless ice-cream entrepreneur known as Mr. Softee. But it seems Mr. Softee's empire might be made up of more than just ice-cream trucks. Dev finds the tables turned and suddenly he's painted himself into a corner with the police pointing the finger at him. Maybe it's time to get help from an old Army buddy, Tony 'Dog' Colli, but then again...There's the usual bullets, bombs, and mayhem. Throw in a gorgeous woman or two and you've got just your average week in St. Paul.
