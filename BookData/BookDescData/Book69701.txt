Fallon is the definition of a woman with her “ish” together. Flourishing business, a home of her own in a new city, a relationship on the verge of marriage, and the opportunity to create a life that looks exactly as she wants it. She’s ready, and willing, to embark on a new adventure.She just didn’t expect to have to do it on her own.Business is great, but the home? A total mess. The relationship? Dead in the water. The “new adventure”? Looking more like a disaster. Until Sean.With their shared track record of betrayal and broken hearts, it may be better to stay away, but neither of them can resist. Even their contentious first meeting can’t hide the spark of attraction, and that spark leads to a deeper involvement than either of them is sure they’re ready for. But love doesn’t wait until you’re ready— it blooms in its own time.That’s just the way love goes.
