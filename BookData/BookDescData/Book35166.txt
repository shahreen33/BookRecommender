"This masterfully retold version of Cinderella presents real Korean customs and includes dramatic, brightly colored illustrations" (Children's Literature).This is an enchanting and magical variant of the favorite fairy tale. Publishers Weekly noted that "the text is especially noteworthy for its instructive but unobtrusive incorporation of Korean words." Children's Literature pointed out that "it should be noted that all the illustrations—from those depicting Korean rituals to the smallest clothing details—are the result of the illustrator's extensive research and passionate interest in Korean culture."Like the tree planted to honor her birth, Pear Blossom is beautiful, and the pride of her elderly mother and father.
