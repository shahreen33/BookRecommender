Barry Parsons's blog was named "one of the best food blogs in Canada" by the National Post and sees almost half a million visitors every month. This year his social media followers topped half a million as well. He has worked on recipe development and social-media campaigns for several national brands like Maple Leaf Foods and McCormick Spices. His work on Rock Recipes has been featured in print and on dozens of brand and broadcast media websites all over North America--from the National Post and Huff Post Canada to Food Network Canada and NBC's Today Show. (para break here) In his third book, Rock Recipes Christmas, Parsons provides everything you need to prepare for the ultimate holiday season. From the perfect turkey dinner with all the trimmings to delectable cakes, cookies, breads, and desserts--there are even recipes for gift giving--Parsons offers the blueprint for a truly delicious festive season. A New Year's menu is here too, with a mouth-watering ham and party nibbles for guests. This is old-fashioned family cooking at its very best, reminiscent of Betty Crocker's Best Christmas Cookbook. Every recipe is accompanied by a full-page colour photograph to help with the perfect presentation. With superior printing and production quality at a surprisingly affordable price, Rock Recipes Christmas serves as the ideal holiday gift. Most customers, though, will appreciate acquiring it in the Fall so they, too, can plan a picture-perfect spread of holiday delights.
