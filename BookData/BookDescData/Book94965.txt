"Make no mistake, when it comes to citations of true horror, you will be hard pressed to find a deeper and more challenging example than you will here. Matthews knows the heartbreak and tragedy of his subject. By the time you are done reading this, you will too." ~KEALAN PATRICK BURKE, Bram Stoker Award winning author of KIN and Sour Candy"Absolutely stunning." ~JULIE HUTCHINGS, author of Running Home"Heartbreakingly sad, overwhelmingly disturbing, creepy, violent and poignant. Highly recommended." ~JOHN FD TAFF Bram Stoker Finalist"Filled with such dread and depravity that even the most desensitized among us will feel the pain. Matthews's prose vividly shows the viciousness and hopelessness of drug addiction, and the beautifully horrifying images will stay with you long after the final page is digested." ~JON BASSOFF, author of Corrosion, winner of the Darkfuse Reader's Choice Award"True reality horror, with supernatural elements that only serve to make it more believable." ~MICHAEL BRADFORD, Executive Producer, Monkey Knuckle Films.
