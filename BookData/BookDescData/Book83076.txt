Alternate cover edition of ASIN B01N9CYNK4 My resume is pretty full: I’ve cow-tipped the Minotaur, decimated a gang of weredragons, sucker-punched an Angel, and eaten pancakes with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse… I’ve kidnapped one of the most powerful wizards on the planet, and slaughtered the Brothers Grimm. I’m kind of a big deal.But I never thought I’d find myself at a crossroads, a pawn in a deadly game that I hadn’t known existed, willing to sell my soul to save the life of someone I loved… That’s when I learned true fear, because the world I thought I knew was all just smoke and mirrors, and I was just a puppy playing amongst wolves… If you like Jim Butcher, Kevin Hearne, or Patrick Rothfuss, you will LOVE the fifth installment of The Amazon Bestselling Nate Temple Supernatural Thriller series.
