I was a thief. The invisible girl only he could see. The woman who wanted to be more. He was the mark. The extraordinary cowboy who stole my sixteen-year-old heart. The damaged man who still owned it, even four years later.The Line was where we began.Where fates collided. Where truths derailed.The place where our love story ends.
