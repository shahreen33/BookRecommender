It's a snow day for Libby and Becca! That means making snow angels, sledding, and looking for animal tracks, which leads them to some hungry birds. Libby and Becca decide to help the birds. They build them a tree house to keep them warm and provide snacks so they won't be hungry. Aligned to Common Core standards and correlated to state standards.
