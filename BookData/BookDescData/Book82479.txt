The Stones are the key to everything. Mikal Ryzaardâ€™s plan to eliminate suffering and bring back Paradise at any cost is surging forward. Combining the ancient technology of his Stone with all the resources of global powerhouse MX Global, Ryzaard kills and destroys without fear or responsibility. Soon, he is able to bring two more Stones under his rule, allowing him to control world markets, giving him overwhelming force. The only one with a chance to stop him is Matt Newmark, a twenty-something with a Stone of his own who nearly died after a violent struggle with Ryzaard. Escaping with his girlfriend, Jessica, Matt seeks refuge on his own spectacular world and tries to put the past behind him. When Jessica is abducted, a message from beyond the grave forces him to choose: return and battle Ryzaard or abandon Earth and all he loves. Drawn by love for Jessica and his dad, Matt chooses to fight Ryzaard. The battle takes Matt from Brazil, where he unites with two gifted children, to a Buddhist temple ruin in Thailand where he finds his dad fighting for his life. As Matt battles for the future of the human race, his eyes are opened by new revelations about his own destiny, the nature of the Stones and their place in the Universe. This is Book Two of the Stones Series.
