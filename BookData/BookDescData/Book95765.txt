One thing rules Daniel's life: voyeurism. A desire far too strong to be denied, despite all the guilt it brings him. He knows the risks and is determined to give up his filthy habits. But when he finds himself as landlord to four voluptuous young female students the opportunities for peeping are far too good to resist. Unfortunately he has bitten off far more than he can chew.Most Buxom should be a delight for all those who enjoy the female body in its full, oppulent glory, while there is also plenty of the sort of kinky sex we have come to expect from Aishling Morgan, and even a splash of male submission. A kinky tale of voyeurism from one of our bestselling authors.
