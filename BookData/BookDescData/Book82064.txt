 
  Will orphaned teen Jacob Marshall overcome his troubled past and find love and acceptance in Lancaster County?
 When orphaned Philadelphia teen Jacob Marshall gets in trouble with the police, he has two options - go to juvenile detention or work on a farm outside of the city. But when he chooses the latter, Jacob gets more than he bargained for as he struggles to find his place in an Old Order Amish community in Lancaster County and with Thomas Mast, the straight laced Amish family man who is charged with keeping Jacob in line. Caught between the light and dark, will Jacob be able to face his demons and put his past behind him, or will his pain prove stronger than the faith of the Amish community he's grown to love?
