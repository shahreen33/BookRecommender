Teddy King excels at many things. Playing hockey. Check.  Scoring on and off the ice. Check.  Being stupidly attractive ... Double check.  I knew him way back when. Before he was the guy everyone wanted a piece of, he was just a rebellious college co-ed and one of my more energetic study partners. But secrets have a way of getting out, and a steamy encounter from our college days (that we probably shouldn't have filmed) is about to cause a major scandal. Unless we can work together to stop it. Teddy’s no stranger to hard work … but the thing he wants most?Is me. Note: This high-heat standalone is chock-full of scorching banter and steamy good times. He's a testosterone-dripping hockey player who wants a second chance. She's a tough as nails attorney intent on making partner. Loads of hot banter. No cliffhanger. Enjoy! Your favorite hot jocks are back with an all new stand-alone novel. If you like sexy, confident men who know how to handle a stick (on and off the ice), and smart women who are strong enough to keep all those big egos in check, this series of athlete romances is perfect for you!(Books can be enjoyed in any order.)
