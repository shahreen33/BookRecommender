Hilda can never sit still for long without setting off on another adventure. She can't resist exploring her enchanting worldâ€”a place where trolls walk, crows speak, and mountains move. The magic and folklore of the wild, windswept North come alive in this book about an adventurous little girl and her habit of befriending anything, no matter how curious it might seem.While on an expedition to illustrate the magical creatures of the mountains around her home, Hilda spots a mountain troll. As the blue-haired explorer sits and sketches, she slowly starts to nod off. By the time she wakes up, the troll has totally disappeared and, even worse, Hilda is lost in a snowstorm. On her way home, Hilda befriends a lonely wooden man, and narrowly avoids getting squashed by a lost giant.This brand new hardback edition of Hilda and the Troll (previously sold as Hildafolk in paperback) is packed with bonus, never-before-seen content and offers a fresh chance to read the very first outing in Luke Pearson's ever-popular series of magical Hilda adventures.Luke Pearson, author of Hilda and the Midnight Giant, Hilda and the Bird Parade, and Everything We Miss, has fast become one of the leading talents of the UK comics scene.
