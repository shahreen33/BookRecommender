If you're a teen writer, Writing Fiction: A Hands-On Guide for Teens, has the concise answers you need to your writing questions.

Reviewers of the first edition said: "Writing Fiction is a bare-bones resource. If the information isn't useful, it isn't there. That is what makes it so valuable. Teens don't have to wade through pages of padding to get to the good stuff. The book contains only the good stuff. Teens interested in writing will make good use of this book." CM: CANADIAN REVIEW OF MATERIALS, Manitoba Library Association "This guide to writing fiction speaks directly to young writers and provides tools to help them become successful in their writing endeavours and to have fun doing so ... The author's love of writing and enthusiasm for sharing her expertise with young writers shines through this guidebook, making it a wonderful resource for young writers." CANADIAN TEACHER magazine
