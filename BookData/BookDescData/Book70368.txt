Perfect for fans of Jojo Moyes’s, Me Before You, My Last Love Story is a heartbreaking and poignant tale about the complexities of trauma and whether love can right a wrong. *** I, Simeen Desai, am tired of making lemonade with the lemons life has handed me. Love is meant to heal wounds. Love was meant to make my world sparkle and spin. Love has ripped my life apart and shattered my soul. I love my husband, and he loves me. But Nirvaan is dying. I love my husband. I want to make him happy. But he is asking for the impossible. I don’t want a baby. I don’t want to make nice with Zayaan. I don’t want another chance at another love story. ***WARNING*** Weepers, keep tissues handy.
