Maxine “Pumpkin” Novak is coming home to Chicago to do three things: eat turkey with her family; chill with her best friend, Joy; and avoid all the awful people who gave her that childhood nickname. But a run-in with a dreamy old classmate sidetracks her plans in a heartbeat, and gets her heart pounding.  Bartender Talbot “Stoner” Spice has out-performed his high school epithet and whooped his childhood demons. Dividing all his time between running the neighborhood bar and caring for his widowed mother, he has never seen the need for a serious relationship. That all changes when his high school crush, Max, returns from California and walks into his bar two days before Thanksgiving. She doesn’t know it yet, but she’s not getting away from him again. Get ready for a full plate of hot, yummy Thanksgiving naughtiness that will melt your heart and leave you begging for more. This book is a safe read, containing NO CHEATING, a GUARANTEED HAPPY ENDING and no relationship cliffhangers! And don’t forget Max's best friend Joy, who gets her own story in the second installment of this two-part holiday treat, Comfort and Joy, releasing Dec. 21, 2018!
