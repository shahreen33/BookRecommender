Rhizomatic Literaties (Vol. I) is a collection of short stories from amateur Pakistani writers. The writers you are going to encounter in the first volume are your regular Joes and Janes – they are your mothers, your sons, daughters and sisters – trying to tell their story. This books contains twelve short stories ranging from various genres that defy the conventional narrative that has become the norm in Pakistan – from mermaid infested shores of Karachi, to finding faith in the most unlikely of places, a dystopia inspired by George Orwell and Plato, the story of a mother and son in the post-colonial era, a contemporary that highlights disabilities, a lonely vampire haunting the qurbani grounds of Islamabad and so much more.Rhizomatic Literaties stands to prove that anyone has the ability of being published and you don't have to write about a specific genre to do so, let's celebrate literary diversity in Pakistan.
