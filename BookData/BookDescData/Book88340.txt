The story of Manchester United told through ten key matches that have helped to shape its history.Award-winning football writer Jonathan Wilson selects ten landmark games from Manchester United's past, from the first time they lifted the FA Cup, beating Bristol City in 1909, to the Cup victory of 2016 that proved to be Louis van Gaal's last match in charge. In doing so, he identifies the pivotal moments in the club's rise to becoming one of the foremost teams of the twentieth century.With his trademark tactical acumen, Wilson goes back to the games themselves and subjects them to forensic examination, re-evaluating and reassessing, and going beyond the white noise of banal player quotes and instant judgements to uncover what really happened. The result is a unique football history of one of England's greatest and most famous clubs.
