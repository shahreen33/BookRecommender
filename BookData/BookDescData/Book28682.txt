One playboy billionaire. One heartbroken heiress. One sham marriage. What could go wrong? *** That’s what notorious playboy Silas Cecil-Coke thinks as he returns to England to persuade Molly O’Flaherty to marry him. Certainly, their brief fling last year ended in heartbreak (and a black eye,) but matters are different now. Molly must marry to save her company, and if she must, Silas is determined that he’ll be the man she chooses. But between the bitter memories and the competing suitors, Silas discovers that wooing a bride is no easy task, unless, of course, he decides to stop playing fair… ***The Persuasion of Molly O’Flaherty is a 40,000 word novella and is the first of the London Lovers duet. It is not necessary to read The Seduction of Molly O’Flaherty first. It is intended for mature audiences only.***
