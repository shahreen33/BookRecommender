Four months ago, I had a one night stand that blew my mind, and literally blew my ‘you know what’.She’s the one that got away, and I’ve been craving her ever since.Just the thought of her, just a scent of the perfume she wore, and I’m hard as a rod.So how do you think I feel now that she’s back in my life?Great? Excited? Aroused? Ecstatic?Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!Because having her back in my life is pure torture.Not only is she my new PA, and I have a strict hands off policy at work, she’s also my father’s spanking new stepdaughter.That makes her my stepsister.I’ve heard of keeping it in the family but come on, that’s got to be crossing the line.The thing is, everything about Carley makes me want to cross the line.I want to rip her out of her ridiculous new business clothes, breathe in her delectable scent, throw her down on my bed, and show her what I meant to show her the first night I had her.You know what? Screw the rules!
