This delightful retelling of the classic poem 'Twas the Night Before Christmas gives Mrs. Saint Nick a starring role and the recognition she deserves. 'Twas the Late Night of Christmas and all through the house everyone was exhausted, even the mouse. The children were whining. The house was a mess. Mom slumped in despair from all of the stress. The perfect gift for hassled parents overwhelmed by the crazy-making business of Christmas.
