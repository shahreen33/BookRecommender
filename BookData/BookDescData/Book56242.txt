Jack and Jill meet on Freshers Big Party Night at university and for both of them it’s love at first sight. Despite their backgrounds, personalities and interests being poles apart, the relationship flourishes during their university years. It’s not quite as comfortable when their studies are over and they start work, Jack in the City and Jill as a teacher.  Way back when they first met, they’d shared the joke that their names were those of the nursery rhyme. Down the line, they fail to recognise that their lives are matching the plot – Jack falls down and Jill comes tumbling after.  Their relationship is on the rocks. Can it survive?  What reviewers say about R J Gould’s writing:  ‘R J Gould is a sharp, perceptive observer of human relationships, demonstrating both their fragility and their absurdity.’  ‘I loved this book! Tender, witty, funny, with characters you can totally relate to.'  ‘I laughed from the beginning and didn't stop until the end and I couldn't put it down in between.’  ‘A story about trust, resilience, forgiveness and fresh starts, narrated with humour and insight. It kept my interest hooked and made me smile all the way through. A great read!’
