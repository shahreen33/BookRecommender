Full &amp; Round is the debut collection from Toya Rochelle. The collection consists of 40 poems that highlight the "lived experience." The best that one can hope for is a life that is full of love, joy, and passion. And even with some ups and downs, the collective support from family and friends shapes and sustains us.
