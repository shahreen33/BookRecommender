The way we react to the circumstances Life throws at us shapes our journey.  For Hadley, an instance at the start of her adult life has been haunting her the whole way. And now she is returning home with her heart heavy. Her life definitely did not turn out the way she had planned. (life rarely does) Not only is she freshly divorced, but she has to face the ghosts of her past, and the reason she left home to begin with...Max Brandon.  Max is only too happy to see his Hadley return and only too willing to correct the errors that long ago made her run. After all of these years they are going to find out if forgiveness is an option....if love is strong enough to heal...if forever is written in their stars.
