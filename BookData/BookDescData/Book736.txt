My marriage seemed perfect from the outside looking in.People envied me. They wanted my life, wanted to be me.Mrs Alejandra Gambino. Wife of Dino Gambino. Daughter of Eduardo Castillo.Respected. Loved. Mob royalty.They had no idea of the horrors that lurked behind closed doors.They didn't know I was at the lowest point a person could reach.Enter Julius Carter.Aloof, handsome, blue-eyed Julius Carter.He saved me.I screwed him over.Now everybody was after me. My life was forfeit.It was only a matter of time. I was a dead woman walking.The question was, who would get to me first?
