There’s no such thing as a right time to fall in love. It happens, or it doesn’t. Possible to fake, but not force. Impossible to simply wish away.  This is the path that hero and heroine find themselves on.  Neither of them quite ready to entertain the idea of dating, let alone love… but they can’t seem to avoid each other either. He calls it “fate”. She calls it “crazy”.  Maybe neither of them is wrong.  When pretense is stripped away, and feelings – good, bad, and ugly – are laid bare, all they’re left with is their truth. It’s up to them to figure out what to do with it.
