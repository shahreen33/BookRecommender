A Feather Brain…  That’s me and a bag of chips. Ever since I started working here at the Unsylum—I’ve been running around in a haze of purple insanity. Somehow, this job has come to mean more to me than being an overpaid maid. It's become a calling that I can’t ignore. One that leaves me constantly torn between running away like a headless chicken or opening every cell in this place and letting them all out - consequences be damned. Because right now, I’m not sure if I’m having sympathy for the devil or if the devil is having sympathy for me. That’s enough to scare anyone.
