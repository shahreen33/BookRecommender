Brave and beautiful, this remarkable debut collection of poetry features the edgy, modern voice of an urban female. From poems of a fraught childhood in Bridgend, south Wales—where a sensitive child escapes through imaginative games—to works depicting student rivalries, damaged peers, and tense situations associated with teenage problems, this compilation matures with an underlying sweetness. Additional poems explore the sensual rapture of love and the clear-eyed realization of its inevitable disappointments.
