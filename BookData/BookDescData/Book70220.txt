The Water Wars have left Commander Rick Strong beaten but not broken, and an invitation to head the defense forces on the new Atopian colony is an opportunity to start over again and renew his relationship with his estranged wife. As the world comes back into focus for the Commander, it seems the perfect time to start a family of his own, but on Atopia, starting a family isn't what it used to be, and time suddenly seems to be running out as dangerous forces threaten to consume Atopia itself.All of the Atopia stories begin at the same moment in time so that you can start by reading any of them, and then read the others in any order you choose to slowly reveal the mystery and terrifying danger that connects them all. Atopia is a near future world without borders that balances on the brink of post-humanism and eco-Armageddon.
