Even if those stories happen to be true. As his sympathy for Sofia and her family grows, Artur finds himself asking how far he’s willing to go to stop them. When his investigation reveals shocking connections between his targets, the Russian mafia, and the CIA, he's forced to choose. Between duty and conscience. Between honor and desire.
