R.I.S.C. (Rescue, Intel, Security, &amp; Capture): An elite, private security team who will stop at nothing to protect the ones they love.  The highly anticipated romantic suspense series by debut author, Anna Blakely.  &gt;HE LIED TO PROTECT HER It’s been two months since Jake McQueen walked away from the woman he loves. With the other members of R.I.S.C.’s Alpha Team by his side, Jake left to ensure Olivia’s safety. Now that he’s back, he’s ready to take their relationship to the next level. Before he can do that, Jake will have to confess his greatest sin. All he's ever wanted was to keep Olivia safe, but Jake fears his need to protect will end up pushing her away from him forever.  DANGER’S CLOSER THAN SHE THINKS To Olivia, forgiving Jake for leaving the way he did seems impossible. When he shows up unexpectedly and explains what happened, she realizes she has no choice but to let him off the hook. Now closer than ever, Olivia’s just starting to believe they have a future when Jake confesses to a decade-long secret that turns her world upside down. To make matters worse, Olivia has no idea that someone is watching her, just waiting for the perfect chance to end her life…for good, this time.  ***Taking a Risk, Part Two brings you Jake and Olivia’s Happily Ever After. Though it can be read as a stand-alone, I recommend you read Taking a Risk, Part One first.  ***These are the only books in this series that have a two-part storyline. The other novels will each be standalones, with characters from the previous books popping up here and there within the different stories.
