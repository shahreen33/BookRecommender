I have it all, money, looks, and any woman I want.Till I meet her and my universe is knocked on its ass and she wants nothing to do with me.

My motto: never date the same man twice. I have less chance of breaking my heart that way.Till my eyes land on the only man I’ll break my rule for.She thinks she can run. That I’ll let her get away.He thinks he can handle a woman like me.He has no idea.A man who has it all needs one thing and one thing only. A temptress.Watch me Tempt the Playboy.
