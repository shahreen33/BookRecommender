Gasping for air inside an ice-filled tub. Convulsing from an electric shock to the brain. Struggling against restraints that bind and gag… Just another day at Agnews, The Great Asylum for the Insane. But for Evelyn, the night is so much worse. “Demons—wearing white coats and crisp white hats—prowled the halls, searching for a patient who would serve as their evening’s entertainment. And from the moment I’d arrived, I seemed to be their favorite play toy.” A young woman committed to the asylum during the late 19th century, Evelyn knows she isn’t insane, that the creatures she sees and suffers at the clawed hands of aren’t hallucinations. Yet she’s all alone but for their unholy company and the doctors trying to vanquish these “visions.”All alone but for the others who can see what Evelyn sees, too. And they’re coming for her. In this short-story prequel to Patricia Leever’s Divinity, we meet Evelyn Brighton before the tattoos—before a century of training and supernatural combat makes her an official bad-ass. Both eerie and endearing, Clarity transports you back to Evelyn’s origins, revealing the crucial turning point that delivers her from misunderstood maiden to deadly demon hunter.
