Book Club Just Got Real. Jeanine Phelps is tired of reading about other women who grab life and have epiphanies. She challenges her book club to live like the heroines in the books they love. At first, seizing the day is pure fun until it generates an upset in each of their lives:  Jeanine’s husband is so inspired by her new vitality it triggers a bizarre mid-life crisis involving tacos.  Paula, the model PTA soccer mom, starts fighting with her man about the family printing business until she’s drawn back to her  secret passion.  Kate, a single mom and teacher, can’t figure out if the rekindled friendship with the new museum creator is worth the romantic risk.  Anne, a mother of four babies, works to hold the book club together while trying to figure out her own identity. When everyone wants to quit the challenge, the media’s spotlight makes it impossible. Can they rely on each other while keeping their priorities? And more importantly, is their sanity worth the chance to each become a heroine in her own life?
