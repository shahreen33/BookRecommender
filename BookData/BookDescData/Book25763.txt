What she discovers, however, causes her to question everything she knows about the war on magic and her own deeply-buried motivations.Still reeling from those revelations, Sara reluctantly partners with the Magician to find and retrieve the most elusive member of the Council, the Hanged Man. Working together far too closely for comfort, Sara learns a series of startling truths about the mercurial, exasperating, and manipulative Magician--including one secret that could finally give her the answers she most craves...if it doesn't destroy her first.The hits just keep on coming when you're Forever Wilde.
