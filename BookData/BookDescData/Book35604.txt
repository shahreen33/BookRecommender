Are you one of the millions who has spent many pleasant hours reading about Nero Wolfe converting the calories from his gourmet dining (albeit grudgingly) into mental energy to solve a murder? If you have traipsed through that morass of neuroses, idiosyncrasies and obsessive-compulsive behaviors, you must have questions. Did you know that while Wolfe usually tilts the scales near one-seventh of a ton, he may once have weighed less than his svelte associate, Archie Goodwin? Or how many times the "unbreakable" rules of the house are broken? Or why Fritz speaks French although he's not from France? Or how many bullet and knife wounds Wolfe carries on his normally sedentary carcass? Or what Inspector Cramer's first name is? Or how the characters evolved over the four decades of their existence?This book will provide you with the answers to those questions and a thousand others. I hope you find it satisfactory.
