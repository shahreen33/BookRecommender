Rock bottom has never felt so good.At least, thatâ€™s what I tell myself when I bargain with the enemy and score a renovation for my hair salon. The enemy? Nick Stamos, my best friendâ€™s older brother. Heâ€™s got a body and face the Greek gods would envy but his personality needs a major overhaul. Heâ€™s surly. A rule-follower.Did I mention heâ€™s seen me naked? I may have crushed on him for years, but the only place I want Nick swinging his hammer nowadays is at my salon. Except, he needs something in return. . . A fake girlfriend. And Iâ€™m just reckless enough to say yes.Hold Me Today is the first book in the highly anticipated series, Put A Ring On It. ðŸ–¤COVER REVEAL: January 3rd, 2019ðŸ–¤RELEASE DATE: January 17th, 2019ðŸ–¤EXCLUSIVE RELEASE ALERT: http://bit.ly/HoldMeTodayðŸ–¤ BLOGGER SIGN-UPS: http://bit.ly/HoldMeTodayEVENTS
