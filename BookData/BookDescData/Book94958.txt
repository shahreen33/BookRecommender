Big, nasty creatures are bubbling up to the surface just as an earthquake gives copycat serial killer Ben Ray Collins the window he needs to escape from prison and continue his lifeâ€™s work. Destiny seems to have a plan for him as he finds himself at the closed-down campground with a cast of scientists on location looking into the strange disturbances happening at the lake.  Ben Ray Collins has a vision for a bloody outcome at Camp Still Waters, but never for a second foresees finding himself underground battling enormous, mutated snake-fish, huge crabs, massive spiders and terrifying cryptids.
