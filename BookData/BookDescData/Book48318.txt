The perfect man for me is the one who broke my heart. #thanksbutnothanksOnce bitten.Twice shy.Yeah, I wish.I'm on a mission to find myself a nice, solid, respectable man. The only problem is nice, solid, and respectable comes in a meh package and is B-O-R-I-N-G as hell.It's been established. I have one type. Bad Boy. I tried the other flavors, I really did. But there's nothing like the allure of a man who takes what he wants without apology. As if my love life isn't dramatic enough, Dean Bennett walks into my life again thinking he's going to win me back with his charm and charisma. He might come in a different package, but under that expensive suit he's still the same cocky, arrogant, pompous prick who only cares about numero uno. I'm not that naïve young girl anymore so I have to ignore the fact that the way he looks at me practically sets my panties on fire.Everyone deserves a second chance to right a wrong. The problem? He's not just an ex-boyfriend…He's my ex-husband.
