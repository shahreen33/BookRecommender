Alissa and her older brother Trent head north to find the father neither of them remembers in one last ditch attempt to create an ordinary family for themselves.But some things just aren’t meant to be and happily-ever-after may not be in the plans for Alissa. The journey from Bakersfield to Seattle is strewn with misadventures as she and Trent find themselves caught up in frightening situations, encounters with the police, and unexpected betrayals.Received honorable mention in the 2012 Leapfrog Press Fiction Contest.
