***UPDATE 19 Dec 2018: As it has been 6 years (!) since 'Equal Parts' was published, I'm happily taking it down from Amazon for purchase (I no longer feel comfortable charging money for older stories, and am keen to not feed monster corporations like Amazon any longer). It will be available FOR FREE on WATTPAD, under the same title and cover, but likely under my other writing pseudonym. At this stage, it does not have a sequel, but who knows what the future holds ;-) If you have any concerns or questions, drop me a line! Have a wonderful day!***Nobody knows happiness better than nineteen-year-old Felicity Eastwood.
