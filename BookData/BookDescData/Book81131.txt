The retirement village, Sage Gardens, has villas set amidst beautiful, lush gardens surrounding a sparkling, blue lake. Everything is peaceful in the small, secure retirement community.  That is until a resident, James, dies at his birthday party. Given his age it is presumed that he died of natural causes, but foul play is suspected and three residents join forces to try and uncover the truth. Although they are retired they use their skills and experiences from their professions as a detective, crime journalist, and accountant, in the search for the murderer. But first they have to work out who a mysterious, yet familiar resident is.  Just who is the mystery resident and will she prove to be an ally or foe? Will the ‘Sage Gardens Sleuths’ be able to catch the killer before one of them becomes a victim themselves?
