  "THERE IS NO ONE. I TRAVEL ALONE. I LIVE ALONE. ALWAYS."
Battle-scarred Thrand the Destroyer has only one thing on his mind: settling old scores. 
  But with the beautiful Lady of Lingfold as his prisoner, the unyielding warrior starts to dream of a loving wife and a home to call his own.
Cwen is also seeking justice, but she knows the fragile alliance she's built with Thrand will only last as long as they share a common enemy. 
  Unless they can find a way to leave revenge to the gods to forge a new life together.
