A secret list of the desires of Lady Olivia Rathbourne:  1. Disregard convention 2. Follow my heart 3. Bed the Earl of WyldewoodA decade ago, Olivia had expected to marry the Earl of Wyldewood, only to have happiness stolen from her before his ring could be placed upon her finger. Now he stands before her, as proud and arrogant and handsome as ever, vowing to rescue her. Well, he's got some nerve turning up after all these years. Where was he when she needed him? As for the earl, scandal has never touched him nor has impropriety ever besmirched his name. But his penchant for doing the expected does have his family calling him, well, dull. Isn't it time to flaunt society's conventions and do what he's always wanted? And first on his list: Olivia in his bedâ€”with or without a wedding.
