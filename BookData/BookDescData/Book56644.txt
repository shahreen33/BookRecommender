Hiding in Ocean’s Isle after being suspended from the force for two months, my hot, feisty, neighbor is the last person I should be interested in.But the next thing I know, we keep running into each other, which lead to some pretty intense sexually-loaded moments.I’m not supposed to fall for her, especially knowing I’ll be going home in a week to face the mess I left behind. It’s just supposed to be a mind-blowing one-night stand.Then I walk into the precinct, and I meet the new psychologist. I sure as hell didn’t see it coming, and now I have to bare my soul to the woman who should’ve remained a fantasy.Keeping her at a distance is next to impossible, but knowing her life might be in danger if I give into the growing attraction between us, I have no choice but to keep pretending to be the playboy joker everyone thinks I am.But will I be able to keep resisting the powerful pull between us?Will I be able to hide her from the man who swore to destroy my life the way I destroyed his?Will I ever survive the consequences of that fatal night?
