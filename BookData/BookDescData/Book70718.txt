What kid raised in recent generations hasn't pretended to be a superhero at some point: worn a cape, "flown" around, bounced imaginary bullets or shot "blasts of power" from hands or eyes? Why not? After all, the superhero is the perfect modern fantasy: powerful, respected, and loved by the public, but with a message of responsibility, duty, truth, and justice that appeals to parents as well as kids. In countless comic books (and now "graphic novels"), cartoons, and live-action television shows and films, superheroes continue to thrill and capture our imagination while also celebrating some of our better qualities. Who wouldn't want to be a hero? With ICONS, you can be! Steve Kenson, the designer of the best-selling Mutants &amp; Masterminds delivers a superpowered new role-playing game, inspired by the fast-playing old-school games and the new generation of narrative role-play! Within its pages are complete rules for character creation, abilities and powers, random adventure generation, a rogue's gallery of villains, a complete adventure and all the superheroic action you can handle!
