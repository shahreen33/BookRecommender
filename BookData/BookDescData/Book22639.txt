TWO POWERFUL FAMILIES... ONE MAGNIFICENT PASSION... SWEPT BY THE RAGING WINDS OF DESTINYIt was the last summer of paradise, an innocent time of picnics among the lush bluegrass and midnight balls under gaily painted Chinese lanterns. For Leigh Alexandra Travers, her Virginia plantation of Travers Hill was the only world she ever wanted. And then she met Neil Braedon...Captured by Comanches as a child, raised in their savage yet spiritual world, Neil had no use for the gentleman's role demanded by his proud Braedon birthright. Yet from the moment he held Leigh in his arms, he was possessed by her-a woman of such passion and power that no man could ever forget her.As the cruel specter of war rose across the divided land, Leigh fought relentlessly to preserve the faded shadows of her Southern past. But her future lay out West with Neil among the awesome, untamed wilderness... following a magnificent destiny that would unite two great families... triumphing in a love that would reawaken past splendors with a shining new glory.
