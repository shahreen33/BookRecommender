Otto Octavius leaves the moniker of Doctor Octopus behind...and once again becomes the Superior Spider-Man! If you think you've already read the most intense, unexpected and surprisingly heartbreaking Superior Spider-Man story there is, prepare to be proven wrong! Otto is going to show the world that he's the most pragmatic, most eff ective and (to him, anyway) best super hero on the planet. But when a villain that considerably overpowers Otto shows up in San Francisco, there's no way the Superior Spider-Man can triumph, right? Right? Can you see Otto smirking from where you're reading this? COLLECTING: SUPERIOR SPIDER-MAN 1-6
