Judas Iscariot journeys through life and death, grappling with his place in “The Greatest Story Ever Told.”EVERY STORY NEEDS A VILLAIN  Judas Iscariot is one of the most tragic figures of the Bible -- an acolyte, a betrayer, a villain. But if it wasn’t for Judas… the story of Jesus wouldn’t work. Before he was born, he was a slave to the story. In a religion built on redemption and forgiveness, one man had to sacrifice himself for everyone… and it wasn’t Jesus.  Written by Emmy and WGA Award-nominated Jeff Loveness (Nova) and illustrated by Jakub Rebelka (Namesake), Judas is a visually striking odyssey of spirituality and fantasy that follows Judas Iscariot through the depths of Hell as he grapples with his place in the “Greatest Story Ever Told,” facing trials and tribulations taken from between the lines of the Bible. Kirkus Starred!  "Villainy is re-examined and religious narrative questioned in this bold and uncomfortably thought-provoking graphic novel about Judas Iscariot. ...This book is not for all readers, but all who read it will be challenged and enriched by the questions it raises."
