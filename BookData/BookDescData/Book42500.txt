One of the most complete representations of this century's art to hit the shelves in years, The 20th-Century Art Book offers 500 full-page reproductions, each by a different artist. No matter how famous, each artist has but one page, accompanied by a concise, informative block of text. Presented in alphabetical order, each artist, regardless of stature, is treated in exactly the same manner as the other 499 others in the book. Some images are delightfully complimented, others deeply agitated by the work that, by chance of the alphabet, happens to lie on the facing page.
