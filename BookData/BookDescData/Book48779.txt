Frumpy is not your typical clown. He doesn't do birthday parties, he isn't in the circus, and he's never run for public office. Instead, Frumpy is a chain-smoking, cynical anarchist who is more interested in sticking it to the stuffed-shirt establishment than making balloon animals or performing in the center ring. Whether he's filling in for the elementary school music teacher, dishing legal advice to the kids, or going paintballing with the guys, Frumpy entertains, enlightens and always surprises. Judd Winick's early newspaper work tells of one clown's attempts to assimilate into suburban life, or at least get suburban life to assimilate to him.
