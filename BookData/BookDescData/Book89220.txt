My dreg name is The Fighter. I’m an expert in mixed martial arts. I had to betray my dreg brothers to protect my child. I’m a traitor now. An outsider. So I keep my distance from them. Hiding in the shadows. But I have more important things to worry about than trying to win back their trust. I have a five-year-old kid to take care of now. She scares the hell out of me. I don’t know the slightest thing about kids. I need a nanny to care for my daughter. So I place an ad and hope that someone will reply. The woman who responds is not what I expect. She’s young and gorgeous and way out of my league. But she’ll have to do, since I have no one else. I try not to want her. I try to keep my distance. But she is pure temptation. And I’m falling under her spell. She doesn’t know that working for me puts her in danger. She doesn’t know who or what I am. And I plan to keep it that way. Because the truth could hurt her. And so could I. ____This is an 8-book series. These books are romantic suspense with sci-fi elements. Each contains a separate romance with an HEA (and no cliffhangers!). However, it is recommended that they be read in order to get the full "dreg" experience. Due to strong language and adult situations, these books are recommended for readers ages 18 and up.
