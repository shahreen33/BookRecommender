The buzz of chemistry between them is undeniable, but should she go out with the arrogant troublemaker? They come from two different worlds. Chase is raised by a prominent visumary family who can see and speak to the dead.

The differences between Jules’s and Chase’s worlds becomes painfully obvious when Chase's descendants join the opposition to the Winklevosses and support the merciless rulers.   Jules has never felt a strong connection to her biological family, but she knows being a Winklevoss twin is special. Will history repeat itself? Not if Jules can help it. Refusing to make compromises to soothe Chase's ego, Jules must decide if she has the confidence to be her own person and lead a revolution against the crazy dictators. Can she save the day and still fall in love?
