 
  “I stopped fighting my inner monster. We’re on the same side now.”  
  
 Aris is back, but he's not alone. His once greatest enemy fights alongside him to take down Coast City's biggest villain. But the city isn't how they remembered. Vampires have taken over, and Aris isn't powerful enough to defeat them. His only hope is to tap into the ancient powers coursing through his blood but doing so may have severe consequences. The monster buried inside him must be unleashed.
