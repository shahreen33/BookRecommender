A JOURNEY OF TRIUMPH This is a story of life. Life with all its beautiful moments and tragic times... and the realizations that come from them. It's a narrrative about big dreams and unshakable spirits, and of running on nothing but hope even in the face of enormous obstacles. It's a journey of triumph - where what is good and right truly comes out ahead. Guided by seven sisters, follow this true story about a family of 13 as they discover they already have everything they need to cross the finish line strong. To cross the finish line as champions. It's what they were made for. And the same applies to you. Run with them through a sometimes impossible course, past obstacles and over hurdles toward a finish line of epic proportion. The challenges might look big. They may even be big. But there's always a way through if you keep this in mind... No matter what you're going through, you're not alone. Seven exists to prove it.
