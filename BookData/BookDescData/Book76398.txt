The monster threat against her life has been contained. For now. But they are attracted to her power and her untrained magic, and it’s a race against time before they break through again.And the monsters aren’t the only ones trying to kill Cassia. The Queen’s Trial is approaching, and her power makes her a target and a threat to the other noble houses vying to be queen. With her enemies piling up and only Four Fae Princes on her side she’s running out of options. There's only one rule in Queen's Trial: Survive.
