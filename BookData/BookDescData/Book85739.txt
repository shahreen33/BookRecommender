*This is a STANDALONE novel with a slow burn, a seriously steamy ending, and an unconventional HEA*What she needs most might be what she least expects… Living without air conditioning in a Philadelphia heat wave has Claire on the brink of a total meltdown. When she escapes her overheated apartment to spend a day at the park, the last thing she expects—or wants—is for a gorgeous guy to chat her up. But his sweet smile and nerdy charm are impossible for even Claire to resist. Patience and persistence go hand in hand… For Ben, Claire is the One, but there’s a small snag—she’s terrified of a man’s touch. But now that he’s found her, he’ll never let her go, even if he never gets to hold her. Another snag? Her obvious attraction to his best friend. Sometimes it takes fire to wash you clean… Ben respects Claire’s firm boundaries, but Andy crashes right through them. He’s arrogant, crude, a total jackass…and criminally sexy. Even if she can fix what’s broken inside her, how will she choose between the delicious slow burn she feels with Ben and the explosive inferno Andy ignites in her? Can they find their happy ending without three hearts going up in flames?This book contains ménage sex.
