1945: WWII may be over in Europe, but in the South Pacific, it beats on, hammer-and-tongs. Johnny Willman is a 20-year-old soldier in Supreme Commander MacArthur's Army. He is sent on "Operation Teeth" - a rescue mission into New Guinea's heart of darkness. Johnny travels with two Australians - Dingo, the veteran Major, and Footy, their colorful pilot. It's supposed to be a three-day piece of cake. It turns out to be anything but. They almost die getting there. And then they're attacked by "the Father," 4,000 lbs. of man-eating crocodile (based on a real man-eater from the period). It mauls his group and Johnny wounds it. From that instant, it hunts him relentlessly, until the hair-raising confrontation on the beaches of the South Pacific.Johnny captures Katsu. The P O W has only one possession left - his ancient Samurai sword. The men run from the great reptile, directly toward the "Valley of the Cannibals," home to the most bloodthirsty headhunters on the Stone Age island.Then there's the lovely Gwyndolyn. She nursed Johnny back to health, but to have a chance with Gwyn, he must meet the challenge she sets for him. That launches an inner odyssey as perilous as the very real physical one. Johnny is consumed by hatred for Katsu and all Japanese. Then there's the rivalry with his companions. Will he be able to overcome it all in order to survive? Is it possible to learn respect for one's enemies - and even find friendship - while a world battered by the most horrific war in history tries to forge peace?
