Pär Lagerkvist's prose novella Bödeln ("The Hangman", 1933), later adapted for the stage, (The Hangman, 1933; play, 1934) shows his growing concern with the totalitarianism and brutality that began to sweep across Europe in the years prior to World War II. Nazism was one of the main butts of the work and a weekly tabloid-format Nazi newspaper "Der Stürmer" responded with a very dismissive review.
