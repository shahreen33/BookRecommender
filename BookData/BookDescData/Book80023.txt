Winged raptors, deadly sand-warriors, and a rebellious girl who breaks all the rules.Sixteen-year-old Kiva Fariq has always dreamed of soaring on the four-winged raptors that scour the desert skies. But the windwalker sect is closed off to women. What's more, the flying predators are said to kill any woman attempting to bond them.Undeterred, Kiva attempts the perilous windwalker trials in secret. Should she survive, she will face an even greater challenge: bonding a raptor of her own. When signs of an ancient enemy appear upon the plains, she desires more than ever to protect her people. But the threat is closer than anyone realizes, and will soon bury them all in a tomb of sand and stoneâ€”unless she can stop it.
