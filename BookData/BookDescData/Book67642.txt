Her neighbor Rafe is everything she's not. Bella isn't looking for a hero, and he's not looking for a hookup. Do they have anything in common besides one unexpected night of passion?  The Fifteenth Minute Just because Bella's neighbor is a movie star doesn't mean she's happy. Lianne Challice is the girl nobody takes the time to get to know. Except for D.J.
