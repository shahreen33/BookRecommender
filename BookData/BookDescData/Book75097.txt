Trust no one. The Remnants are outsiders on the planet they once called Home. 500 years after the Rock, Earth is an arid wasteland, inhabited only by a handful of human descendants &amp; mutated animals. To survive, they must plant one of their own--Mo' Steel--as leader of a wild band of surface-dwelling Marauders. But first he has to prove himself by defeating the Beasts, defending the group from Slizzer attacks, and somehow safely leading the Marauders to The Source. And if thatâ€™s not enough---he has to keep an eye on those closest to him...because he no longer knows who his friends are.
