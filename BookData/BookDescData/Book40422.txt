In gentle prose and warm, appealing pictures the author and the illustrator present a story that is a familiar one in many families. Mom leaves for work just as Rachel and her younger brother, Josh, are helping their grandmother set the table for dinner. Sometimes, Rachel hears Mom come home. She wakes Josh and they go downstairs to share quiet time. Full color.
