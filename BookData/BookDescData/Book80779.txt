Spending money is one thing the Wakefield twins are very good at, but earning money isn't that easy. Especially earning $87.50 in just three weeks. That's how much Jessica and Elizabeth need to take a bus trip to visit their great-aunt Helen. Mr. Wakefield has told the twins that they must be responsible for earning their own bus fare. Elizabeth's idea of dogsitting is the perfect solution, especially since their friend Ken is helping them. But that's when Joe comes along. The poor dog has been abused and the three suspect Joe's owner is the guilty one. If Jessica, Elizabeth, and Ken keep quiet about Joe and collect their pay, the twins will have all of the money they need. But what's moe important-the trip or a dog who needs help?104 pages
