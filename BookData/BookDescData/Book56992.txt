Recently revived Private Detective Bastard teams up with his old partner, Criminal Mastermind Miguel Evangelista, in this absurdist narcotic cyber-punk noir. The two cons hatch a plan to destabilize the official monopoly of institutionalized drug dependency while pushing their own product - a newly discovered wonder-drug they call White Dove. Hilarity ensues.Join Bastard as he bumbles through a circus of a city, implausible architecture, and vast subterranean caverns of variety lights and sounds in this genre-hopping pataphysical romp. Absurd, playful and dystopic, Adventures of Bastard and M.E. is as uncategorizable as it is entertaining.
