Hi, I'm Teagan Foster. I have a tendency to over-exaggerate a lot, but trust me when I say that there have been 2 worst days of my life.The first worst day was when my baby sister, Meagan, died in an accident. It tore me to shreds, and it was my fault. The second worst day was a month later, when my father left because my mother was cheating on him. All I want is to escape reality, to escape my own head. The horrors and thoughts that crowd my mind as I lie in bed at night are too much for me. It's been a month since my father moved out, and this is where my story begins.
