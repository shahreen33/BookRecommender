They've had multiple lives together, but this may be their last.  As a neurologist, Nick Reilly believes everything can be explained by science. But he can’t explain her—Quinn Stewart, an irresistible patient who knows things about him she shouldn’t. And insists that at some point, she was his wife.  Something else he can’t explain: he remembers her too.  Quinn wakes each morning remembering new details of the life they shared. She’s desperate for the dreams to stop. With each one, she finds herself craving what she had with Nick more than the life—and the fiancé—she already has.  Nick and Quinn share an attraction neither can deny, but one that might destroy everything.  Just like it did before.
