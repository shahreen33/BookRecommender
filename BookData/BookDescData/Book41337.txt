Dr. Herbert J. Hall was the originator of Honest Work for Occupational Therapy. He established a sanatorium where he stressed the value of crafts as an effective medical tool. In order to demonstrate his discoveries, he gave lectures and wrote many articles. His works include: The Work of Our Hands: A Study of Occupations for Invalids (1915), The Untroubled Mind (1915), Handicrafts for the Handicapped (1916) and The Sea World Waits: A Book of Poems (1922).
