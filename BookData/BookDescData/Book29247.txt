Six contestants pair off into three teams of one man and one woman as part of a pilot season for a new reality show called Stranded. The challenge: Survive thirty days in a hostile and brutal environment for a chance to split a half-million-dollar prize. Victor, the showâ€™s creator, chooses the northern Arctic as the first location, but after a single day, his mistake is clear: They are not alone. Their presence awakens a relentless and unforgiving predator that feeds on greed, lust and fear. In this game, the lucky ones get to die.
