A threat of total elimination hangs over the heads of all who inhabit the Celtique Isles, and only young Ashlynn, soon to be crowned High Queen of one of the most powerful nations among the Isles, can bring them together to overcome years of petty differences and stand united against the growing threat to their lands and their lives. Set in a land of magic and mystery, this is a tale of pride and devotion. Ashlynn has a deep love for her kingdom and her homelands, and risks her own life to try and spare her people the pain of war. She is a ruler unlike any other, one who has inherited the heavy burden of not only a crown but the duty of an Elemental, one who has the ability to shift their form into that of a dragon and have special kinship with others of her kind. When the High King of Caedia, a nation once a part of the Isles, decides to bring war to the Elementals, to try and rid the earth of them in his quest for ultimate power, Ashlynn must grow up in a hurry and learn to fight, as well as find the rest of her kindred who have been scattered across the globe for generations. Little does she know that the man she prepares to fight is only a pawn in a much bigger war, and that the real face of terror has been hiding in plain sight all along.
