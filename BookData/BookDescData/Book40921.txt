First baby of the New Year…delivered by a cowboy!  When Wyoming cowboy Brice DeWitt placed an ad for a housekeeper-cook at his Flying D Ranch, he expected a sturdy, mature woman—not a petite, pregnant applicant who was about to deliver on his doorstep.  Madison Carlyle needed his protection—and his name. But an isolated Wyoming ranch in the middle of winter was no place for a new mother and child. If he let them stay, he risked his heart. But if he sent them away, would he miss his best chance at having the one thing he’d always wanted? A family?  A Romantic Times Top Pick and W.I.S.H.
