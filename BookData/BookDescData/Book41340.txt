In 1979, Larry Jones was ministering in Haiti, where he was approached by a young boy who hadn't eaten all day. The child asked for a nickel to buy a roll. Recalling the wheat surplus back home in Oklahoma, Jones soon started Feed The Children, initially a wheat-exporting outreach, that grew into one of the world's largest and most respected charities. Year after year, it efficiently distributes food and other essentials to impoverished families throughout the United States and much of the rest of the world. In this audio, Jones describes his journey from a childhood as the son of two barbers in America's heartland to a career that takes him to war-torn countries and areas devastated by natural disasters-as well as into the halls of Congress and the offices of foreign governments to solicit support and funding. Rich in moving stories, Keep Walking offers vivid insights into the faith that moved Jones to do God's work and shows listeners that they, too, can make a difference.
