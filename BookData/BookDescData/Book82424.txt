LIGHTSPEED is an online science fiction and fantasy magazine. In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF--and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales.  This month, we have original science fiction by Scott Dalrymple ("Marcel Proust, Incorporated") and Matthew Kressel ("Love Engine Optimization"), along with SF reprints by Vandana Singh ("Yakshantariksh") and Elizabeth Bear ("The Heart's Filthy Lesson"). Plus, we have original fantasy by Shweta Narayan ("World of the Three") and Pat Murphy ("Crossing the Threshold"), and fantasy reprints by Carlos Hernandez ("The Magical Properties of Unicorn Ivory") and Ben Hoffman ("Substitutes"). All that, and we also have our usual assortment of author spotlights, along with our book and media review columns. Our cover art is by Randy Gallegos, illustrating Shweta Narayan's "World of the Three." For our ebook readers, we also have an ebook-exclusive reprint of Yoon Ha Lee's "Iseul's Lexicon" and an excerpt from the latest novel by Seanan McGuire, DOWN AMONG THE STICKS AND BONES, as well as a bonus excerpt from NEVER NOW ALWAYS by Desirina Boskovich.
