Storm in the night. Thunder like mountains blowing up.Lightning licking the navy-blue sky.Rain streaming down the windows,babbling in the downspouts.And Grandfather? . . .And Thomas? . . .And Ringo, the cat?They were in the dark.Too early to go to bed, and with only flashes of lightning to see by, Thomas and his grandfather happily find themselves re-discovering the half-forgotten scents and sounds of their world, and having a wonderful time learning important, new things about each other in a spirited conversation sparked by darkness.Mary Stolz and Pat Cummings have each brought their unique talents to this lyrical tale about a magical, stormy night and a special relationship.
