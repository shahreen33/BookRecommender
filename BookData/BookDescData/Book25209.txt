Shi-Hyun is the girl who brings nothing but bad luck--at least that's what everyone believes. In some ways, Shi-Hyun herself is convinced of this and tries to stay away from the people she loves the most.

But when she transfers to a new high school, a new start brings new characters--and new challenges--into her life.
