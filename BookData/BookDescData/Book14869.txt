Within the splendour of the Time Shield, six hours is equivalent to a minute on earth; but beware, in the midst of its beauty hides a terrible spell-would you dare to enter? Inquisitive seventeen-year-old Sarah Brown had resigned herself to a quiet summer with her aunt in their town Cherryfield - then she meets Mark Louis. Mark Louis de la Mer is an eighteen-year-old fairy-human hybrid, who, in 1908, was hidden in a Time Shield by his supernatural mother following the murder of his father. Due to the unforeseen presence of a Holding Spell within the shield, Mark has since been trapped. He cannot directly access the spell which is hidden within a maze of terror, but Sarah can ... that is, if she consents to. For Sarah to destroy the spell, she will not only need to undergo intense physical training, but also must face her innermost fears. Destroying the Holding Spell is just one part of the trial that awaits them both. His father's evil killers have been on the lookout for him, and Mark's release would bring the supernatural into Cherryfield; parasite imps, fiendish monsters, and last but not the least, his mother's brother Noel - a formidable fairy-sorcerer hybrid. Ancient magic, superheroines, the realms to Faie, Victorian princes, murder and love ... Welcome to The Time Shield Series.*This Book is written in British/Oxford English.
