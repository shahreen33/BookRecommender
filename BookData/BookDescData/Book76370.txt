The Dark Dynasty trilogy continues – step into the dark, scandalous world of America’s elite and discover their sinful secrets, twisted lies, and dirty desires...  I’m his captive. His toy. Sold into his possession to pay for my wicked deeds. I tell myself I hate him, but every time he steps into my cage, my body betrays me. I fear him and want him at the same time. I don’t even recognize myself anymore, and I can’t tell what’s real. Can’t tell where the lies end and the truth begins. All I know for sure is that I’m trapped with him. I don’t want to show weakness. I don’t want to surrender to the darkness. I want to make it out of his clutches and expose him to the world. But something is becoming clearer to me with every day that passes… He’ll never be done with me.  Note: This novel contains disturbing content that may be offensive to some readers.
