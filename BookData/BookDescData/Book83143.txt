Bucky Katt is a snaggle-toothed Siamese who can't stand monkeys, the media, or civilized behavior. Satchel Pooch, an unlikely mix of Shar-pei and Labrador retriever, wears a watch (which he can't read), laughs at jokes he doesn't understand, and eats food off the floor with joyful abandon. Together they are at the chaotic, hilarious center of "Get Fuzzy" by Darby Conley, the world's hottest comic strip. Appearing in more than 400 newspapers around the world and in a best-selling series of books-more than 400,000 copies sold to date-"Get Fuzzy" again brings its distinctively offbeat sensibility to a calendar line that is certain to appeal to readers everywhere, of any species. Let the mayhem begin. More than 350,000 copies of the two previous day-to-day calendars have been sold. The 2005 edition is sure to build on that success by continuing the winning format of a putting a "Get Fuzzy" daily strip on every page.
