A little vampire bat takes stock of all the creepies in the castle and decides he's scarier than all of them! But the creepies? They're not convinced. When they play a trick to prove their point, the oh-so-boastful bat's response is as unexpected as it is exuberant. It turns out the creepies may have created a monster- an absolutely adorable one. Award winner Kevin Sherry delivers a toddler-friendly, not-so-scary Halloween read-aloud with simple text, bold and delightful art, and a lovable little bat with an uncrushable spirit.
