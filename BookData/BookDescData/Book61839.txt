Crystal Cove Reminds You Of Love. Theo Valentine doesn't want to remember; not the cute little town, his forgone friends or the girl he's done everything to forget. A lovely flower when he knew her a decade before, she's bloomed into a stunning woman. A mother, a fighter and the sexiest thing he's ever seen. A decade apart, and all the trying hasn't done much to erase his feelings for her. Now, she's the only thing that makes him want to remember. Daisy Kirkpatrick might be tough-but she doesn't want to be. Once the town sweetheart, her fairytale life fell apart piece by piece. Left with nothing but her precious twins and lots of bad memories, romance is the last thing she's thinking about. Enter Theo-her secret high school crush-in town just long enough to make Daisy wonder if her fairytale is still coming true.
