Luca St. Kelly was a perfectly timed distraction. A temptation that quickly morphed into addiction. He’s closed off, and volatile. A self-proclaimed jerk... yet, I can’t seem to get enough. Hey... heartbreak... ‘sup old friend.....Francesca Walker is certifiable. That’s one thing I’m sure of. That, and certain parts of my body really seem to like her.Yeah... I know that too.She strutted into my life, a complication I didn’t need but definitely wanted. I convinced myself I could handle her, problem is that measly organ beating in my chest, yeah, I didn’t quite factor him into the equation. Hey... heartbreak... f*ck you!!
