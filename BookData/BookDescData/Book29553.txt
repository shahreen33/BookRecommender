A five-course meal of laughs!The surest way to a cat's heart is through his stomach. Garfield knows this tasty fact from experience! After all, the only thing bigger than Garfield's heart (and his latest hearty slab of lasagna) is his darling "little" tummy. But when he's not eating between meals, America's favorite feline is dishing out ample helpings of humor. So whether he's triple-lutzing his way to supper or tap dancing with Odie by the light of the moon, Garfield was born to make us laugh well past dessert!
