Join Muffy, the curious and happy-go-lucky Goldendoodle puppy and her fun-loving family, the Gabriels as they adopt a new pack member. Winter, the big white dog, is lost in the mountains of Tennessee and must be rescued by Captain Ross in Edna, the plucky little airplane. Muffy has a run-in with Mama Porkee, the porcupine, and meets Shi-mi, the Medicine Cat who spends her time helping all the animals at the vet. Winter flies in a helicopter, and meets the good people of Rolling Acres Sheep Farm where Chewey the Great Pyrenees teaches him how to guard the sheep. Hang out once more with this endearing and orderly pack; check in with Oliver, the heroic little Papillion, and Radar the retriever, and Jazz who is “blue”. Muffy and the Medicine Cat is a wonderful doggie adventure for kids aged seven through twelve, with colorful illustrations. And in the end……well, you’ll have to read it to find out, now won’t you?
