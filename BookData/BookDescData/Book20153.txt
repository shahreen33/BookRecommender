Andi was doing just fine on her own. Sure the world had been hit with an outbreak that turned anyone infected into flesh eating zombies. Not to mention that everyone she ever loved was now dead. She was alive though, taking care of herself. She had little desire to indulge in building relationships with anyone. People just couldn't be trusted. Whether they screwed you over intentionally, or just managed to get themselves killed, no one stuck around for very long. She didn't need anyone else either. That was until Will showed up to save her. Will, with his sparkling green eyes, lips you just wanted to taste, and insanely adorable crooked smile, wasn't letting Andi get rid of him so easily. Yet still, Andi did everything she could to push her feelings, and Will, away. The more time they spent together though, the more difficult that became. In a world where another day was not something you could count on, wasting even a single moment, could mean missing out on your only chance for happiness.
