In life, you always learn one important lesson you won’t ever forget.For me, it was to never have hopes and dreams.They could shatter into a million pieces in a matter of seconds.I’d managed to live by that one rule almost my entire life, until the day Harper and her little boy moved in next door.One look into her guarded eyes and a flame of hope was lit.Little did I know, her green eyes held more pain than my heart did. And breaking through the fortified walls she’d erected around hers would cause me more agony than I’d ever imagined possible.I didn’t know if two broken and bruised individuals could come together and create something beautiful out of nothing but shattered pieces.But I needed to find out.
