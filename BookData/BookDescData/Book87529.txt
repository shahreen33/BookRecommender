B.R.A.G. Medallion Winner 2015When four alien visitors arrive on Earth and disappear into the cornfields of Indiana, it is Stewart Faulkner’s job to find them. Who they are, where they’re headed, and what’s important enough to make them jump from a moving spaceship are all questions that Stewart must uncover. And he will have to do it all while 1) training a new team member named Mindy—who is developing a crush on him; 2) flying under the radar of his boss to make sure he’s not removed from the case; and 3) staying one step ahead of a government agent named Karl Bruner, who is determined to expose the presence of aliens on Earth.
