Drawing, my online clan, and planning my escape from my mother--these are priorities. Or, at least they were, until three huge alien males came to abduct me and take me to their planet. But it's not just a simple process of probing and then releasing me back to Earth. All those movies are lies. These three males keep me. And I'm suddenly a cadet at an Omega Academy where I'm supposed to learn how to serve the Gretar Fleet. None of this makes any sense to begin with, nevermind the three males I can't seem to avoid. But they say we have a connection, that we're a circle, whatever that means. And my body seems to agree, because anytime they're near, I can't seem to think of anything except Kyte's horns, Jeren's smirk, and Ceredes's long, hard ... sword. Focusing on class is almost impossible, and the Omega Academy isn't for the faint of heart. I have to learn who my enemies are, how to make friends, and how I fit with the three males I can't stop thinking about. All doable, right? No. Not right, especially when I discover the fleet has other plans for me. The bond with my three males may be the only thing that can keep me safe, but that means we need to consummate our circle. Yeah, you read that right, consummate. Deep. Breaths.Lily's Note: Omega Academy is a full-length novel and the first book of the Omega Academy trilogy.
