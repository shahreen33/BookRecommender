"In a sequel worthy of The Mouse and the Motorcycle and Runaway Ralph, the dauntless mouse Ralph goes to school....Cleary captures the essence of classroom bickering and the warm relationship between a good teacher and her students....The story is a deft blend of realism and fantasy, quietly and consistently funny, and occasionally touching...Again, bravo."--Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books.
