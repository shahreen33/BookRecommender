Carrie Hansen spent her life caring for cardiac patients. Little did she know she would become a patient herself. After recovering from her own heart surgery, she learns she has a special talent: the ability to see and talk with the dead. Now, with her new heart failing her, she leaves the bustle of Seattle behind and returns to Lexington, Missouri, the small town where she spent her childhood. Here, she sets out to restore an abandoned antebellum mansion and open it as a venue for celebrations. Carrie’s work is cut out for her. The 150-year-old Greek revival house is in need of serious repair. Her sister, Melanie, tries to bully Carrie into returning to Seattle, predicting “her little project” is doomed to fail. Finally, Carrie’s health gives out on her, requiring emergency surgery. But she will not give up. Carrie’s unique gift allows her to build relationships with the mansion’s ghostly occupants, especially Maj. Tom Gentry, the handsome Civil War soldier who died 100 years before Carrie was born. Will Carrie finish restoring the celebration house or will it finish her? And how can she plan a future with a man who has only a past?
