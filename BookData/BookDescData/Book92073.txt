A beautiful collection of the "metamorphic" art of one one of Mexico's most prolific artists Octavio Ocampo works primarily in the metamorphic style, using a technique of superimposing and juxtaposing realistic and figurative details within the images that he creates. Ocampo is known for his sometimes wryly sardonic, sometimes evocative paintings in which detailed images are intricately woven together to create larger images—the optical illusions fading back and stepping forward as the viewer studies the pieces, notices the details, and finally recognizes the large-scale intention.
