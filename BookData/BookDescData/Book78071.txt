With talking foxes and golden owls, with paths that lead into the land the dead and others into faerie, with battles raging down Fifth Avenue and impossible labyrinths hidden in the depths of New York City, Throne is as much a tale of wonder and dread as it is of the trials of the heart. Maribel thought she had it all: a professional career in modeling, a burgeoning one in photography, and a world famous diplomat for a husband. Yet it all turns to ashes when her newborn baby is stolen away by an impossible being nobody else can see. Against all reason and advice she pursues it, though the path leads her perilously close to the realms of madness.Maya thought she had nothing left to lose: an illegal immigrant and an orphan, she was trapped in a life of slavery working in the sweat shops of New York City. Then a beguiling stranger kisses her and gifts her with magic, giving her access to a hidden world she had never imagined lurked beneath the grim facade of the City.For the Fae govern the crossroads of our lives, and Maya and Maribelâ€™s crises attract their attention. Both Seelie and Unseelie Courts seek a human to assume the mantle of Queen, to fulfill a potential that will draw their forces from across the skeins of time to New York, and there continue their ages old battle for dominance. Each woman will have to make a choice--how far are they willing to pursue their desires before they risk losing themselves to something beyond their comprehension?
