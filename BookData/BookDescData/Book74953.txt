Retired US Navy SEAL Commander Gabriel Michaels has finally found peace after decades of active duty and two failed marriages. No tangoes, no red tape, no women — just his rifle, his fishing pole, and his loyal coon hound on a pristine piece of lakefront heaven. But when the Assistant Director of Homeland Security asks for his help, he can’t say no. Not only is it a case of national security, it’s finally a chance for Gabe to avenge his fallen teammates.  As for the irritating woman who slips his dog cookies and is so willing to help? She’s a great source of inside information… and unexpected temptation. But can she be trusted?  Virginia Miller is used to working quietly from the shadows as a personal assistant to a powerful, wealthy businessman. That all changes when her boss suddenly goes missing and she’s thrust into a world of deception and international terrorism. To further complicate things, the compelling former SEAL with incredible green eyes thinks she’s the key to unravelling the mystery.  The most ironic thing of all is… he’s right. And he could ruin everything.  SEAL Out of Water is a stand-alone military romantic suspense with slow-burn romance and plenty of twists and turns to a happy ending you’ll never see coming.
