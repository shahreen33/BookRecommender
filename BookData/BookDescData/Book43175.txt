While it is commonly believed that Wicca is a preserve for women, the word wicca is from the Old English and means "male witch". Wicca for Men seeks to propel the pendulum that has swung toward the feminine back to the middle, resulting in neither female nor male dominance in this religion, but in equality.Wicca for Men calls for a return to the basics of Wiccan belief. Wicca is a positive, affirming, and truly spiritual religion, one that helps its members to grow in harmony with the Earth and with each other.Wicca for Men offers an understanding of the god and goddess; ritual tools and their use; the significance of ritual and preparation of the temple; sabbats and the wheel of the year (along with appropriate practices to enhance the celebrations); sample spells; sources and resources; and much more.
