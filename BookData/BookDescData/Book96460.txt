Matt Barns is on a mission. The goal of this mission? Find a mate before his broken bear drives him into madness. He knows exactly what he’s looking for, but when his bear finally settles for a mate, she dumps his world upside down. She’s funny, sure, but other than that, she’s not his type in any way. Or so he thought, because Willa is breaking down his walls and opening his eyes to a new life he thought he might never find.  Willamena Madden: smart-mouthed, fun-loving, loyal-to-a-fault, proud nerd and fragile human. She’s also somehow become the potential mate to a grizzly shifter. A shifter? She feels sorry for the critters and wishes humans would leave them alone, but Matt is proving he doesn’t need her pity. He’s a sexy, scarred up, growly beast-man, and she’s thinking he could be the one to finally take her V-card. But Matt’s hot and cold, and one of her friends is after a bucket-list werebear diddle with the man Willa’s falling for. And if that isn’t stressful enough, Matt’s Gray Back Crew is a loosely knit community of maniacs.  Matt feels important, but Willa has never been in more danger. If she can’t find a way to survive his people, she’ll have to go back to her safe life without her Gray Back Bad Bear.  **Brand new series from T.S. Joyce. Can be read as a standalone series.
