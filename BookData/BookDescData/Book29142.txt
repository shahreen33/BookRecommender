Presenting an all-new horror anthology that shatters the mold...Mainstream publishers want all-star lineups. Small press publishers often can't afford to pay pro rates...and even when they can, the names in the table of contents can be limited by the editor's reach or effort. Bestselling horror, fantasy, and thriller authors Christopher Golden and James A. Moore knew there had to be a better way. Inspired by the efforts of legendary anthology Charles L. Grant, who helped move so many new writers in the horror community's conversation, Golden and Moore teamed up with Haverhill House's Twisted Publishing imprint to create...THE TWISTED BOOK OF SHADOWSDetermined to pay pro rates, the editors crowdfunded the project, and then put the word out as far and wide as possible, loudly and repeatedly encouraging submissions by diverse voices, and recruiting a stellar editorial committee to read along with them, including Linda A. Addison, Nadia Bulkin, Rachel Autumn Deering, Lamar Giles, KL Pereira, and Lee Thomas.Out of seven hundred stories received through a blind submission process-none of the editors had any idea who the authors were-nineteen made the final cut. Within these pages you will find the beautifully weird side-by-side with terrifying nightmares, horrifying folklore, and hellish futures. Nineteen unique and haunting tales that truly earned their place in a book entitled...THE TWISTED BOOK OF SHADOWSDiscover your new favorite horror stories by: Melissa Swensen -- M.M.
