They say going home is easy, and in all reality, it should be. Just not for me.  The small, one-horse town that gave me my roots, that made my soul thrive, is also the place I never wanted to set foot in again. I left everything behind and never looked back. Until now. With the death of the man who raised me, I’m forced to return to Boone.  Old wounds resurface, and heartache and loss trump everything once more.  Seeing the man who shattered my world the night of our high school graduation almost brings me to my knees. Jessie, my once best friend and love of my life, ruined it all for me…for us.  I’m back in Boone…and my secret is about to rattle the tiny town.
