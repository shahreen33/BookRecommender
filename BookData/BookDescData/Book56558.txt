She calls it a devil’s bargain. I call it a deal she can’t refuse.I was owed a debt and I expected payment. That payment? One night in my bed. My rules. The debt cleared, and she could walk away. There are worse things. And besides, debtors can’t be choosers.The night started as it should. She obeyed as she should. But then something happened. Something I was wholly unprepared for. And what I saw changed everything. I broke my own rules after that. And I didn’t keep my end of the bargain. Because walking away was no longer an option I would grant her, no matter the cost.
