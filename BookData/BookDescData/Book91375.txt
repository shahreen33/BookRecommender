Got a demon that needs killing? I’m your girl. On paper, I’m a Blood Sorceress. I can whip up the spells of your dreams. It’s a legal occupation--barely--but mostly a cover. My real job is protecting my city from the monsters of the Dark Realms. I’m the resident demon slayer, and occasionally those suckers escape. Then it’s up to me. I’ve even got a side hustle using their blood for my sorcery biz. It’s gruesome, but that’s life. Things get complicated when I start clashing with a sexy AF bounty hunter. His name's Declan, and we're after the same necromancer. Bounty hunters are my enemy, and his stupidly hot body keeps getting in my way.The only way to save the city is to team up with Declan. I have two goals: don’t kill him &amp; don’t screw him. Both easier said than done, since self control isn’t really my thing. But it’s a race against time to catch the demon, and there’s no way in hell I’ll fail at that.Demon Slayer is a fast-paced urban fantasy adventure starring a kick butt heroine, a powerful hero, and magic that will blow your socks off.
