COMING SOON TO PRINT!***I thought I’d hit rock bottom when my dad died.I was wrong.I never dreamed my mom would choose drugs and alcohol over me.I was wrong about that too.I thought teachers were there to instruct, to guide, to counsel.Wrong doesn’t begin to describe what nearly happened that last day of my Junior year. Lesson learned; trust is for suckers and actions speak louder than words.New plan. Keep up my grades, earn a scholarship, tuck into as tight a ball as possible and roll on out of this town and this life. But this boy, this Casanova transplant with a funny accent, who’s way too charming to be healthy for a girl... Why won’t he let me be?I wish I hadn’t let him in on my secrets...well, most of them.I wish I hadn’t grown to look forward to our daily walks to work.But mostly, I wish I hadn’t freaked out when he tried to steal a kiss.Maybe I wouldn’t be parked in the friend zone. Maybe he wouldn’t be dating a girl I loathe. Maybe I wouldn’t be in this hell of wanting what I can’t have but having what I thought I wanted—to be left alone.
