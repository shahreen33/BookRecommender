John has been to his daughter's best friend Lily everything a godchild could ask for: a protector, a friend, a better father as her own could ever be. His godchild and his daughter have been friends since they were born.The alleged car accident four years ago that put Beth's mother in a week-long coma, did not only kill Lily's mother's and Will's wife's life, but took from John his best friend, and first love. Now, when he looks at Lily, he forces himself to see his godchild, Will's daughter, Beth's best friend and not his second chance for true love and true fulfillment. Because it was Lily's mother, Sarah, who really understood every part of him including his DARKEST LONGING.**Warning: This book is recommended for readers over the age of 18 due to explicit sexual content such as light BdSM, and topics some might consider as too taboo due to age-difference and relationship between the main protagonists.**
