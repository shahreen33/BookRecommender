In a world not unlike our own, Jerna Setiq has a perfect life, a beloved wife and two adored children, with his past desires and needs firmly put behind him. But when he's falsely accused of child abuse and imprisoned, he's cast into hell, with no apparent means of redemption, or regaining all that he's lost.In the most unlikely of places, in the most unpromising of circumstances, fate offers Jerna his second chance and a path to freedom. With the cruelly fascinating Tolomi, a dominant in need of education and a patient submissive, Jerna dares to satisfy the long denied passions of his dual nature - but will he risk losing what has become so dear to him, all over again? "Remastering Jerna" is a complex, erotic story of redemption, love, and the contract of trust in a relationship of control and submission.Words: 114,879 (approximate)
