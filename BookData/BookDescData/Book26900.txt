Eight-year-old Naima dreams of being on the stage. She loves singing and dancing, and has been performing in local talent shows with her big sister, Mina, since she was five. But recently Mina has been too busy to spend time practising their routines - she's always chatting on the phone with her friends and giggling about boys. Naima doesn't know if she can perform without her . . .When the family decides to get a puppy, Naima quickly throws herself into being the best owner a pet could wish for. Suzy, the adorable springer spaniel pup, loves the limelight just as much as Naima - and when Mum spots an advert for an animal talent show, it looks like Naima has found the perfect partner to join her on the stage!
