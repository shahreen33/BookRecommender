Take one pregnant omega who’s all alone in the world…  After accidentally getting pregnant by his best friend and occasional hookup buddy, Owen Grant finds himself on his own… again. After being abandoned at birth and growing up in the foster system, he’s used to having to say goodbye. If he's learned one lesson in life, it's this: people don't stay.  Add in one alpha who just won’t leave…  Austin Logan is a quirky alpha who’s accepted that he’ll never marry and have a family of his own. His focus is on being the favorite uncle to all of his brothers' kids. He’s happy with the well-maintained and structured routine of his life, and doesn’t need anything more.  Mix in one fake marriage of convenience…  Meeting Owen shakes things up in Austin’s world. He has to beg and barter with the guy to convince him to accept his help, even going so far as to sign a prenup that absolves Owen of any rights to Austin’s wealth, just to get him to agree to a fake marriage that will provide him with the medical insurance he so desperately needs for himself and his unborn child.  And remember not to fall in love with your fake groom!  What happens when your fake husband turns out to be an awesome dad to your child and doesn’t seem in any hurry to let you go? And what if you slowly find yourself falling for the stranger you married? You sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.   This is the final book in the Lone Star Brothers series.
