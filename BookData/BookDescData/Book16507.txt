Marjorie Fordham is just itching to sign up the hottest author in the world into her quaint little publishing house. Well, sheâ€™s also itching for other things, to be honest. So what if she finds the author attractive? And so what if he makes an offer she cannot refuse? So what if she accepts? And so what if David J. Seton is everything she has ever wanted in a man? He is a Dominant male with some ulterior motives up his sleeve, something that both terrifies and excites our feisty, independent, love-is-for-needy-chicks-and-not-for-me heroine. She has entered a world of Domination and submission, one she cannot free herself from, no matter how hard she tries to fight it.
