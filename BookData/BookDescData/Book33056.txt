Cyclops and Wolverine struggle to deal with the growing threats facing mutants while still keeping X-Force's existence a secret from the X-Men. Warpath is out for vengeance, Wolfsbane is missing, and X-23 keeps cutting off pieces of Vanisher. But worst of all? One mutant's deadly actions will put mutantkind squarely back in the crosshairs of humanity. Things were bad before, but they're about to get a hell of lot worse...Collecting: X-Force 12-13, 17-20
