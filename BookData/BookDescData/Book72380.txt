It's said the artist is born of a damaged soul…Wilhelmina Allende is a prima ballerina. When tragedy turns her beloved Paris into a gilded cage, she jumps at the chance to work with one of the most prolific choreographers she’s ever seen. But Zack’s style is way out of her comfort zone. So is his teaching method. And his humor. And his everything. He’s a charming little connard. It’s hard not to like him. Merde. What has she gotten herself into?Zachary Coen’s first musical is opening on Broadway. Much like his life, it’s anything but conventional, so hiring Mina is simply out of the question. She’s too…classical. Too perfect. She’s all wrong for the role. Then he meets her in person and sees her cracks. Her broken pieces. How unique and beautiful each one is. And he can’t help but notice how her edges seem to fit his…perfectly.Just when teaming up seems to be working, the monsters they’ve kept hidden threaten to rip it all apart.**Content warning: The hero is a child molestation survivor and hyper focuses on what he eats as a coping mechanism. He is triggered in a scene toward the end. (While it does not get explicit, it may be triggering to some readers.)** **2018 Wishing Shelf Independent Book Awards GOLD MEDAL WINNER**
