“Bend over and lift your skirt. I’m going to show you what it’s like to spend Christmas on the naughty list…”Let’s get one thing straight—I’m not your usual bad boy billionaire. I’m actually a nice guy. A very nice guy who also enjoys turning a woman over my knee and spanking her ass until she begs for mercy—AKA a good, hard, hold-her-down-and-teach-her-who’s-boss f*ck.I’m a gentleman in the boardroom and a Dominant in the bedroom. I’ve also been secretly in love with my sweet, sexy, too-innocent-for-her-own-good executive assistant, Jane, for the better part of two years. But like I said, I’m a gentleman. Any woman on my staff is strictly off limits.Until the night I’m snowed in at the office with Jane…The same night I discover she’s a submissive looking for a teacher…The night I decide to make her mine…“Are you ready to be possessed? If so, get on your knees, beautiful. The game is about to begin. Tonight, you’re mine.”WARNING: This red hot holiday read contains spanking, dirty talk, and a Dominant alpha male who will melt your panties off—he doesn’t care how cold it is outside. Hotness level—five hot toddies, four roaring fires, three turtleneck sweaters, two chestnuts roasting, and a spanking with a switch from that old pear tree.
