The sun is Briar Hale’s enemy.   All her life she’s been in the shadows, sheltered and protected, warned and smothered.  Not anymore.   Briar is ready to take control of her life, and step out into the sunlight for the first time. A newly enrolled graduate student at Boston College, she’s determined to discover why her body betrays her.  And she knows just the scientist to help her.   Professor Hudson Nors has secrets of his own—secrets he’s kept for eternity, and which he never wants to see the light of day. No matter how wonderful Briar smells, and how important she feels, Hudson decides the best thing he can do for her is stay away.  Suddenly, Briar, with her strange condition and boundless curiosity, turns the world Hudson’s spent centuries perfecting, upside down.   But this pale, fragile girl has a spine of steel, and if Hudson won’t help her, she’ll find someone who will.   By a luck, or fate, Briar meets Hudson’s brothers, Marcus, Valen, and Sylvain. Like Hudson, they can sense this human girl means something important to all of them. But what could four, vampire brothers possibly have to offer a human?   Unwittingly, Briar brings together these immortal brothers, and teaches them, eternity is too short to give up on hope.   ***Briar is the first book in the Midnight's Crown series. A slow-burn reverse harem romance***
