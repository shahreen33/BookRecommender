As soon as it appeared, Richard Ford's Handbook to Spain was hailed as a major work of literature. How far Ford had burst out of the guidebook genre was amply proved the next year when Murray's produced a compendium of the material they had forced Ford to discard from the Handbook. Characteristically, Ford also added much that was new, all of it treated with energy, diamond wit, and irresistible charm. This new edition of Gatherings from Spain is illustrated with drawings by Ford himself and his friends, and enriched by a fully annotated index.
