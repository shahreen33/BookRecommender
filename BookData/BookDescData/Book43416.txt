All new adventures from everyone's favourite Aussie larrikin.Nick's debut book Tales of The Honey Badger was the runaway humour and sport bestseller of 2015 and he's back in 2016 with a bumper book of yarns and tall stories. Packed with Nick's sensational sayings, ripper yarns and pure Aussie wisdom, this new book is a charming collection of stories celebrating the importance of family, mates, rugby, getting out amongst it (i.e. seeing the world) and pen-portraits of 'buggers I've run into'. Nick's fantastically hilarious stories include: a spot of helicopter fishing in the Kimberley and Northern Territory with the old man; lending a coaching hand to the Norwegian Rugby team; passing on some Rugby insights to the Thai netball team; and rambling tales of life in the Cummins clan. You won't want to miss it. Hold onto your hat, it's going to be a bonza year.
