A mother’s secrets threaten a daughter’s future…  Bethany Waterbury left Hollywood and the shadow of her mother's death to give herself a fresh start. Her main intention—to connect with the family she’d never really had the chance to know.  Author Kent Black is enjoying his chart topping success and living freely wherever his travels take him. But when he meets the illustrious Bethany Waterbury his wanderlust subsides and the thought of a steady future begins to take over.  Kent believes in happily ever after, but the burden of Bethany’s past might be too much for him to embrace—unless true love is more powerful than a Hollywood tragedy.
