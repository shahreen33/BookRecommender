Where are you going? Where have you been? What are you doing about it NOW? As you think through these questions, I encourage you to make your move and reclaim the life you’ve always dreamed about. It’s yours if you really want it. You need a burning desire and a foundation of core values. Values like confidence, faith, courage and hard work are key to living life on your terms. Know this my friend—it’s not only about the end goal. It’s the journey you take to get there. The Value of You is a journey into the core values that define our human experience. Each chapter has a story to tell, as well as the core features of the value, obstacles to living the value and a personal game plan to make the value your own. Start your journey today! Amy Schumer calls it, “the book of a generation.”
