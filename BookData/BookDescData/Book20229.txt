Based on the beloved song of the same name, this colorfully illustrated version of Frosty the Snow Man, told by Annie North Bedford, is a sure delight for all ages. Who can resist the tale of children enjoying the fun of building Frosty, when suddenly to their astonishment, he comes alive! The children in the neighborhood have never had a better winter of sledding, ice skating, and building snow houses, until one day, a warm wind blows. What will happen to Frosty? 8 1/2" X 11 3/4".
