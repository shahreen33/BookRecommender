This is a highly readable volume of Short Stories, set in modern Australia. Most tales are romantic.The book kicks off with 'The Girl Next Door', an engaging tale of a young man's affection for his neighbour, which sadly goes amiss just as he summons the courage to ask her out. Other favourites include 'A Song for Ellie': a young man's struggle to be noticed by a singer; and 'The Blossoming': a young woman emerging into life and love.Like all Margaret Lynette Sharp's books, this is edited by her husband Ronald Sharp B.E.M., the creator of the Grand Organ in the Sydney Opera House concert hall.
