A #1 New York Times bestseller “This little mouse may well inspire some big dreams.” —Kirkus Reviews “In this picture book based on the space shuttle Endeavor…Meteor is one of the smallest mice, but the most hardworking…the values of being small, useful, solving problems, and working hard—as opposed to being big and strong—will inspire young readers.” —School Library Journal  “Inspired by this real-life mouse, Kelly’s first children’s book tells the story of Meteor, a lightly anthropomorphized rodent who turns his tininess into an advantage when an important key gets stuck in a crack between two monitors…textured images and vivid portraits that make it absolutely clear that space travel is a larger-than-life adventure.” —Publishers Weekly A heartwarming picture book tale of the power of the small, from bestselling author and retired NASA astronaut Commander Mark Kelly.Astronaut Mark Kelly flew with “mice-tronauts” on his first spaceflight aboard space shuttle Endeavour in 2001. Mousetronaut tells the story of a small mouse that wants nothing more than to travel to outer space. The little mouse works as hard as the bigger mice to show readiness for the mission . . . and is chosen for the flight! While in space, the astronauts are busy with their mission when disaster strikes—and only the smallest member of the crew can save the day. With lively illustrations by award-winning artist C. F. Payne, Mousetronaut is a charming tale of perseverance, courage, and the importance of the small!
