 She has nowhere left to turn… A twisty, compelling, thought-provoking new crime thriller from a major new talent.
  ‘Outstanding, gritty and hard-hitting, yet woven with humour’ Jo Jakeman, author of Sticks and Stones
A body without a name…One night, the body of a young woman is found, naked but for a necklace, tied to a statue outside a block of luxury flats. There should be an outcry. But the police rule it a suicide, and move on. A case where nothing is as it seems…Private investigators Lee and Jo, owners of No Stone Unturned detective agency in Leeds, are tasked with looking into the case. Who was the woman? Did she really kill herself? A world where danger lurks around every corner…As they investigate, Lee and Jo uncover shocking secrets. And when they see links between this case and another they are working on, they are forced to question – is any woman ever truly safe in this world? And are they risking their own lives by delving too deep?
