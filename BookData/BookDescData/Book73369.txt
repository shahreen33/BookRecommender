Governments, hospitals, and industry use computerized industrial control systems to remotely monitor and control elevators, electricity, alarms, surveillance systems, and more. It's convenient and efficient. And potentially deadly.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Aroostine Higgins put her personal life on hold to join the Department of Justice's elite Criminal Division. Now she’s prosecuting two men accused of attempting to bribe a foreign government official.  But everything's going wrong.  Her pretrial motion vanishes from the federal court's electronic docketing system. Her apartment catches fire. Routine dental surgery turns into a near-death experience.  When Aroostine's past comes crashing into her present, her most critical vulnerability is exploited and she finally admits she isn't simply suffering a string of bad luck.  An unseen enemy is determined to destroy her—and the only man she's ever loved—unless she finds him first.  Critical Vulnerability is the latest whip-smart legal thriller by USA TODAY Bestselling Author Melissa F. Miller.
