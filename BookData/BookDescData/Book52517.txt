The men and women of Reed Security are back, but after all the turmoil of the past year, how do they adapt and move forward? For some, it's easy, but others, the past year is only the beginning of what they will have to deal with. Some of them were shot and almost died. Morgan and Chance were taken and tortured in their own respects and now must deal with the after effects. Payton was torn from her mother and spent a year and a half without her. The wives lost their jobs, and many had to run from their families and friends to keep them safe. But one thing remained the same through all of this, they are each others' family and will do anything to help each other through. They are Reed Security, and they will rise from the ashes.
