Morton, the golden retriever is back just in time to turn Dev's dating experience with gorgeous AJ into an absolute disaster. Meanwhile his longtime "friend with benefits" Heidi is being showered with jewels and romantic getaways. Dev is investigating Austin Hackett, a scheming attorney who has run scams on everything from porn to disability lawsuits. He can set everything right if only Swindle Lawless and Woofy Barker can keep their act together. Assaults, shootings, scams, broken hearts and murder combine for more humorous entertainment from the master of the bizarre, Mike Faricy.
