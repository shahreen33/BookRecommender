  Alexis Ravenel: Peasant. Princess. Pawn. 
 As a peasant, I was forced to work the jewel mines in order to survive. My life was hard, but my worries were few: affording food to eat, and keeping my pet sloth out of harm’s way. But when a chance encounter with a stranger concludes with me obtaining the power of the gods, suddenly my whole world changes. When the Storm King finds out—and trust me, he always finds out—he plans to make me a princess by marrying me off to one of his four sons. Which doesn’t really seem like too bad of a thing...at first. After all, the Storm Princes are sexy as sin, rich, confident, and built like the very gods themselves. But nothing is as simple as it seems, and the luxurious life of the Blackwood royals is nothing but a nightmare I cannot wake up from... and neither can the princes. They grew up knowing and resenting this fact, but I had to find out the hard way... 
  In the Kingdom of Blackwood, we are all just pawns in the Storm King’s wicked game.
