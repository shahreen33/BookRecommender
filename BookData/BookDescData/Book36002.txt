(Unedited manuscript for feedback and critiques)Eighteen-year-old biracial Haze O’Hagan is a virgin, and everyone in 2050 Dublin seems to be doing “it”, except for him. During a Halloween party, Haze meets Aoife, a girl with the strength of ten men and impenetrable skin. Determined to break away from his family’s Latter-Day Saint views on abstinence, Haze agrees to go home with Aoife. Their night comes to a halt upon discovering Aoife’s father, Patrick Lynch at home. Haze realises Aoife’s dad is the world-famous creator of God-Tech, nanobot making tech akin to magic. Upon greeting Lynch, Haze falls unconscious and see’s in vision, a demon named Legion.After waking, Haze discovers his own demonic powers and the ability to possess minds. Haze gained a hidden curse and divine protection after witnessing his father’s murder years ago. Haze could never identify the murderer, until now—Patrick Lynch. Lynch willingly became possessed with Legion granting him immortality.Haze wants to kill Lynch but can’t because of his immortality and Lynch can’t kill Haze because of Haze’s divine protection. A tit for tat game erupts between the two: Haze tries to expose Lynch to the world. Lynch retaliates by killing people associated with Haze, filling Haze with guilt and grief. If Haze can’t prove who Lynch really is, Lynch will get away with murder, Haze will lose Aoife, his friends will continue to die, and Lynch will destroy humanity from the inside out.
