Cover artist: Lima de FreitasThis was some household. The kid was a genius, the father a scientist of international repute. Money was problem. Not shortage of money but the opposite: too much. The sort of money that brings the envious and the scheming clustering like flies round a pile of ripe offal: nieces, nephews, cousins - a family of mean minds and gross appetites. The hired help had its peculiarities too: the chauffeur, an ex-con; the governess, formerly a featured act in strip clubs from New York and Miami; a secretary with a well developed taste in other women. Quite a household. And not one to welcome the arrival of Mike Hammer - not when the kid had been kidnapped and everyone else was a suspect.
