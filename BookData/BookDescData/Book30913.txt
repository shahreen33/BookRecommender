The Pennyfoot hides many secrets and its downstairs staff keeps a tight lip, even when the Edwardian aristocrats are spotted dallying with damsels in the boudoirs, or gambling in the forbidden card rooms hidden below the floorboards. Should now and then one of the hotel guests fall prey to a dastardly murderer, however, it is up to Cecily Sinclair to restore order before Scotland Yard steps in and shuts down her infamous seaside hotel.  EAT DRINK AND BE BURIED  May Day heralds the opening of the summer season at the Pennyfoot, and the downstairs staff is busy getting the hotel ready for their aristocratic guests. Festivities to celebrate are in full swing, when one of the guests is found hanging from the Maypole with a ribbon around her neck. Cecily puts herself in danger as she hunts for the mysterious killer.  The final Pennyfoot Mystery, also a Christmas edition, Mulled Murder, was published in November 2013 by Berkley Books.
