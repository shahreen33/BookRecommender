Formerly published in the Romantic Interludes anthology. Now available for the first time as a stand-alone short story.Emily Valentine is a matchmaker who doesn’t believe in love.Well, at least not the hearts and flowers, see-your-soulmate-across-a-crowded-room-and-the-world-stands-still kind of love. No, Emily is a pragmatist – a scientist – and she’s abandoned her family’s tradition of matchmaking based on instinct and uncanny intuition for a more scientific approach to pairing people up.Emily believes love is more about compatibility and common interests than anything mystical.But a run-of-the-mill job turns her world on end when swoony cake designer Sam Cavanaugh pops up as a potential match for her newest client. The attraction she feels for him throws a wrench in her plans, but she’s not going to succumb without a fight.Emily is nothing if not practical. And reasonable. But she’s about to learn that sometimes the best things in life…are neither.
