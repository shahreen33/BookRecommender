Crocker uses popular culture to gut punch coming of age insecurities and all the ferocious sexual energy that comes with growing up. Whether in the form of a lust poem from Skeletor to He-Man, an existential lament for Snuffleupagas, or a poignant rumination on siblings, Crocker's poems are at turns funny and haunting, and always bristling with the electric murmur of their characters making a place in the world for themselves." —James Brubaker, author of Liner Notes and Pilot Season  "I've never read a book so heartbreaking, so funny, so tender, so powerful, and so real. At a certain point in this book, one loses one's bearings completely, and enters the darkness and confusion that Crocker has been hinting at. Then, Crocker takes that sensibility a step further. These poems needed to be written." —Steve Henn, author of And God Said: Let there be Evolution
