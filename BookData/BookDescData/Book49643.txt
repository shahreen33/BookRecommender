Your heart misleads you.That's what my friends and family say.  But I love Noah. And he loves me.  We met and fell in love in the sleepy farming community of Meadowview, while we rode our horses together through the grassy fields and in those moments in each other's arms. It should be  
  ROSE &amp; NOAH
 forever, easy. But it won't be. Because he's Amish. And I'm not.
