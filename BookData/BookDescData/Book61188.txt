Miss Catherine Hooks is one of the best governesses in all of England; her employer, the Right Honorable Edward Glennon, is one of the busiest men. The fact that they’ve fallen in love is immaterial. Honorable people in their situation do not mention such things. But Edward’s son is on the verge of leaving for school, and when Cat asks for the only thing she can demand under the circumstances—a reference and help finding a new position—she discovers that even a right honorable gentleman has his limits…_____A Right Honorable Gentleman will be coming as a standalone story in September of 2016. Until then, A Right Honorable Gentleman will be available in the anthology Premiere. Premiere, the first anthology of its kind produced by Romance Writers of America®, is a collection of 17 original short stories that showcases the breadth and complexity of the world’s most popular genre of fiction!
