I’m a player on and off the ice, with the reputation to back up my game. I’ve never met a woman I couldn't get between the sheets, because I’m the best D-man on campus with the biggest stick.I have two rules: don’t fall in love, and play to win. Until I meet her. Cassie Rivers, my best friend’s sister—off-limits—and out of my league. But from the moment I see her, I have to make her mine. You know what they say about forbidden fruit. One taste is never enough.
