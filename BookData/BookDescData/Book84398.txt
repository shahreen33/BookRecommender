One on the wrong side of the ocean. Lost and wandering the woods, Wynne Theaton was surviving quite nicely until Rowen Lockton appeared. He saves her from getting trampled by a thief’s horse, but then becomes insistent on showing her where she truly is…  One refusing to deny fate. Fate tossed Miss Theaton into his path, and the Duke of Letson is not one to deny fate. But the woman comes with a host of problems, not the least of which is her belief that she is in another country.  An undeniable attraction neither expected. He was not looking for a wife. She was only searching for home. But fate has very different plans for the two of them—if they can survive the secrets of the past, of the forgotten.  
  Note: The Lords of Fate and Hold Your Breath books are each stand-alone stories, and can be read individually in any order.
