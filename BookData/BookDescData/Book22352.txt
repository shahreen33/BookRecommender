Open the covers of this extraordinarily inventive, interactive book to find that the cats inside are ready to play -- in very surprising ways. There they are, purring under a blanket. But not for long! Three sprightly cats named Tiny, Moonpie, and Andre are eager to involve you in their games, whether it's tossing a ball of yarn (oof!), lifting flaps to find them in boxes (comfy), or getting caught in a pillow fight (biff!). As their antics get wilder still, they'll need a kind soul to blow on the page to dry them off! With an irresistible story that directly engages the reader, this book's clever design and bright, gestural illustrations make for cat-tastic lift-the-flap fun.
