In a future London close to a century away the city is split into two and threatening to explode into chaos. There’s anarchy on the streets of the lower city and the privileged occupants of the blocks are stagnating and oblivious to the troubles below. The “LSA” and the “Brotherhood of Light” are spreading terror campaigns across both worlds, indifferent to who get’s hurt and focused only on their own agendas, the over populated citadel is on verge of total loss of control. But the Stark Corporation has formed a desperate plan to restore order.  Kirsten Glass is an occupant of the blocks, a high tech, self contained paradise world for those affluent enough to afford it and totally separated to the toxic world beyond and outside of them. Working as a successful model and friends with the gifted set and minor celebrities, she is neither affected or concerned with the larger world threatening to swallow her whole. However that’s all about to change. Unknown wheels have been set in motion and a chance encounter is about to destroy everything she holds to be true and throw her in a political nightmare that proves to be all too real!
