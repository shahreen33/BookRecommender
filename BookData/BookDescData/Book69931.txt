He's having a really, really bad hair day...Larry Boyd just found the coolest thing in the trash. It's an old bottle of INSTA-TAN. "Rub on a dark suntan in minute" - that's what the label says. So Larry and his friends do. But nothing much happens.Until Larry notices the hair. Dark spiky hair growing on his hands and face. Really gross shiny hair.Hair that keeps growing back even after he shaves it off...
