The Final Donati Bloodlines Novel  ***  Emma Donati  Some days, it felt like Emma had just imagined it all. Like maybe everything she had been with Calisto was just a dream. Emma knew it was crazy—it was impossible to forget what she had shared with Calisto Donati. All their love, the stolen moments, their foulness together, and the beauty underneath it all were real. They were real. But he didn't know. He didn’t know any of it. And little by little, with every day that passed her by, Emma found she was losing those pieces that reminded her they had existed once. Just like the rosary. All too soon, Emma knew … there would be nothing left.  Calisto Donati  Emma hadn’t given him a choice. Her, not him. Yeah, that’s what Calisto was going to keep telling himself. He refused to feed into the strange curiosity he had about Emma Donati. It had been building from the moment he’d first seen her face after he’d awakened. He wouldn’t admit that for longer than he cared to admit, he thought there was more behind her false smile, polite words, and the distance she put between her and him—that there might be more to them. He couldn’t. Except … he was feeding into it. Calisto just wasn’t sure what it was. But tonight he was going to find out. Whether she wanted to tell him or not.
