I never expected to be locked out of my room basically naked in a total blackout. Thinking that would be the biggest shock of my night was my first mistake.  With my friends nowhere in sight, Iâ€™m thankful when Jason, the mysterious guy who flirts from across the hall, shows up and comes to my rescue.  After I borrow his clothes, I let this man be my protector when mayhem ensues.  As he takes me under his wing how could I not fall for this handsome Clark Kent lookalike?  But just like the lights suddenly going out, our night ends just as fast, leaving me more lost than when it went dark.
