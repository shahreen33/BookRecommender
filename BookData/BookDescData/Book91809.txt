Shellie Zacharia’s collection of short fiction is a melodic ensemble. Her prose-like verses are scenes accompanied by stomps of voyeuristic images, followed by a chorus of relationships. She writes in a playful tone and structure, but her motifs are serious. If you read closely, you’ll hear the music.
