The future of the local church is directly tied to its ability to attract, equip, and unleash the potential of volunteers in the church Pastor Bill Hybels sees a new reality on the horizon. There is unprecedented spiritual openness in today’s society, and at the same time, increasing economic pressure on the resources of local churches. The solution lies squarely on the able shoulders of God-gifted volunteers. And they are ready for the challenge! Once trained, empowered, and inspired, record numbers of volunteers will take on all new levels of responsibility in the local church, creating a volunteer revolution that will transform churches and communities. The Volunteer Revolution reveals how all of this can happen and how churches can unleash vast amounts of untapped potential. Through real-life volunteer stories, Hybels inspires church leaders in their role as equippers while motivating potential volunteers to align themselves with God’s mission to change the world. The Volunteer Revolution is also available as an unabridged Audio Pages® CD.
