British teen Mel Beeby is horrified to end up in posh Angel Academy-- why learn about halos when she' s always found shopping much more divine? Then she' s recruited into an elite group of time-traveling angels fighting the Opposition and finds out angel business is a lot more dangerous-- and a lot more fun-- than she ever could have suspected. Even angels need to relax! That' s why Mel' s been looking forward to her pal Lola' s surprise party for weeks. And she' s happy when she and her friends get sent off to medieval times at the last minute. Then she stumbles on a scam that runs from the Middle Ages to the future. This is seriously dangerous stuff. Can Mel change something that hasn' t happened yet?
