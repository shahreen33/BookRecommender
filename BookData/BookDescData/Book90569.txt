From 1632 until 1854, Japan's rulers restricted contact with foreign countries, a near isolation that fostered a remarkable and unique culture that endures to this day. In her remarkable book, Anna Sherman describes searching for the great bells by which the inhabitants of Edo, later called Tokyo, kept the hours in the shoguns' city.An exploration of Tokyo becomes a meditation not just on time, but on history, memory and impermanence. Through Sherman's journeys around the city and her friendship with a owner of a small, exquisite cafe, who elevates the making and drinking of coffee to an art-form, The Bells of Old Tokyo follows haunting voices through labyrinth that is the Japanese capital. An old woman remembers escaping from the American firebombs of World War Two. A scientist builds the most accurate clock in the world, a clock that will not lose a second in five billion years. The head of the Tokugawa shogunal house reflects on the destruction of his grandfathers' city: 'A lost thing is lost. To chase it leads to darkness.'The result is a book that not only engages with the otherness of Japanese culture, but marks the arrival of a dazzling new writer.
