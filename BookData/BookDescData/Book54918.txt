“They called it a cult. I called it home.”ABIGAILI don’t regret running away from home six years ago. I wound up at Good Souls, a secluded farm where I could fight my dark, dirty impulses and remain pure. I knew that soon I would receive the ultimate reward: ascension straight to heaven. Then the police raided our farm and took everything away. They called it being “rescued.”I had nothing: no family or friends, just an empty apartment in New York. The other women from the farm barely spoke to me. Our leader, Brady Booker, was missing, and my therapist wanted to convince me my sexual urges were normal, and that ascension was a lie.For so long I believed my hunger for discipline and restraint was the work of demons tempting me to sin. Then I met Mason. Dominant and handsome, he made me feel good... even if I am sick...MASONFor ten years I’ve been on the hunt, trying to fix a mistake that cost me everything. Obsessed with righting the wrongs of my past, I lost touch with my friends and family; I lost my badge; I lost all semblance of a normal life.I never should have let Abigail Lamb get under my skin. Just when I’d caught a break, when I thought the end was in sight, she stood in my way. Beautiful, but brainwashed, her tragic past and thirst for submission drew me in and held on tight. I couldn’t resist, even if it meant jeopardizing my mission.Now I have no choice. I can’t let her go, not until I get what I need. I’m going to finish what I started, even if that means becoming a monster...Publisher's note: “Good Sick” is a psychological, new adult dark romance story with explicit sexual content, including BDSM practices, with no cliffhangers, no cheating and a HEA.
