I thought he bought me to save me… but he’s keeping me for himself.  It was a girl’s night out gone wrong. Like some awful horror movie, my friends and I were grabbed in a dark parking lot and shoved into the back of a van.  Coming from powerful families, we thought we were untouchable.  We thought wrong.  Our captors trapped us, violated us, and put us up for sale on the black market.  Johnathan was sent to buy me so his boss, Lucifer, could have leverage over my father.  He was supposed to save me, protect me, and return me.  Not claim me and keep me for himself…
