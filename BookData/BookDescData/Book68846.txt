Something is wrong in Neverland. Dreams are leaking out - strangely real dreams, of pirates and mermaids, of warpaint and crocodiles. For Wendy and the Lost Boys it is a clear signal - Peter Pan need their help, and so it is time to do the unthinkable and fly to Neverland again.But back in Neverland, everything has changed - and the dangers they find there are far beyond their dreams...Peter Pan in Scarlet was commissioned specially by Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children as the official sequel to J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan. True to Barrie's quirky style and to his unforgettable hero, Peter Pan in Scarlet takes us back to a land of pirates and fairies, of childhood and exploration. But it takes us forward too - with new characters to fall in love with, new adventures to set hearts racing, and new perils to overcome - all bound together with an enchanted sprinkling of fairy dust.
