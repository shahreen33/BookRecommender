When the president of the Brook Ridge Falls Senior Center Book Club is found dead face first in one of the pies meant for the book club pie eating contest, Lexy and her posse of iPad toting grandmas take it upon themselves to find the killer. Too bad the only potential clue might be buried inside one of the many pies taken by the police for evidence.   That’s no problem, Lexy, Nans and the ladies will use their uncanny methods of deduction to ferret out the killer. They waste no time filling their suspect list.   Was it the crusty old author?  The flaky antique dealer?  Or the cheating husband with his half-baked grief act?   All of them had means, motive and opportunity and seem to be harboring secrets. But what has Lexy really worried is that someone in her group of detecting grandmas seems to have a secret of her own.   Just when the case seems impossible to solve, the final clue presents itself. Will Lexy and her posse realize its hidden meaning before it’s too late?
