Otters are some of the most delightful animals on the planet.These long, lean, furry creatures embody pure joy in so many ways – they live for napping, playing, making friends and eating, and forget about the rest. Pretty inspiring, right?In a world that can often seem divided, lonely, and just plain cruel, the otter reminds us of what’s important in life.What other animal:• Holds hands with their friends whilst napping so they don’t float away?• Communicates in a flurry of whistles, chirps, chuckles, clicks and coos?• Builds a waterslide on a daily basis?• Befriends other species, just because?• Eats food off their tummy while floating peacefully with their pals?These intelligent, adorable, water-dwelling mammals have a lot to teach us about the way we live. So, kick back, grab a pal, dive in and reconnect with your playful side, just like you otter!
