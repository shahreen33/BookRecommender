LIGHTSPEED is an online science fiction and fantasy magazine. In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF--and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales.  Our cover art this month is from Elizabeth Leggett, illustrating an original science fiction short by Will McIntosh ("What is Eve?"). We also have new work from Timothy Mudie ("The Elephants' Crematorium"), along with SF reprints by Steven Barnes ("Mozart on the Kalahari") and Mary Anne Mohanraj ("Webs"). Plus, we have original fantasy by Adam-Troy Castro ("A Place Without Portals") and Ruth Joffre ("Nitrate Nocturnes"), and fantasy reprints by Carmen Maria Machado ("The Old Women Who Were Skinned") and Ken Liu ("The Snow Train"). All that, and of course we have our usual assortment of author spotlights, along with our book and media review columns. We also have a feature interview with Angus McIntyre. For our ebook readers, we also have our usual ebook-exclusive novella reprint ("Lazy Dog Out," by Suzanne Palmer), and an excerpt from Bryan Camp's debut novel, THE CITY OF LOST FORTUNES.
