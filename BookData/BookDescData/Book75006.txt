One night to drown all the pain is all it’s supposed to be … or so we thought. We were wrong.Secrets, lies and betrayal changes both of our lives forever.Cocky. Self-assured. Confident. Skilled.Crow is the President of the Ravage Motorcycle Club Rebellion Chapter—my father Rhys’ MC.The way Crow commands the space is all alpha bad boy biker. He’s enthralling. But it’s more than that. Somehow he grips that broken part of me that weeps for the loss of my grandfather. He is my solace when all is lost, the only person who can calm my soul.This second chance encounter ignites an already growing desire. It explodes into passion neither of us anticipated. The connection is too strong to ignore. I wasn’t the only one in agony. Our lives intertwined in a way neither of us expected. We’re connected in pain, bound by family loyalty, and consumed with lust. But he’s, forbidden, because he’s much older—which makes him even hotter.If I choose wrong, I’ll lose the one thing I’ve always had—respect within the Sumner Ravage MC. I’ll lose my family.Forever.
