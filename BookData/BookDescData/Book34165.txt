 They tempted me with her. And I couldn’t resist.   I’m not a good man. I’m a hired killer, and damn good at what I do. Raised to be ruthless and forced into this life, I never had a choice.  Until she was thrown into my lap.  I didn’t want to take the hit. It’s too dangerous, and I can’t afford these kinds of risks. I turned my employers down, but they sweetened the deal.  Gifting her to me.  She’s scared, beautiful, and all mine.  She gazes at me with her gorgeous baby blues, and I can hardly resist taking her. She makes me want to break my rules… all because of the desire hidden in those stolen glances.  I’m addicted to her seductive curves and the soft moans that spill from her lips. She’s tempting in ways she doesn’t even realize. I’m practically obsessed.  They’re going to want her back, but I’ll kill them all to keep her.  *Forsaken is a full-length standalone DARK romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger. Includes expanded content and a deleted scene!
