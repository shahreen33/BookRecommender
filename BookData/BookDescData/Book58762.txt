"And in the end we are nothing more than love and space dust." Timeless poetry of feeling and emotion, Love &amp; Space Dust carries readers on a journey through love, life and relationships, and then far beyond, into the stars and the far flung galaxies, where all that remains of the feelings we once felt and the lives we once lived is love and space dust.
