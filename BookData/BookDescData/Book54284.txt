Nothing makes Dr. Taggert Webster wearier than the two words “love” and “marriage”. Having grown up in an environment where “marriage” meant “the time before divorce” and “love” meant nothing, he wants to avoid them both. Unfortunately, his live-in lover Alex doesn’t share his opinion. Her need for his love and a deeper commitment is driving a wedge between them and ruining what he considers a perfect relationship. During a heated argument, Tag mutters, “I wish you’d leave me alone….” And soon discovers the true meaning of the words “be careful what you wish for.” Not only does Alex leave his life for good, she doesn’t remember their past year together. With Alex gone Tag realizes his folly; he’s loved her all along. Little does Tag know that Psyche granted him a wish in exchange for saving her life. Now they’re both in hot water. With her help, Tag must get Alex to remember what they’d shared before Valentine’s Day or the wish will become permanent.        Previously released in the Wild Wishes anthology. This valentines story is a quick hot read for a cold winter night.
