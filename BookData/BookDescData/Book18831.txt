When Dorian disappears, Alan and his friend, Leo, set out to find him. But the disoriented young man discovered cowering in a hotel room is not the Dorian they know and love. That Dorian is shattered. It’s up to Alan to pick up the pieces and show Dorian there are better ways to fly.They may be off on a new journey together, but their destination will rock them both to the core.
