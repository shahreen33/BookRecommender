It's time for Bear to hibernate, but he just can't get to sleep because his cave is crowded with all of his friends. Raccoon snores, Beaver fidgets, and Skunk doesn't exactly smell too good. So Bear gets a great idea and reserves a room at the Hibernation Hotel. "This is the life!" he exclaims, eating all the snacks he wants and bouncing up and down on the bed. But for some reason, at bedtime, he still can't sleep. Could something be missing?
