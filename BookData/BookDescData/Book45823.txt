ABIGAIL DARLINGTON IS AWKWARD…  She will never be “that” girl. You know the one: that girl on campus, confident in her own skin. Always saying the right things. Putting herself out there. Knows how to talk to a guy without stammering.  Nope. Shy but clever, and easily embarrassed, Abby is fine being the wallflower in her circle of outgoing, beautiful friends; she would rather read about a sexy book boyfriend than actually have a live, breathing one.  …BUT CALEB LOCKHART IS WORSE.  Star goaltender for the University’s hockey team, Caleb is quiet and broody, preferring the solitude of his orderly, regimented life. He doesn’t like, or need people—and plans to keep it that way. One more year left of hockey and he’ll be long gone.  AWKWARD NEVER LOOKED SO GOOD.  Both their lives change the day that Abigail falls for Caleb. Well, falls directly on top of him, to be accurate. Because sometimes we don’t settle into love.  We fall there.  WARNING: This book contains cursing, and LOTS of it. It also has sex, uncomfortable sexual situations, and secondary characters who say some really inappropriate shit. RATING: R
