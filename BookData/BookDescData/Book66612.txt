This is the story of a young woman's first encounters with rural South Africa. Coming from the all-mod-cons society of Britain at the beginning of the 1980's, the author is literally transplanted to a farm in the foothills of the Drakensberg mountains in what is now Kwazulu Natal - where life was considerably more primitive than the one she had come from. Once there, she finds her feet in the ways of Africa with the help of a charming, elderly Dutch couple, an appealing but wily African farm hand, his practical and motherly daughter and a wise and fascinating neighbour who has a fund of local knowledge. They are tales of a different kind of life, which include living without electricity, hand-milking cows, drought, veld fires and mad-cap adventures into the unknown, all told with affection, respect and a liberal dose of tongue-in-cheek humour.
