GALENLust. My ultimate downfall,And demise.I'm shackled to a life I can't escape.A life I never asked for.Now, I'm trapped--soulless,Burdened by a Watcher lurking within.He wants out, he wants her.But I can't let that happen,Won't let that happen.She's mine.Somehow that doesn't matter.I canâ€™t have what I crave.What I want.What I need.As the Watcher fights me,Battles for control,I refuse to succumb.It's a power I'll never relinquish.I can't unleash what lies beneath,Without paying the ultimate price,And losing her in the end.
