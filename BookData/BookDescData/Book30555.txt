The journey of life. We all go through it. Matthew Davis went down a different one than most of us. Horse racing, computers, divorce, and food. Food especially, led him down a path of self destruction. What happens when a thirty-something man who is addicted to betting on the horses gets divorced? Will he have the self-discipline to move on? Spending hours upon hours alone in his small condo wasting his life on the horse racing forum that has become his only social involvement, Bang-Bang Man leads a life that no one should. Can he change the course his life is on? Will there be anyone who can help him cope? Will he ever realize just how important people are to each other?
