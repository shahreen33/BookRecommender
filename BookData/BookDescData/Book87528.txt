Irina awakes, bound and beaten, in a cabin. A prisoner of a rogue Wolf. Her life is a living hell until she reaches the point where she longs for death to take her. Two powerful Vampires, Vlad and Zach, are on the hunt for this Wolf, and finding him ends in a bloody fight to the death. Only Zach's vast Vampire abilities alert them to Irina's whereabouts. They find her, bloodied and broken...and newly turned. With no other option, they take the young woman to their home, Unity, where she refuses to be separated from Vlad. The Vampire reluctantly lets her stay in his home and all too soon he realises he feels for her things that no Vampire should for a Wolf. This is the story of Vlad and Irina from the Defender's Blood series of books. Here you find out exactly how things were for them in the beginning.
