*48k words of Fast, Funny, &amp; Sexy - Enjoy!*  Do you know what's better than being Queen of the Dead? Having four sexy friends that aren’t romantically interested in you. I’m joking, it sucks. Can I really blame them though? I mean sure, I'm a total bad*ass and babe. But why would two sexy vampires, a century-old demon, and wolf shifter be interested in little old me? Now, I don’t want to discredit myself because let me be clear… I’m awesome. The fun kick*ss leather wearing type of awesome that hangs out with the dead because frankly, the living are pretty annoying. Well, most of them anyway. Being Queen has always come easy to me. I mean who doesn't like putting some jerk in his place? Lately, though, something has changed and I feel the trouble coming like a storm rolling in. Despite my boys not reciprocating my crush, I know they will always be by my side. Though, I do wonder why they are acting so weird about the local demi-god of luck and VooDoo priest’s attention.  I mean, I have to date eventually, right? Right?! Apparently, not if my friends have anything to say about it. This is why I stick to the dead and not the living. They are so complicated.  Current release date is NOT set to change, however, any updates will be posted on my social media page. Check out my author information for updates and content extras!  *Fantasy RH* This is a light-hearted, semi-satirical, and fairly fast-paced reverse harem. You can bet that our characters will be swearing up a storm in New Orleans and expect elements of horror such as gore, violence, and an array of other topics dealing with death. Sexual themes are suitable for mature audiences. +18
