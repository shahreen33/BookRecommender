Gambit-one of the smoothest, best-looking operators in the world of the X-Men. Deadpool-one of the most annoying, ugliest dirtbags in the world of everything. Naturally, these guys got beef. But do you know what they have in common? A secret history of working together to pull con-jobs. That's right-the grift is on as the Regeneratin' Degenerate and the Ragin' Cajun begrudgingly take on one last job together.
