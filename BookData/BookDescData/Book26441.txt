On the outside my life seems simple. I'm an average woman with a love for motorcycles. A high school teacher who's a single mother. But what you don't know is what lingers just beneath the surface... The desires The needs. This hunger that can never be fully satiated. Part of me knows it's bad. That I shouldn't crave what I do. But the other half doesn't give a fu*k. I'm split in two. Which is how I've spent most of my life. Torn in half by conflicting emotions. By the man I desire, but shouldn't. By the secrets that I hide from almost everyone. Then... One day, everything changes... My world is turned upside down and I'm left falling... Falling toward something special. Toward a sense of belonging that I find in the strangest of places. With someone I never thought I'd be with in my wildest dreams.  I'm Gwen Donovan and this is my journey to love and self acceptance. Let's just hope, that in the end, it doesn't bite me in the ass.
