IN THE WEEDS is a boisterous ‘70s tale of gas, grass, ass…and Vietnam. While serving there as an Air Force pilot, Slats Kisov directs bombing runs from a plane so small that the armament doubles if a passenger climbs in wearing a shoulder holster. Slats returns to the US a changed man, one determined to live a life of harmless banditry from the cockpit of an airplane. War has left Slats something of an adrenaline junkie and, using his exceptional low-and-slow flying skills, he begins to smuggle marijuana into Florida from the Bahamas. He is aided in this venture by his friends the Morales brothers, members of an improbable family of immigrants seeking their own unique form of artistic freedom. They’re moral people…who just also happen to be money launderers, gun molls, and poetry-spouting bulimic Cuban marijuana farmers. Slats generally enjoys good fortune as he strolls through life, but his luck takes the occasional appalling turn. Much of the trouble comes from Bobby Ray Pistle, police chief of Farth. He’s the sort of man who considers the Klan an upstanding civic organization, and he views Slats as nothing more than a Hebraic hippie who prefers the company of minorities to that of paler folk. The chief soon comes to suspect that Slats is smuggling the same weed he’s been smoking, though Pistle’s bulb burns too dimly to find proof. But when the chief discovers his lusty ex has fallen for Slats, it’s time to fish or cut bait. Slats fights many battles – with the Viet Cong, hijackers, PTSD, and mother nature herself – but no enemy proves more perilous than the chief.
