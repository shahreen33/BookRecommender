Alex the Mutt was the love of my life, but she could have been euthanized before having had a chance to live. Please join me on my journey to find love, and the emotional conflict I endured when forced to leave a dog behind.  These strays deserve more. All it takes is compassion and understanding. Too many animals are killed before their time, and this has got to end now. If only more people would stop and think first before going to a pet store or breeder. Instead, visit a local rescue, pound, or shelter. Itâ€™s time to be their voice; please help spread the word. Will you join the cause?
