Personal stories of soldiers, citizens, and journalists who were present for the most harrowing and historic day of WWII.  On June 6, 1944, under the steady leadership of Adm. Sir Bertram Ramsay, Allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy. Known as Operation Overlord, it was the greatest seaborne invasion of all time. Voices from D-Day tells the extraordinary story of that fateful day, the preparations leading up to it, and the ten weeks of fighting in Normandy that followed, told by the men and women who were there.  Compiled from interviews with veterans, as well as diaries, memoirs, and letters, this book features classic accounts by soldiers, including FM Erwin Rommel and Gen. Omar Bradley, as well as frontline reports by war correspondents, including Ernest Hemingway and Alan Melville.  Published to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the Normandy landings, highlights of this unique collection include the break-out from Omaha Beach as told by the GI who led it, a French housewife's story of waking up to the invasion, German soldiers' accounts of facing the biggest seaborne invasion in history, a view from the command post by a member of Eisenhower's staff, combat reports, diaries and letters of British veterans of all forces and services, and accounts of the follow-up battle for Normandy, one of the bloodiest--and most significant--struggles of the war.
