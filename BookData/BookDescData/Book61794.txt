Life regret number one: Moving into an apartment where all I hear are the moans coming from my downstairs neighbor's apartment. It's pretty obvious what's happening behind those doors, which is even more frustrating when you aren't getting any action yourself. To make matters worse, I got fired from my job, and my savings account is pathetic. That means I can't eat my body weight in donuts, even if I wanted to...and I really want to. Thanks to my sister, though, I have a new work opportunity lined up, and I promised myself I wouldn't do anything to lose this one. Until I realize my new boss, Logan, is none other than my sex god of a neighbor. Keeping my ever-growing attraction to him in check proves to be a lot harder than I thought, especially with my knowledge of his extracurricular activities. When my new job as his photography assistant keeps throwing us together--sometimes completely eliminating our personal space--I find it more and more difficult to remember why I'm supposed to stay away from him. Hi, I'm Ember Keaton, and I suck at adulting. The Best Kind Of Mistake is a fun, sweet, and romantic standalone novella with a HEA.
