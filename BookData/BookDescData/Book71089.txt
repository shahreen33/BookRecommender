When Brad opens his Vegas hotel room door to find a hot police officer waiting on the other side, he assumes crazy Aunt Tilly has sent him a strip-o-gram. But instead of getting naked, Detective Gorgeous pulls out his cuffs — turns out, the badge and uniform aren’t just props, this cop is the real deal. Brad is a free 10k word short story in the Made Marian series by best-selling author Lucy Lennox. It can be found here: https://www.instafreebie.com/free/LrvnV
