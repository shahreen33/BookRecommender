I just published my first novel: Love Doctor. There’s one small problem—besides the fact it isn’t selling—my boss from Hell, Dr. Declan Sincock, Sex Therapist, was my muse. Let’s just say, I took some creative liberties with him…I never thought he’d know about it. And never in a million years did I think he’d read it. But he has, and he’s not happy. I should just quit, find a new job, but now I have another plan. Write what you know, right? Dr. Sincock is going to educate me on how to write hotter sex. He just doesn’t know it yet.
