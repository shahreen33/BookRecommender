“Tell me a secret.”“I’m falling for you.”Austin Sexton is the man I’ve always tried to stay away from. He’s arrogant, entitled and a total ass. That’s why I didn’t bother giving him my name last night. We’ll never see each other again. Or so I thought.Imagine my surprise when I start my new job only to come face-to-face with the blue eyes I just declared all wrong for me. No, he’s not my boss, but being my boss’ brother seems almost worse. No matter how hard I try to push him away, his secrets draw me in. When it comes to a Sexton that could be lethal...for my heart. I have his secrets and I won’t tell a soul. Now I just have to not fall for him completely.
