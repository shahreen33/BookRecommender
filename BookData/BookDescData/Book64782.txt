In these five beautifully illustrated stories, Ollmann peers into the cracks of everyday life, finding inspiration in those slightly uncomfortable moments, both extraordinary and mundane, that make life ... well ... interesting. Influenced by a variety of artists such as Ben Katchor, Charles Schulz, Ralph Steadman, and Edward Gorey, Ollmann draws the inhabitants of his world with remarkable craft and an eye for detail, making each character unforgettable. "Oh Deer" tells the story of Schultz, a mild-mannered office drone suffering a mid-life crisis, who, instead of leather pants, buys a rifle and goes hunting with the alpha males he works with. The novice hunter gets lucky but with terrible results as he refuses to deal with the deer carcass in his garage.
