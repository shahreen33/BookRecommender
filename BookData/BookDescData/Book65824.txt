From the New York Times Bestselling author of MISTER O and BIG ROCK, comes a hot &amp; hilarious new standalone romantic comedy…Let’s be honest, ladies. A good man is a lot like the perfect car. You want a hot body, an engine that purrs, and superior performance under the hood. You probably also crave a ride that can go all night long.I’m at your service. Like the custom cars I build with class and sophistication, that’s exactly how I treat a woman. But don’t worry. I absolutely do my best work dirty…both in the shop and between the sheets. Work and play keep me plenty busy, until a certain sexy brunette reappears in my life and throws a wrench in all my plans.This woman drives me insane. With longing. With lust. With every-damn-thing. But I kept my hands off her when I worked with her before, and I can damn well do it again now that’s she’s the competition.After all, you don’t sleep with the enemy, even if it’d be one helluva joy ride?
