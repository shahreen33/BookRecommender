Bear cubs Button and Mungo are so excited for Christmas! They’re especially happy when just before bed they see that it’s snowing. “I wish it would snow forever,” Button tells Papa. It snows all night, and suddenly, there’s too much snow! It blows in through the mail slot, comes in through the window, and blocks the chimney. “How will Santa deliver our presents?” Mungo cries. Can the bears save Christmas?
