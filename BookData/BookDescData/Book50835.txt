Having no regards for people, their property, or even her own life, Faith Simmons has done everything from selling off her life's fortune, to selling her body, to stealing -- all because of her sweet addiction fo the Candy Shop. Looking back ten years ago, who would have ever thought that this well-respected -- and very well-paid -- thirty-five-year-old assistant principal for a performing arts school, would trade in her husband and her daughter, a two-story brick home in a gated community, and a fully-equipped Jaguar for a body riddled with track marks and a substance that gave her a better feling than sex. But when that candy, as she knows it, finally runs out, Faith resorts to the "desperate times, calls for desperate measures" solution, which will have her playing Russian roulette with the Angel of Death. And sooner than later, these episodes will catch up with her so that she will be forced to make some life-altering choices--but will it be too late?
