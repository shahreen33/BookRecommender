Zeke Daniels isn't just a douchebag; he's an asshole.A total and complete jerk, Zeke keeps people at a distance. He has no interest in relationships - most assholes don't.Dating? Being part of a couple? Nope. Not for him.He's never given any thought to what he wants in a girlfriend, because he's never had any intention of having one.Shit, he barely has a relationship with his family, and they're related; his own friends don't even like him.So why does he keep thinking about Violet DeLuca?Sweet, quiet Violet - his opposite in every sense of the word.The light to his dark, even her damn name sounds like rays of sunshine and happiness and shit.And that pisses him off, too.
