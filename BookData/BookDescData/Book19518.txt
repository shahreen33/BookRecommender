Pandora and her friends Alcie, Iole, and Homer are practically evil-hunting experts. Jealousy, Vanity, and Laziness are all safely in the box and they already know Lust is lurking on Mount Pelion, so this fourth task should be super easy.Just one teeny tiny problem: the evil is hiding at a wedding that took place 1,300 years ago. Luckily, the messenger god, Hermes steps in to help Pandy and her friends travel back in time-with just one rule: don't change anything. At the wedding, they recognize most of the gods and goddesses, but nobody recognizes them. (Duh, they haven't been born yet.) So they can search for the evil without drawing attention to themselves. But then Lust appears in the middle of a fateful argument between three of the most powerful goddesses. There's no way Pandora can capture the evil without making a big scene. And worse, if she takes it at the wrong moment, she won't just change the course of history-she'll be history. Yup, this quest is totally under control . . . gulp!
