It's years into a campaign against the rebels who have rallied behind the White Rose that left the Company jaded, and the Lady's particular interest in Croaker since his stay in the Tower hasn't exactly made his life easier. Now it looks like The Limper is up to his old tricks, doing what he can to separate Croaker and the Black Company from The Lady's favor. Croaker finds his fate tied to a brand new Taken. One claiming to be something impossible, but feels uncomfortably familiar. It's going to take all of Croaker's cunning to insure that the machinations of The Lady and her "loyal" Taken, The Limper, don't destroy the company once and for all.At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.
