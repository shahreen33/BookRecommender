In this book, Robyn Youkilis, one of the leaders in this field, reveals the surprising connections between gut health and getting slim. A healthy gut allows for more efficient absorption of nutrients from food. This in turn means the gut can better signal the brain when to stop eating and which foods are working best for your body. Eating happy-gut foods, you will be able kick the negative cravings and up-and-down weight swings. This plan will help women shed in a way that nourishes, not deprives; this is a lifestyle, not a diet. Robyn's tone is never didactic; instead reading her book is like getting advice from a close friend--reassuring while gently prodding.
