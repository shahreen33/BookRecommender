This handbook examines the most common type of liver disease-fatty liver-and offers a comprehensive plan to reverse the condition and restore health. In addition to providing an extensive overview of the disease, its causes, and tools for diagnosing and determining the level of severity, the reference features a step-by-step path for healing. Among the information provided for those seeking to eradicate this disease, and reduce the incidence of blood clots, cancer, diabetes, heart attacks, and weight gain, is a description of basic dietary principles and natural therapies to heal damaged and fatty liver cells. An extensive personal essay-"Confessions of a Fat Man" by Thomas Fanelli MD-reveals a true-life example of one person's emotional battle with food addiction and fatty liver disease. In this chronicle, Fanelli documents how the book helped turn his health around and details his psychological and emotional strategy-the 10 Ps-to help control food addiction and other addictions that cause damage to the liver.
