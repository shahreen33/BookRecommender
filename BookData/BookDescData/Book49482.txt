Chinatown, 1910. Violence is nothing new to these streets, but the discovery of three bodies—little more than piles of flesh and organs, the bones stolen—have proven to be the most bizarre murders to date. The police turn to Max Elliot, an unstable homicide detective, who six months earlier lost his wife and daughter under similar circumstances. The freakish murders provide an opportunity for Max to rejoin the force and find closure to his family’s demise. But the clues lead him on a path he never could have imagined. A mysterious drug, a world beneath our own, sex and violence on an unprecedented level... and creatures as ancient as sin itself. Follow Max as he looks for answers in THE CITY—an extreme horror novel with a noir twist.
