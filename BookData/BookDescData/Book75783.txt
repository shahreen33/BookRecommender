"Gundark" is one of the most notorious illegal arms dealers in the galaxy, wanted by virtually every law-enforcement agency in known space... and now, for the first time, his catalog of illicit wares is available to you. From the ABC anti-personnel canister to the Z2 stun baton, Fantastic Technology: Personal Gear contains detailed game statistics and information on scores of items: weapons, armor, security mechanisms, computers, explosives, communications equipment, and other "specialty devices". Take a tour to the black market, where anything can be acquired... for the right price.[This book contains material gathered from several sourcebooks, supplements and The Official Star Wars Adventure Journal. The editors would like to thank the many authors and artists - too numerous to list here - who created the equipment contained in this volume.]
