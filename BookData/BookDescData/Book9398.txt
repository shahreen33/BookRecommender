Three hundred years ago, a group of heroes imprisoned a dark god and his lieutenants in a hell dimension known as the Void.Since then, the people of Maghe Sihre have lived in relative peace. Now, a secret war brews at the edge of civilization. Tadgh Dooley, a young man from Earth, is burdened with a dangerous and impossible power. He has the ability to warp the fabric of reality, to make his wishes come true. The armies of evil see him as a weapon. They will not rest until they control him. A mysterious force transports Tadgh to Maghe Sihre and, in doing so, ruptures the Void. Worse, each time he uses his ability, the Void cracks open a little further. Prisoners start to escape. If Tadgh can't control his power, he risks shattering the Void completely, unleashing the dark god on an unprepared world. And what does the appearance of the Sword of Kassandra mean for the people of Maghe Sihre?
