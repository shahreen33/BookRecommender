“I have to believe in love. It’s all I’ve got. It keeps me going.”  Ryan Turner is looking for a better life. His abusive, alcoholic father has been getting worse ever since his mom passed away twelve years ago. Struggling with his sexuality, Ryan works hard, takes night classes, keeps his head down and does his best to look after his dad, but he’s not sure how much longer he can keep it up. If he just had a little time, a little space to work out his feelings, a little money, maybe he could make things better—for himself and for his dad.   “That kind of love doesn’t happen to guys like me. It doesn’t exist in my world.”  Eric Harper doesn’t believe in love. Not when it comes to finding it for himself, anyway. Not the kind of love his brother found with Chase. Or the kind of love his parents had. Maybe it’s because he lives in the small town of Baxter Springs. Maybe it’s because he hasn't really put himself out there to find the right person. Maybe it’s him.   “Sometimes love is unexpected. Sometimes it’s even inconvenient. Sometimes, you have to take a chance…”  When Eric hires Ryan to work at the ranch, it’s supposed to be a temporary position. Just two or three weeks. That was the plan. The part that wasn’t planned? The sizzling chemistry between them, and worst of all…. falling in love.  This is Book 2 from the Baxter Springs series. While it is a standalone novel, you may enjoy reading Coming Home first to meet the rest of the crew!
