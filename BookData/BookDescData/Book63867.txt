On the twilight world of gat the quest begins. A mercenary, a galactic traveller, a survivor: Earl Dumarest is tired and wants to go home. But in a decadent universe where life is cheap and starflight precious, where emotionless conspirators and mind-controlling churches spin webs of intrigue to ensnare whole galaxies, Dumarest's goal seems impossible. For no one knows where his home world lies, no one believes Dumarest was born on a myth called Earth.Earth is lost in an infinity of stars, leaving Dumarest stranded on Gath, trapped in the schemes of a sadistic prince, a dying Matriarch, a corrupt ruler, and the sinister Cyclan--on a world where star storms drive men mad with the song of the spheres and the voices of the dead arise to kill the living. Here the journey begins, and here it may end, adrift on the Winds of Gath.
