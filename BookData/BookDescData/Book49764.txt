When Loving You Is Hurting Me examines various forms of domestic violence such as family violence; intimate partner, child, and elder abuse; teen dating violence; and men being abused by women. Readers are enlightened about its effect on the victims and those who love and care about the maltreated person. The author deals with the subject from a biblical and spiritual perspective. The title of the book gives a foreshadowing of the subject and the dynamics between victims and perpetrators: the individual who cares immensely for the very individual who exploits and takes advantage of that endearment by mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually annihilating them.Dr. Kimberly D. Shamberger uses scriptural and clinical references to encourage and demonstrate that God does not desire his children to endure maltreatment. It is the author's desire by the completion of this book that all perpetrators will be edified and all victims will have gained knowledge, self-assurance of the love of God, and encouragement to safely change the title to "I'm Leaving You For Me" (Con Funk Shun).
