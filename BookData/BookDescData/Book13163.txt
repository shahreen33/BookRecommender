Winner of the 2018 Will Rogers Medallion Award Bronze Medal Have you ever found a cougar on your swing set or a moose in your driveway? Go West, Young Woman! is the true story of one family’s transition from beltway living in metro Washington, D.C. to what they thought would be a “calmer” existence in rural Montana. They soon discover how unprepared they are for the challenges ahead, both comical and adventurous. The humor of their early encounters with cattle and local customs only masks the more ominous confrontations with predators and nature. Through their journey they discover the true meaning of “the code of the west,” a concept which has not entirely vanished from the American way of life.
