Your name is Fidge and you're nearly eleven. You've been hurled into a strange world.You have three companions: two are unbelievably weird and the third is your awful cousin, Graham. You have to solve a series of nearly impossible clues.You need to deal with a cruel stuffed animal dictator and three thousand Wimbley Woos (yes, you read that sentence correctly). And the whole situation -- the whole, entire thing -- is your fault. Wed Wabbit is an adventure about friendship, danger, and the terror of never being able to get back home again. And it's funny. It's seriously funny.
