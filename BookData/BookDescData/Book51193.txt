Every choice you make in life comes with a consequence.I was once on top, I was the professional boxer to be afraid of. I had everything I could possibly hope for. I was happy, satisfied, content . . . until one night. One off day. One wrong reaction. I killed a man. The sound, the blood, the stagnant air, it’s forever imprinted in my mind and now dictates the way I live my life. Desolate with nothing but my penance to pay, I didn’t expect to have my world flipped upside down when Lyla seductively strutted into my life. I want her. I need her. I crave her. But I don’t deserve her. People like to celebrate the day they were born, I like to celebrate the day my soul died. This is my story of repentance.
