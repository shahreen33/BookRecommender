A healer and a dragon queen. They’re meant for each other—and for so much more.  A baby, abandoned on a harsh slope to die. She grew into a healer, but she can’t grow out of the thing that keeps her from being entirely human.  An ice-blue dragon who will one day be queen. Self-confident, and beloved, but there has always been a hole inside her that nothing can fill.  Neither of them is ready for what awaits—but the Star doesn’t wait for those it calls to be ready.  A note from Audrey: I tell stories of hope, resilience, belonging, and finding what (and who!) matters. I do that in a lot of different genres, but you’ll always get those things in an Audrey Faye book. :)
