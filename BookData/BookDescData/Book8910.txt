Buy paperback, get the Kindle version FREE with Kindle MatchBook!Adam Nash is a superstar. House, cars, money, women ... he's got it all. Yeah, he's conceited, but with his looks and talent why shouldn't he be? Not until he's banned from another hotel for his drunken antics does he realize that it's time to grow up and treat his music as a career and not a free ride. Now Adam has set his sights on florist Jade Graham. She's not the kind of woman he's used to, she's too smart to play the role of arm-candy. Adam is going to have to keep his celebrity status a secret for as long as possible, because what woman in her right mind would get attached to a playboy without a conscience? Jade Graham is going to be one tough case, but she seems hell bent on proving that there is more than one way for a star to fall.*3/13 update: BONUS! Now includes the short story, Falling Star's Epilogue Starting Forever at the end of the file.*55,000 words, 3390 Kindle Locations
