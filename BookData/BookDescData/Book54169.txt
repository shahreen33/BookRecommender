Ambassador Edric Saran is having an uncommonly rough year. Living as an exile in Tressia, the city of his ancestral enemies, he’s surrounded by a bodyguard he doesn’t trust, and expected to do a job that no one – least of all Edric himself – takes very seriously. When Edric becomes the chief suspect in a murder, he and a young noblewoman join forces in order to bring the real killer to account. But Edric soon realises the murder was only one strand in a tangled web of mortal and immortal scheming. Hunted by the law, and pursued by vengeful servants of half-forgotten gods, Edric soon learns that there’s more at stake than clearing his name. Will he discover the truth before the Shadow of the Raven descends upon the world, and the war between the living and the dead begins?
