Holiday Omegas: Book One  Sonny is an omega witch with a huge crush on the alpha bear shifter next door. Unfortunately, every time they meet, Sonny’s normal sassy personality disappears and he becomes a shy, babbling idiot.  Leo is captivated by the adorable kitchen witch that lives in his apartment building, but what could Leo possibly offer him? Thanks to his ex, Leo knows he’s not exactly the greatest catch. The problem is, Leo’s bear knows Sonny is his mate. Fed up with their awkward mating dance, Sonny and Leo’s friends decide All Hallows’ Eve is the perfect time to cause a little mischief to bring the two together.
