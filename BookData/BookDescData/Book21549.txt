The farm was near the Grand Teton Range of the Rocky Mountains and Yellowstone Park was only a few miles away. Grandeur, beauty and love surrounded her and were implanted in her soul. Ruth also lived in several other western states as a child where experiencing different cultures, lifestyles and new adventures gave her a variety of things to write about. Her heartfelt stories are memoirs of growing up during the twenties and thirties. Ruth is an excellent storyteller and her unique style captivates readers of all ages.
