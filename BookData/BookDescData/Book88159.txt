First in a thrilling new adventure series based on references made to the "Baker Street Irregulars" in the classic Sherlock Holmes novels. It is 1897, Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee year, and the Baker Street Boys are helping Sherlock Holmes solve a case involving a mysterious American when Holmes himself disappears. Only the Boys realize that he hasn't gone undercover but has actually been kidnapped by a Fenian gang from Boston who are planning to assassinate the Queen. The Boys save the day by getting into Windsor Castle and persuading Victoria herself of the real danger she faces. Based on a series originally screened on television. An ideal series to encourage boys to read - both historical and exciting.
