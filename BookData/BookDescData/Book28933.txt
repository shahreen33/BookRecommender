Desperate times call for a darker team of X-Men! With mutantkind in extinction's crosshairs once more, Magneto leads a group of the deadliest that homo superior has to offer to fight for the fate of their species!

But with a team populated by killers, can they stay away from each other's throats long enough to take down their targets? And can the Master of Magnetism curb his own homicidal instincts long enough to find out who's trying to speed up mutantkind's descent into the grave? It's X-Men with the emphasis on Uncanny!Collecting: Uncanny X-Men 1-5
