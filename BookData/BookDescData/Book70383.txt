Young Mehjabeen's stay in Montmartre, Paris, is an exploration of different worlds, without and within. The Paris that she discovers is not a utopia of Love and Art alone. It's also a city simmering with ethnic conflict. Mehjabeen is in search of her roots, and unknowingly she embarks upon a journey of self discovery as she attempts to understand art, love, the notion of freedom, and more. On the one hand there's the world of soirees, champagne and luxury and on the other is the world of Agnes Desmoulins, her mentally challenged son Dodi and the Guatemalan refugee Marina. Mehjabeen straddles these two very different worlds, and her myriad experiences find their way into her canvas.
