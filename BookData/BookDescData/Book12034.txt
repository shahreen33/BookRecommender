American journalist Claire Raymond is caught in the undertow of China's emergence to regional dominance at the close of the 20th century.Foreign correspondent Claire Raymond finds herself uncomfortably sidelined at home on maternity leave. A neighbor's son, Petey, is found dead along the Midlevel district's May Road during the Christmas season only six months before the official handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China. A neurotic anxiety pervades the colonial middle-class and mixes with a mounting religious hysteria among the mistreated Filipina amahs, the housekeepers who slave for Chinese and colonial households. Claire fears for the safety of her own newborn, Caspar. The visit to Hong Kong of Xavier's ex-lover Fabienne adds to her tensions as she investigates Petey's suspicious death.
