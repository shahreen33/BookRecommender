The perfect man for me is the one I hate most. #gofigureDating is hard.Dating in your thirties is even harder.Dating in Chicago is harder still.I haven't given up on finding my happily-ever-after, but in the age of swiping right and Netflix and chill, I'm wondering if everything is as temporary as my marriage turned out to be.Truth is, there is one guy I can't get my mind off of.Roarke Baldwin has salt and pepper hair I've dreamed of running my hands through and I'm pretty sure that if I checked he really does have a six pack of abs underneath his suit. And I've always wondered what that stubble on his face would feel like between my thighs.The problem? He's the one man I hate more than my ex-husbandâ€¦His divorce attorney.
