The death of a boy at Chloe’s high school looks like an accident... until Chloe discovers that he was blackmailing several other students. Was it accident—or murder?

And then it appears that Peter, the writer of the paper’s astronomy column—a boy recently found dead from an accidental fall over a cliff—was blackmailing Daria. And she wasn’t the only one.
