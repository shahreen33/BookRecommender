Not everyone can handle their newly-discovered power.  Roland is an Irish bare-knuckle boxer with an attitude and a shadowy past.  Harriet is an MIT graduate student about to embark on a research expedition to Mozambique.  They never planned on their lives becoming irreversibly intertwined.  The third gryphon to unleash his inner beast, Roland is struggling to cope with his newly discovered shifter power. But aircraft are mysteriously crashing in Mozambique, and despite what scientists think it has nothing to do with the eruption of Monte Muambe. When Roland learns that Harriet is in jeopardy from the bloody Ruby Dragon, he chooses to abandon his friends to save her.  Even though it means tracking her across the African plain.  Can he reach his new mate in time to protect her—and learn about the dragons’ sinister motives in the process? Or will the Ruby Dragon’s crimson flame be too powerful to withstand?  GRYPHONS VS DRAGONS is a new paranormal shapeshifter series from Ruby Ryan. There’s steamy romance, exciting action, and no cliffhangers. Each book in the series can be read standalone (though they're best when read in order), and of course each features a Happily Ever After!
