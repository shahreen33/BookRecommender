XavierThis is not a love story.I hate you not for who you are, but what you represent. I’m the whispers in the darkness you can’t quite hear. I’m the unease that can’t be explained, but won’t go away. I’m your worst nightmare come to life. I’m the filthy rich guy who’s coming for revenge. Everything you’ve ever had. Everything you hold dear. I won’t stop until I break you. RockyYou were once my savior. Now you’re my bully. I’m the girl from the wrong side of the wrong side of the tracks. No match for your money, your might, or your wrath. But I’m not going down without a fight. When I go, I’ll take you with me. Because we’re more alike than you want to admit. And more connected than you know. This is not a love story.
