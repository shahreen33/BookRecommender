This book is the sequel and the final chapter in the love story between Giani and Christine. The first book, "IF ONLY THERE WAS MUSIC...The Poetry of Forbidden Love" (a co-authored project), was a love story told thru the eyes of two lovers...but written for the hearts of many.  Across oceans and thru many barriers, two hearts try to connect - but with the distance between them, will their love survive? And, with the forces-that-be against them coming in the form of murder plots and domestic abuse, the bigger question is...will they?
