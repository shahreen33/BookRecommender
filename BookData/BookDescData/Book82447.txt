If you want to read gripping stories that don’t rely on sex, swearing, and graphic violence—you’ve come to the right place!  DEEP MAGIC is a bi-monthly electronic magazine that publishes clean short fiction in the fantasy and science fiction genres (epic, paranormal, steampunk, etc). Our issues are also filled with author interviews, art features, book reviews and tips for writers.  In this issue you'll find an exclusive story for Deep Magic by bestselling author DK Holmberg called "The Price of Healing" - it is set in a new world that he'll be introducing in an upcoming novel. We also showcase a great sci-fi story that we loved called "Between Earth and Exile" by Laurie Tom. Clint Johnson also brings us "The Dealer, the Hag, and the Boy Who Dreamed" and "Not That Kind of Wizard" by day-time attorney Eugene Morgulis. Finally, an enchanting story of love, loss, and dragons in "Autumn at the Dragons Cave" by Kathryn Yelinek.  We've also rounded up a great interview with Shawn Speakman and the multiple hats he wears in the genre. We interview the amazing artist Andree Wallin. Love that sci-fi cover! He did concept art for the latest Star Wars movies. And bestselling author Nick Webb gives us the technical know-how on interstellar travel with his article "Fictional Space Propulsion."  This month we also feature two book excerpts that we think you'll love to purchase. Jeff Wheeler's new Kingfountain book "The Hollow Crown" and a sneak peek at Emily King's debut novel, "The Hundredth Queen" - both are sneak peeks and will be published in June 2017.
