Even The Hunter can’t escape when love decides to snare him.  For years, Suzie’s been running with her children in tow, determined to not be found by her violent ex-boyfriend. Tired of hiding, she decides to settle down in sweet suburbia. But forget the quiet life, meet Hunter, Suzie’s hot next door neighbor.  Masquerading as a private eye, Hunter is much more than he seems. He’s what’s known as a tracker, and the magical realm he comes from has sent him on a quest to keep his world’s existence secret. A real ladies man, Hunter can’t understand his attraction to the cute mom next door, but when danger comes knocking on her door, he does everything he can to save Suzie and her kids, even if it means his life.  A vengeful exboyfriend and a predatory shapeshifting dragon are nothing though when compared to the more frightening battle taking place in his heart.
