Sparky, Smokey, Snozzle, and Squirty are the valiant firepigs who keep Busytown safe. But their busy days are much more than just putting out fires. They come when Hilda drops her keys in the drain, and they help Mr. Frumble with his pickle car. It's also important that they keep the firehouse neat and clean. But, of course, putting out fires may be their most important job. Once again, Richard Scarry's trademark humor and silly picture details will enchant readers who, again and again, will want to hear the adventures of these perhaps overambitious firefighters.
