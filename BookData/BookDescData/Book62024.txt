P'howa is a Vajrayana Buddhist method by which one's consciousness is intentionally transferred to a pure realm at the moment of death. P'howa training enables one to approach death as a unique opportunity for liberation from cyclic existence rather than as an experience of fear and uncertainty. In this book, Chagdud Khadro explains the process of dying, the steps involved in p'howa training based on the hidden treasure text ["terma"] of the Buddhist meditation master Rigdzin Longsal Nyingpo, the means of accomplishing p'howa at the time of death either for oneself or for others, and integrating p'howa into one's daily meditation practice.
