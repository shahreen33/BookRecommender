Author Callie Logan never expected to swap her life in London for one in rural Suffolk but, after the breakdown of her marriage, she decides that a fresh start is just what she needs. Finding Owl Cottage in the tiny village of Newton St Clare, Callie determines to give up on love and throw herself into her work. But fate seems to have other ideas and she soon has two very different men vying for her attention.  First there's Leo who likes to live on the wild side which usually means taking his dates foraging in the local woods for their supper. Then there's Sam Nightingale, owner of Nightingaleâ€™s bookshop. Sam, recovering from a divorce, has also vowed to embrace the single life. That is, until he meets Callie.  But is Callie willing to risk her heart again and, if she is, will she make the right choice?
