Tudor-era England, the deeply rural county of Suffolk, to be specific. Queen Elizabeth I is on the Throne. In the small village of Bungay, life sits in an undisturbed status quo; Peasants labour over backbreaking work tilling the fields by hand, the Merchant Class preside over looms and textile traders and Bungay Castle lays peacefully dormant as it has for the centuries passed since Hugh Bigod was pulled from it by Royal Guard to face execution after a failed rebellion against King Henry II......but one fateful early August night in 1577, peace is disturbed in this unassuming village, when a Beast tears through the Church doors; inside, the Beast is said to have feasted upon four unsuspecting worshippers, before vanishing and reappearing in nearby Blythburgh where the Beast's white hot, scorched-in Claw marks can still be seen on the Doors of The Holy Trinity Church to this very day!Some say the Beast is a big Demon Dog, eight-feet tall when on all-fours with fur as black as tar. Others say its Eyes burn with the white hot flames of Hell itself. Rumours abound and before you know it perhaps the most legendary of all British mythical beasts is born: Black Shuck.
