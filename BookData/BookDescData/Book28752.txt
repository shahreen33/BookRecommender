See Fred Run. . . . At least, that’s what the book says. But Fred has other ideas, and the resulting battle of wills between the book and its protagonist-who-won’t-play-along makes for an uproarious read aloud, full of surprising twists. Best of all, the patterned text has been carefully crafted so that beginners can read it themselves--and learn more than 50 essential sight words while they're at itFans of See Fred Run can also brush up on sight words with Fun With Ed and Fred, short vowels with Gran on a Fan, and long vowels with companion book Lazy Bear, Crazy Bear. As Kirkus Reviews said of Gran on a Fan: “New readers… will hardly be aware that they are supposed to be learning basic phonics because they will be giggling.”
