I preferred it when life came in tidy packages. When it didn’t — when something went awry — I was exceedingly skilled at packaging it back up. It was my job to do so after all. I was a reconstructionist. I collected the puzzle pieces, then I gave those pieces to an investigative team to sort out. I didn't ask questions. I didn't offer answers. I saw. I recorded. I moved on. I didn't dwell or obsess. I didn’t hunt down suspects. I didn’t follow clues to find a killer. And I certainly didn’t work side by side with anyone. Least of all, a vampire who I strongly suspected might turn out to be the major missing component at the end of the trail. Then I saw something I couldn't forget. It wasn't the bloodiest thing I'd ever seen. It wasn't even close. But it haunted me. I didn't like being haunted.And I couldn't figure out how to get it out of my head.Someone was killing teenaged boys in the Pacific Northwest. Despite my misgivings, if I could help catch a killer, I had to at least try.------------------This 68,000 word urban fantasy is the first book in the Reconstructionist Series by author Meghan Ciana Doidge. Author’s note: The ideal reading order of Catching Echoes (Reconstructionist #1) is after the first six books in the Dowser Series and the three books in the Oracle series, but it's not actually necessary to read the Dowser or the Oracle series before reading the Reconstructionist Series.
