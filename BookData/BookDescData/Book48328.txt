The arrangement is simple, with only two rules:  Rule #1: Don’t fall in love Rule #2: Revert back to rule one when necessary  I thought I could stick to the rules, but with a girl like Fallon I should've known rules were only meant to be broken. We’ve been best friends since elementary school, and she’s the only woman I want for more than a one night stand.  No matter how much I’m attracted to her, and I'm pretty f-ing attracted to her, I know she deserves better than a man who refuses to commit.  Then my father gives me an ultimatum:  Have a baby...or he’s selling the business my great-grandfather started over fifty years ago to a stranger.  Winston Industries is mine and I'm not about to let someone else take it from me.  Too many drinks has Fallon volunteering to help me with my problem and our agreement is born.  There’s just one little problem...Everything changes the moment I slip inside her.  Now I'm pretty sure we both know there’s no denying what we want anymore.  To hell with the rules... I'm going to claim what's mine before it's too late.  ** This is book one in the Winston Brother Series. It is a complete standalone, full-length novel with an HEA.
