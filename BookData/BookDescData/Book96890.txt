From the USA Today Bestselling author of Magnificent Bastard comes a sexy, flirty, dirty standalone…on ice.They say Jake “The Dragon” Falcone earned his nickname by setting fire to the ice his first season in the NHL. But just between us ladies, I’m pretty sure he earned it for the dragon in his pants. Lord have f*cking mercy, but the man’s been given a gift. (And I’ve heard he knows exactly how to use it.) From my first hug as his fake girlfriend, it’s clear he’s packing below the belt. After a few fake dates I realize he’s packing…everywhere. Heart, brains, sex-vibe, and the ability to make me laugh so hard I almost pee my pants—Jake is everything I’ve ever wanted in a man. He’s also my client and OFF LIMITS. Oh, and he has an ex who’s completely crazy and out for my blood.I should steer clear, and I would, if my dragon weren’t so completely incredible…***The name sounded like a joke.
