My first crush. My first heartbreak. My brother’s best friend.The butterflies in my stomach turned into full blown eagles the second our lips touched. A kiss under the stars that changed our relationship forever. After a lifetime of wishing, I stared up into Ford’s eyes with his fingers caressing my cheek and my heart racing.The evening ended with my heart bleeding on the ballroom floor. He destroyed my heart two years ago...but now he wants back in my life. This time I won’t fall under his spell. I’ll resist his sexy, scruffy beard, and panty-melting smirk. I thought I was over him. Hell, I fully planned to wave to him through my rearview mirror...but with one text, in the middle of the night, I know I'm in over my head.Ford: I need you.
