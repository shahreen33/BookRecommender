Maeve Binchy is one of the world's most popular and bestselling authors, and this collection of short stories from the BBC Radio archive shows her at her most insightful and imaginative. These four stories, never collected together in book form and unique to audio, are read by acclaimed actors Niamh Cusack, Dervla Kirwan, Doreen Hepburn and Stella McCusker. In The Garden Party, Helen envies her neighbor Debbie Kennedy's garden-and her life-but discovers that thing are not always as they seem; while The Special Sale sees lonely Yvonne arranging a special lunch for her friend Frank and his children on the day after Christmas. The Sensible Celebration finds Lorna about to throw a small party to celebrate the decade gone by; as she plans, she starts to think about her life, and her marriage. Finally, in Dolly's Mother, the beauty, grace and efficiency of her perfect parent have always made Dolly feel inferior-until the day of her sixteenth birthday.
