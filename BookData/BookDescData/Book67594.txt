Written between the ages of 13 and 18, Emilie Autumn's debut poetry book quickly sold out amongst her followers upon its release back in 2000, and the audio version has since become a sought after collector's item.Now, through the magic of digital downloads, this unique spoken word book/album with EA's original musical accompaniment is available again.This edition contains 48 poems, including the well-known "How To Break A Heart," from which New York's Rochester Ballet Company created an original ballet.
