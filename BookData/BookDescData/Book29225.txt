You won't soon forget your visit to The Isle." — Tom Deady, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of Haven“John Foster masterfully weaves New England folk horror into a hard-boiled murder mystery to form a wholly original and gripping novel that will keep you guessing as the dread builds like a tide rolling over the rocky shore. Strange rituals, hidden histories, and dangerous paranoia intersect on The Isle in ways that turn northeastern peculiarity into something uniquely horrific and thoroughly engrossing to read.” — Ed Kurtz, author of The Rib from Which I Remake the World and Nausea"If you’re the kind of person who seeks out hidden places with awful histories, then this book is for you. You’ll feel the damp and the chill, you’ll hear the shrieks and the inhuman mutter, you’ll see those children and their awful games. Read it in a safe place." — Karen Heuler, author of The Inner CityProudly presented by Grey Matter Press, the multiple Bram Stoker Award-nominated independent publisher.Grey Matter Press: Where Dark Thoughts Thrive
