This edition has been revised to reflect the vast number of changes in the magazine publishing industry. Here’s what one reader had to say about this earlier edition of our book:“After purchasing Query Letters That Rock my rejection rate is almost zero. First I know the magazine and I know the reader. If I email a query and it’s rejected, I send it out again to another market (within 24 hours). Plus, I write a thank-you email to the first magazine and send out another query. Developing a relationship with editors makes for assignments and contracts coming my way. On the average, I sell to about 300 paying markets annually. Most pay between $400 – $500, plus photos.” —Carolyn TomlinWritten by two top freelance magazine writers who authored the freelancing classic The Renegade Writer, From Pitch to Published will guide your way to freelance writing success!
