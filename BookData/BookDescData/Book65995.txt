One in seven couples struggles with infertility. Other parents long to add to their family another child who needs a home. Whatever the reason, many couples who decide to pursue adoption do not realize the often unnerving, stressful, emotional ride it can be. Deciding to adopt means moving into uncharted territory. There are many emotional highs and lows, as well as psychological, mental, and spiritual ramifications. The authors prepare prospective adoptive parents for the adoption process, from helping them examine their motives for adopting to making practical decisions about the type of adoption to pursue. They also explore the adoption process from the viewpoints of the prospective adoptive parents, the birth parents, the adoptee, attorneys, and adoption agencies. This book is an indispensable resource for anyone considering adoption.
