Lars Bradby was supposed to be my forever.That was before we found out he would become a father at the tender age of eighteen. For years, he’d watched me.For months, he’d wanted me.For weeks, he’d chased me. Relentless and infuriating, he turned my stubborn heart into something pliable and weak. Sly and honest, he worked his way into my life as though he’d always planned to be the focal point of it.In love and naive, even when our future seemed bleak, I believed in us. Heartbroken and desperate, I tore my bleeding heart from my chest, wanting only the best for him. In doing so, our forever wasn’t just interrupted. It was chased away with one irreversible decision after another. And now, we could no longer see it beneath the heaping piles of debris we’d left in our wake.
