Sexy surfers. Epic parties. Wild nights.Welcome to my senior year of college. At least, this is what I imagine when I accept a semester-long medical internship in LA, California. But reality trumps imagination when I meet him. Cade Wilkins, Astor University football god and projected NFL draft pick. With thundercloud eyes, a teasing smirk, and a ripped body, Cade is my game changer. I fall for him faster than he can score a touchdown. Except our happily-ever-after is fumbled. One tackle ends him. One party destroys me. Broken promises. Ugly truths. Ruined futures. Welcome to my senior year of college. The real version.***The College Pact Series (originally published under The Senior Semester Series) has been re-edited and revamped with new content and a fresh look. All books in this series can be read as standalones.
