Five years ago, Brock Adams disappeared from Cedar Glen, New Jersey, never to be seen or heard from again, leaving behind his wife Faith, his daughters…and two sons under a family curse.  Give up everything. That was the deal. Give up his werewolf pack, his family and his immortality, in exchange for finally, finally ridding his sons of the deadly curse. But when a disguised Brock sneaks back into Cedar Glen, he finds the curse still very much in effect. He also bumps into Faith, who he aches for just as much now as the day he left.  Coming back was a horrible idea. Winston, his foul-tempered fairy friend, told him so. But did Brock listen? Noooo. He’s listening to his heart and his libido, and both are begging for one more moment in Faith’s arms. So what if she doesn’t even know it’s really him? And one of his sons hates him? And he’ll have to leave again? And he has a vindictive witch on his trail…?  ***Author Note: Dear readers, Please note, while a completely new addition to the Wolf Mates saga, this is not a stand-alone title and should only be read if you've also completed An American Werewolf in Hoboken and What's New Pussycat?
