She knows what hides in the shadows…and now they know about her…I could go for a man with bite, and I don’t mind a little danger. But when I’m working a routine PI case and meet the seductive and mysterious Adam, it doesn’t take me long to realize he may be way more bite than I can handle. I’ve just learned vampires aren’t only scary stories told in the dark of night. Adam is the real deal. And, if having one immortal after my heart weren’t enough to convince me, there’s another one after my blood. A serial killer with an appetite for young blondes is on the loose in Phoenix, and it looks like he’s added me to the menu. I’m a pawn in a game played by beautiful monsters, and one wrong move could mean “game over” for me. Adam might be the only one who can save me, or he might be the wildest—and deadliest—mistake I’ve ever made.
