Jill Mansell's hugely entertaining bestseller GOOD AT GAMES is perfect for you if you love reading Cathy Kelly, Milly Johnson and Lucy Diamond. Reviewers love Jill Mansell: 'A lovely uplifting read' Good HousekeepingSuzy fell for Harry the moment she showed him her husband's sperm sample. It didn't really belong to her husband, though, because she wasn't married. It wasn't a sperm sample either, it was a drinks carton containing the dregs of her milkshake. But when you're trying to get off a speeding charge you just have to improvise, don't you? And it wasn't actually love at first sight. Still, it was undeniably a healthy attack of lust. And it might just be the beginning of something special...What readers are saying about Good at Games: 'This book is hilariously funny, addictive and you just can't stop once you've started. It's my favourite romantic comedy book of all time' Amazon reviewer, 5 stars'A really fun read in Jill's usual style.
