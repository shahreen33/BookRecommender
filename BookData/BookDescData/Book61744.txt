  
  A sweet, flirty, and heartfelt romance with two roommates that spend one enthralling summer together.

Instead of trying to get back on her feet, she works on perfecting the art of couch surfing.Famous author, Gabe Mitchell, doesn’t fare much better. On top of watching his roommate letting her life pass by, he also suffers from a major bout of writer’s block.Hoping a change of scenery will get them both out of their rut, Gabe takes matters into his own hands and whisks Monica away to his own personal haven.What neither one of them expects is the attraction to each other to bloom even though Monica will leave Brooksville in a matter of weeks.Their time together is filled with skimpy bathing suits, sexy fantasy book inspirations, hot tub make-out sessions, and new job prospects.It’s plenty to reignite their creative flames, but will it be enough to turn their one short summer into something more?
  ***This is book two in the Brooksville series and can be read as a complete standalone. HEA guaranteed! (Book one is Baking With A Rockstar and features Gabe’s brother Hudson.)***
