Enid Blyton is arguably the most famous children's author of all time, thanks to series such as The Wishing-Chair, The Faraway Tree-, The Mysteries, The Famous Five and The Secret Seven. Enid takes her place alongside Roald Dahl, Beatrix Potter, and A. A. Milne as one of Britain's true heritage children's authors. "Her books were terrific page-turners in the way no others were." (Michael Morpurgo, author of War Horse).
