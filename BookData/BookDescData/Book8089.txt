Until Brain discovers the hacker is a woman, and just as smart as him. She’s so clever, he chases her a full week before he finally catches her. She’s the enemy, and yet his wolf wants to protect her from Bash. Worse, his wolf is beginning to decide he wants to claim her. This isn’t going to be pretty.Warning: Fights with full-on violence and lots of blood, as well as descriptions of horrendous tortures to a captured female.
