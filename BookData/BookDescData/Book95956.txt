Celebrate the holidays with Lottie and Herbie! Dressed as Santa and humming a tune, Herbie is ready for Christmas. But when he does something bad -- and wishes he could take it back -- the holidays don't feel very happy. Children everywhere will sympathize with Herbie in Petra Mathers's new picture book, which shows how easy it is to make a mistake...and how hard it is to say you're sorry.
