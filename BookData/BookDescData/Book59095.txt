"Big Blonde" is a short story by American poet, writer, critic, and satirist Dorothy Parker (1893-1967), telling the life of aged Hazel Morse, who, when we meet her, is "a model in a wholesale dress establishment", whose thoughts are largely devoted to men. Then she meets Herbie Morse, an attractive man and a heavy drinker. Where will events now take her?
