I couldn’t be anything other than a romantic at heart — it’s my nature, it’s who I am. But this isn’t a typical story of traditional love. It isn’t a fairy tale. No happily ever after neatly tied up with a shiny bow. It’s a memoir of the reality left behind in the wake of grief — the desolation, the resurrection, and final culmination life offers to the fallen. This is a journey through love…the love of self, love of a friend, and sometimes love is ugly, messy —destructive.My name is Bastian Thames…and this is my story.
