Max Masters was born into a post-Incident world. Years ago, a beast decimated the population of the Americas and the resulting carnage was enough to weaken the very barriers separating Earth from other, far more dangerous worlds—and the monsters that roam within them. As a paranormal marshal struggling with her own less-than-human identity, Max is responsible for hunting down the most dangerous of supernatural creatures, working side-by-side with government operatives who specialize in keeping the human population safe. One of those operatives happens to be a six-foot-five, bullheaded but charming ex-boyfriend who won’t accept no for an answer—especially when it comes to Max.After an abnormal energy spike indicates that a being of exponential power has migrated through a barrier, people across Max’s territory suddenly began dying or disappearing. But when a particularly gruesome murder hits too close to home, Max is forced into the fight of her life.
