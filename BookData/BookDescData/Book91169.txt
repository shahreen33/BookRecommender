A story I wrote for my roommate. A runescribe meets with disaster on his way to a job interview.-Near-blind without his glasses, regarded as a burden to his family, Tyri left his clan to attempt a career as a runescribe in the city. But finding a job proves more difficult than anticipated, and his last hope to avoid being thrown out on the streets depends on the interview he has that morning. A morning immediately ruined by way of a storm and a stranger who accidentally breaks his glasses.
