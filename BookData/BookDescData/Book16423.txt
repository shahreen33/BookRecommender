""If the path of obedience is the path of wisdom, it is one not well worn by my feet. I am Adira, daughter of the caravan, daughter of the wind, and daughter of the famed merchant, Zakiti. That I am his daughter, not his son, is a secret between my father and myself.""Secretly raised as a boy in her father's caravan and schooled in languages and the fine art of negotiation, Adira rejects the looming changes of womanhood that threaten her nomadic life and independence. With the arrival of two mysterious Northmen, rumored to be holy men, Adira's world unravels. She loses everything she values most, including the "Angel" who has awakened her desires. Caught between her culture and freedom, and tormented by impossible love, she abandons all she has known in a dangerous quest to follow the "Angels." With only her beloved dog, Nami, at her side, Adira must use all the skills she learned from her father to survive the perils of the desert, Sodom, and her own heart.Angels at the Gate is a story of adventure and the power of love, a compelling saga based on historical research about the ancient biblical world of Abraham, Sodom and Gomorrah, and the woman who "became a pillar of salt." Like T.K. Thorne's previous award-winning novel, "Noah's Wife," this book brings to life early history in a new light and gives it relevance in the most ancient of ways - an enticing story.ARCs available now!Publicity, Media, Bloggers etc. please contact:Jane Wesman Public Relations, Inc.322 Eighth AvenueSuite 1702New York, NY 10001Contact:Jane Wesman (jane@wesmanpr.com)Felicia Sinusas (felicia@wesmanpr.com)212 620-4080fax 212 620-0370www.wesmanpr.com"
