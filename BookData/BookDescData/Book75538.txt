"If you liked Vox, you'll love this... Amazing debut by Rebecca Bowyer." Emily-Jane Clark, best-selling author of Sleep is for the Weak."Fans of The Handmaid's Tale will be instantly hooked... Maternal Instinct asks questions about humanity's final destination if we continue down society's current path of no real support for working parents." Virginia Franken, author of Life After Coffee"It's a cracking good read about upholding the rules, until time shows you that maybe the rules aren't right in the first place. This is feminist dystopian fiction at its finest, set in a not-too-distant future that is not at all difficult to envisage. Settle in, because you won't be putting it down any time soon!" Amy Wakley-Ahearn, Handbagmafia"A very well written novel, that I hope many people will enjoy..." ~ Ashleigh Meikle, The Book Muse"Something of a blend of The Handmaid's Tale and 1984, this is a fantastic book. I was hooked early on and didn't want to put this one down. I read it over the course of a family vacation and stayed up far too late at night because I NEEDED to know what was going to happen." ~ Elle, Erratic Project Junkie"The story is amazing, it is unique. I’ve never ever read anything like this before." ~ Anna S, NetGalley reviewer"Absolutely amazing book. Kept me hooked and wondering what was going to happen with an absolutely bitter sweet ending. I'd love to see a second book carrying on from this! 5 stars." ~ Lauren H., NetGalley reviewer"This book has such an UNIQUE storyline... When I say I couldn't put this book down, I mean I really couldn't." ~ Kade G., NetGalley reviewer"Dystopia at its finest! It gave me “Brave New World” vibes (my all time favourite) which made “Maternal Instinct” a very enjoyable read for me." ~ Bettina M., NetGalley reviewer
