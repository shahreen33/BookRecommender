Glenn Beck has entertained, inspired, and informed millions with his self-effacing humor, heartfelt conviction, and down-to-earth approach to life. And in The Real America, a powerful collection of his early writings, he calls it as he sees it, cutting through the fog of those who have made it their mission to underestimate -- and undermine -- the greatness of America and the power of "We the People." Whether the topic is family, religion, personal responsibility, rampant political correctness, presidential elections, or out-of-control celebrities, Glenn Beck rails against the forces that keep us from uniting and fulfilling our potential and explains how to overcome them. His compelling, patriotic, and spiritually driven message will inspire you to connect with your own power and help lead us back to that place that is quickly being forgotten...THE REAL AMERICA.
