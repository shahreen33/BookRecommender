Two lonely hearts.Just once, she'd like to be someone's first choice.She's strong-willed and spunky, but she's left picking up the pieces from her ex's lies and manipulations, and daydreaming about taking a scalpel to his scrotum. Flying under the radar is what he does best.He's laid-back and loyal, but he wants the most off-limits woman in his world, and nothing will ever make that a reality. An arrangement of mutual benefit.Two months, four dates.Five, if things go well.Five at the most.But possibly six.Definitely no more than six dates.Only the appearance of a romantic relationship is required, and they expect nothing more from their time together. There will be none of those benefits involved. One wild weekend.After waking up in bed together—very naked and even more hungover—the terms and conditions of their arrangement no longer apply. Now they're faced with something riskier than exposing their fake relationship: letting go of the past and zipping up the future. Some things have to fall apart before they can be put back together.
