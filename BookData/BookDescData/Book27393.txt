As Emily and Oliver Young head home from a party on a cold winter night, they have no idea that someone, perhaps something, is waiting for them in the darkness. When a strange man in a fedora steps in front of their car, what begins as an innocent accident becomes a crime, a hit-and-run that will forever change their lives and shatter the world they believe existed. It's midnight again in America. The country is divided, the planet is in turmoil. Hatred, distrust and anger run rampant. Fear--both manufactured and real--is a disease, and it's spreading. Now, that fear, that god of horror and mayhem, has taken shape. And no one is immune.
