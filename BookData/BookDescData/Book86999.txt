The first novella of The Unholy Trinity series.Katie doesn't know what she is. All she knows that touching people drains the life out of them, and that she has some sort of mystical charm where she can influence people around her.She gets by as a performer in Las Vegas, until one day she finds herself staring at the business end of a crossbow. Then, when a dangerous felon comes to her aid, her life will never be the same...Excerpt:"Ah, there you are. You've been such a challenge to find, it's hard to believe we've finally caught you."The man that stood over me wasn't the same one that fired the crossbow. This one was shorter, with light skin and hair. And his smile was different. Whereas the man that shot the crossbow at me had a grin that looked more like a smile of success, this man's smile was malicious."You sure are a beautiful one... tell me, what are you willing to do to save your life?" He passed his weapon to his other hand, and reached down toward me with a gloved hand. And I thought I was a monster.At least I wasn't going to feel the least bit bad about what I was going to do."Whatever it takes," I said as I grabbed his forearm. I shot forward, wrapped my other hand around his head, and kissed him.He resisted, but just for a moment. My hand made a fist in his hair, holding his mouth to mine. As scared as I had been, it was replaced by a rush of energy flowing into me. I felt stronger, more confident, like I could take on these men chasing me, and more beyond that. It had been so long since I even touched someone else, for a moment I completely forgot I was in danger.Then the man collapsed at my feet, not moving. I had a fleeting thought that I should see if he was still alive. But then I remembered that he had wanted to kill me, and that he had more friends out there. I needed to run.
