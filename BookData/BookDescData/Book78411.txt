Librarian's note: Alternate cover edition of ASIN B00UZSTI28.Piper Skye is rock ‘n’ roll. She’s party all night, sleep all day. She’s get wild and be free. Or she would be if she had the time. And the energy. And not being so awkward would probably help, too. As the owner of a thriving dessert business, Piper spends her days at school and her nights elbow deep in batter and frosting. She’s confident her hard work and sacrifice will pay off as long as she stays focused and sticks to the plan. Jake Hyde is a workaholic with a jaded outlook on life. Surrounding himself with employees he considers his brothers, he long ago made the decision that his custom garage would be his focus. Fate, as it often does, has other ideas. Plus, a killer sense of humor. Thrown together by coincidence, the gruff mechanic and the sweet as sin baker have instant sparks. Suddenly, all of their carefully made plans have taken a giant freakin’ left turn. And they do it on the back of a Harley. *Warning: This book is intended for adults.
