Herbie is a little hedgehog who is perfectly happy at home with his mother. But one day Mommy tells Herbie that it's time to go exploring--all by himself! Herbie is so not sure, but ready or not, a westerly wind sweeps Herbie into the wide world ... and Herbie's Big Adventure begins! Little Herbie finds that he's braver than he thinks and even makes a friend before coming safely back home to Mommy.
