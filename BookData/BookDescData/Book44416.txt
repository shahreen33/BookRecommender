**Note: This is not a standalone or a novel. It’s the previously unpublished epilogue (which I extended :-) ) to "Sincerely, Carter", and the easiest way I could make sure as many readers as possible have it since I normally post things like this on my blog. (And it's FREE!) :-) PS—Yes, I will still post this on my blog. :-)   Just friends. We’re just friends. No, wait. We’re no longer just best friends…
