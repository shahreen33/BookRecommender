These are the dangerous people, the residents who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple. They are given the very thing they profess to want: They are allowed outside.This collection includes over 20 pages of bonus material: Jimmy Broxton’s sketchbook, variant covers by Darwyn Cooke, and more!This book was initially released in episodes as a Kindle Serial.
