I have it all—money, fame, women. But one viral video is about to change everything.  Baseball is my life. My fans love my temper on the field, but when a video of me shoving a cop hits the internet, I’m labeled as just another out of control athlete. It doesn't matter that the officer was a sleaze with wandering hands. My career is on the line.  My publicist thinks a fairytale romance might salvage my image. And he’s found the perfect woman—a sweet brunette who runs a shelter for families in need. She's willing to pose as my girlfriend for a sizable donation to her charity.  I may be fighting for my job, but after one kiss, I realize she’s the real prize.
