Spiralizing isn't just about noodles anymore, so blogger Ali Maffucci satisfies paleo, vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free diets with 125 healthy recipes for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. "Ali continues her genius spiralizing but adds in a number of other ways to approach vegetables, to make it easy to get your five (or more!) a day." --MindBodyGreenFor the first time, Ali Maffucci, founder of the healthy culinary brand Inspiralized, is going beyond expectations--and beyond spiralizing. In this book she shows you a myriad of additional ways to add nutrients to your diet, reach a personal health goal, or just make good-for-you meals at home. Sweet potato slabs replace toast, cauliflower becomes pizza crust, broccoli turns into tots, avocado gets moussed, jackfruit mimics pulled meat--and that's just the beginning. Among the brand-new recipes, complete with nutritional information, you'll find Rainbow Lasagna, Apple French Toast, and Cauliflower Steaks with Chimichurri. Rest assured, Ali still offers up some favorite spiralized dishes, too. Get ready to get your veggies on.
