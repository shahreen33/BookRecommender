There is a way that seems right unto a person, but the way thereof is the way of death. It is the 1960's. Above the rich Native American city of NuSprings, Missouri, the sky is turning dark with a deadly storm brewing on the horizon. Suicide Affair is a multi-book story of how lives crisscross and intertwine. Some affairs, no matter how exciting or appealing, are suicidal when pursued. Dark, intriguing, and sometimes chilling, Dark Skies pulls you down a path you would never wish to go: Rita, a child lost on the path, wanders a dark stormy world of loneliness and survival. Her worst fear is not being raised by the monster who murdered her mother, but the shadows that threaten to eat her soul. Garth, a boy with a good soul, is pushed onto the path and pulled into its darkness through revenge and murder. RiverDawg, an aging witch doctor, plays on the path and toys with those who venture down it. People are his entertainment. Quillpen Jack, a Native American boy hoping one day to become a great warrior, discovers the path is not only dark, but deadly. Will he survive? Will any of them survive the coming storm?
