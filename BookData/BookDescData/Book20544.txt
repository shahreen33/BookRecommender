I have loved my best friend for eleven years.Eleven years of celebrations.Eleven years of victories and losses.Eleven years of inside jokes and shared smiles.Eleven years of helping him raise his daughter as a single father.He smiles at me and my world brightens.He ignores me and I forget how to function.He holds my hand and takes more of my heart.He leaves and time stops.We have both lost too much, but am I willing to risk the effects of falling again?
