Meet Jenny. She's rich, spoiled, rude and obnoxious. She's also just been signed up for the BDSM ride of her life - without her consent.

Which Master or Mistress do you turn to for rescue? And what do you do if you suspect you might actually be enjoying yourself?This is Jenny's adventure into the world of BDSM and pony play. She's about to find out just how much effort it takes to become a pony girl and that she has no choice but to excel in every aspect of her training or she may never stand a chance of being released from her bondage.Book One features Jenny's abrupt induction, where she finds herself being stripped naked, medically examined and intimately measured for her new uniform - as a pony girl.
