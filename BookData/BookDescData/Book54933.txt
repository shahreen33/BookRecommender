The Acquisition has ruled my life, ruled my every waking moment since Sinclair Vinemont first showed up at my house offering an infernal bargain to save my father’s life. Now I know the stakes. The charade is at an end, and Sinclair has far more to lose than I ever did. But this knowledge hasn’t strengthened me. Instead, each revelation breaks me down until nothing is left but my fight and my rage. As I struggle to survive, only one question remains. How far will I go to save those I love and burn the Acquisition to the ground? Full disclosure: This book is a DARK romance with elements of BDSM, slavery, violence, and super-hot sex. It is the last of the Acquisition trilogy, no cliffhanger. If you're good with these caveats, enjoy!
