Opposites don't just attract... sometimes they BOOM!Valerie DawsonAll I've ever wanted is to make my father proud. All he ever wanted was sons. I've never felt like I was enough… then everything changes when I'm assigned to audit the Broken Eagle's Motorcycle Shop and meet Rowan Pryor for the first time. The minute his eyes lock on mine, I know this gorgeous man is trouble. He's looking at me as if I'm his everything, his eyes telling me he's thinking of a thousand ways to get me dirty. And I like it. But I have plans for myself and none of them include some hot, motorcycle guy in a small town.Rowan PryorI traded a broken past for a brotherhood I could count on. War changes people, bonds them together, so when our time in the Navy is served, I join my fellow SEALS in Nashville to help start up a motorcycle repair shop. A big city guy like me is enjoying a distraction free small town life. But then Valerie Dawson walks into the shop, wearing those nerdy glasses like it's her mission to steal my breath away and I know I’m in dangerous territory. She makes me feel things I never thought I could feel and I am determined to make her mine.I didn't believe in love at first sight... Until Valerie.
