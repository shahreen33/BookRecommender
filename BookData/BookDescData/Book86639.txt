The first cookbook from top keto expert, Jennifer Marie Garza of Keto Friendly Recipes and Low Carb Inspirations on Facebook Jennifer Marie Garza spent years struggling with her weight and trying every diet out there without success. Finally she tried out the keto lifestyle and lost an incredible 55 pounds—and kept them off. She knew she wouldn’t continue to succeed without delicious food to make at home, so she started creating recipes of her own. The results turned out so well that she made it her life’s mission to share her creations with others who struggle like she did, and now her Keto Friendly Recipes Facebook page and Low Carb Inspirations (plus Keto Friendly Recipes) Facebook group have hundreds of thousands of devoted followers. It’s easy to understand why with healthy and tasty recipes like Fluffy Keto Waffles, Pull-Apart Pizza Bread, Amazing Keto Lasagna, Creamy Tuscan Chicken, Three-Ingredient Peanut Butter Cookies, and more. For anyone new to the keto lifestyle who needs to learn the basics, Jennifer Marie explains the types of ketones, macronutrients, and the benefits of intermittent fasting. Also included are lists and charts of what to eat and what to avoid, a guide to special ingredients like keto-approved sweeteners and alternative flours, a list of essential kitchen tools, and even helpful advice for traveling and dining out while on the keto diet.
