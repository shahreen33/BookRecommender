Talon Reed was filthy.His mouth was filthy. The way he f*cked was filthy. He was a dirty boy, and I wanted him. Every. Single. Long. Inch. That was until I found out my mom was marrying his father and he would be my new stepbrother. See that was a line I didn't cross. Or so I thought. Turns out I wanted Talon just as much as he wanted me, and maybe that was the problem from the start.
