Laurence Olivier was a true legend. No classical actor had ever been such a dazzling star. No star had been such a magnificent actor. In this marvellous autobiography Laurence Olivier tells his own story: his brilliant career as actor, director, film-maker and producer; his role as husband to three women including Vivien Leigh and Joan Plowright; and his many friendships - with Sir Ralph Richardson, Noel Coward and Sir Winston Churchill, to name just a few. Confessions of an Actor is more than just a memoir. It is a deeply felt testament by one of the most astonishingly gifted artists of all time.
