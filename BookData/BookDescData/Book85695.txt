I’ve spent a lot of years as a hit-it-and-quit-it player only seeking a good time. As Vice President of the Lost Kings Motorcycle Club, willing women are never in short supply. I never needed any of them for more than one night. Until I met her. My perfect woman. Like a damn mermaid, she was beautiful, smart, sexy, and slippery as fuck. I thought I’d convinced her we’d be good together long-term, but then she disappeared without a word. Two years. That’s how long it’s been since I saw her. Just as I finally moved on, my mythical woman resurfaces. She forgot to mention one little thing before she vanished. One small secret growing up into a big lie. It’s a betrayal too big to overcome. I should hate her. Even though she’s heartbreak wrapped in a seductive package. I want her more than ever.
