 Poison, pits, and murder… the village vegetable competition is heating up!  Merryfield’s reigning vegetable-growing champion is found dead on his allotment.  The police think it was an accident caused by the champion’s advancing age.  Diana Flowers, his allotment next door neighbour, isn’t convinced.  She knows someone has poisoned the dead man’s prized pumpkin plant.  And if the dead man dug the pit in which he met his doom, where did he leave the spade?  A scientist like Diana knows you should never underestimate evidence… and in this case, she thinks the evidence points to murder.
