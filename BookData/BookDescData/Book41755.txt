-Santa Claws (originally published in 
  Naughty or Nice
 anthology)-Monster Love-There's No Such Thing as Werewolves (originally published in 
  Lighthearted Lust: Three Not So Serious Tales
 anthology)-A Fiend in NeedThe queen of comic, erotic, other-species romance brings her best setups and hottest sex scenes to this four-novella party. Three of them feature the bad Wyndham werewolves, who find unanticipated love with often reluctant earthlings. In "Santa Claws," Alec Kilcurt, the most powerful werewolf in Europe, falls for Santa-clad Giselle Smith and wins her over with lots of oral sex and a heavy Scottish accent. In "Monster Love," bad-tempered Janet Lupo is kidnapped by a sexy werewolf. Then there's the story of Doctor Drake Dragon and his unusual encounter with Crescent. Finally, following the events of Undead and Unreturnable, a psychic werewolf, Antonia Wolfton, receives a vision to show up at Queen Betsy's Minneapolis home to help and falls hard for George, the fiend in the basement. It's all pure Davidson fun. Ginger Curwen
