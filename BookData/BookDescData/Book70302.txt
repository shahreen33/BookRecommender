We asked authors to select just one paragraph from their book &amp; explain why they think it’s the best they’ve written. The result? “Authors’ Best”: A different way to discover new writing. This is the inaugural edition of Authors' Best featuring nine authors &amp; one poet. The free e-book is available in PDF &amp; EPUB formats (the files have been hosted on Box.com and can be downloaded without creating an account):https://purl.org/authorsbest/edition/...https://purl.org/authorsbest/edition/...Since most browsers can open EPUB files, you only need to double click the file after downloading. However, for the best reading experience use an e-book application - this one is for free: https://calibre-ebook.com/Your feedback is important and can be mailed to AnAuthorsBest@gmail.com or posted to our social media handles:https://twitter.com/authorsbesthttps://www.facebook.com/authors.best.5https://www.instagram.com/authorsbest/https://www.reddit.com/user/authorsbest
