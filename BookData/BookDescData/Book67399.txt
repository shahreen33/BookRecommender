Maisy Parker isn’t asking for a lot in life. Just good friends, good fun, and finally reaching one hundred thousand followers on Instagram.  She’s well on her way to all of that, until one drunken dare ends up with a cut hand, blood sacrifices, and a thousand-year-old prison opening to reveal a giant of a man.  Finding herself with a Titan of a problem, she does the only thing that makes sense in that situation: selfie. Because he’s beyond hot, and that has got to be worth twenty thousand followers.  Only it turns out, this is no joke.  Cronus is really a Titan, and he’s set out to destroy the leader of the Greek pantheon.  When Maisy makes a colossal mistake, unleashing an untold evil on the world, Cronus is the only one that can help her. #oops  Maisy is starting to see that she should have been less interested in Instagram and more interested in the impending end of the world.  An end she quite possibly caused—not that she’s admitting to anything just yet.
