Casey Snow is grounded for life... or at least until she leaves for college. After driving her car into the side of her parents’ garage, Casey is stuck filing papers in her mom’s office during the day, and confined to her house on the weekends. Worst of all, she’s not allowed to see her favorite band, Moving Neutral—whose lead guitarist, Blake Parker, just might be the love of Casey’s life.But with her best friend’s help, Casey comes up with a plan to sneak out of her house for the concert. And as she’s standing in line at a coffee shop near the show, everything changes. Because behind her is Blake Parker, ready to sweep her away for the best summer of her life.
