When U.S. Marine Corp Sgt. Orion MacKinnon loses both his legs in the bloody sands of Afghanistan, he forsakes his soul along with them. After retiring to a remote location in the snowy mountains of Alaska with his Special Forces canine companion—a German Shepherd named Zeus—he becomes a recluse and vows never to wear the prosthetic legs he keeps buried out of sight… until a lone hiker becomes trapped beneath an avalanche on his mountain.  The woman Orion calls Hope can’t recall a shred of her former life. As he tends to her wounds she slowly begins to unravel the tight seclusion he has wrapped around himself.  She can’t remember her past. He only wants to forget his.  However, the two have more in common with the forces that brought them together than they realize, including the sinister presence that will threaten their very lives.   When their pasts collide, will they survive the future?
