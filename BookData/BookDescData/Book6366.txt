The Brown house isn’t a house you want to mess with. It’s that place where you and your friends go on a dare, but no one is brave enough to go inside, and if they do, they come out screaming. So when Brylee Branson and her family move in, it's not long before the evil things lurking in corners come out to play. Brylee just wants to acclimate to her new school but the ghosts in the house don’t make that easy. You see Brylee has a gift, one that the dead need and if she can’t help them they’ll make her friends pay with their lives.
