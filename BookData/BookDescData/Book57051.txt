 In this screwball comedy, Haruhi, a poor girl at a rich kids' school, is forced to repay an $80,000 debt by working for the school's swankiest, all-male club--as a boy! Then she discovers just how wealthy the six members are an how different the rich are from everybody else. Hikaru has asked Haruhi to go out with him, but he doesn't want her answer right away. Yet at the same time, he's trying to get Tamaki to realize he's in love with Haruhi too. Is the Host Club prepared for a love triangle among its members?
