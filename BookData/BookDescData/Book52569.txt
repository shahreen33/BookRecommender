Jack I'm driving along when I see a woman sitting in a puddle on the side of the road. I stop to help her and instantly need to have her. Our chemistry is explosive, quite literally. It seems we are going to have to repair a few things. She's feisty and sexy as hell, but I keep screwing it up. Harper This day couldn't get any worse. All that's left is for lightning to strike me. And then it does, in the form of sexy mechanic, Jack. If I could keep my wits about me, I might survive him, but I seem to have verbal diarrhea around him. He brings excitement into my life and sex to my books.
