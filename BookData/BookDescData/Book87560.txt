When Sam Chaplin runs into financial difficulties, a generous, yet strange offer from wealthy businessman and suspected IRA member, Morris O'Hara seems a Godsend. The Irishman's business is suffering after he accidentally kills a young girl in a road accident, so he dreams up a scheme which will hopefully win back the support of the public. A promise of a bonus for recruiting three penniless, heroic subjects to each receive one million pounds, is not enough reward for Chaplin. Together with his brother in law and journalist friend, they devise an elaborate and ingenious plot to steal the money. What the trio did not count on was the desperation of O'Hara's ex-IRA hoods and Pakistan terror organisation Sipah-e-Sahaba, who aim to retrieve the money. Blood Money is an intricate and thrilling story, which will take you on a breathtaking journey to places such as London, Belfast, Jakarta, Islamabad, Athens, Florida, New York and Wales. A guaranteed page turner, not to be missed.
