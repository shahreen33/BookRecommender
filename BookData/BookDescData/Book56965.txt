Travel through time in this sword-clashing adventure over a hundred years from the 1860s leading up to the beginning of the first movie. In the thirty years since its release, Highlander has inspired a cult following and numerous spinoffs with its epic clashes between powerful immortals. Now, The American Dream follows Scottish swordsman Connor MacLeod as he navigates through the American Civil War and 1950s Manhattan toward The Gathering in 1986. Reunite with familiar faces, such as Connor's secretary Rachel, and meet new immortals, such as Osta Vazilek, but remember... There can be only one!
