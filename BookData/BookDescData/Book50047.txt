And she reeeaally didn’t mean to almost burn down his house. Now she needs a good lawyer, stat. But where to find one?Ethan Vaughn is a very busy man.

As the most sought after lawyer in professional football, he should be focused on representing his NFL clients––not an accident-prone, struggling actress.Now she’s remanded on bail, and living in his house. The woman is a walking talking disaster. And considering his track record, he needs to stay as far away from this one as possible. Problem is, he’s finally met the one he’s willing to risk it all for.Take one outspoken actress, put her under the same roof with an overworked lawyer, and watch the slow burn bring down the house.
