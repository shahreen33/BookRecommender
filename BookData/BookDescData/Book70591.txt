Two rough twin mountain men. One princess on the run. She thinks she can’t have babies. But *baby* are we gonna prove her wrong.When our enemies conspired to murder our father, take our company, and set us up for the crimes, running to the woods of Blackthorn Mountain was the only option we had.We thought we’d left everything good and beautiful in the world behind. That is, until she tumbles into our arms. Gorgeous, whip-smart, and a mouth as fiery as that red hair. Catching her skinny-dipping in our lake lights the spark.…Laying our hands on her sets the whole thing on fire.Life in the woods has turned us into the hardened rough mountain men we are today. She should stay away – from us, and from the dark past that looms over our shoulders. But one taste of her sweet lips, and one of her breathless moans in our ears, and we both know we’re never going to let her out of her hands.We share everything, and we’ve always sworn that nothing will get between us. But then, Stella between us might just be exactly what saves us.With the shadow of our past still hunting us down, and the demons from hers still looming, this whole thing could blow up in our face. But we’ll be damned if that keeps her away from us.She thinks she can’t have a family. We’ve always wanted one. The odds are against us, but then, three is a crowd…  Wild, out of control, over the top, and completely ridiculous. If you love your growly alpha cavemen heroes in twos, you're going to see double with these twins. Safe, no cheating, and a HEA guaranteed.
