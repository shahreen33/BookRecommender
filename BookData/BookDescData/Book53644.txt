I should have told her everything.How much I loved her. How much I’ve always loved her. But I didn’t. I couldn’t. I just wasn’t made that way.Instead... I claimed her. Teased her.Taunted her.Worshipped her.Until... I broke her.My best friend. My savior. My girl.From my mind to my heart, to every single bone in my body. She owned me. I was hers.Every look. Every kiss. Every touch. Every tear.It was always her.The only thing I feared more than losing her was forgetting her.I hated how much I needed her.She was mine. Always and forever.I hated her then.But Harley Jameson was about to find out how much…I LOVED her now.
