 
  Observation is just the first step.  Then comes the action.  And these actions will speak louder than any words.
  Someone is watching. Scrutinizing every flip of the hair, change of expression, and spoken word. How long until they come for you?  For Cooper Chain and Willow Ball, it was a normal weekday morning. Until the moment Cooper opens the back door and...  Was it just an accident? Or is an invisible force trying to eliminate Ball &amp; Chain off the face of the Earth?  Unable to let go of the memory of her father, Willow takes the lure of learning more information. But a meeting goes horribly wrong, and death is knocking on her door.  Sucked into a vortex of bizarre, deathly events, Willow and Cooper struggle to fight off a never-ending series of attacks. They take one step, but someone else is always a step ahead. How can they defeat what they cannot see?  But when the gauntlet is thrown down, survival takes on a whole new meaning. And that's when Willow and Cooper come face-to-face with a force that could bury them for good.  How many shapes can evil take?
