His eyes emit an unearthly glow when he is near her, and he possesses strength and power beyond any mortal being. He's not human. That much is clear. Here's the catch, though: Dessa isn't human, either.When the ghosts of her tainted past return with a thirst for vengeance, Dessa must decide what is really worth fighting for. She must choose between saving herself and saving those she cares about. But when the enemy you are fighting is yourself, how are you supposed to win?
