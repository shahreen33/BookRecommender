Mr. Putter and his fine cat, Tabby, are itchy. Not because of fleas, but because it is hot, they're bored, and they're out of orangesicles. So when their neighbor, Mrs. Teaberry, suggests a sightseeing cruise, they're excited about an adventure. The boat makes them feel free! Plus they get orangesicles! But when it's time to go home, there's a little problem with Mrs. Teaberry's good dog, Zeke. The nineteenth Mr. Putter &amp; Tabby book has all the sly, sweet humor that has made the series a huge success. Cynthia Rylant's perfect ear for rhythm and Arthur Howard's comical illustrations continue to bring to life the quartet of characters readers know and love.
