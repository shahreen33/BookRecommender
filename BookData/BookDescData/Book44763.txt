Harlan Ellison's classic postapocalyptic saga of Vic, a boy, Blood, his dog, and the telepathic union that binds them together in a struggle for survival. The cycle begins with "Eggsucker", which chronicles the early years of the association between fourteen-year-old loner Vic and his brilliant, telepathic dog. The saga continues and expands in A Boy and His Dog, in which Blood shows just how much smarter he is than Vic, and Vic shows how loyal he can be. The story continues in "Run, Spot, Run", the first part of Ellison's promised novel of the cycle, Blood's a Rover. Here Vic and Blood find surprising new ways to get into trouble but getting out of it may be beyond even their combined talents.
