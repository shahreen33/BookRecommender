Lord Vincent Prescot’s life couldn’t be better. Thriving investments, well-respected by his peers, and a man who submits to his every desire—what more could he want?  Lord Oliver Marsden should be more than happy with his life. He’s been in love with Vincent for over a decade and six months ago the impossible happened and they became lovers. But since then, nothing has changed. More specifically, Vincent hasn’t changed. Oliver has tried to be patient—it took a lot for Vincent to accept the fact he preferred men. But what felt like a tiny distance between them six months ago now feels like an ever-widening chasm.  Then Vincent’s father asks him for a favor—one that involves marriage. If Vincent agrees, he’ll have the respect he’s craved from his father his entire life but he could lose Oliver. Nor does Oliver make the decision easy. To keep Oliver, Vincent must do more than deny his father. He’ll have to give Oliver his heart.  Note: This is a previously published work. This second edition has been edited with minor changes.
