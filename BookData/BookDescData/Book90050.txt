 
  The city doesn't need another hero. It needs a monster.  
  
 Aris has lived beneath the streets all his life as a growing evil overtook the city he loved. He’s watched the people suffer, smelled their fear, and heard their cries for mercy. All while they lived under the control of the ruthless man who murdered his parents.  But the time has come for Aris to rise from the darkness. He’s trained his whole life for this moment and, unlike the justice system, he will not fail the people of Coast City, or the woman he fell in love with as a child, the woman who believes him dead.  But no one told him that sometimes heroes aren’t enough. Sometimes people need a monster. .
