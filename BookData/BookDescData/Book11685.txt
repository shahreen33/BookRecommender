The book talks about the spirit of the Laughing Buddha which is a state of ultimate relaxation, happiness and contentment. Sakshi Chetana brings in this book the rare combination of ancient Buddhist wisdom and its practical use in our daily lives in the modern world for living in joy. Buddha has had an immeasurable influence on the human race. The Laughing Buddha is a practical aspect of the Buddha, who, after enlightenment, showed us the way to a euphoric living right in the middle of our daily chores and responsibilities. In other words, Sakshi has brilliantly introduced the wisdom of Buddhism for ecstatic living in a market-place. This book wonderfully explores the legends and lessons from the life of Laughing Buddha, whose spirit we can imbibe for a delightful living. Lucidly and beautifully written, the â€œLaughing Buddha" contains the wisest spirit of Buddhism in a readily understandable and accessible form, often in a question-answer format, for even those, who are new to Buddhism. The book is an enjoyable read for everyone who aspires to live a joyful and meaningful life.
