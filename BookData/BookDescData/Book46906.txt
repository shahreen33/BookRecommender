In the aftermath of dying and being resurrected, Xena travels to Egypt for some much needed R&amp;R. But a run-in with slave traders and the rescue of a young girl in chains leaves little room for rest as Xena discovers the girl is Egyptian royalty and the center of a plot involving none other than Cleopatra -- and Set, the Egyptian god of evil! Xena must stop the blood sacrifice that will bring the fearsome Set into this world, but she'll have to cut her way through the Egyptian priesthood and the Roman Army to get the job done!
