First Published 1 July 2017 KATHERINE The day Antonio walked into my Café I knew things were about to change. He had this presence about him, and I could see shadows in his eyes of things I could never understand. But he was like a force of nature, taking what he wanted, when he wanted. He was big, strong, and had eyes the color of the finest chocolate. Everything he made me feel, scared the hell out of me. When he opened his mouth, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to slap him or kiss him, he made every nerve in my body come alive. But, I have a secret. I didn’t want to let him go but its better this way. I have let enough people down in my life so, I tried to distance myself, and push him away. I never thought I could love, or trust, any man after my father left, but Antonio was here to prove me wrong, and he wasn’t going to back down. Kitten: Antonio was determined to take me to my knees and crack me wide open.  ANTONIO Katherine was the kind of woman you could only ever dream up in your wildest fantasies. A woman who oozed sex kitten with every sway of her hips, and she had the attitude to go with it. With hair like fire, and eyes as blue as the sky on a clear summer’s day, that body of hers I swear had a direct line to my cock. Then, she pushed me away, but I don’t go down that easy. I didn’t get to where I am today without fighting tooth and nail for it. Katherine was mine and no matter how long it took me, I was going to make her see she belonged to me, just like I already belonged to her. I know she is hiding something, I can see it in her eyes every time she looks at me. I don’t care what I have to do, or how long it takes, I will find out what it is. My kitten isn’t the only one with secrets. Antonio: Katherine brought me to my knees, and I was going to take her down with me.
