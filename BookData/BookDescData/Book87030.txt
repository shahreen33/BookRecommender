Maris left the Cliffwater Clan of wolf shifters as soon as she was able, and has lived among humans ever since. Why bother staying around when her own clan is ashamed of her? To them, she's a broken omega: she's never gone into heat, and what good is an omega who can't mate and bear pups for the shifter nation?  When her clan orders her attendance as the shifters prepare to crown their new king, Maris goes with a heart full of reluctance and a deep feeling of unease.  But wait... That's not unease. That's her heat coming on, several years too late. Or, as she's coming to find out, right as she meets Ember, King Zehr's general and an alpha lioness beyond Maris's wildest dreams... maybe it's just in time. Because Maris isn't broken. Her body and her soul have just been waiting for a female alpha all along.  Alpha and Omega is a novella series. The first installment is A Mate for the King by Rebel Carter. The Lioness Claims a Mate is the sequel, and features the lesbian shifter couple you never knew you needed, and more of the wolf king and his new queen you've been waiting for...
