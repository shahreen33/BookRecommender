Kauffman writes smart and sexy, with sizzle to spare!--Janet Evanovich. Now the "USA Today"-bestselling author of "Catch Me If You Can" takes readers for a fun ride, with a gorgeous pilot who knows how to leave any woman breathless.Jake McKenna fixes planes, not people. Compared to an engine, humans are high-maintenance and unpredictable - which is why Jake has zero interest in indulging his sister's request that he play tour guide and rent-a-date to her boss' visiting stepdaughter.

Everything about sexy, enigmatic pilot Jake tempts Lauren to unleash her inner bad girl and let him take her places she's never been...even as her snooping around town provokes some extremely hostile reactions. At this altitude, losing your head is easy. Trusting your heart can cost you everything...
