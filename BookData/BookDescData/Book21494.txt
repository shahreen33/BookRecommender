The book is about a small town boy who learns the value of friendship. A medieval, Italian town named Roseto serves as the backdrop. The beautiful and colourful illustrations – all done in paper collage style – depict different parts of the town and journey. Although, the story unfolds in a different time and place, the message is universal and timeless.Available on Amazon and iTunes (iBooks store)Printed version of the book sold on Mary's website: m.f.publishing.com
