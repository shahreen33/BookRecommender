"A cozy little mystery that . . . soon draws the reader into Madison's mid-century modern fantasy world of fashion, movies, friendship, loyalty, and violence" (New York Journal of Books). Interior decorator Madison Night might look like a throwback to the sixties, but as business owner and landlord, she proves that independent women can have it all. But when a killer targets women dressed in Madison's signature style--estate sale vintage to play up her resemblance to fave actress Doris Day--what makes her unique might make her dead. The local detective connects the new crime to a twenty-year-old cold case, and Madison's long-trusted contractor emerges as the leading suspect. As the body count piles up, Madison uncovers a Soviet spy, a campaign to destroy all Doris Day movies, and six minutes of film that will change her life forever. "If you are looking for an unconventional mystery with a snarky, no-nonsense main character, this is it . . . Instead of clashing, humor and danger meld perfectly, and there is a cliffhanger that will make your jaw drop." --RT Book Reviews
