Aston LockeWhispers of the Locke brothers fill the town, facts and reality twisted to fit what these motherfuckers believe they know about us.That we’re sadistic bastards, incapable of any real emotions or fear.Maybe they’re not wrong about that.That is, until I set my sights on Kadence King, getting just as drawn to her as I am the darkness. It’s the first time I’ve felt anything in a long time. But would she really be scared knowing the depth, the lengths I go with my brothers to make any fucker who crosses us pay? I need a woman who can accept me for who I am.For what I am.I’m hoping like hell it’s her, because I want nothing more than to claim her as mine…Kadence KingI know Aston’s dangerous, know people fear him. But I want him. I’m drawn to him, just as he’s drawn to the darkness.I should be afraid of him, should turn the other way, but I can’t. I’ve gone mad and let him in my room, in my life, allowing him to consume me. He possesses me, dominates me. Aston Locke shows me what it means to want to be claimed by him and only him.And when he tells me I’M HIS, I have no doubt that’s the truth.Because in the end it’s what I want too.No matter how dangerous he is…
