Murder and revenge in the Deep South.  In a city called "Winnersville" there are bound to be losers. In 1980, the carnival came and lost one of their own--the carnival owner's 12-year-old daughter--her body found at the carnival's ticket gate, brutally murdered. The killer never discovered. Her father vowed to return one day and avenge his daughter's death. Thirty-five years later a mysterious stranger buys the old Daniel Ashley Hotel and for some of the citizens of "Winnersville" things will never be the same.
