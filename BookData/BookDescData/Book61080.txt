From USA Today Bestselling Author Kat Cantrell (writing as K. Cantrell) -- All three books in the Olympia Alien Mail Order Bride series: Eros, Ares and Ajax together in one set!  Looking for Love on all the Wrong Planets  Eros Penelope Boswell needs a fake boyfriend to save her from her meddling family. But when the Intergalactic Dating Agency matches her with a sexy alien willing to play pretend in exchange for her help assimilating to Earth culture, she gets way more than she bargained for: Eros is seductive, pushy and has no intention of faking anything, least of all their relationship…  Ares Clementine Daily has struck out so many times in the dating game that she’s had to move on to another species. When the Intergalactic Dating Agency matches her to a Torvian who needs a marriage of convenience to stay on Earth, she’s happy to help—who wouldn’t love a sexy alien as a reward? Except her new husband is scarred by secrets from the past and wants nothing to do with love or romance, and Clem's seduction strategy suddenly needs a whole new game plan.  Ajax When Brooklyn Carter flees from an abusive ex, a friend suggests the perfect bodyguard—an honest-to-goodness alien. Ajax is built like a tank, willing to do the job in exchange for a green card marriage, and best of all, he can't and won't touch her. His genetic modifications give him super strength, which means he carefully avoids all contact with fragile humans. But once they start spending time together, Brooklyn begins to wonder what it would be like if he could touch her. Now all she can think about is exactly that… and how to trade safety for the courage to go after what she wants.
