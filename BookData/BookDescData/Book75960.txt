This is a short story prequel to The Best of Fools  The complete opposite of her parents, Jane doesn't like reading love stories and can't stand all things romance, but most especially she hates her name. "No, not that Jane Austen," she's said so many times to so many teachers, friends, and strangers, while lamenting the fact that her parents named her after one of their favorite authors, the very author who sparked their own love story.  Jane isn't looking for a love story, and on the eve of her 18th birthday she happily considers changing her name and finally steering her life away from the self-imposed expectations that come with it, but ... she meets a charming British boy on his way back home and everything she's fought hard to control suddenly becomes irresistible.
