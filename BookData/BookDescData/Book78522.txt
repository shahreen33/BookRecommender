And You Can Love Me is a story for everyone who loves someone with ASD (autism spectrum disorder). It is the fictional story of Ethan, a nonverbal autistic child, based on the author's observations and experiences with her grandson. The bounce of a ball is not only a metaphor, but also how the author imagines that the child is releasing his innermost physical and emotional challenges. It is a love story that can be recognized by parents, caregivers and teachers; a story that embraces Ethan, a nonverbal child, who may never/or not yet be able to write his own story, yet he lives it every day and tells it by his actions and by bouncing a ball- any ball, any size, any color.And You Can Love Me is also a picture book that a child with ASD may, in some way, recognize within himself/herself. It doesn't try to explain, define or even educate; it is merely Ethan's story - the story of one particular nonverbal autistic child; one of the many stories that will add to the diversity of ASD stories.
