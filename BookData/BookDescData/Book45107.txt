If only he could stop fantasizing about the best two legs he’s ever seen. . . .   Brian and Veronica can’t help coming together. Again. And again. Suddenly, Veronica finds herself throwing all her best-laid plans out the window. Could she possibly have fallen in love with a man who’s wrong in every way—except the only one that matters?This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.
