I’ve never known what it’s like to have a dream that’s really mine. To live a life without fear. Being the niece of the most ruthless mob boss in Las Vegas has made any sort of freedom impossible.  Francesca Rossi has spent much of her life balancing the weight of running the family bakery with avoiding her uncle’s life of violence and corruption.  When Maddox Black forces his way into her life, sure of himself and of her, he’ll force her to see that there’s more to life than fear.  But when fear becomes reality, Maddox and Francesca will have to decide if their dreams are worth fighting for.  This is the story of Francesca and Maddox, the second installment in the Ride Series Second Generation.  Maddox can be read as a stand-alone, but it's recommended that you read the First Generation Ride series.  * Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.
