Nominated for Best Self-Published Novel in Booknest's Fantasy Book AwardsTomkin Thornhewn, youngest son of the Duke of Marshwell, has a problem: he’s not heroic.Regardless of his aspirations, the bookish, untrained young man is better suited to recording the deeds of heroes than being one himself. Which becomes an obvious problem when he finds himself clinging to a ledge above a sleeping dragon. And instead of wielding his family’s great sword with valor and skill, he drops it—onto the dragon.The problem grows immeasurably worse when Tomkin himself falls off the ledge—also onto the dragon.And his problem reaches its peak when Tomkin, after being captured, discovers a maiden locked in a tower. But this is no sweet damsel. Not only does she refuse to be rescued, she refuses to even admit she’s in distress.It’s too bad for the people of Marshwell that Tomkin is the only thing standing - or falling - in the dragon’s way.
