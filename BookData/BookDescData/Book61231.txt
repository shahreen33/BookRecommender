Written in Spanish, this introduction to Spanish linguistics covers the structure, history and dialects of the Spanish language. It is designed primarily as a textbook for students pursuing advanced studies in Spanish language and literature at North American institutions, either at the advanced undergraduate or at the beginning graduate level. Nevertheless, this book will also be useful to students in other instructional settings. Clear and accessible with exercises accompanying each chapter, the text will provide students with a solid foundation for pursuing further study in Spanish or general linguistics.
