What do you do with a generation who’ve had everything, but still can’t grow up?Perhaps this is you. Perhaps you still owe your student loan, and make jokes about how you’ll never pay it back, so it’s easy to ignore. We know. Perhaps you spend more than you earn. Perhaps you still live with your parents. We know. Perhaps those ignored bills and reminders have become threats and court summonses. We know, and we can help.Welcome to The Transition.While taking part in The Transition you and your partner will spend six months living under the supervision of your mentors, two successful adults of a slightly older generation. Freed from your financial responsibilities, you will be coached through the key areas of the scheme Employment, Nutrition, Responsibility, Relationship, Finances and Self-Respect until you are ready to be reintegrated into adult society.At the end of your six months who knows what discoveries you’ll have made about yourself? The friends’ you no longer need. The talents you’ll have found time to nurture. The business you might have kick-started.Who knows where you’ll be?
