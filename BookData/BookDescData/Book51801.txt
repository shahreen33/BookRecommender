Like daughter, like father.Over the past few months, Barbara Gordon has made some big changes to her Batgirl alter ego. She has a new look, new support team and new home base in Burnside, Gotham's trendiest neighborhood. But just when she's hitting her stride, her fahter drops a bombshell--Babs isn't the only masked crime-fighter in the family anymore. Jim Gordon is the new Batman. After the original Batman fell fighting the Joker, the former police commissioner was given a high-tech super-suit and asked to take up the mantle. With a team of GCPD officers watching his every move, Jim Gordon's new law-and-order Batman has zero tolerance for vigilantism. He's been ordered to arrest any unsanctioned superhero in Gotham--and Batgirl is next! Collecting: Batgirl 41-45, Annual 3, Sneak Peek
