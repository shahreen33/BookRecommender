A collection of the last complete unpublished short stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the iconic American writer of The Great Gatsby who is more widely read today than ever.What to Do About It is a collection of the last remaining unpublished and uncollected short stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald, edited by Anne Margaret Daniel. Some of these stories were submitted to major magazines and accepted for publication during Fitzgerald’s lifetime, but were never printed. Others are stories that could not be sold because their subject matter or style departed from what editors expected of Fitzgerald in the 1930s. Readers will experience Fitzgerald writing about controversial topics, depicting young men and women who actually spoke and thought more as young men and women did, without censorship. Rather than permit changes and sanitizing by his contemporary editors, Fitzgerald preferred to let his work remain unpublished, even at a time when he was in great need of money and review attention. “What to Do About It,” the collection’s title story, is drawn from Fitzgerald’s stays at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore when his health, and that of his wife Zelda, was beginning to fall apart, and his solution—what to do about it—was to keep writing. Most of the stories come from the 1930s, though the collection spans Fitzgerald’s career from 1920 to the end of his life. Written in his characteristically beautiful, sharp, and surprising language, exploring themes both familiar and fresh, these stories provide new insight into the bold and uncompromising arc of Fitzgerald’s career. What to Do About It is a revealing, intimate look at Fitzgerald’s creative process that shows him to be a writer working at the fore of modern literature—in all its developing complexities.
