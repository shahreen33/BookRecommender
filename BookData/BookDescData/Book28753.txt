Learning to read has never been more fun than it is with Ed and Fred! This hilarious beginner reader text has been carefully crafted to teach more than fifty first sight words—the simplest, most commonly used words young readers must learn to recognize “on sight.” The patterned structure makes the text accessible to beginners, while its humor is guaranteed to draw in even the most reluctant older readers.Readers who are fans of Fun with Ed and Fred can also brush up on their short vowels with Gran on a Fan and their long vowels with companion book Lazy Bear, Crazy Bear. As Kirkus Reviews said of Gran on a Fan: “New readers… will hardly be aware that they are supposed to be learning basic phonics because they will be giggling.”
