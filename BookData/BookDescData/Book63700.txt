As His people harvested their fields, they were instructed to always leave a portion of the crops for those in need.Today, God's heart continues to beat for the poor, the widows, and the fatherless. And as His children, our divine commission remains the same, a directive that's nothing less than the heart of the Christian message.Author Tom Davis encourages us to move beyond words and become Christ to those in need.
