This item includes all 4 issues of BLACK MARKET.WHY WE LOVE IT: Here at BOOM!, we’ve never shied away from exploring the dark crevices of the superhero genre. From Mark Waid’s IRREDEEMABLE to Mike Carey’s SUICIDE RISK, we love finding new ways to push the boundaries of our medium's favorite genre. WHY YOU’LL LOVE IT: BLACK MARKET mixes the visceral noir/pulp sensibilities of Frank J. Barbiere’s Five Ghosts and Victor Santos’ Filthy Rich with a truly modern take on superhero mythos. If you love Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips’ work on Sleeper like we do, this series is for you. WHAT’S IT ABOUT: Ray Willis is a broken man, a disgraced medical examiner making ends meet by preparing corpses at a funeral parlor. His scientific genius is being wasted—that is, until his estranged criminal brother Denny shows up on his doorstep, supposedly cleaned up and proposing a once-in-a-lifetime partnership to cure not just cancer, but all disease. The catch? It exists within the DNA of superheroes.
