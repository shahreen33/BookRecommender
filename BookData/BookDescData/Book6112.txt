Cold. Distant. Unattainable.  Reid Tate wasn’t always like this. He once cared for me. Made music with me. Gave his heart and soul to me.  But I ruined it.  The breathtaking boy I used to love is gone. In his place is a man who wants to rip my heart apart and lay my soul bare before thousands. He doesn’t care about the secret that will ruin me. His brand of retribution is destroying my band and ruining our future.  But I promised myself never to let Reid Tate steal my voice again.  Except that’s the problem when dancing with the devil. By the time the music starts it’s already too late.
