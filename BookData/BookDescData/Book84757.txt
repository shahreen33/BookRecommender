All Alex wants for Christmas is a little peace and quiet. After all the drama of her summer in Saratoga, she's been taking it easy around the farm, enjoying the horses (and baiting Alexander). But a phone call from a local charity changes all that.  When Alex meets Wendy, a young girl with a tragic past, she finds herself going to surprising lengths to brighten Wendy's life – and visiting some surprising places. A filly named Christmas, a horse-crazy kid, and a trainer who never thought much about holidays or children – Claiming Christmas celebrates the bond between horse and human, and between a trainer and student.  *In keeping with its racetrack theme, this book contains strong language.
