Being kidnapped into a bordello has a way of changing a woman's focus. On the day Mara Kincaid escapes the Pleasure Emporium, she vows to start living for herself. Rebuilding her life isn't easy as the town isn't fond of reformed fallen doves, but she's a Kincaid and Kincaids are known for their stubbornness. She's successful right up until the notorious ex-marshal Cougar McKinnely comes into town. As big as a mountain, dark as sin, and wearing a reputation as deadly as the knife strapped to his thigh, McKinnely is a man who knows what he wants. By rights, Mara should be shaking in her shoes when he approaches her. But when the powerful half-breed turns his dark gold eyes on her, it isn't fear that has Mara trembling, but rather an overwhelming desire to be the kind of woman Cougar needs to satisfy his deepest desires.
