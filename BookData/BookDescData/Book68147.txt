Keva Lane loves her job at the Institute of Parapsychology. When she responds to an emergency call to help Sebastian Brooks, a psychic about to go supernova, things go horribly awry. Normal treatment methods don’t work, and Sebastian rudely suggests that she could cure him with sex. With lives at risk, Keva doesn’t have any choice but to give in to the sexy psychic. Little did she know that she would be setting off a chain of events that would change her life forever.Being psychic cost Sebastian Brooks his family. He’s not interested in being saved. Though he knows he’s not good enough for Keva, he can’t resist her. He can’t seem to stay away from her no matter how hard he tries. Because whenever he loses control, it’s like he’s possessed and nothing can stop him from claiming the woman he’s had visions of for a lifetime.
