My name is Courtney Jane Salinger...and I'm sick of games.Sick of the Friday night bar-scene-cum-meat-market. Sick of the boy-girl, man-woman, mars-venus, flirtation-without-expectation, game-playing nonsense.Sick of awful dates and one-night stands, booty calls and guys who don’t call back, mixed messages or NO messages and—and—and...I'm sick of all of it. I’m done.I just can't do it anymore.It's too hard, and worse: little by little, it's making me hard.It's breaking my heart.What do I want?That's easy.I want a house in suburbia with a white picket fence.I want babies to buckle into a minivan.But most of all, I want to be married.I want a husband.So I've made an important decision: I'm making my escape from the dating world and the single life.I've filled out my application on ArrangeMe.com and I'm putting my fate into the hands of experts.Is it a little scary?Sure.I mean, I have no idea who I'll end up with. After all, I'm planning to marry a complete stranger.But between you and me?I can't wait.Being arranged can't possibly be worse than being single.Can it?
