Listening length: 7 hours, 2 minutesFrom New York Times bestselling author Penelope Ward, comes a new standalone novel.What do you do when a sexy, older man moves into your family’s summer rental?Well, apparently, you make a fool of yourself—over and over. Things didn’t exactly get off on the right foot with Noah Cavallari. Our first encounter was embarrassing, to say the least.But despite that, I found myself waking up every day with a newfound energy. Nothing exciting ever happened on the lake—not until Noah moved into the small boathouse on our property. He’d booked it for the entire summer…and I was still trying to figure out why.When my mother became ill, I inherited the responsibility of making sure our guests were well taken care of. I should have been in college. Instead, I was living my best life…as a maid.Dark, handsome, and mysterious, everything about Noah screamed forbidden. I knew he was just passing through town for the summer.I knew he was probably too old for me.Yet, I was drawn to him.Not to mention, he tried to save my life when he mistakenly thought I was drowning.I wanted him and made no secret of it.His own attempts to warn me away soon gave way to late-night moonlight chats by the lake. We were slowly easing into a friendship that was gearing up to explode into something I might not recover from. Because he’s leaving at the end of the summer.And I have no idea what I’ll do when August ends.
