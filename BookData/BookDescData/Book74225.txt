In your hands you hold a curious stash of documents. They were found by me, Tom Angleberger; in the storage room of the old Qwikpick gas station on Franklin street. They tell an absolutely crazy (and smelly!) story about three kids trying to go on an adventure in their pretty boring hometown of Crickenburg. Did they succeed? Well, you should find out for yourself.This is the report of the first-ever trip of The Qwikpick Adventure Society.It has been written by Lyle Hertzog (me) with the help of co-members Marilla Anderson, who took the pictures, and Dave Raskin, who drew the maps and stuff. We call ourselves The Qwikpick Adventure Society. Society is just a fancy word for club, which is stretching it a bit since there's only three of us.But the word adventure is stretching it a lot!We didn't stop a smuggling ring or get mixed up with the mob or stop and ancient evil from rising up and spreading black terror across Crickenburg.But we did see something that not many other people have gotten to see and no one will get to see again - - the Amazing Poop Fountain at the Crickenburg Wastewater Treatment Plant...
