"Power has to have a purpose" my father had always told me, "and if not for the good of the coven, of the family then what for?" Cherry knows her place. She also knows she doesn't want to stay in it. Many have sought the immense power Cherry possesses. Over the ages, it has been the dream of supernatural beings and mortals alike to harness the prowess of magic Cherry naturally holds. A witch with the kind of strength that she has has not been witnessed for centuries. It is no wonder that her coven of witches sees her as a leader--and a great risk that may need to be eliminated. Caught in an odd power struggle with the coven that acts as her family, Cherry fears for her life. Cherry is not like the rest, and that statement applies in ways far beyond her superior powers. She wishes to live a simple life and embrace the normalcy of the humans she observes around her. She rejects the coven's all-consuming commitment to power and their way of doing things. Rebellious witches do not typically meet a positive end. When Cherry meets a handsome stranger at a bar, she is taken aback when he doesn't withdraw from her. It is a nice change of pace from the reality she knows--the one where other beings who aren't magically inclined sense her power and hide away. The coven doesn't approve of outside relationships as it is, and Cherry's refusal to meet the demands of the coven already has her on thin ice. Has the dark, mysterious beauty of Cherry led her to true love, or will this circumstance lead her to her demise? Experience Cherry's powerful journey in Larissa Ladd's Eye of the Coven, the first in a spellbinding series of compelling novellas exploring magic, power, life, and love.
