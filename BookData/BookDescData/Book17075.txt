Jersey Hatch can't remember if he rammed the car into his parents' house.He can't remember why his best friend won't speak to him.He can't remember the right words to have a real conversation. And he can't remember why he tried to shoot his own head off.Broken in both mind and body, Jersey must piece his life back together, step by painful step. He must re-learn to tie his own shoelaces. He must somehow pass Algebra and graduate high school. And he must try to repair old friendships as severed as the connection between his brain and his once-athletic body. With a compelling and unique literary voice Susan Vaught thrusts readers directly into the bitterly funny head of Jersey Hatch as he navigates his own damaged existence, and as he tries to answer the question not just why he wanted to end his very good life, but whether he can stop himself from trying to end it again.  An eye-opening story that expertly navigates the triumph of family, the depths of despair, and the humor of the most mundane details of life.
