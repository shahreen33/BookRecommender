Morgan's saga continues in this double-length, stand alone SWEEP book. Moira's Story will shoot readers forward through time, where we will meet Morgan's daughter-raised as a blood witch-and follow her adventures as the progeny of one of the most powerful blood witches the Seven Great Clans have ever known.
