The day I truly started to live, I sentenced him to die.At twenty-four, I'd resigned myself to a simple life following in my mother's footsteps. I would manage the antique shop she left me and marry a kind, stable man. Most importantly, I would never tell a soul about my psychic abilities.But with a single, intentional touch and a vision of the past, I set events in motion that expose my secret. Iâ€™m part of a world I never knew existed, and my new allies are dismantling my carefully constructed walls.Except, those walls had a purpose--they kept me hidden.Now, my abilities make me a target.And my mere existence is endangering everyone I care about. My name is Adele Rose, and I know nothing but regret.
