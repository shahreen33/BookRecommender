"Maybe next time I kiss you, you'll be awake."   When a handsome man walks into her life, Ivy falls hard. He quickly fills her dreams at night, and her thoughts during the day. But, when dreams and reality blur, is a dangerous grey area.   Kian can't sleep at night, but watching Ivy as she slumbers has become his addiction -- even before he met her.
