"This is a weird and wondrous book! Don't let the deceptively simple beginning fool you: there are clues planted throughout the novel suggesting nothing is quite what it seems. The ending is worthy of the best psychological thrillers. It still haunts me days later..." ~ Clarissa Harwood, author of Impossible SaintsFrom an award-winning novelist comes historical fiction with a psychological twist:When World War II drags Maggie Lerner’s husband off to Europe, Maggie joins the workforce as one of America’s Rosies. Though she savors her freedom, she is haunted by a dream that leads her to believe something terrible will happen to her husband. After the war, Sam returns home unscathed, and Maggie, who once again takes her place as a doctor’s wife, believes the dream will disappear. Instead, it evolves into an all-consuming world where Maggie is admired for her strength; where she can have whatever she wishes. Resenting her conventional life, she willingly surrenders to the temptation of imagined perfection. But all is not as it seems. Beneath the dream’s flawless surface, a monster lies in wait. In an era of post-war feminism and the latest in psychoanalysis, Maggie will need to confront this evil—whether real or imagined—before it destroys both her worlds.
