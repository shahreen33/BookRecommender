Dreams of Elsewhere brings together Stevenson's best travel writings, including: An Inland Voyage (1878), an account of the journey he made by canoe from Antwerp to northern France, and his companion work to this, Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes (1879), shadowing his life as his ill health took him from Scotland to Europe, America, and finally to Samoa, where he died.
