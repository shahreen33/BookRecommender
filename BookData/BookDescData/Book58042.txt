On the verge of losing her laboratory, her savings, and all respect for herself, Pandora (Penny) Yee lands her first contract as scientific consult to the police department. And with seventeen murder cases on the go, the surly inspector is happy to leave her to it. Only she's going to need to get around, and that means her slightly unhinged adopted brother, Matiu, will be doing the driving. But something about the case spooks Matiu, something other than the lack of a body in the congealing pool of blood in the locked room or that odd little bowl.Matiu doesn't like anything about this case, from the voices that screamed at him when he touched that bowl, to the way his hateful imaginary friend Makere has come back to torment him, to the fact that the victim seems to be tied up with a man from Matiu's past, a man who takes pleasure in watching dogs tear each other to pieces for profit and entertainment.Hounds of the Underworld blends mystery, near-future noir and horror. Set in New Zealand it's the product of a collaboration by two Kiwi authors, one with Chinese heritage and the other MƒÅori. This debut book in The Path of Ra series offers compelling new voices and an exotic perspective on the detective drama.
