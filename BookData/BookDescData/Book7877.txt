Once, they shared one soul. Can hope heal years of despair and broken dreams?
Music is all I know. It saved me as a kid. It brings me fame and fortune now. But what am I, the famous Gage Rodin, doing at night when I’m on the road and can’t sleep Googling her. Tess Hades, the girl who still haunts my dreams and my lyrics. She arrived like a quiet storm, a wild thing with eyes guarded to the world. But she let me into the deep end of her beautifully broken soul. When we were together, life was simple. When my life got complicated, she did what she thought was the right thing. She let me go.While she’s been out saving the wild creatures of the world, my muse has fed on the memory of our life together. But now everything in my world is shifting again, and not in a good way. I’m not certain I have the strength to bear another devastating loss, so I find myself reaching for something as rare and elusive as the perfect song lyric.
