One Fine FoxFour famished foxes make fun of their brother Fosdyke, who feels fondly for fried figs, fennel, and French bread. Leaving him behind to fry and flamb√©, they go foraging for fowl in a forbidden farmyard. Unfortunately, the foxes find the fowl forwarned. Foiled, they return to their den. Will they ever filch a fabulous farmyard feast? Or will they forgo fowl and finally admit that "a fox is a fox whatever the food"?
