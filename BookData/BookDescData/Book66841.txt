Lennon Carter first saw my face with his hand around my throat.Shock widened his eyes, starbursts of anger for what I'd done. That moment should have been the last of us; our beginning and end. Fate, it seems, had other plans.A dedicated musician, Lennon would become my mentor, my shadow, my protector and nightmare.We were two discordant notes that somehow blended with perfect harmony.Challenged to become a pianist as talented as him, I became Lennon's SIN, while he became my DISCIPLINE.(A Taboo Student/Teacher Romance)
