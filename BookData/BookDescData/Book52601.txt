Jake Dean crushed any certainties I thought I had in life. He took my perfectly sculpted existence and tipped it upside down. I let him. I actually pushed him to do it, if I’m being honest, which isn’t something I overly pride myself on. Aubrey King was never supposed to be mine. I guess even now, she’s not. Not really. She made me question my character, my morals. But I go back. Every. Single. Time. I’m addicted to her.
