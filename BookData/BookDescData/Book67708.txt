People call me callous. Arrogant. Ruthless. I call myself tenacious. One of the most powerful attorneys in Charleston, I don’t let anyone or anything stand in my way.Until a chance encounter changes everything.One glance.One touch.One night.It only leaves me wanting more.But Grace is off limits. Most people would even say forbidden. Everyone knows an attorney can’t sleep with his client. Too bad I already did. And even with the threat of losing everything, I don’t know if I can stop myself from having her again...
