ZERO-SUMThrough sheer force of will, Tatara and Chinatsu have made it through the first elimination round of the Tokyo Metropolitan Tournament. But from here on out, it's a zero-sum game: The judges have a limited number of points to award, so for every couple who receives one, another couple doesn't. With the competition fiercer than ever, Tatara and Chinatsu have no margin for error, and failure is not an option!
