Faber Stories, a landmark series of individual volumes, presents masters of the short story form at work in a range of genres and styles. Walking ahead of him on the heath, his wife turns to look at him over her shoulder, 'Topaz eyes glinting. Scorched face. Vixen.'In language harvested from nature, Sarah Hall tells a story of metamorphosis, of wildness and fecundity, and of a man reaching for reason, who cannot let go of the creature he loves.Bringing together past, present and future in our ninetieth year, Faber Stories is a celebratory compendium of collectable work.
