Holt the ME is a socially awkward, highly distrustful kangaroo mouse shifter who takes one look at Leighton, who seems to like him, and knows he's being played. A man like that doesn't fall for the big-eared weirdo that spends more time with dead people than live ones.  Leighton, a harpy who has never done anything the easy way takes one look at the cutie with the oversized ears and evasive attitude, and feels something he's never felt before. But if he's going to get the cautious man to take him seriously, he's going to have to break down some walls.  More details coming soon!
