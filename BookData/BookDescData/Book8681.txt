If coping with life is not an easy task for everyone, at certain stages, at least for a Single Parent, it becomes a daily act of heroism. This pleasant, uplifting and easy read provides Single Moms and Dads with personal focus and thought-provoking tips, entertaining guides and exercises helping them rediscover a life above and beyond just being a parent/child's taxi service or cash dispenser.  Starting from Chapter 2., the book displays its full inspirational and motivational power and captivates the reader both visually and through the variety and appeal of its content: 24/7 Inner happiness, love, fulfilling relationships, problem solving, becoming and finding the right partner for life, (online) dating, surviving divorce/a breakup, creating quality time with children, a balanced - strong - confident Self, benefiting from experiences and much, much more.  The built-in “My Life-Coaching Workbook”, including six multitask exercises, is an outstanding tool that enables Single Parents to learn, deepen and practice positive attitudes and behaviours right in the areas where they most need help: Self-Development, Dating and Single Parenting.  The great number of targeted impulses, as well as the loving, caring and professional advice offered by the author, have a unique purpose: making Single Moms and Dads fit to FLY. Where? To higher levels of emotional well-being… up to a happier and more fulfilling life!
