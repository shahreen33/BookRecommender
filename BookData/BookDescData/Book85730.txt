This is an alternate cover edition for B01N0IR0CM Travel blogger Sophie Newport doesn't date athletes, but one look at Declan O'Shaughnessy has her re-thinking everything. The boy who once tormented her is all man now, and even though she shouldn't want him, she can't stop picturing all the sinful things he promises to do to her. But as days turn to weeks, Sophie comes to realize it's not just about his hot body or his wicked mouth. Underneath that cocky persona, he's kind and generous, too. The exact opposite of who she thought he was. But is it enough to make her set aside her fear and finally put down roots? Rugby was the only things Declan cared about—right up until his first love waltzed back into his life. As Dublin Rugby’s captain, he's not used to losing, but Sophie's one challenge he never saw coming. For the first time ever, he sees a future with the girl he never forgot. He wants her, and he never gives up without a fight. Even if it means showing her who he really is; introducing her to the things he needs. Even if it means laying his heart on the line and asking her to stay. Sophie was his first love; he’s determined to be her last.
