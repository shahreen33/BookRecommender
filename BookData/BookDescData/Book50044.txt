It can be our little secret. Until her abusive ex-boyfriend shows up in town and ruins everything. If he even tries to lay a finger on her... he'll regret it. I'll do anything to protect my new family. No matter what.  Baby Makes Three is a super steamy secret baby romance. It has a HEA and NO Cliffhanger.
