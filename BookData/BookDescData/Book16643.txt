Ashlyn never believed in fairy tales until she was in one. They say ignorance is bliss, but not when you're on a centuries old hit list...and there's a traitor in your midst. Ashlyn must decide what's most important: trusting the allies she has, or siding with those she thought were enemies. Ashlyn knows old friends can turn on her, and unlikely allies may be the best chance she has to piece her family back together. No matter what her choice, she could lose someone she loves. And when you don't know who to trust, believe one thing: You can never trust a faerie. Book Two in the BRIDGER Series
