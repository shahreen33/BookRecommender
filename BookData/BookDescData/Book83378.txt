Can Multima Corporation withstand another attack from organized crime? While billionaire John George Mortimer copes with treatment for cancer, the accomplished CEO must also ward off challenges for control of his sprawling fictional American empire both from within the company and from nefarious powers operating outside the law.The Multima Scheme is a fast-paced account of the lengths to which organized crime can infiltrate large global corporations and seize control of respected businesses to conceal activities that are both illegal and immoral but generate billions. It's also a story of survival - how individuals and organizations might react under intense pressures and the ease with which people can cross lines between what's legal and what's not.Using his knowledge of how large multinationals operate - accumulated over 40 years working with major corporations around the world - author Gary D. McGugan weaves a tale of intrigue using a writing style that readers will find hard to put down once started.
