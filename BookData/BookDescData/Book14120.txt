This anthology aims to be a showcase of recent indie writing.  Hugh Howey launched the idea on Kboards, a forum for Kindle readers, but also the meeting place of an active community of indie writers.  The result is this anthology of 101 very short stories by 101 authors.  To make it more attractive for you, the reader, we set ourselves a limit of a thousand words. You should be able to read each story in under five minutes â€” on your desktop computer, laptop, or tablet at home or in the office, but also on your smartphone, on the go, while you are commuting or waiting at a coffee shop for your significant other to arrive.  We included as many genres as we could. We hope that maybe, with only five minutes of your time on the line that would otherwise be wasted anyway, you'll be tempted to venture outside your comfort zone and try out some new genres and new authors.
