One celebration destined for failure.  Wayne and Clarissa are a young London couple whose immediate families are about to meet for the first time. Trying to create harmony between the parents is hard enough, but in this case there are eight parents, step-parents, and partners to cope with.  Wayne comes from a working class background and Clarissa, an upper-middle class one. They are deeply in love but tensions arising from the forthcoming gathering have created a rift, and it’s touch and go whether their relationship is strong enough to survive the event.  With more than just an engagement on the line, can these two families come together – or will their differences rip them all apart?
