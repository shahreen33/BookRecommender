There's something totally inconvenient about falling for your best friend's brother. Especially when he's a pompous, arrogant, albeit annoyingly sexy a-hole that you'd like to punch or kiss to death at any given moment. But when he does something unforgivable, will there there ever be a second chance for first love. The summer Jazz turns eighteen, a stupid favor will blur the lines from friends to lovers between her and Joey Butler, leading to a summer will change the course of their lives forever. Now for three years they’ve pretended there’s nothing between them anymore and Jazz is finally ready to move on with the rest of her life and from what Joey did to her. But when Joey finally admits that Jazz is the one he's always wanted, all bets are off. This is a full length, standalone contemporary, friends to lovers and second chance romance. It is a spin off from the Eversea series and may therefore contain minor spoilers. This book is recommended for ages 17+ due to strong language and sexual situations.
