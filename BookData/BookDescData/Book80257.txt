Yours truly, and worse - my beloved incubus, Alec. Did I mention the new dean is also Harris's cousin? Harris will have to betray his family if he wants to help us, but the price he asks of me is. . .um. . .blush. . .murmur.As if I don't have enough problems already, Firian is still stuck as a fox, Montague is getting a little more cozy with his vampire heritage, and Daisy is betrothed to the new dean who is more than willing to abuse her powers. I'm still trying to save my mom and bring her home to my dad, but the truth is, I'm scared. She's been working for a high demon for twenty years and what will she do back in my little home town?

I'm about to find out.*CONTAINS MATURE THEMES*Â©2019 Lidiya Foxglove (P)2019 Tantor
