Fall in love with Graham Braden and Morgyn Montgomery in TRAILS OF LOVE. When Graham Braden travels to Oak Falls, Virginia to attend the wedding of his buddy Reed Cross to Grace Montgomery, he sticks around to help with renovations to Reed’s new theater.

Graham is a careful, keen businessman, and Morgyn is impulsive, disorganized, and more interested in the energy flow in her eclectic retail shop than in the accuracy of her records. While Graham isn’t ready to open his pockets to the sassy, sexy business owner, he may be ready to open his heart.The Bradens &amp; Montgomerys are part of Melissa's Love in Bloom big-family romance collection.
