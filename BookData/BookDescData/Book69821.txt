You will truly push the envelope on what you can accomplish in the kitchen with Plants Taste Better. This plant-based recipe book puts vegetables on center-stage, and gives you a deeper understanding of the techniques which make them shine.    Cooking plants is an art form completely different from cooking meat or fish. It requires not only a solid grounding in traditional cooking techniques, but also a deeper understanding of new techniques specific to working with plants. Current vegan cookbooks rarely address finer cuisine the way traditional cookbooks present preparing meats. Plants Taste Better presents you with stunning recipes that take vegetable cooking to a new level and highlights specific techniques in each recipe to enhance your skills in the kitchen.
