The year is 2197. More than one hundred years had passed since the natural cataclysm on the Earth's surface. The surviving inhabitants of the Earth were now living in Heavenly Cities above the clouds and did not want to descend back to the unstable surface of the Earth.   Helen was a lawyer who lived in one of the cities. Her life was perfect, but soon she was to find out that all this was an illusion, for her dreams will be scattered like the leaves in the wind and the only thing left for her to return to would be her hometown.  But on her way home, a car accident on the heavenly highway turned her to a completely different direction. Helen was suddenly falling with the car down to the surface of the Earth and into a forest world that was completely foreign to her.   Was it true what they told her that no one had survived on the surface of the Earth? What if the truth was completely different? What if on earth there were survivors?
