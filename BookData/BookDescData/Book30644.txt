The small, peaceful lakeside community of Mount Dora suddenly changes one morning when two local fishermen snag the skeletal remains of a man murdered more than 75 years earlier. The local police give up after only a few days even though a relative of the dead man claims infamous mobster Meyer Lansky committed the crime, but he’s been dead for 25 years. Former newspaperman Trent Cooper thought he was heading into an early retirement. Maybe he would finally have a chance to finish the novel he’d been working on for too long. Mostly by accident, he finds himself investigating the unsolved murder with the help of his good friend Horatio Cook, a borderline genius and certifiable slob. Cooper begins to unravel the web of clues and sort through the local lore involving the mafia, a U.S. President, a Hollywood movie and even a dead F.B.I. Director. The two reluctant sleuths enlist their freewheeling girlfriends and a cast of unique townspeople to help stay a step ahead of the Miami mob. Cooper learns that it will take the skill, tenacity and diligence from his former life as an investigative reporter to solve a Murder in Mount Dora.
