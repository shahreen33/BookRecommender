"Blending scholarly evidence and the experiences of numerous families, The Art of Screen Time is a well-researched and reassuring guide to raising kids in a world where technology is everywhere." -danah boyd, author of It's Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked TeensFinally there's a no-nonsense, don't-panic, evidence-based guide to one of the biggest challenges facing parents today: managing a world where screens are everywhere we look.With this book, Anya Kamenetz--a journalist, an award-winning expert on both education and technology, and a mother of two young children--takes a refreshingly practical approach. She surveys both the experts and hundreds of fellow parents to find out how they really manage screensat home--for their children and themselves. Cutting through a thicket of inconclusive studies and overblown claims, she hones a simple message, a riff on Michael Pollan's well-known "food rules": Enjoy Screens. Not too much. Mostly with others.Realistic, wise, and disarmingly candid, The Art of Screen Time shows us how to set aside our digital anxiety and create space for a happy, healthy family life.
