THANK YOU. **You're not the same as you were before…That’s what happens when a man has been to hell and back--literally--as Georg Kivistö, former bruin king, knows all too well.Restless. Aimless. Georg is at loose ends until he encounters a strange woman in a strange land. Sweet, alluring and innocent, Alice soon wraps him around her little finger, one maddening knot at a time. Georg knows better than anyone he can't afford another romantic entanglement, but what a bruin wants a bruin gets.Or dies trying.As shadows close in, the path to a new throne seems inevitable, but is it a crown Georg really needs--Or a queen?
