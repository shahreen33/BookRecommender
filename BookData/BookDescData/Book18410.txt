But the Furys have their secrets as well, none so dangerous as the daughter whose Shadow magic spills from her, unchecked. Unless her powers are concealed, sheâ€™s not only ruined in Society, but marked as a target for those who would use and abuse her magic. Persephone Fury is the Dark daughter, the one they hide.

Evil powers circle, calling her to the destiny foretold at the moment of her birth, drawing her to the source of her power, to the one place she can finally be free. By embracing the Shadows, by embracing the Darkness within her. Persephone is ruthless, devious, and clever, but when confronted with the truth, she must make horrifying choices. Can she defy destiny and seize her own fate? ______________________ START READING NOW ______________________Amazon/Kindle http://amzn.to/2p0FtzF Barnes&Noble/Nook http://bit.ly/2vNH8Z7 Kobo http://bit.ly/2xBntha iBooks http://apple.co/2iLLWNm And book stores around the world. https://books2read.com/u/4jKXlo Website: https://furytriad.com
