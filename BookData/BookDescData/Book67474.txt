Magic is real. So where does reality end and the madness begin? Whoever said magic was beautiful didn't mention the blood. The violence. Or are we just special? Better question, where is Lucida? Also, why can't Edwin or Byron answer any of our questions? AND for the love of all that is bloody... why are there bird bones everywhere?  The Ravens - ever vigilant. Ready yourself for chaos, love, and gore in a story that weaves together elements of gothic aesthetic, horror, and romance. Nothing is simple for Vegas and her boys in this second installment of The Red Masques. (and yes... Vegas's men can get more intense!)  For those who LOVE over the top alpha males AND our kickass heroines.  *Fantasy Reverse Harem* Our characters swear a lot. Be prepared. As well, please be advised that the book contains darker themes including but not limited to assault, PTSD, gore, and violence. Additionally, sexual themes are suitable for mature audiences +18.
