In 1965, a young child went missing while he and his brother explored a disused cemetery. When his body was found floating in the river three days later, his older brother insisted the death wasn't an accident. That something dark and deadly lived in the cemetery's crypt. That it would kill again.  More than fifty years later, Sara finds herself facing the gate to the abandoned graveyard, with the story of the dead child ringing in her ears. She's there with one specific purpose: to uncover the decades-old secrets of the crypt.   Crypt is a chilling half-hour story by award-winning horror author Darcy Coates.
