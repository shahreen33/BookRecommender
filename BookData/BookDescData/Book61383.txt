It should take Tommy only eight hours to get home by Greyhound. But when he listens to a mad man giving a tip on a sure thing, listens to the words of wisdom of a haiku reciting frog, and listens to an eccentric billionaire about a marriage proposal, then the eight hour trip turns into a life changing journey. Some want to know if Tommy is crazy enough to be locked up, but his heart tells him he is just crazy in love. A little juju can protect him from River Ratz, but itâ€™s going to take a miracle to give him back his peace of mind.
