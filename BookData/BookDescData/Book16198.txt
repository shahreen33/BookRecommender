You will not be taken aback by his crooked grin or the bubbly personality that can make just about anyone instantly fall in love with him. In fact, unless you know what to look for, you are not likely to notice anything different about him at all, but he is different.This world we live in is confusing, overwhelming and painful because he has a condition known as autism.
