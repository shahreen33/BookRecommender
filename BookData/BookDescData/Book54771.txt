Trapped in their basement.Raped, beaten, and broken. All I have left is my sanity. Preston took my name, and my body. Paxton took my heart.Existing only for him.Don't make me walk away. ***As if it wasn't clear enough, there are TRIGGERS in this book, and if you are not over 18, or cannot handle subjects such as violence, kidnapping and rape, this is NOT the book for you***
