From the one of our best-loved food writers and the presenter of BBC One’s Eating Together, A Year of Good Eating is a completely fresh take on seasonal cooking.The third instalment of Nigel Slater’s classic Kitchen Diaries series, A Year of Good Eating explores the balance and pleasure in eating well throughout the year. The leisurely recipes and kitchen stories of the Diaries are ingeniously interspersed with seasonal sections of quick, weeknight suppers in the style of Nigel’s most recent bestseller Eat. A salmon pie with herb butter sauce or an asparagus and blue cheese tart for when you have time to cook; roasted summer vegetables with sausages or quick baked eggs and greens for when you need to get dinner on the table fast.With Nigel’s characteristically simple recipes and inspiring writing, this new book will make good eating a joy, every day of the year.
