After the death of her mother, Adaline is sent to live in St. Louis while her father—the famous scout Kit Carson—explores the West. Yearning for the faraway world of her mother's people and desperate for proof of her father's love, Adaline flees the home of her cruel relatives to forge her own course through the wilderness. When she allows an abandoned dog to join her on the trail, and to enter her heart, everything she ever knew about love and loyalty is put to the test.
