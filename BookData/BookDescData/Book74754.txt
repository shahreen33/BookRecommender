In this white-knuckled, timely, and whip-smart debut thriller, a deadly plot against the president’s life emerges from the shadows of the deep state.Trust No One.Recently elected President Richard Monroe—populist, controversial, and divisive—is at the center of an increasingly polarized Washington, DC. Never has the partisan drama been so tense or the paranoia so rampant. In the midst of contentious political turf wars, the White House chief of staff is found dead in his house. A tenacious intern discovers a single, ominous clue that suggests he died from something other than natural causes, and there may be a wide-ranging conspiracy running beneath the surface of everyday events: powerful government figures are scheming to undermine the rule of law—and democracy itself. Soon, allies are exposed as enemies, once-dependable authorities will fall under suspicion, and no one seems to be who they say they are. The unthinkable is happening. The Deep State is real. Who will die to keep its secrets? Who will kill to uncover the truth?
