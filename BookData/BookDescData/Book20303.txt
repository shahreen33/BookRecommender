The #1 Publishers Weekly  religious best-seller now becomes a best-selling  paperback! Joseph Girzone, author  of Joshua, takes us on a personal spiritual quest in  his first book of nonfiction. Joseph Girzone is  that singular publishing phenomenon, an author who  answers the unasked questions that lie hidden in so  many hearts. The wisdom of his spirituality, at  once both simple and profound, transcends the many  factions of religion and speaks to millions,  regardless of background, in a language all can  understand. Never Alone is his most  intimate book to date, and has already brought him  many new readers because of its accepting message.  In it, he unveils his personal way to God -- a way  of such wisdom, sympathy, and generosity that  anyone can follow it and find satisfaction, happiness,  and serenity. As Father Girzone guides the reader,  he brings us before a god who is neither silent  nor condemning, but a patient God who heals gently  and thoroughly, a realistic God who knows quite  well how we function. We may be shocked or ashamed bv  what we see in ourselves, but God understands. In  Never Alone, Joseph Girzone unfolds  the spirituality of love and forgiveness, and  directs his readers toward peace.
