Zoey Mathers was a witch. Not on purpose. It had happened accidently. But as Zoey was finding out, maybe this had been her fate all along. Luckily the potential witch hunter, Slade, had turned out to be on her side and had found a place in her heart. With the War of the Witches heating up, it's not just Zoey's life on the line, but all the witches fighting for good.But fate wasn't done with Zoey yet. There was a reason she'd become a witch when others wouldn't have. And that answer was going to change her life even more. Now Zoey was falling in love, fighting for good, and defending the sweet small town of Moonshine Hollow. All while the humans were completely unaware of a war around them. But that was nothing compared to the fight to end the war-the one the prophecy said was up to her. Only one witch was going to survive and she just hoped fate knew what she was doing because Zoey's life was in the balance.
