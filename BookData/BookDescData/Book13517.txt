Only problem, she was a bit of a recluse, painfully shy, kind of clumsy and didn't know the first thing about living it up. Thankfully she has a very sexy, very determined editor to help her along the way.She was everything he could ever want, popular and in demand, but unfortunately for him the author that he needed to make a name for himself was also a little recluse who wasn't doing what he needed her to do. In order to get her to do what he wants he decides to help her in her little quest for a life and ends up with more than he bargained for.
