MISS DELACOURT HAS HER DAY is truly an old-style Regency romance with all the things we enjoyed about them years ago. This story is the sequel to MISS DELACOURT SPEAKS HER MIND (December 2008) and takes up after Anthony and Ginny have met and fallen in love. Take a journey back to early English life and once again revel in a true historical romance this month - you'll love it.
