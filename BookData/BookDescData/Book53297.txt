Fair is foul and foul is fair.   Betrayed by her father. Abandoned by her mother. Left at the altar by the prince of her dreams.  Anastasia Gosse's past is more tangled than most. Everything she's been through has taught this witch one valuable lesson. Trust no one. All that Ana's ever wanted was to have her family back together and safe. She'd do anything to make that happen.  Even blackmail an assassin of the realm who drives her crazy in more ways than one.  Tyr Kanerva thinks he's seen it all, the worst of both the human and fairytale worlds. This assassin thinks he's too jaded for surprises. Enter one clever, calculating witch who tricks Tyr into a contract that just might be the death of him. He should hate her, but instead he finds himself wondering what the witch is hiding under all that ice?  When Ana comes up with a sinful solution to satisfy their mutual curiosity, neither of them are prepared for where their liaison will led.  Because the FTC world is not a kind one, and between gods, goddesses and a Fire Prince who will stop at nothing to have Ana back at his side, a happily ever after for these two may be just another impossible fairytale....
