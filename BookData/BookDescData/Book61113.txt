How much weight can a man take on his shoulders before he buckles?  Blue’s life is in shambles.  He has to fight off his MC brotherhood on a drug problem threatening his town, balance his time as a father while dealing with a vicious custody battle with his ex, and somehow manage the huge load of responsibilities of his job. All the while, he is fighting his attraction to the quiet shopkeeper who lives just across the street from him. The last thing he wants is to take her down with him.  Psalm’s life is uneventful.  Finally healed after the heartache of losing her husband, kind-souled Psalm throws herself into her store and rescuing dogs. Her crush on Blue can be traced back to high school so many years ago, and even after being widowed, she still carries a torch for him. From the sidelines, she aches for Blue and his children. With her caring nature, she reaches out to him, over and over again, even when he pushes her away. Is Psalm’s heart strong enough to take on this broken man and heal him?
