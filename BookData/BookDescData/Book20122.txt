This retelling the Biblical mythos of the Creation and the Fall comes from the perspective of the Fallen: the angel Morningstar. It is the story of an angel, not of pride and envy, but of confusion and frustration. Forced to watch as the place of the angels as the Creator's favored is slowly taken over by the rise of Man, Morningstar seeks solace with his lover, Radueriel.Radueriel has a fanatical devotion to the Creator, and he repeatedly urges Morningstar to surrender to the Creator's will. Unable to do so, Morningstar revolts against the Creator and His ineffable Divine Plan, jeopardizing his relationship with Radueriel and risking the wrath of God. The revolution fails, and the rebelling angels are expelled from Heaven.Not to Hell, but to Earth.
