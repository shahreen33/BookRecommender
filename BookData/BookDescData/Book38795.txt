Is Dingle Grove as clean-scrubbed as people believe? Female sleuths, Alice and Lena are once again snooping into lives, this time joined by Audrey the bloodhound. An elderly man of the Midwest town of Dingle Grove disappears, and the hound finds him digging in an open field, weeping. As Alice signals her dog it's time to leave, Audrey lies down nearby, her jaw flat against the earth. Alice recognizes the expression in her dog's eyes, the sad look more intense than the one Audrey reserves for dead squirrels and night crawlers. Unsure of her dog's ability to find a cadaver, Alice questions whether she should alert the police to her suspicions. Will her report create needless trouble for the old man with dementia? Residents help Alice unravel the buried secrets involving an obsession with outlaws and gangsters.
