Based on a Emmy Award-winning Cartoon Network miniseries, Wirt and Greg are brothers, lost in a strange and endless wood called the Unknown. To find their way home, they must make it through this eerie place, where their only guides are a sardonic bluebird named Beatrice, and an elderly Woodsman. But as things become stranger and stranger, can they find their way out...alive?  Written by the show creator Pat McHale (ADVENTURE TIME) and illustrated by show storyboarder Jim Campbell, OVER THE GARDEN WALL features tales that fill in the blanks of the critically acclaimed miniseries, making it an essential companion for your own journey into the Unknown!
