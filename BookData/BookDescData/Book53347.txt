 PAIGE People say Derek Gentry is arrogant, perpetually drunk and good for only one thing. Even from a distance he's like a neon sign that reads: ‘I AM THE WORST IDEA YOU EVER HAD.’ And I’m not tempted, no matter how hot he is. I’ve heard the rumors. I know his story. But I’ve got my own scars. I don’t need his. Despite his muscled, blue-eyed good looks, he’s definitely just heartbreak wrapped in a seductive package. However, I didn’t plan on falling into his arms on the worst night of my life. I didn’t plan on initiating a chain reaction of events that neither of us saw coming. And I didn’t plan on needing him so much I can hardly stand it…   DEREK Everyone has a history. Mine’s a little worse than most. I’ve hurt my family. I’ve hurt people I never even knew. I’ve hurt myself. And I’ve been hiding at the bottom of a bottle for so long I’m not sure how to do things differently. At first Paige didn’t seem like the type who would ever be able to handle a guy like me. Little did I know what kind of mysteries she’s been keeping inside. Now I can’t get her out of my head. We could help each other. Or we could destroy each other. Right now it’s anyone’s guess.
