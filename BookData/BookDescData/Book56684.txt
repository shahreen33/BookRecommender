Playboy. Gym rat. Womanizer.  I’ve been called them all. Until one-night changes everything. Changes me. Trying to drown a broken heart in cheap whiskey and a willing body leaves me with the last thing I ever expected. All that matters now is my son. There’s no room for anything, or anyone else.  Until her. A free spirit. A nomadic soul. She intrigues me. She excites me. She’s everything I never knew I needed.  In the end, loving her was the easy part. It was letting her go that almost ruined me.  Struck is a surprise baby/single dad romance and can be read as a complete standalone.
