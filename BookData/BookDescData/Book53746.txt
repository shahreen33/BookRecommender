Mason Keller is broken, destructive, and the only man I’ve ever loved.I met him when I was just a child, but I knew there would never be anyone else.He lit my world with each smile and warmed my heart just by looking at me.But he was my brother’s best friend...Which meant I was off limits.So he let me go and took my heart with him.Now everything has changed, and the obstacles that kept us apart all our lives are no longer in the way.He wants to claim me.He wants to own me.He wants to ravage my world.And if I’m not careful...I just might let him.
