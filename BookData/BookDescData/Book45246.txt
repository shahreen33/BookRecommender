There's no "gobbledygook" in this picture book by James and Susan Patterson, with each letter of the alphabet providing a sophisticated word and definition for "Lilliputian" children to learn. Adults will appreciate the "juxtaposition" of young kids properly using impressive words that many grownups may not have heard of before! Includes a list of extra words in the back for further learning.
