As Canadian men volunteer for World War II in Janette Oke's When Tomorrow Comes, Christine Delaney recovers from her broken heart and finds solace in helping her adored brother Henry settle into married life with the widowed Amber and her young son Danny. However, the Delaney family's happiness is shattered when a terrible auto accident mars an anticipated family celebration. At this crucial turning point in her spiritual maturity, Christine must decide if she is willing to give up her dreams of living in the North, and let God help her choose between her suitors to find a lifelong love.  It's classic Oke here from cover to cover. Christian readers will appreciate that no matter what the circumstances, God is praised and everything works out for the best, even when things look grim. The writing is loose in spots-- characters "flush" repeatedly, and the dialogue is often stiff. Oke devotees will likely see these as minor glitches in a light, romantic novel that's penned in the tradition they've come to expect and enjoy. Readers who loved Beyond the Gathering Storm in Oke's "Canadian West" series will be more than content with this sweet sequel about the Delaney family. --Cindy Crosby
