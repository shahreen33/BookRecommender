Skyler Drake is in way over her head. As a breeder chosen by a Crestfall warrior, she’s had plenty of time to accept her fate. But when a chance encounter in Saratoga thrusts her into the path of a mysterious, and strange-talking shifter, Kellen, she begins to realize just how big the world is. And when Kellen-the-kidnapper turns out to be a battle-hardened werebear, she’s thinking she just might have stumbled upon someone who could love her despite her flaws—and possibly survive the wrath of her people.  Kellen would rather be hanged than watch a woman be hurt and trapped in a life she doesn’t choose, and when he gets a glimpse at just how much Skyler is keeping inside, he doesn’t think, only acts on protective instinct. Sure, he’s kidnapping her, but he knows what she really is, and she can escape any time she wants. Unfortunately, his bold moves and determination to show Skyler just how unbreakable she can be put his crew of lumberjack bear shifters in peril. But if he can toe the edge of danger, and avoid the wrath of his alpha, he just might find a mate worth sharing his secrets with.
