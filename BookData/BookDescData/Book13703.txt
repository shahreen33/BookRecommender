Natasha Munro is your typical twenty eight year old girl, well, your typical twenty eight year old Geordie: curvy, fun and a whole load of fab-u-lous. Her life is all going to plan — good job, great friends, close family and a loving boyfriend — until an unexpected event turns everything on its head. Nursing a broken heart and decked head to toe in tasselled chaps and rhinestones, Natasha and her flamboyant fairy of a gay best friend, Tink, uproot from their Northern nest, throw caution to the wind and embark on a new life together in Canada — the land of Rocky mountains, Maple Syrup, oh, and an ‘in-between movies’ Hollywood mega-star.Enter infamous bad-boy of the big screen, Tudor North. Bonafide hunk and actor-extraordinaire. Tudor is big, brooding and gorgeous and is harbouring a deep secret. Tudor’s cold and intimidating demeanour successfully keeps everyone at bay, that is everyone but a certain Ms Munro. It soon becomes clear, what with her smart mouth and lusciously ample arse, that Natasha proves more than a match for the emotionally distant star. Will Natasha and Tink settle into their new life abroad? Will Natasha ever find her fairytale happy ending? Can a movie star and an ordinary girl ever really make it work?Or will the secrets lurking in Tudor`s past threaten her chance at happiness?Addictive, hilarious and heart warming. A fast paced comedic journey of self discovery, unyielding friendship and of course, a suitable dose of slap and tickle.Warning: contains a foul-mouthed voluptuous Brit, a self-named 'Friggin' Fantastic Fairy’ and an abundance of bulging muscles and tattoos.
