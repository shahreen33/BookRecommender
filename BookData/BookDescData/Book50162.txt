 Two tantalizing mouths. Four magical hands and two incredibly delicious hunks.   They’re the hottest fantasy I never knew I had. Two total opposites of each other. Jasper is a billionaire with an MBA and Bryce is a hot AF firefighter. How they came to be best friends, I’ll never know, but put them together and I get dirty thoughts I shouldn’t have. I want them to do filthy things to me. Fill me up, turn me over and make me beg for more. A good girl shouldn’t be having these thoughts, but I can’t help myself. I want them. I crave them. My body aches for their nasty touches, their dirty kisses, their filthy mouths. And this Christmas, I have a special present for both of them!  Three Under The Tree is a standalone Christmas romance with loads of heat, guaranteed HEA and absolutely no cliffhangers! Includes extra steamy bonus content for your reading pleasure! Enjoy!
