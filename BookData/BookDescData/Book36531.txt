Jemima Small just wants to be like other girls. She hates being called "Jemima Big", being forced to join the school health group - aka Fat Club - and that she can't apply for her favourite TV show without worrying everyone will laugh. But she also knows that the biggest stars in the universe are the brightest. So maybe it's her time to shine. A brilliantly funny and touching new novel exploring big issues of bullying, body confidence and, most importantly, learning how to be happy with who you are.
