Preston has no friend closer than Luke, the surfer bro with a hangdog attitude. And Luke has no better friend than Preston, his snarky genius roommate. They spend their summer surfing and playing innocent games, like Who's-the-Spy and Hide-and-Seek. But when Luke changes the rules, inventing games like Kidnapper and Interrogation, Preston feels something he's never felt before for his friend. He lies awake at night, waiting for Luke to "break in," eager for the ominous tearing sound of duct tape, the rattle of handcuffs. He doesn't understand: he's straight, and so is Luke. He's always loved his best friend. Of course he has; that's what friendship is. But now he's starting to wonder: does he love him, or is he in love with him? Or maybe he's just in love with the taste of tape on his lips and the chafing of belts against his wrists. The two friends trade sweet pain and agonizing pleasure, until Preston is bound and helpless -- in every sense. Is Luke feeling something similar when he puts on his leather gloves and mask, or is all just a game to him? This 44,000 word stand alone novella contains scenes of steamy BDSM.
