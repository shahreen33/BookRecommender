My life is one big party until the day I turn 27 and everything changes. In order to take over my grandfather’s vineyard, I have to…1) Move back to my hometown. 2) Stop partying. 3) Get married. Wait! What?Before I know it, I’m buying a huge-ass diamond ring. Throwing a balls-out engagement party. And making the wedding a quickie before the bride has a chance to change her mind. Marrying me isn’t her first choice. She says this party boy is anything but husband material. That I’m cocky, arrogant, presumptuous, and even manipulative.With both of our failing businesses merging and a contract that states only one winery can survive, we’re spending a lot of time negotiating, and not the kind I prefer. Still, our perfectly unstable marriage is right on track until I go and screw everything up.Now I have to win her back, and short of rewinding time or riding in on a white horse, I’m at a loss of how to do that.Unless…Hey, every girl dreams of a Prince Charming. Right?Well, I can redefine this party boy, and turn him into one.Just wait and see.***Filled with hot and hilarious moments, you won’t want to miss the complete series!***
