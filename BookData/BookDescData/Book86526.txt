The best gift of all is the one you share with someone else. . .From the moment he strode through the iron gate and into the offices of Two Love Lane on a crisp December day, it was obvious that Deacon Banks was something different. He wasn't a Charleston native, not with that adorable Yankee accent. And unlike the usual client at the elegant matchmaking agency, he had no interest in finding a woman to marry--just a few no-strings dates while he was in town.Macy Frost takes her professional services very seriously--how could she not, when she's rumored to be a direct descendant of Cupid?

But can the hopelessly romantic Southern belle stop trying to fix him up and just let Cupid do his work on her own heart?
