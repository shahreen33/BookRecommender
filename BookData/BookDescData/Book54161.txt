Any Man's Land is part 2 of the Surface Chronicles. Several years have passed since the world changed forever in the wake of the solar storm. The conflict that followed proved that society as it had been, would never be again. The world had become a wild and dangerous place. The human race is irreparably divided, and trust is hard to come by. Ryan, Lucy and Jessica roam the broken world. Their only goals are to keep each other safe, and survive one day at a time. Life had taught them one valuable lesson however: There would always be others who would stand in their way and threaten their way of life.
