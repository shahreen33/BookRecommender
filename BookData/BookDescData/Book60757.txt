NOTE FROM THE DOM, LOGAN THORNDIKE: Poor sorority pledge, Addison Montgomery, lands in a world of trouble and heat when she’s caught chucking eggs at my father’s mansion on Halloween at the demand of her sisters. When she accepts a trip over my knee as her punishment, we get swept up in a delicious power exchange and a squall of tumultuous passion. But given our limited experience, diving into untested lusts may be way too hot for us to handle ... especially where more than hearts can be broken. Besides, I’m doing all I can to keep my dark side and hellish childhood from rising up to strangle me, and a girl like Addison Montgomery, so compliant, so wet, so eager to please is...God, she is the very last thing I need! She’s both my dream come true and my absolute, worst nightmare.This novella contains me doing debased things to her mind and body, I’m wicked like that, and other yummy treats I’m not gonna spell out in a blurb. What kind of Dom would I be if I went around spoiling surprises? If you’re at least 18 and pink gets you flowing, go slip into your loosest pajamas. That’s not an order, those only go to my sub, but it’s a recommendation I strongly suggest.* * * This 20,200-word novella is Book 1 in the 10-part Sorority Pledge Saga, a serialization that follows a rocky romance centered around the edgy bliss of Domination and submission. Contains explicit situations and language. 18+ please. * * *
