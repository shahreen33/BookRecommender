There are serious dangers lurking behind the government's $30 billion electronic health record (EHR) experiment. This omnipresent technology turns doctors into data clerks and shifts attention from patients to paperwork-while health plans, government agencies, and the health data industry profit. Patients who think the HIPAA ''privacy'' rule protects the confidentiality of their medical information will be shocked to discover it makes their medical records an open book. Inside this book, discover:- how Congress forced doctors to install surveillance in the exam room- hard facts from over 125 studies and reports about the impact of EHRs on medical care, costs, patient safety, and more- how patient treatment decisions are controlled (and tracked) by the EHR- what specific steps back to freedom, privacy, and patient safety are available, and why we must act now.
