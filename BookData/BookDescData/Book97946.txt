Inspired by Dulle Griet (aka “Mad Meg"), Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s 16th-century painting of a “strong, intense woman striding determinedly across a violent landscape," Dull Margaret is the first graphic novel by Academy Award winning-actor Jim Broadbent (Harry Potter, Game of Thrones) and artist Dix (perhaps best known for his Roll Up! Roll Up! comics in the Guardian newspaper). The Dulle Griet painting shows a breastplated woman with a sword in one hand in front of the mouth of hell, and Broadbent uses that single, vivid image as a launching point to explore what the rest of Dull Margaret’s bleak existence may have been like.
