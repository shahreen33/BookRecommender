Have faith to see God turn the unexpected into the expected!  If you’re in need of a miracle, interceding for a loved one, or believing in God to move a mountain, getting on your knees is the easy part. The hard part is waiting. Not seeing the answers we long for can leave us feeling depressed and even doubtful. We begin fixing our eyes on the world around us, rather than the One who made the world.  Whether it’s been a day or a decade, don’t lose hope. You serve a mighty God, capable of doing immeasurably more than you could ever ask or imagine (Ephesians 3:20). Join me as we dive into God’s Word for insights and reassurance during your wait. He has a plan for your life, and His timing is always perfect.
