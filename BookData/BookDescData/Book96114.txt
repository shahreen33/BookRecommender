ERIKThe white picket fence.The happily-ever-after.That life was never meant for him.For years he’s been bouncing from city to city—from one cage fight to another.That’s his outlet. That’s pain Erik can control.But in Seattle, everything changed.River’s an artist.He’s a pretty boy.He does yoga.Someone so soft shouldn’t be intrigued by Erik’s rough edges.RIVERHis life was quiet. He had a simple routine.Designing tattoos, avoiding drama. Well, mostly.Then Erik comes along—scarred and dangerous, shrouded in mystery.A mystery River can’t resist trying to solve.Maybe a secret as dark as his own.Neither of them expected a relationship so complicated, so intense.Neither of them expected…each other.Erik and River are both trying to escape a shadowed past.But the thing about shadows is: the faster you run, the faster they chase you.
