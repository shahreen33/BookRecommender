Women learn the lesson early: Coveting money is greedy. Hustling for it is unladylike. Talking about it is crass. And so they develop a quiet contract: I'll do what it takes to get money, but I don't want to have to think about it. Maybe an extravagant purchase gets chalked up as a necessity. A few twenties disappear from the husband's wallet while he's in the shower. A raise goes unrequested. A looming debt gets pushed aside, just for the moment . . .  In Money, Liz Perle adds her own story of money and denial to the anecdotes and insights of psychologists, researchers, and more than two hundred ordinary women. The result is a bestselling book that "will force both men and women to ask hard and important questions about love, marriage, and money" (San Francisco magazine).
