Our arrangement was simple—just physical and definitely no falling in love. That seemed easy enough until a positive pregnancy test changed everything. He’s loud, crude, sexy, and can cook and he’s bound and determined to make me his, but I’ve been burned before and if I let him in, and things don’t work out for us, well, it’s more than just my heart on the line. Can I push past my issues to open my heart to that big beautiful man? As we navigate this unfamiliar terrain his enthusiasm begins to knock down the walls I’ve always kept around me, but we keep hitting obstacles that could ruin everything we’re trying to build. Am I strong enough to battle my own demons to move forward to a future that could promise to be everything I could’ve hoped for?
