 EDGE  My name is Dallas 'Edge' Masson and I'm the Soulless Bastards MC's enforcer.  I was raised by an evil bastard.  The apple didn't fall far from the tree.  I have personal business.  Whisper is my business.  I will be her judge and jury.  My father may have been Hell's Bastard, but he was still my father.  They say blood is thicker than water.  I'm about to find out.  WHISPER  Life has been a bitch to me.  I don't even know my full name.  I was a secret.  Miss Catherine changed my life.  I have friends.  I trust in people.  But then it all had to be wrenched away from me.
