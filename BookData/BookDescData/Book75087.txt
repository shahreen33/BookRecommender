Lewis Brock, First Peer of the ancient Haute-Forêt family on the planet of First Home has been accustomed to having his own way, so far as women are concerned. But when he is sent as envoy to an obscure and peaceful planet called Circe he meets a woman who will not let him have his own way. Tethyn Claibrook-Merjolaine lives her own vital and useful life on the planet she loves and plans never to leave, but although she clings fiercely to her independence, the appearance of the intriguing and commanding man disturbs her happy and comfortable existence. What the envoy does not understand at first is that Circe is a planet which possesses a mind, a planet which observes and thinks, a planet which likes and cares for the humans who live with her, sharing a special social contract. Circe’s humans are not exactly the same as other people, and Lewis has a lot to learn about Circe and about Tethyn. Over the years rumours about Circe have spread widely but no one has known exactly what she can do until she decides to make more open contact with First Home, the strongest planet of the solar system. Circe has sensed a distant but approaching threat from another sector of the galaxy and she realises that she will not be able to face it alone; she will also need the energy, ability and courage of the people of First Home. As part of the diplomatic program Tethyn must follow tradition and escort the envoy and his entourage on an expedition to her hidden family home where he will encounter the planet herself, see some of her powers and learn about her past. The envoy is deeply affected by the experience. During the excursion Tethyn admits to herself that she has come to love Lewis although in return she cannot hope for anything other than his desire. But desire is not enough, and Tethyn cannot face the life which Lewis offers her on First Home. Then personal danger for Lewis arrives with the appearance of his greatest enemy, and lives begin to alter.Cover by Vila Design
