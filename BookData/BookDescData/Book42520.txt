For most people, persocoms represent technology at its finest - after all, they can do anything you program them to and they make great looking companions. But for Yumi Oumura, persocoms bring out her deepest insecurities, and not without reason. Just as people once became addicted to their computers, many people are now addicted to their persocoms to the exclusion of other human beings.

Ordinarily this love would be considered one-sided, as how could a computer love a person back? When the persocom in question is the mysterious Chi, perhaps it's not such an impossibility.Chapters 61â€“72
