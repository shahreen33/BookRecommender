Can this beauty tame the beast? Her father's shop is more than just a family business. It's the place they lovingly call home. When a powerful property development company stoops to barely legal tactics to force them to sell, Lila's outrage spurs her straight to the source to fight the injustice. A serious accident left Hunter Jamison's body scarred. A bitter split from his latest lover has left the former playboy without faith in the female sex. Yet, confronted with Lila's fiery beauty, he finds himself offering her a deal: If she'll be his mistress for three months, he'll allow her father to keep the shop. A simple agreement? Hardly. It's a battle of wills that flares into much more than either of them bargained for-a consuming passion that could heal Hunter's soul-deep scars-or inflict new ones. Warning: This title contains blackmail, vehicular sex, angry sex, light bondage and graphic language.
