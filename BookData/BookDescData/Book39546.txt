  Be careful who you spill your secrets to... 
Some women just have it — that combination of stunning looks and sexual confidence that brings men to their knees.Not me. My last boyfriend once fell asleep while we were … you know. Not my proudest moment.And my crush on my hot, arrogant, and oh-so-unattainable CEO? Never going to happen.But one night, after too much wine, I find myself online, creating a profile for a sex kitten called SweetVixen. Safe behind my computer screen, I’m suddenly the seductive goddess of my wildest imagination. Next thing I know, I’ve spent a month sharing every filthy fantasy I’ve ever had with a man I know only as Mister Bigshot. A man who can make my toes curl with just a few keystrokes. A man who brings new meaning to the eggplant emoji. A man who now wants to meet in person. Dressed in my rarely-used little black dress and heels higher than my expectations, I gather my courage and cross the restaurant toward the stranger who’s been teasing me mercilessly all month. But then I come to a dead stop. Right in the middle of the restaurant. Frozen in place like a deer in the candlelight.Because the man sitting there waiting on me is no stranger.The man I’ve bared everything to — and I do mean everything — is none other than my hot, arrogant, and oh-so-unattainable CEO.Mister Bigshot is … my boss. And trust me, there’s no emoji for the look he's giving me right now ...
