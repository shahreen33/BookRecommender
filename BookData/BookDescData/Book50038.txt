   Tia It’s taken years of toil and sacrifice to get here: New York City. My goal is my career. To prove myself. To climb the ladder. The last thing I need is a man. But when my apartment falls through and I end up staying with my friend’s super-rich, super-ripped brother Alex, the temptation is overwhelming. I’m strong, I remind myself. I can resist him. Can’t I?  Alex I love playing the hero to a damsel in distress. So when I get the call from Tia I say yes right away. I answer the door expecting to see a timid, lost girl. I couldn’t be more wrong. Tia’s feisty, confident, and damn sexy. She doesn’t need me to be her hero. She doesn’t need me at all. And it makes me so much more determined to get her.  
  Roommate Material is a Valentine's Day romance novella with no-cliffhanger and lots of panty-melting scenes. HEA guaranteed!
