My name is Leona Tillard. I need your help. You see I have been spending my whole life trying to know who I am. I was born and raised in Akron, Ohio. Being a product of a temporary singled-parent home, I was left without some pertinent information that could have possibly told me who I am. Eventually, still a child, my family structure evolved into a blended family situation. In silence, I cried far more than I laughed. Don’t get me wrong. There was much love for me. I learned early in life that I was a very special little girl. People loved being in my presence but more than anything, my body was always desired. I didn’t want for anything. Life was good to me. I just didn’t understand love and what is considered being a normal human being. This is where I need your help. Would you listen to me as I tell you my story about my life? Tell me who really loved me. Am I really an angel or a freak of nature? Your help will be highly appreciated. In return, I promise to entertain you from beginning to end. Below find one of my thought processing moments. It came during a time I needed understanding. Until we meet, enjoy!“My body was betraying me in the worst way.“Oh, God, help me! I face you now in my naked and weakened state and beg you to save me.” I prayed silently.”
