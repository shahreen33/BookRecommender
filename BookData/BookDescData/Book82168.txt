 My house, my rules, and she better f**king like it.   I have a playboy reputation and I earned it. I can’t help it if I leave a trail of soaking wet and satisfied women in my wake.  Until my latest scandal lands me in hot water. Either I fix my image or the board of directors will force me to step down from the company that I founded. It’s bullsh*t, but I have no choice.  That’s why I marry my secretary and closest confidant. We’re not really into each other, but she says she’ll help when I offer her an outrageous sum of money.  It sounds like an easy plan right up until I meet her daughter, Emily. I’m supposed to be good, but her gorgeous curves and innocent baby blues make me want to be very, very bad.  If I get caught with Emily, it’s game f**king over. I’ll lose absolutely everything, and it’ll destroy her in the process.  But I can’t keep my hands off her. She’s so deliciously tempting that I can barely control myself when she walks into the room. I know I’ll ruin her, but she’s begging for me to make it dirtier and dirtier.  She may be incredibly off limits, but I’ll break every rule to get a taste.  Man of the House is a dark romance with steamy scenes and bad language. It’s only recommended for readers 18+.  Man of the House is a STANDALONE, full-length novel. No cliffhanger. Guaranteed HEA. Includes bonus content!
