Erotic Novella:  When Tristan took a dishwashing job at the Black Ribbon strip club, he expected five weekends of work and enough money to cover his bills until school started up again. He didn’t expect to meet the sex god Cade Rue and be lured in by the man’s inherent sexual magnetism. What began as innocent flirting and lots of day dreaming, on Tristan’s part, turned into the sexual night of Tristan’s life. Will this be just a one night stand or will it be so much more. If Cade’s wolf has anything to say about it, this encounter will lead to forever.
