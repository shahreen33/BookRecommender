The minor leagues are largely misunderstood, more well known for the players who have skipped through their ranks than the ones who reside in them. They’re a mysterious land of hotels, bus rides, and clubhouses. Upon being drafted out of UC Irvine by the Phillies, right-handed pitcher Eric Pettis didn’t quite know what he was getting himself into. Just A Minor Perspective allows readers to jump into Eric’s mind and experience the journey along with him. The narrative resembles stream-of-consciousness as he describes the good, the bad, and the ugly of the minor leagues as it hits him square in the face for the first time.From his first day in Philadelphia..."I tried to open the door in a manner that would exude confidence in the off chance that my new teammate was an expert on body language and would be analyzing my entry."To the heat of the battle..."As I hopped over the foul line I could feel my body try to rev itself up. It was pleading with me to get something going. It knew how significant this was... As hard as my body tried, it couldn’t muster anything. I tried again and again to turn the key, but my engine just wouldn’t start."Eric gives an honest, pointed, and often humorous account of what he feels when he’s feeling it. Just A Minor Perspective is a gripping story of one man’s attempt to find his place in a new world; a scramble to conquer the first rung of the professional baseball ladder.
