25th anniversary edition of the groundbreaking classic with a new introduction.First published in 1993 on the one-year anniversary of the L.A. riots, Race Matters was a national best-seller that has gone on to sell more than half a million copies, and become a classic on race in America. Cornel West addresses a range of issues, from the crisis in black leadership and the myths surrounding black sexuality to affirmative action, the new black conservatism, and the strained relations between Jews and African Americans. He never hesitates to confront the prejudices of all his readers or wavers in his insistence that they share a common destiny. Bold in its thought and written with a redemptive passion grounded in the tradition of the African-American church, Race Matters is a book that is at once challenging and deeply healing.
