It was temptation that broke the sinner.People say I have everything. They’re wrong. I may have looks, money, and privilege, but I don’t have the one thing that really matters, the one thing I crave: a woman with eyes only for me. I’m searching for my woman—one who will fall to her knees because I’m her king. She’ll wear the crown of my tarnished name, and long for me when I’m not near. And when I am close, she’ll be naked across my lap, feeling the sting of my palm across her milky skin. You could say I’m a sinner because I’d do anything to have the perfect woman—compliant to my every need and whim—and I’m envious of every couple who walks around naive to the luxury they have. That’s why I joined The Elite, the most prestigious brotherhood in the south. It’s the one place that will give me what I cannot have.Only…the task assigned to me is too much for my jealous eyes.Accept your sin wisely, for the tasks given to earn your place are not for the weak...they’re for The Elite.Those who envy have no peace.My name is Sabastian Westbrook. I am Envy. ***The Elite Seven SeriesLust (The Elite Seven, #1) by Ker DukeyPride (The Elite Seven, #2) by J.D. HollyfieldWrath (The Elite Seven, #3) by Claire C.
