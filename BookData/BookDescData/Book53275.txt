   I left here a man but came back a beast
CHANCEA shoulder-fired missile broke my body. But betrayal obliterated my heart. For months I lingered in and out of hell until my body healed.Now I’m back in town with my club brothers. They think I am ok. But I am still fighting a war of darkness in my head and I can’t see a way out.Then she comes into town like a summer breeze and makes me feel things I didn’t know existed.She has the voice of an angel and the body of a goddess.But she is running from her own demons. From the Devil himself.He's coming to town and she's scared. But I've walked through hell and survived, and I'll walk through it again to protect her. CASSIDY I’ve spent years running from my past. Town to town.State to state. Never putting down roots. Because I am running from the Devil himself and if he finds me he will drag me down to hell again.Then I meet a beautiful, scarred beast of man who makes me feel something for the first time of my life...hope.He makes me want to stay but thats an impossibility.Because the Devil is coming for me and when he arrives I won't stand a chance.
