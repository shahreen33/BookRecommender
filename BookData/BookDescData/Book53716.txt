Sometimes two broken pieces make a whole.  He’s the one she’s always loved.  She’s the one he could never have.  A forbidden night of passion resulted in years of heartbreak when he walked away. Now she’s in danger and needs his help.  Trust doesn’t come easy for FBI Agent Nick Stone, especially when it comes to love, but he’ll risk it all for Katelyn Slade.  Including his heart.  Bullets fly, betrayals are exposed, and the flames from their past ignite.  His protection might be what saves her but in the end she will be his salvation.  This is Book two in the Acts Of Honor series, the spin-off series to Men Of Honor. It’s Nick and Katelyn’s story and is told in dual POV, has an HEA with no cliffhanger and it can be read as a standalone. However, I highly recommend that you read the Men Of Honor series prior, as characters play recurring roles in both series.  Warning: Due to mature subject matter, such as explicit sexual situations and coarse language, this story is not suitable for anyone under the age of 18.
