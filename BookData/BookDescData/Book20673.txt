I’m not pretending or fantasizing. I’ve never been this honest with a woman before. When I say I won’t be nice…it’s closer to the truth to say that I will be cruel. I’m not offering you safety or love; I’m not offering you romance with tender kisses. What I offer most consider sadistic and brutal; the best of what I offer is my respect if you can be what I want, what I demand.
