One click. One perfect frame. That's all it takes to capture an eternal moment; although most people let them pass by without acknowledgement. I don't waste any. Not a single one. If I see something of beauty, I want to experience it, feel it and immortalise it. If I see someone of beauty, I want to taste them, worship them and memorise them. I don't have a type, if I like you, I like you. I don't have a preference. My bisexuality is a gift, not a defect. It's the freedom to see beyond gender. One blink. One touch. One night. Life is filled with so many ones. One chance to get things right. One life to live as you choose. One decision that gives you acceptance. One person to fill the emptiness. Just one? Nah, like I said, life is full of ones. My camera lets me focus on the good times; I develop from life's negatives, and if things don't work out, I just take another shot. Who needs just one?  Book #5 in the 'Love by Numbers' series. Can be read as a standalone.
