Listening to Bethlehem is a new novella by Cymru Roberts with artwork and book design by Hugh Frost.“The [book] is not evil.... but it is dark.” So says bassist Jürgen Bartsch of his dark metal band Bethlehem. So it is, that we listen, on overcast days when no music is playing, and what do we hear coming from behind the clouds but the hallmarks of a Third Destiny (?!) NOW INSIDE! A book with three protagonists: Bryan is good (but flawed, some might even say self-destructive), CK is totally pure evil/sooo happy, and Travie... well Travis is hard to explain. I met Traviana on a train, and what happened really kinda, like, freaked me out :(. Let’s see how their stories intersect; or, maybe they have nothing to do with each other besides an ominous sense of dark serendipity. *POZOR* Read at your own wrist. Literature doesn’t exist anymore—and when boundaries are vaporized, anything is possible.™️™️Children under 18 must have parents or legal guardians read this book to them by their bedside, preferably accompanied by small glasses of leche calentitiiiita. :)"Heartbreaking and stunning. I honestly can’t believe it. I took this to my bookclub and have since been banned for life."––Marianne Coltrane, mother of 2 from Tulsa, OK
