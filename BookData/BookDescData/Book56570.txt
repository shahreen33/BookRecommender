It’s been five days since I’ve seen Regan. Five days of unanswered calls, five days of unread messages, and five days of letting my anger fester to the point it isn’t healthy.She is the cause of the fury slicking my veins, the reason I can’t numb my feelings. I need her, but instead of standing beside me as I face my darkest day, she stays at his side, protecting him, sheltering him. Choosing him.I understand she’s mad, she caught me in a lie, but I can’t fix the mistakes I’ve made if she refuses to talk to me. I guess I should be grateful? Maybe she’s staying away because she’s trying to save me more heartache, because she doesn’t want to come clean. I’m not the only one at fault here. I did wrong, but so did she. There’s just one difference: I chose the right side of the law. She didn’t.
