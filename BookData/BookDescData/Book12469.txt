I was a good girl. I ate my vegetables, volunteered at the local autism centre and sat in the front pew of church every Sunday.Then, I got cancer.What the hell kind of reward was that for a boring life well lived?I was a seventeen-year-old paradigm of virtue and I was tired of it. So, when I finally ran into the man I'd been writing to since he saved my life as a little girl and he offered to show me the dark side of life before I left it for good, I said yes. Only, I didn't know that Zeus Garro was the President of The Fallen MC and when you made a deal with a man who is worse than the devil, there was no going back...This is Daddy Zeus Garro's story from Lessons In Corruption. A standalone in The Fallen Men Series.
