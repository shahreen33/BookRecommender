Welcome to America's most dangerous town. Ian Donovan lives a life on the edge. The bastard son of an alpha, he's a lone wolf fighting to survive in the Colorado wilds. No pack. No code. Until the woman showed up. Anna Gold studies shifters - their secret rituals, their renegade lives. Everyone knows shifters are untrustworthy and deadly, especially in the hard-luck, shifter-only town of Shifter Falls. But Anna has never met a wolf until the day she springs Ian from prison to study him. Not only is Ian so hot he's a distraction, he's definitely dangerous. And he's the wrong guy to fall for. Because the pack alpha is dead. A new leader must be chosen. An Ian's three brothers want to kill him for it. No one said life in the Falls was easy...  **This is a standalone, full-length book with NO cliffhanger**
