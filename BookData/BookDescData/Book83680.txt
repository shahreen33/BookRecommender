 This is no fairytale, and I’m no prince. And there are much more dangerous things in these woods than big bad wolves or poisoned apples. Things like me.  They’ll say this is wrong.  They’ll say she’s too young for me - that she’s too untouched.  They’ll say a sweet and innocent princess like her has no business being anywhere near a roughneck soldier like me.  They’re right.  But poisoned apple or not, I’ve had a taste of her forbidden fruit, and I’ll be damned if I’m not after another bite.  She should run away. She should say no. But she seems to be having a problem saying anything but yes to the things I want to show her.  Very, very bad things.  Her father, my King, wants to send her to suitor’s ball to find a husband. Royal or not, I’ll show these fancy, frilly princes what a real man is, and I’ll show her how a real man claims his woman.  Princess Adele might not’ve been looking for trouble when she stepped into my woods, but she’s about to find it.  Every inch of it.   *Please note that each of the Possessing Beauty books are completely standalone stories centered around one couple, with no cliffhangers.  This one’s so sweet it’ll make your fillings hurt. Hunting Beauty is a quick and steamy modern fairytale involving an utterly obsessed alpha hero and enough insta-love, kindle-melting steam, and sugary-sweetness to make you swoon for more. If you love over-the-top, slightly unrealistic, and wildly dirty stories, this one’s for you! HEA with NO CHEATING!
