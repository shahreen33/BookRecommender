When a circus caravan is torn apart by a destructive summer storm, the show's tattooed man and his fellow performers are scattered across the wheat fields of a nameless hamlet. The tempest's survivors convene at a local boarding house, but a series of violent attacks and strange deaths sabotage their attempts to regroup. The show's tattooed man is Sue, a middle-aged, world-weary war veteran whose days are haunted by dark memories. At night his inks call to him, seemingly alive. As the circus strains to stay the course, Sue's sense of reality begins to fragment -- and something reaches for him from the recesses of his past."Keith McCleary writes like a hard-boiled Nick Cave, while the wandering spirits of Harry Crews and Katherine Dunn look on in grim whimsy. His fast-paced yet character-driven tale of geeks and lion-tamers, bendable women and sinister showmen, and an illustrated man named Sue who can never outrun his past--or his present--never flags. CIRCUS+THE SKIN is a high-wire act of the tender, the fierce, and the deeply macabre." --Adrian Van Young, author of Shadows in Summerland and The Man Who Noticed Everything
