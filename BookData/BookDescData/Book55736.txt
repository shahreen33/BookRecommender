Lincoln I’ve done a good job getting over my past. I’m not only proud of who I am, but revel in it. Still, I don’t let myself get too close to people. With closeness comes questions and those pesky feelings, and I’m having none of that. I’ve got a great job, friends, I’m cute and twinky, and my bed’s never empty. What more do I need? Except I can’t stop sleeping with Rush Alexander. I try, I really do, but I just can’t stay away, and that, ladies and gentlemen, is stressing me out. Rush has the power to hurt me—something I swore I’d never let happen again. Unfortunately, things become a little more complicated when I tell a white lie that lands me in a fake relationship with him. Yeah, not my best moment.  Rush I’ve always been an easygoing guy and don’t let many things get to me. I’ve worked hard to make my dream of becoming a professional motocross racer come true, and everything else is icing on the cake. Like Lincoln Gray, for example. I need to tread carefully, even though I want more from him than our occasional hookups. If I give what we have too much throttle, we’ll crash and burn. But when Linc accidentally announces we’re boyfriends in front of my mom, the race is on. First, I have to show him there’s more between us than the way we burn up the sheets together. When Linc finally trusts me in ways he doesn’t anyone else, there’s no turning back. I’m a firm believer that nothing worth having comes easily, and Lincoln Gray is worth it all.
