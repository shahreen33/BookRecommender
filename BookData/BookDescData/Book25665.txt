"I may have had more lovers than you, and I may take my clothes off for countless women, but you are the only one who can strip me bare." Do you ever stop loving someone just because they’re gone? Five years ago, Ryan Pierce disappeared from Alana Remington’s life without a trace. He was the one she gave her heart to, her soul to — and her virginity to. So, imagine her surprise when she finds him dancing at one of NYC’s hottest male revues as ‘Jack the Stripper.’ Ryan never stopped loving Alana, and now that she has serendipitously dropped back into his life, he’s vowed never to lose her again. But being together has its costs, and challenges Alana isn’t sure she can handle. She finally has Ryan back. But how in the world is she supposed to share the love of her life with half of the women in New York City? Strip Me Bare is a standalone, second chance romance. It contains angst, heat, humor, heartbreak, and one seductive male stripper who will not only steal your panties, but also your heart. You’ve been warned.
