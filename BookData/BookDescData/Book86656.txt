Tails have many functions: communicating, warning, stinging, grasping, swimming, and many more. Some lizards surrender their tails to predators, then grow new ones, while kangaroos stand on their tails for balance while fighting. Some tails, such as scorpion tails, have venom in them, while other tails, such as porcupine and rattlesnake tails, send visual and acoustic warnings. Fun, easy experiments illustrate the ways animal tails work, and tail tricks and trivia will amaze family and friends. Includes a glossary and index.
