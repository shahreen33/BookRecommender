Lost Angel Walkabout-One Traveler#x2019;s Tales is a spirited collection of travel narratives recounting the haps, mishaps, and serendipitous adventures that give, travel-writer Linda Ballou, a sense of wonder and delight. Some of the stories like Falling in the Footsteps of John Muir and Look Both Ways on Small Islands are reflections that might make you glad you stayed home, while River Wise could inspire you to toss the TV clicker out the window and to explore our beautiful planet. All of the stories take you to special places where you share the sensual experience of being there without straining one muscle, getting altitude sickness, or tipping your canoe. This is an eclectic mix of tales filled with chills, spills, giggles and squeaks!
