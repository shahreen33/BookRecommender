Wanted: Discreet Dominant gentleman to teach maybe-submissive woman the rules of the game. No whips, chains, paddles, handcuffs, ropes, or toys. No nookie. No creepy stuff. No butt stuff. No gluten. Just the facts, Sir. Serious enquiries only. –CuriousCat4  When I see the ad in the Portland Alternative’s “Love Wanted” section, I can’t resist the urge to respond. Yes, it’s dangerous—as a star forward for the Badgers I have a reputation to protect—but I miss the thrill of calling the shots in the bedroom and reading that ad is the first time I’ve laughed in months.  So I reach out to Curious Cat about the “educational” opportunity...  A few sizzling—and hysterical—emails later we arrange to meet. I’m hoping we’ll have chemistry, and I might finally be on my way to getting over my ex-girlfriend.  And then the gate to the beer garden swings open and in walks Hailey.  My ex is Curious Cat, and this experiment just got a hell of a lot more complicated. ​But I never back down from a challenge—on or off the ice.  I keep my educational offer on the table—six weeks of submissive lessons. Six weeks to learn how to drive a Dominant man crazy, and then we part ways as friends.  What do I have to lose? Except what’s left of my heart?
