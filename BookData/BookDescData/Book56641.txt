“Why won’t you let me love you?”“What if I don’t know how?”Between my job and my two beautiful, yet medically fragile children, my plate is full.Add a failed marriage to a drama loving, asshole ex-husband, into the mix,And I’ve had enough heartache to last a lifetime.Then I met Liam.One look at him in just his tight jeans, his muscles bulgingAnd my thighs clench.I’ve never met a man quite like him, before. But, with him being my new boss Not to mention my brothers’ best friend, he is OFF LIMITS.Try telling that to my heart though.Sometimes you just have to take a chance.Liam is the biggest risk I’ve ever taken.Will this be the happiness I’ve longed for, or just another crack in my already broken heart?
