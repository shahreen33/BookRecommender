Once again, all was well in the Carlson household. Better than ever, perhaps. Mary and Maddy, the twin daughters of Adelaide and Ron had grown into beautiful, independent women......only much faster than expected. In five years they had aged what appeared to be twenty. It was not the fact that they had become strippers and bragged about their love of sex toys that distressed their parents. Instead it was the thought of living forever only to see their daughters die well before their time. And yet another terror had presented itself: Xartasia. She came back, and this time she wasn't alone. With Janice out of the picture, performing her role as a top CIA agent, and the seemingly absent trolls, will the Carlson clan be forced to rely on their own devices to battle the Martian evil? Perhaps not. Two friendly visitors from the Red Planet have come to assist, and a pack of angry Mormons may have some role to play in all of this too.
