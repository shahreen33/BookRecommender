A sexy category romance novella from Entangled's Brazen imprint...She was off-limits...until now.Vegas was a bad idea. There's no real good reason for a Marine to be stranded in the desert...and yet here I am. Hungover as hell, bruised, and bloodied. The tequila was just another mistake in a long line of mistakes. So naturally she had to be the one to come and save my sorry ass. The girl who broke my heart. My ex-best pal's little sister...And dammit, I still want Erica Jones as much as I did all those years ago. Tried to tell her I loved her then, and she ran. Now I just need to touch that smooth-as-silk skin, worshipping the curves of her body. But she and I? We always see through each other, and something's changed. And despite how screwed up we are, this time I'm going to prove myself to her...to hell with the consequences.Previously released on the Ever After imprint in May 2012.
