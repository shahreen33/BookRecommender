For the newcomer and old hand alike the Discworld can be a fatally confusing planet. From the great city of Ankh-Morpork, featuring a river you could skateboard across if it wasn't so knobbly, to the distant Ramtop Mountains and mysterious Counterweight Continent, the Discworld is a place where Death waits around every corner... For safety's sake, you need a guide. And here it is. Terry Pratchett and Stephen Briggs, respectively chronicler and cartographer of the Discworld, have the produced the one and only definitive guide to the flat planet - its geography, its flora and fauna, its (many) religions, its architecture and customs, and its outstanding personalities. What is a Quantum Weather Butterfly? What does Death keep on his desk? Would you drink Bearhugger's Homeopathic Sipping Whiskey? How are the kings of Ankh-Morpork different from the kings of Ankh? Everything the Discworld traveller needs to know is contained in these pages, together with useful maps and illustrations of significant places and emblems in this unique world.
