Hilary and Mark Bradley are trapped in a web of suspicion. Last year, accusations of a torrid affair with a student cost Mark his teaching job and made the young couple outcasts in their remote island town off the Lake Michigan coast. Now a teenage girl is found dead on a deserted beach, and once again, Mark faces a hostile town convinced of his guilt. Hilary Bradley is determined to prove that Mark is innocent, but she's on a lonely, dangerous quest. Even when she discovers that the murdered girl was witness to a horrific crime years earlier, the police are certain she's throwing up a smoke screen to protect her husband. Only a quirky detective named Cab Bolton seems willing to believe Hilary's story. Hilary and Cab soon find that people in this community are willing to kill to keep their secrets hidden--and to make sure Mark doesn't get away with murder. With each shocking revelation, even Hilary begins to wonder whether her husband is truly innocent. Freeman's first stand-alone thriller since his Stride novels is a knockout.
