​Unmarried, childless, and in her 40s, Julie Rowse is an anomaly in the Mormon faith tradition, and she’s looking for an explanation for why her life hasn’t turned out like the lives of the girls in her school and church. In this memoir, she reflects on how popular culture and her faith influence her expectations of dating and marriage. Rowse offers readers a glimpse of the tension that a single Latter Day Saints woman tries to manage as she chooses to continue living her faith despite being outside the norm of LDS culture. Relying on the works of Jane Austen, John Hughes, and Cameron Crowe, she draws parallels between the pantheon of romantic comedy writers and her own relationships. L​ies Jane Austen Told Me is one woman’s journey to understand what has shaped her spiritually and socially.
