THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE NEW ON-GOING SERIESFrom writer, BRIAN AZZARELLO and artist, EDUARDO RISSO -- the Eisner award-winning creative team behind the crime classic, 100 Bullets -- comes a brutal new series! Set during Prohibition, and deep in the backwoods of Appalachia, MOONSHINE #1 tells the story of LOU PIRLO, a city-slick "torpedo" sent from New York City to negotiate a deal with the best moonshiner in West Virginia, one HIRAM HOLT. Lou figures it for milk run -- how hard could it be to set-up moonshine shipments from a few ass-backward hillbillies? What Lou doesn't figure on is that Holt is just as cunning as ruthless as any NYC crime boss and Lou is in way over his pin-striped head. Because not only will Holt do anything to protect his illicit booze operation, he'll stop at nothing to protect a much darker family secret...a bloody, supernatural secret that must never see the light of day...or better still, the light of the full moon. Volume one of MOONSHINE reunites the acclaimed creative team that defined modern crime comics with 100 Bullets...and now puts a horror-twist on a classic gangster tale! Collects Issues 1-6
