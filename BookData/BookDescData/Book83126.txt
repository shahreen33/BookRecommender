 
  You never mess with a young girl around James Brownstone.
 It doesn't matter what crime syndicate you belong to, that just doesn't sit well with him.The world has changed since the news of Oriceran came out twenty years before. Now, countries all over the world have agreed to using a bounty system for dangerous criminals using advanced magic or advanced technology.
  People too powerful for the cops to deal with.
Magical criminals, thugs and bounty hunters, in the future we revert to what worked in the past.
  if you find out you are hunted by Brownstone, we suggest you turn yourself in. 
  
It will save you a monumental ass-kicking.
  
  Brownstone likes his life simple, but Life is about to throw him a wicked curveball.
  

  NOTE: This book contains cursing. Perhaps humorous cursing, but cursing nevertheless. If this offends you, I don't suggest reading this book.
