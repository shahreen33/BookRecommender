They call him ‘Wilde Man’. Rumor has it he’s an animal on the ice and between the sheets.  Like the rest of the female population, I’ve been crushing on Clancy Wilde, the captain of Boston University’s hockey team, since the first time I saw him. Big, blond, and charming, he ticks all the boxes.  When we find ourselves at a wedding, drunk and flirting, I know I can finally check this tattooed, bad boy, hockey player off my wish list.  One night is all it was meant to be, until I see two pink lines on the pregnancy test.  How did the notch on my belt turn into a ball and chain?
