The Feminist Theory Reader provides a revolutionary new approach to anthologizing the important works in feminist theory by incorporating the voices of women of color and postcolonial scholars throughout. Classic works in feminist theory by scholars such as Simone de Beauvoir, Judith Butler, Charlotte Bunch, Adrienne Rich, Donna Haraway and Monique Wittig appear alongside Amrita Basu, Gayatri Gopinath, Ji Yeon Lee, Gloria Anzaldua, and Chandra Mohanty, providing both local and global perspectives and infusing the collection with the vitality needed for contemporary study.By incorporating global perspectives throughout the anthology, the Reader itself offers a challenge to the hegemony of white, Western feminism, providing an approach to feminist theory for the twenty-first century. This approach includes the conversations among postcolonial women and women of color about issues of gender, race, colonialism, and sexuality as paramount to understanding the concerns of feminism. This important new Reader will soon become the definitive collection of classic and contemporary readings in feminist theory.
