I survived my first semester at the Academy of Unpredictable Magic. Apparently, the universe took that as a challenge…For years, Unpredictables have been brushed aside by the rest of the magical community. Now people are starting to pay attention—and I’m not entirely sure that’s a good thing.I’ve always been content to fly under the radar, but now that we’ve been invited to participate in the Inter-academy Trials, the entire school will be in the spotlight.As if trying to sort out my feelings for the four insanely gorgeous men who all want to date me wasn’t enough, now I’m juggling magical games, deadly plots, unexpected allies, and notoriety I never asked for.All right, second semester. Do your worst.Trials is the second book in the Academy of Unpredictable Magic series, a medium-burn reverse harem story intended for ages 18+, featuring a badass chick and the four sexy men who fall in love with her.
