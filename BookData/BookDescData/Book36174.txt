All through the year, this shaggy, raggy, rumbly, bumbly bear faces down whatever comes his way: bee stings and scolding squirrels, cold rushing rivers and prickly bushes. And he does it all with a spring in his step and a smile on his face. There’s just one thing he can't abide. Luckily, he knows exactly what to do about it.     Season by season, Alice Schertle and Matt Phelan lead us through a year in the life of a charming, resourceful, and quite hairy bear.
