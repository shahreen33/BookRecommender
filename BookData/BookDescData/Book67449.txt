 When I realized I had a stalker, I swore off men completely.   That was until four extremely hot men came into my life.  They’re all gorgeous, muscular, gifted in the arts, and rich, and for some reason, interested in me.  I’ve never been this attracted to anyone, let alone four at once.  I couldn’t choose, and luckily, they don’t want me to.  It takes a special kind of man to not let jealousy get in the way, and I’ve found four of them.  It actually goes beyond rare, it’s magical.  But the closer my stalker gets, the more I realize that he’s no ordinary being.  My four magical lovers might not even be enough to protect me.  They tell me they couldn’t stand to lose me, and I can’t stop them from risking their lives.  But I couldn’t stand to lose one of them.  Knowing it would be my fault they are gone.
