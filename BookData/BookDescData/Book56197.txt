A ghost storySomething is Lurking Under the Lake…  When Owen Saddler's little sister mysteriously drowns, Owen is determined to uncover the circumstances by following in her footsteps, even if it means diving into the murky—some would say haunted—waters of Chapel Lake.  Thirty years earlier, the town of Peace Falls had been flooded to build a hydroelectric dam, and its ruins remain below the surface of Chapel Lake. The strange disappearance of the town Pastor, along with many of the parishioners, still haunts the citizens of Chapel Lake. But does the church haunt the lake itself? Is Owen really seeing ghosts… or has he descended into the depths of madness?  SALVAGE is the debut horror novel of author Duncan Ralston (GRISTLE &amp; BONE). A darkly disturbing story of depression, religious fanaticism, and the afterlife, SALVAGE seeks to illuminate the evil within us all.
