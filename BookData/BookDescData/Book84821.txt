The lack of teaching cases in program evaluation is often cited as a gap in the field. This ground-breaking book fills this gap, covering the essentials of program evaluation as it is used in education and with a wide variety of evaluation projects to be discussed, analyzed, and reflected upon. The book covers the essentials of program evaluation, including foundation and types of evaluation, tools for collecting data, writing of reports, and sharing of findings. Individual cases cover classroom instruction, community-based program, teacher training, professional development, a secondary-school based program, after-school program, reading achievement, school-improvement grant, and confidentiality. Each case is structured to include learning objectives, program description, evaluation plan, summary of evaluation activities and findings, key concepts, discussion questions, class activities, and suggested reading. As useful for students as it is for evaluators in training, Program Evaluation in Practice is a must-have for those aspiring to become effective evaluators.
