  Declan’s quest seems simple enough. Find an older man who defers to him and remain in control of every aspect of his life.
  Twenty-five-year-old wealthy businessman, Declan Moore, thrives on taking charge of situations and people. It’s what he’s good at. Too bad he can’t find an older man who’s willing to relinquish total control and let him take charge.  
  Then he meets Owen, the older submissive. 
  For the past fifteen years, Owen Long brought up his three children on his own, dedicating his life to raising them right and minimizing the impact of their mother abandoning them. Now his youngest has left the nest, the forty-six-year-old is stuck, not sure of his position in the world. His life’s practically over or so he thinks until a younger man with an unusual kink enters his life and proves otherwise.  Owen has no problem giving up control to Declan. In fact, after the long years of putting his now adult children first, he craves the attention Declan gives, but dare he go further and accept the role Declan wants him to play? Can he completely let go of his hang-ups about Declan’s age and let the younger man take care of him? Both men must learn it's okay to trust and when it’s time to give in.
