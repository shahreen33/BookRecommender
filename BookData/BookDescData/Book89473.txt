Hustle is a step-by-step guide to breaking out of the monotony of the 9-5 lifestyle and making your dreams a reality. It lays out the tools you need to realise the work you enjoy and gain the confidence and motivation to be in charge of your own adventures. In a world where loyalty doesn’t translate into success learn how to get ahead and discover a more imaginative way of living. Hustle is split into three parts: ‘The Heart’, which teaches you how to follow your own dreams rather than others; ‘The Head’ covers how to get started and how to prepare for the mistakes that can come with risk; finally, ‘The Habits’ demonstrates how to spot opportunities and create your own luck. Hustle explains how realigning these parts will bring more momentum, money and meaning to your life.Neil Patel, Patrick Vlaskovits and Jonas Koffler know all too well that not all of us are born extra ordinary, and how in fact, for the majority of people hustling is not second nature. Each of the authors has figured out how to secure a more imaginative way of living through work that defines, but also reflects and rewards their strengths and talents.
