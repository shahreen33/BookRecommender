For millennia, the human heart was the deepest of mysteries, as untouchable as the human soul.But we have always been curious and frail, and by the twentieth surgeons were exploring the secret recesses of the human body, searching out the heart’s imperfections, holes and tears, and with the advent of World War, bullets.The implications of these life-changing endeavours stretch far beyond the merely surgical and into a dizzying moral maze. What should we make of the grotesque and macabre experiments of the Russian surgeons who created bizarre and unnatural animal hybrids, the advances of vivisection, or the moral dilemma of transplants that led to the redefinition of death across the globe and the coining of the phrase ‘brain dead’?The Matter of the Heart is a story of human ingenuity, perseverance and ambition, an astonishing compendium of technological invention, alongside some catastrophic failures, bringing us right up to the medical miracles of the present day.
