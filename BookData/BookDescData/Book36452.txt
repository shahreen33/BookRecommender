In a realm where toxic mist sweeps the lands and magic is forbidden, all Bleak wants is a cure for her power.  Still grieving the death of her guardian and dangerously self-medicating with alcohol, Bleak is snatched from her home by the Commander of the King’s Army, and summoned to the capital. But the king isn’t the only one interested in Bleak's powers.  The leader of an infamous society of warriors, the Valia Kindred, lays claim to her as well, and Bleak finds herself in the middle of a much bigger battle than she anticipated.  Heart of Mist is the gripping first book in The Oremere Chronicles, a fantasy series of epic proportions.   "A brilliant, absorbing read - I absolutely loved it. The dark, rich characterisation, the wonderful world building, the breathtaking plot and the beautiful writing make the whole experience a joy from start to finish." - Alexandra Nahlous  "Heart of Mist is captivating in its world-building and brilliant character development.
