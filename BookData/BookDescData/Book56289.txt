Where Confidence is the New Black.  Meet best friends Pixie, Ellie, Katie and Jane. Fed up with always struggling to lose weight, they ditch the scales and start a social club where size doesn't matter. Soon it's the most popular place to be - having fun instead of counting calories - and the women find their lives changing in ways they never imagined.  But the club can't stop real life from mucking things up.  Sharing offices in a taxidermist's garage with Pete the bear, together they've got to manage more than their new club - dodgy colleagues, a waste-of-space husband and sabotaged romance - while learning the most important lesson of all. In the Curvy Girls Club, confidence is the new black.  "This is a delightful book of friendship, acceptance, and belonging for anyone who has ever wondered: "What if?"" Publishers Weekly
