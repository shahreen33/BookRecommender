Goong Volume 1 features story and art by Park SoHee. Monarchy ended long ago in Korea, but there are still other countries with kings, queens, princes and princesses. What if Korea had continued monarchism? What if all the beautiful palaces which are now only historical relics were actually filled with people? What if the glamorous royal family still maintained the palace customs? Welcome to a world where Korea still has the royal family, and high school girl Che-Kyung has to marry the prince - who apparently is a total bastard!
