It's time for the annual Corn Maze Festival.   The farm is bursting with activity.   Cluck Whack!   The chickens build a fence around the cornfield.   Moo Thwack!   The cows give the barn a fresh coat of paint.   Thump. Quack!   Duck builds the ticket booth for the hot-air balloon ride.   Everyone is excited. Well, Duck is not excited exactly. But he has a plan. As Farmer Brown designs the corn maze for the festival, Duck does some designing of his own. Guess who's in for a big surprise?   The always-creative, always-hilarious, always-champions-of-corn-mazes pair who brought you Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That Type; Giggle, Giggle, Quack; and Duck for President have planned a terrific event. Step right up, folks.
