The man who shattered her dreams as well as her heart, five years ago. He's asking for forgiveness, but he's not the only one who needs forgiving, for she too made a mistake.  As they struggle to mend what's broken between them, an outside force threatens Cassie, and Gage's relentless pursuit, turns into an overwhelming desire to protect the woman he loves.

While Engaging can be enjoyed as a stand-alone, it is part of a series started with Alluring and contains some spoilers. **Trigger warning** This book deals with the abuse and rescue of "fighting dogs". No dogs are killed. I am an avid animal lover and wanted to spread the word that animal cruelty is NOT okay.
