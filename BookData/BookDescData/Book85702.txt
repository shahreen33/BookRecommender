She says she has a three date rule. She thinks she doesn’t do serious. She thinks she’s prepared for me.And I’m about to prove her wrong. Penny has no idea I’m the chubby, nerdy kid she went to high school with—I shed that baby fat on a surfboard after graduation, though I am still a massive nerd, spending the bulk of my time and energy coding my video game. The last thing I expect to find in New York is her.The second I see her smile, I recognize her: the girl I’d crushed on since sophomore year. The girl who dated the biggest asshole in our school—the same guy who might have ruined her for me.She can tell herself all day that she won’t fall for me, but she doesn’t stand a chance. Because I know exactly what I want, and it’s her. And I’ll do whatever it takes to have her.But everyone has limits, and Penny will test mine. And the moment I have her heart in my hand is the moment I stand to lose her forever.
