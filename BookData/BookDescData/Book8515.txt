I am a sociopath. I know this because I diagnosed myself.I have a PhD in Clinical Psychology from a very prestigious university.I am charming, attractive, and you probably want to sleep with me.I take what I want, when I want, and I enjoy picking the most tragic of all my patients to experiment with.I have no remorse, I am unrelenting in my pursuit of tragedy, and I am about to meet my match.Her name is not important, I am only allowed to call her Mistress. She is a femme fatale, a patient, and now an obsession.She will destroy me, I will do anything to get inside of her.I can already feel her inside of me.**Trigger warning. This novel contains situations of perversity and dubious consent. It is not a love story, but more of a journey through a few short days in the life of a madman. What you see is not always what you get, reality is altered through his eyes and sometimes there is no happily ever after.
