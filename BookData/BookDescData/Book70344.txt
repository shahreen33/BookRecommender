A witch in need…  Mpenzi Munro’s life changes forever when a mysterious parcel arrives from her father’s lawyers. Penzi has been looking after her two younger brothers for the past seven years in their home in Notting Hill Gate, London – ever since their mother ran away to find herself. The strange parcel contains amongst other documents her absentee father’s Last Will and Testament. The children’s inheritance depends upon Penzi’s moving the family to France, to her father’s old holiday home. No one wants to make the move least of all Penzi who has recently established herself as a barrister with a starter portfolio of clients, but move they must. With a few hiccups along the way they arrive at Les Dragons in Beaucoup-sur-mer to find a nasty surprise awaiting them in their garden and threatening the liberty of their newly found mother. Penzi needs all her resources to set her mother free, even those she has denied all her life, and so she has to decide whether to accept her witchiness or not.  …is a witch indeed.
