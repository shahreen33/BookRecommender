A coming of age novel that doesn't hold back, filled with raw emotion and soulful honesty against a backdrop of rock and roll."It feels like I've been broken and pushed back together in the wrong shape. Like there'll always be something in me that doesn't fit together in the right way anymore." Seventeen-year-old guitar prodigy Tyler Mills is lost in the wake of his mother's death, searching for a sense of identity in her absence and living with a father who he can barely tolerate. When he finds his mother's journals - and the long-held family secret within them concerning her ties to reclusive ex-rock star Trevor Graves - he sets out alone on an emotional journey to learn the ultimate truth about his mother, his family...and himself.What readers are saying:"Songs from the Phenomenal Nothing is proof positive that Steven Luna is not a one-trick pony...while his Joe Vampire made you laugh, Songs just might make you cry.""The parent/child relationship is often a hard one during those adolescent years, and Luna has woven a story that poignantly delves into that bond.""It takes a special kind of author to encompass the essence of diversity in literature, but Luna does it with one work to the next from funny to poignant with ease.""I’m gonna say it right here, folks. I loved this book—even better than Eleanor and Park."
