A beautifully illustrated picture book from the bestselling author of The Fox and the Star. Deep below the earth, Worm dreams of having more space. There's not much room down there. Above, Bird waits, through sun and rain and wind. As the day goes on, will they both find what they are looking for? This is a book about searching and hoping, and how the smallest moment can be beautiful.
