I stand at the edge of the ocean with my toes buried in the sand. I remove my clothing one piece at a time. No one is around. I'm alone on this beach, so I feel liberated. It's a relief to have finally made the decision to leave this world the same way that I came into it.No one would miss me. My mom remarried and now has a shiny new stepson to brag about named Jake. I can't stand Jake. He's an alpha male about as perfect as perfect comes. He's a star rugby player, and on the Dean's list.Suddenly, I'm yanked by the arm, thrown over the shoulder and brought back to shore. It's Jake. As I lay naked in his arms, my eyes transfixed on his pink, smooth lips that curl up at the corners.  Why do I suddenly want to kiss him?
