Trine Hampstead knows everything. Just knows it. Ask her a question like, "Where are my keys?" or, "Is my husband cheating on me?" or, "How can there be perfectly preserved mammoths in the ice of Siberia when the ice isn't that old?" and she just knows the answer. She's the Mystery Girl. The only thing she doesn't know is anything about the last ten years of her own life, including what happened to give her this ability. But that's a mystery for later. The mystery for now is about those mammoths. Trine knows why they're there but surprises anyone who knows Trine by demanding to leave her London-based sidewalk detective setup to go to Siberia with the archaeological team to see them for herself. And close behind is a vicious killer who is targeting her for reasons even Trine doesn't know.
