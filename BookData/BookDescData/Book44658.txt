Evan Tormer is haunted. His life has been shattered by events beyond his control and regret is his constant companion. His wife is gone, lost to an unbeatable cancer. His son has been mentally and physically handicapped by a tragic accident. He’s been fired for using company funds in a failed attempt to save his wife’s life. On a whim, Evan accepts an invitation to housesit on a picturesque island in northern Minnesota. At first it seems like the perfect second chance for he and his son to recover and rebuild their life together. But there is something very, very wrong with the house and all that occupies it. And worst of all, Evan doesn’t know if the house is haunted... ...Or if it’s all in his mind.
