ANGEL I know what you're whispering in the car as you pass me by. Hitchhiker. When you see me walking along the side of the road with my thumb out, you'll probably keep driving without giving me a second glance. You probably think I'm foolish. Naïve. You might assume I've made some bad decisions. You might think I'm too young to be on my own. You might be right.  TRAVIS I love my job, but driving an eighteen-wheeler comes with a certain stereotype. When you hear I’m a trucker, a specific image might come to mind. Uneducated. Dirty. Perverted. Rough around the edges and a little bit dangerous. But the truth is, I’m not any of those things. In fact, I’m pretty far from it. You’d be surprised to find out I’m one of the good guys.  *EXCERPT from Trucker* I’d only been driving for about a mile when I saw someone walking along the side of the road in the distance. As I got closer I saw the backpack and blonde hair. She turned toward my semi before sticking her thumb out. “Shit,” I whispered, recognizing her right away. Even from a distance, I could see the hopeful expression on her face, and I felt something twist in my chest. What the hell did she think she was doing? Hitchhiking was dangerous. For a split second, I thought about not stopping. I could just keep on driving and forget I ever saw her. But just as fast, all the possible scenarios played out in my mind. All the things that could happen to her. All the sick, depraved people who could be the ones to pull over and lure her into their vehicle with the promise of a safe ride. I’d never picked up a hitchhiker before. Had never planned on it. But there was no way I could leave this girl out there on her own.  Trucker is a standalone novel. Due to language and sexual content, this book is intended for readers 18 and older.
