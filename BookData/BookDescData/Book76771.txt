Are you an expert at the game of love? Find out in Coulda Woulda Shoulda, an interactive unromantic comedy where YOU become the protagonist. As Elle Masters, you'll navigate hundreds of familiar dating dilemmas and passionate predicaments inspired by popular advice books and modern romance. Each choice is more complicated than the last, and the stakes are raised with each turn of the page, but you’ll have backup from Elle’s best friends, Rachel and Valerie, who put the “antics” in “romantics.”With 60 endings ranging from "I don't know what happened!" to “I do,” don't be surprised if art imitates life and you throw this book across the room… only to pick it up and try again. One more time. Because, unlike real life, when you don't like the outcome, you can go back to a pivotal moment and explore the path not taken, or even start over at the beginning.BUYER BEWARE: Happily Ever Afters are hard to come by in Coulda Woulda Shoulda. In fact, most of them are flat out unhappy. Still, with persistence, you might find one or two endings that downright satisfy - even if it means Elle drives off into the sunset alone.
