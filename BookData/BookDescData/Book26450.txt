As the president of the Sin City Outlaw Motorcycle Club, I fuck as hard as I ride and rarely go to bed alone. The women are fast and the violence is intense. I excel in both.People either respect me or fear me. I'm not arrogant. It’s just the truth.I was a king, reigning over Vegas without complication, until one gorgeous sheriff made everything fall apart. When I saw her, I became a Neanderthal, wanting nothing more than to be between those legs. I guess that’s where I went wrong, because my reality was shot to hell real fucking fast.One kiss caused her to step over that blue line.One night in her bed made me a traitor.And now… we’re both screwed.
