Stephen Hastings is a control freak. He’s arrogant. He’s smart as a whip and sexy AF.He has too much money. He’s bossy, and he’s usually right. All I saw were his clear blue eyes, tight ass, and ripped torso. I gladly handed him my V-card that night, ten years ago. I was so stupid. I swore I’d never be that stupid again…Emmy Barton works for a dry cleaner? Yes, that Emmy Barton—long, blonde hair, bright blue eyes, pretty smile… Sexy little ass. Smart mouth.She was the only girl who interested me, but I was leaving to be an officer in the Navy.Now I’m home, running my business, my life is perfectly ordered until I bump into her, divorced and struggling to make ends meet. I hate seeing her like this. I hate that she married Burt “The Dick” Dickerson. What an asshole.She says she hates me, but when we fight, it's all heat and lust.I won’t leave her this way. She will let me help her and her son. She will stay... It’s a thin line between love and hate, and this line is on fire.(STAY is a STAND-ALONE enemies-to-lovers, second-chance, marriage of convenience romance. No cheating. No cliffhangers.)
