In the closing years of this century, a new comet is discovered—and computations of its orbit indicate that it will approach Earth. But unlike other comets, Icarus is a solid body, and its impact would create a disaster worse than any fusion bomb could create. Astronaut Nigel Walmsley is sent out to intercept and vaporize Icarus…but what he finds beneath its barren surface moves him to defy orders and risk the destruction of most of the world’s civilization.Nigel’s mutiny, and the world-wide panic it raised, should have destroyed his career—but, as the century turned, then moved into its second decade, he kept a foothold in the space program, insulating himself from the steady erosion of the quality of life on this planet with his work and his prickly but rich relationships with two very different women.Two events tore the insulation away: an alien spacecraft looping inward from the Solar System…and signaling intelligently; and the sentence of death the doctor pronounced on his beloved Alexandria, poisoned by what the world’s air had become.For Nigel, the only sense, sanity, and hope left was in the approaching spacecraft and what it might mean—and then the authorities gave him the mission of destroying it.The adventures and discoveries in this novel are in the finest traditions of modern science fiction, but the story is enriched by the equally gripping development of Nigel as a man who finds he must seek something others cannot conceive of—whose true home is in the limitless ocean of night between the stars.
