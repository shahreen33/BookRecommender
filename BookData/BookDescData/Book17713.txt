Like dewdrops from a silent night, writings in Letters from your Soul are distinctly brilliant, and, resonate with our sense of beauty and wonder. They contain the condensed wisdom of years of soul-searching before Victorâ€™s awakening, and years of compassionate attempts since, by him, to remind others of their own journey towards self-realisation. The messages are relevant to anyone who has ever pondered about existence and the possibilities of improving this life-experience, the only thing that truly belongs to us.The style of writing interweaves between storytelling, conversation and prose-poetry. The uniqueness of these expressions of timeless truths lies in the fact that throughout his spiritual search, and, the years following his awakening, Victor continues to remain in the chaos of an average urban life. And, for this reason, his messages act as a perfect bridge between the unworldly and worldly quests of human mind, giving immense hope to finding a life full of freedom, joy and love by remaining exactly where we are.---From back cover: Your journey didn't begin when you were born, or, even when you thought you have arrived; Your journey begins, when you stop, and look for new eyes, to see you. Your journey didn't begin, when you fulfilled your dreams; Your journey begins, when you reject dreams that you bought in your sleep. Your journey didn't begin, when you were told that you have made it; Your journey begins when you reject the notion 'what you have become, is the best you can be'. Your journey awaits for a path never travelled before. Start making your path from here; and start walking towards a new 'you' now. Beauty, Wonder, and Faith; you will find them all, on your way.Readings in the Letters from your soul are filled with sparks to ignite a flame of self-renewal, but, the readiness to burn, and, be new, needs to come from within you.
