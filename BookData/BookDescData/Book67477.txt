The dark fae king has left me with no choice.  He threatened my guard and my brother. My need to enact revenge for the brutal massacre of my parents is all-encompassing. If he wants war, a war he will receive.  First order of business... returning to a land and home that I haven't seen in years. Will everything have changed? Will the politics of court allow for my shift in policy? Should I enact the Always Punch First rule? Why the hell are there carriages?  My secrets have been laid all out in the open for inspection, but returning home means that my guard are subjected to the same light. Not only do we have to deal with court politics, but family politics as well. Can I even hide my relationship long enough to convince the light fae to stay allies with us?  Will I even make it the coronation? Or will our merry band of lunatics have problems before I can even touch the throne?  The only question I don't have? How I will kill the dark fae king.  *** It is not necessary but adds to the experience if you read the Red Masque series as well.
