Braden Grimlock likes being in charge … in theory. When his father announces that he’s going to a reaper conference with three of his siblings, Braden is disappointed to miss out on the trip but excited about being the boss. That is until he finds out which sibling is staying behind with him. Braden and his only sister Aisling have never gotten along. Still, Braden has seniority. Aisling has to do what he says. Of course, Aisling has other ideas. Grimlock Manor is rocking with arguments (and maybe a few petty games) when someone breaks into the house. Aisling insists on staying at the family mansion because she’s got party plans. Those go out the window when the security system keeps going off. Braden thought he would be a man about town but he’s a man stuck at home … and trying to figure out a mystery. Who is going after his family? And will Aisling ever shut her mouth long enough to help him figure it out? Come along for the ride. Things are about to get loud.  Note: This is a 30,000-word short set in the Aisling Grimlock world. It’s set back and can be read at any point in the timeline.
