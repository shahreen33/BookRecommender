While researching an historical piece on the Asylum for the town’s newspaper, editor Oliver Metcalf digs through the attic that once belonged to his father, the last superintendent of the facility. There, among the dusty medical records, Oliver discovers a beautifully embroidered linen handkerchief with an ornate “R” in one corner. He decides it will make a lovely present for Rebecca Morrison, who recently suffered a horrifying family tragedy. But is this token of affection the innocent object it seems? What tears were once dried with Rebecca’s handkerchief—and how many more will begin to flow?
