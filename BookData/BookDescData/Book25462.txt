A song to Pacific islands rooted in a far-ranging journey, Reach for Paradise is the Pacific addition to the world's fine travel literature. Written as he gained deep knowledge of the islands and their peoples, their history and traditions, the influences that have shaped their destiny, Rayner's story conveys the mystery and marvel of travel to destinations denied most people. Intent on exploring what if anything has survived of the paradise celebrated by travelers of past centuries, Rayner bought a sailboat and set off, picking up both boat and island knowledge as he ploughed 30,000 miles of ocean. A personal journey of delight, Reach for Paradise is rich with information gleaned from Pacific peoples, literature and observation. For Pacific voyagers, Reach for Paradise is an invaluable source. If a guide, rather than explaining how to get there it is the sort that will tell thoughtful adventurers why to go. And what you miss if you can't. Protected uniquely by distance and time, Pacific islands are extraordinary, often meeting the old definition of that devalued word "paradise" as a place that inspires blissful contentment. Island spirits and magic, landscapes, the splendor of coral reefs, the gift economy, Rayner defies you to argue that planet Earth has any better elixir for a world-weary traveler.
