Ten years after the Rapture, a beautiful occultist and her pet demon embark on a road trip to the last open gateway to heaven in hopes of befriending God and escaping hell on earth. A bare-knuckle, action-driven series peppered with social commentary and dark humor, Strange Girl is a story about the bewildering nature of religion, what would happen if the dark future predicted by many came true, and what a good person would endure for not having faith in advance of it. Featuring story and art by a handful of today's hottest new talents including Rick Remender (Uncanny X-Force,  Venom), Eric Nguyen (Halo, Sandman), Jerome Opena (Uncanny X-Force, Punisher) and Nick Stakal (Criminal Macabre).
