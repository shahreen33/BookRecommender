Imagine living with a fear so visceral each day that simply walking down the street draws terror to one’s core. That’s the best case scenario for a woman on the streets of Juárez, Mexico. Kate del Castillo (La Reina del Sur) delivers a stunning one-woman performance that transports listeners from a New York stage to the treacherous streets of Juárez, Mexico, where thousands of women have been murdered in an ongoing epidemic of violence. Written by Isaac Gomez (Steppenwolf’s La Ruta) and based on his intimate interviews, the way she spoke is a raw and riveting exploration of responsibility and follows one playwright's journey to give voice to a city of women silenced by violence, fear, and a world that has turned a deaf ear to their stories. This poignant and unforgettable play is directed by Obie and Lucille Lortel–winner Jo Bonney.Written by Isaac GomezPerformed by Kate del CastilloDirected by Jo BonneyOriginal Theatrical Sound Design by Elisheba IttoopNote: the way she spoke contains mature language and themes, and graphic description of violence against women.
