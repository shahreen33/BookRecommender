After liberating New York City from her now-feral Gang of Harleys, poor Harley wants nothing more than to slip back into retirement in her coastal (and heavily guarded) paradise. But the Laughing Boys Gang has another idea--they'll follow her to the ends of the Earth, to drag her back to their leader!If you think that's a big problem, just wait. The Joker couldn't possibly still be alive, could he? After all ... Harley killed him with her bare hands! Should she turn to President Power Girl for help? Or flee to the 51st state, Atlantis? Step into an insane vision of a future DC Universe we all better hope we don't live to see!In this dystopian-future tale, Harley's quest to find out how The Joker could possibly still be alive has taken her back to their old stomping grounds, but Gotham City is very different nowadays! Nobody's allowed on the streets without the Batman's permission--but who is this Batman, anyway? Harley's only choice is to return to Arkham...the Arkham Home for Criminally Insane Retirees, that is! Fancy a round of bingo with the Riddler? Or some pool aerobics with Killer Croc? Collects Harley Quinn #42 (Rebirth Series) and Old Lady Harley #1-5
