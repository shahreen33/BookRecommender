The inn will soon be renovated in preparation for a new lease on life. So tonight, from midnight till six, Peter Haskins will watch over the machinery.And he will soon discover that there is something else in the hotel with him, something that needs no new lease on life, for it has never died.And never will.SELDOM SEEN IN AUGUSTWade Crawford is not a good guy. Heâ€™s a bank robber and a ruthless killer, and now three people are dead and Wade is on the run. With the cops hot on his heels, he breaks into a seemingly ordinary house in a seemingly ordinary neighborhood to hide and wait on word from his partner.But this neighborhood is far from ordinary. Indeed it has a very specific purpose, and soon Wade will discover that life in prison would be preferable to the hellish torment Seldom Seen has in store for him.MIDLISTERSMeet Jason Tennant, a writer of violent horror novels whose career is mired firmly in a maddening swamp of frustration somewhere north of nowhere and south of success.

He's wealthy, handsome, and the object of Jason Tennant's professional jealousy.Welcome to Baltimore, Maryland, and the Aurora Science Fiction &amp; Horror Convention, where these two men, midlister and bestseller, will meet for the first time, and the midlister motto "Better Read Than Dead" will be put to the ultimate test.
