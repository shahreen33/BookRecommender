Gunther Lueschen, a particle physicist, gets pulled through a mysterious portal and transported two hundred years into the future to an exotic underground world inhabited by other humans from earth. Despite the society's advanced technology, the people are unable to find a way to return home. But when Gunther himself develops the technology, it is taken from him by a malevolent force and modified to be a powerful weapon. With the aid of an unlikely mix of companions, Gunther seeks to take back his invention and re-open the portals. Standing in his way are genetically altered soldiers, technologically enhanced humans, and corrupt government officials. Yet even greater than these obstacles are the questions that arise about the nature of truth - questions that challenge the very core of his beliefs.
