First to translate two of the oldest accounts of Musashi's career, the Bushū denraiki and the Bukōden, the author here presents a full biography of this most famous yet most enigmatic of swordsmen, Miyamoto Musashi.Drawing on a wealth of additional and newly uncovered original sources, the author for the first time reveals aspects of Musashi's life that have hitherto been shrouded in mystery: the source of his deeply troubled relationship with his father, the exact place and side on which he fought during the battle of Sekigahara, his heroic role in the summer siege of Osaka castle, his actual whereabouts in the years that followed, and the remarkable gestation of the Gorin no sho, his great legacy to posterity of a unique martial philosophy.Quoting directly and extensively from original sources, A Life in Arms, traces Musashi's constant search for his own distinct style of swordsmanship--a path that began with the brutal slaying of Arima Kihei, led to the fall of the illustrious Yoshioka clan, and culminated in his dramatic encounter with Sasaki Kojirō on Ganryū island. It reveals how Musashi built on what he learned from his father and his uncles, how he perfected it on his musha shugyo, and how his Enmei-ryū evolved into the Niten Ichi-ryū, his unique art of fighting with two swords.A Life in Arms shows how Musashi's path through life was shaped by strong personal traits: his reckless valor in the face of danger, his sensitive intelligence in the fields of art and architecture, his generosity toward peers and pupils, and his defiant stubbornness in old age. The complex yet human portrait that arises is a far cry from the accepted one-dimensional caricature of this great medieval swordsman.
