    The Dead vampires return to free a vampire's powerful family held captive in the tunnels beneath the town. To defeat The Dead, Linda and her friends join forces with the human vampires--known as hybrids--and the vampires of Oasis. Linda and her best friend, Shana, pose as members at an exclusive club in Disney World rumored to be The Dead's new lair. With hybrids, Todd and Sheriff Sam, as their respective husbands, Linda and Shana uncover more than they intended at The Club. Leaving a trail of dead bodies behind them, they return to Oasis with more questions than answers.
