Praise for Through These Veins  With a cinematic sweep, "Through These Veins" has a colorful, broad, beautiful feel to it with characters that come so alive I can see them. - Lisa Napoli, author of "Radio Shangri-La: What I Learned in Bhutan, the Happiest Kingdom on Earth"  Enthralling. "Through These Veins" doesn't just call plants by their names; it sings their praises. There is no better case for conservation than this vivid account of how our wellbeing is so intertwined with the secret lives of plants. - Calestous Juma, Director, of Science, Technology, and Globalization Project at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, and former Executive Secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity  A real pleasure. Very dramatic with a wide range of vivid descriptions and an important reminder of the relationship between science and nature. - Warren Olney, Host of Public Radio International's To The Point  Summary In the coffee-growing highlands of Ethiopia, an Italian scientist on a plant collecting expedition discovers a local medicine man dispensing an apparent cure for AIDS. As the medicine man's teenage daughter reveals the plants behind the cure, their lives become irrevocably intertwined. Through These Veins weaves together the dramatically different worlds of traditional healing, U.S. government funded AIDS research, and the pharmaceutical industry in an intensely personal, fast-paced tale of scientific intrigue and love, with both devastating and hopeful effect.
