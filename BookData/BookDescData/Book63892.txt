What’s to Love: It’s our first-ever Lumberjanes special and we could not be more excited to welcome writer Faith Erin Hicks (The Adventures of Superhero Girl) and newcomer artist Rosemary Valero-O’Connell to our growing Lumberteam. This self-contained story perfectly captures the spirit of what the Lumberjanes are: hardcore lady-types who can fend for themselves, but also quick to help those who are in need!What It Is: In this special one-shot issue, a monster is terrorizing the Lumberjanes camp and the girls go to stop it. However, it turns out that the monster is being framed and now the girls have to figure out who’s doing it and to what end! Join April, Jo, Mal, Molly and Ripley as they earn their Beyond Bay Leaf pin!
