Melanie: I can’t even believe I didn’t make eye contact with the guy on the elevator. I’d seen him before in my office building and he was totally awesome to look at. From what I could tell by the way his suit clung to him, he had a hot bod, too. Another missed opportunity! I’m so lame. Next time, I’ll see if he wants to do lunch. I wonder if he listens to 80s music when he works out, because he has got to work out.Tyler: Dude, that chick in the elevator was mad fine. My sister may think I’m not capable of keeping a relationship, but she’s bugg’n. I’m gonna show the girl with the big green eyes that I’m all that and a bag of chips. Next time I see her, I’m gonna hit her up for sure. I wonder how she feels about watching 90s TV reruns on Friday nights?
