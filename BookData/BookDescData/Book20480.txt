Four horror authors. Four stories. One terrifying theme.Extreme: Defined as being of a high or of the highest degree or intensity. In literary terms, it means going above and beyond the normal level of horror, creating stories that not only shock, but leave a mark afterwards. From Kyle M. Scott, Angel Gelique, Stuart Keane, and Jack Rollins, come four dark tales of debauchery, graphic violence, blood-soaked scares, and toe-curling torture - stories that will have you puking, flinching, screaming, and crying in sheer terror. The warning label says it all; this is likely to offend. Featuring a foreword from the master of Extreme Horror himself, Matt Shaw - the author behind Porn, Sick B*stards, Whore, and Rotting Dead F*cks - this is one eBook that will ensure you have a very, gory Christmas.
