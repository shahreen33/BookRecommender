He’s an Enigma, like an unsolved mystery or a puzzle missing the final piece. How did he become this way? Well, that’s the part that gets complicated.Kol - I’m a foster kid raised by greed and child abuse. I fought my way out of the system, literally. My bloody knuckles and bruised ribs have made me the man I am today: one angry, distrusting a$$hole. I keep my thoughts and my words to myself, and my women to the barest of minimums. Don’t get me wrong. I could have any woman I wanted, but I don’t want just any of them. I want her. Jade. She looks like Barbie but fights like Brutus.She drives me crazy with her sassy mouth and constant want to discuss my “feelings”.That damn stubborn streak of hers is going to be the end of me.Jade – I’m a foster system reject, but I refuse to let it hold me back. I know what I want in life and how to get it, but some men think a female fighter is a distraction to the real MMA fighting that men do. I’m not going to let anyone get in the way of living my dreams.So when I have to beat a fighter just to join an exclusive MMA training center, I choose him. The Enigma. One trip and I fall in love. I see the lover I need inside the fighter I want, but his past keeps his heart caged and untrusting.When life starts to crumble down around us, a cowardly shadow of the man I admire takes over. Will Kol and Jade fight to keep their love alive? Or does one slip of the tongue break their trust forever? What happens when the fight is over, but no one wins?
