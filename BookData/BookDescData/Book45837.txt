Three's a crowd, but four's a war.Big girl undies? Check.Speech planned? Check.Nerves of steel? Check.A single crush? …not check…?What do you do when you find your best friend/crush kissing your other best friend on the day you were going to declare your feelings for him? You only agree to fake date your crush’s rival. The King of the Bows, popular golden (play)boy, and all around douche, Xander wouldn’t be my last choice for a boyfriend.Across the school, battlelines are drawn and sides are taken between the new ’it’ couple of my former best friends and the excitingly scandalous pairing of me and King Douche. Xander keeps distracting me from the plan; make Jason jealous. He insists on holding my hand and kissing me and being nice. Ugh. Xander’s not nice and he’s not the relationship type, but he’s doing a damned good job of acting both parts.He calls it ‘keeping up appearances’, I call it ‘take one more pass at my arse and I’ll break your nose’.They say all’s fair in love and war, but what’s so fair about falling for the wrong guy when your two best friends are on the other side of the battlelines?Please be aware that this story is set in Australia and therefore uses Australian English spelling and syntax.
