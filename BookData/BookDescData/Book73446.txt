It’s been a year since Cyndi went into the empty water park with her friends and almost got killed by a masked maniac. One full year since she learned how to be strong, how to be a survivor. Now it’s 1984, and summertime has come around again. Cyndi has a boyfriend, a new group of friends, and a part-time summer job. She has every reason to be happy and forget about the past.But she can’t forget. Her nightmares about the water park and her dead friends are getting worse. Wherever she goes, she keeps thinking she sees the killer from last summer watching her from the shadows. Worst of all, there’s a new water park opening up in town, and it looks eerily similar to the one from last year. Opening day is just around the corner, and Cyndi is starting to wonder if her water park nightmare is really over, or if it’s just beginning.
