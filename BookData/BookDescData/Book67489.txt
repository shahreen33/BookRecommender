  
    New enemies, new allies.
  
I survived my first year at Fortuna Academy. Lucifer met my mates and it wasn’t totally mortifying. I met Azriel’s mom and she’s not that bad. We’re all back at school and we have a mission—find that prophecy and figure out who tried to poison Keane. Everyone in our group has a least favorite Hellhound they suspect of doing the deed, but really, we have nothing.That is, until Lilith comes through with information from school records. Both Hellhounds that have been harassing me have secrets, but this one ties back to Keane and the Lilim.We finally find the prophecy as we gather more allies. Even with the warlock police and Hellhounds on our side, I’m woefully under prepared for any of this. Suck it up, buttercup. That’s my only option. With Lucifer as my father and all the prophecies surrounding my birth, the only thing I can do is figure things out.
  
    I’m the Princess of Hell. I can do this, right?
