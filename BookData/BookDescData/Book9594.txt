It has been years since Elizabeth “Betts” McGee has returned to her once-adored Bulls Island in the Carolina Lowcountry—ages since tragic fate coupled with nasty rumors ended her engagement to fabulously wealthy Charleston golden boy J.D. Langley. Having successfully reinvented herself as a top New York banking executive, Betts is now heading up the most important project of her career. But it’ll transform the untouched island she loved in her youth into something unrecognizable. And it’s forcing her to return to the bosom of her estranged family, where she may not be welcomed with open arms—and uniting her with ex-flame J.D., who’s changed . . . but perhaps not enough. "Bulls Island" is a satisfying tale of honor, chance, and star-crossed love, infused with Southern wit, grace, and charm from the "New York Times" bestselling author of "The Christmas Pearl" and "The Land of Mango Sunsets."
