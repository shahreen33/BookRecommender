The coming of age diary of a young Polish Countess, Francoise Krasinska who in the space of three years travels from the shelter of her father's court and becomes the secret consort of the Duke of Courland. In so doing she manages the transition from innocence to awareness in a time of political treachery. Elegant sparkling prose contemporaneous with and comparable to Jane Austen.
