Jesse thinks he's caught a break when he, Emma (the girl of his dreams), and her friend are assigned by their newspaper to cover the opening weekend of a sprawling new state park. But the construction of the park has stirred an evil that has lain dormant for nearly a hundred years, and the three young people--as well as every man, woman, and child unlucky enough to be attending the Algonquin Falls grand opening--are about to encounter the most horrific creatures to ever walk the earth. Charly has three young children and a jerk for a husband, a hot shot girls basketball coach with a penchant for seducing his female assistants. When Charly's baby is kidnapped by one of the creatures, she turns to Sam Bledsoe, the man who constructed her house (and the man on whom she has developed a sizable crush) for help. Sam, Charly, her husband, and the newest hot assistant coach soon find themselves underground and on the trail of Charly's baby. Jesse's trio, a group of professors, and Frank Red Elk--a Native American who specializes in women and booze--take refuge in the caves hoping to find a way out of the park. But like Charly and the others, Jesse's crew will soon learn just how monstrous the creatures are. And how cunning. Together, they will all try to save Charly's baby, escape with their lives, and take down as many of the monsters as they can. But the creatures are hungry. They delight in human suffering. And they will stop at nothing to prove that they are the dominant species. FLAME TREE PRESS is the new fiction imprint of Flame Tree Publishing.
