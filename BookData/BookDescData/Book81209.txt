Just when Zara Riddle thought she was handling the whole witch-librarian thing, her friend got zapped into a flamingo. Yes, the pink-feathered kind. Her library coworker Frank Wonder is now four and a half feet tall, and none too happy about it!  The Department of Water and Magic gets involved, but now they want Zara to channel a missing spirit. The fiesty redheaded librarian wants to help, REALLY, but this new spirit is going to be murder on her love life.  With a few timely spells, some top-secret sleuthing, and (of course) the appropriate reference materials, Zara Riddle should have this case solved in no time. If it doesn't kill her.
