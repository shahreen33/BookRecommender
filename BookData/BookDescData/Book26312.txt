He was a drug I couldn’t kick. I’d overdosed on him before. It didn’t turn out well.I was stupid enough to let him crack my heart, in hopes we would fall off the same cliff together. No matter how much my idiotic heart wanted to love him, my head knew better. He didn’t choose me. He chose her. That’s where the problem started. Maybe that’s how it should end.
