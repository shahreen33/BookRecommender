School's out for the summer, but 11-year-old Kendall plans on camping out on the playground until he finds a permanent place to hide from his crazy-mean adopted parents. He meets Lorelei, a girl his age, and together they find out not all treasure can be bought. When his adopted parents show up at the playground and Kendall disappears, Lorelei has to decide whether to break her promise and tell her mom that he's homeless or risk losing her best friend forever.
