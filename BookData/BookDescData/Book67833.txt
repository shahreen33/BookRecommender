*AN ENEMIES TO LOVERS STANDALONE*Byron Crowne is a charming liar and a gorgeous monster. I detest him.I can't resist him.He’s awakened desires I didn’t know I had.When he touches me, I need to fight him . . . and I need him to win.Our one night stand bruises my skin and leaves dents in the walls, but the sheets aren't the only thing we shred that night.And suddenly, the stakes are higher than ever.***Olivia Monroe lights a fire in me that died a long time ago.I’m a different man when I’m with her. I need to own her, take her, mark her as mine.Everything changes when she might be pregnant and for the first time in my life...I’m powerless against this stubborn, untamable woman.She’s the one in control and I have an impossible job:Prove I’m worthy to be a father.
