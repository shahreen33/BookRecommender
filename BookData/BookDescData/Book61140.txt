The past few years have not been easy for Chris Minot, but he's always been the guy who's "there" for everyone. He's there despite taking on a demanding new job, and going through his own very personal loss. When does Chris get to do something for himself? What his friends don't know is that Chris has always known what, who, he needs, but she's never nearby. Maybe it's time for Chris to make sure things happen for him this time. Maybe it's time for Kissing Day.
