There’s a fine line between lust and hate.I don’t care that Drew Merritt spent the last year transforming himself from grungy slob to sexy playboy. With messy, dirty blond hair and gorgeous eyes, his looks aren’t the problem.His mouth is.And the stupid things that come out of it.But after an emergency strands us together, and he does his damnedest to take care of me… Let’s just say there’s one thing we don’t clash on.And it doesn’t involve talking.I’ve despised Drew since I met him years ago. One weekend can’t change us that much, can it?Spoiler alert: It doesn’t.Except he left me a little keepsake.And in nine months, I’ll have a surprise for Portland’s most notorious player.
