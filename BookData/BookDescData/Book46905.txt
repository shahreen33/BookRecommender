It's decision time for the mighty Warrior Princess . . . left for dead by the Romans on the cross, Xena struggles with delirium and deceit as she must decide her fate -- to relive her dark past or to face the grim spectacle of her present. And when her choice casts her into Hell, the Big Bad Guy himself offers her the opportunity to sit at his right hand if she will lure to the Netherworld a pure, powerful soul -- a certain Norse God of Thunder! -- to lead a war against Heaven! These storylines are interwoven with those of the finale of the season four and the premiere of season five of "Xena: Warrior Princess" and as such are integral companions to the epic saga of Xena's struggle against evil and oppression.
