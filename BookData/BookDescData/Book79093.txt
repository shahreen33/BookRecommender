Doctor When has a Time Machine and a Very Important Mission. In order to save the world from untold chronological havoc, the esteemed Chrononaut requires the assistance of some very peculiar associates: one dangerous dwarf and the deadly Spaghetti Sisters. Together, they will need to find Ingeborg. But what exactly is Ingeborg in the first place? Why are there dinosaurs in the South of France? And which Thursday is this, exactly? All these questions answered, and more, in The Adventurous Time Adventures of Doctor When.
