From the creators of THE NIGHTINGALE, an exquisite edition of another Hans Christian Andersen classic tale of dark adventure"Left, right! Left, right!" A soldier is marching home from war when he meets a witch who says, "What a fine sword you have, and what a big knapsack! Now I’ll show you how to get as much money as you want." Fortune is fleeting for the soldier until he learns the secret of the witch’s tinderbox and her three eerie dogs, each with eyes bigger than the last. With each strike of the flint, a dog materializes to grant him his wish, and the soldier doesn’t hesitate to take advantage of this gift — at a high cost to the kingdom. Spun with wit and clarity, Stephen Mitchell’s wonderfully fresh retelling is paired with Bagram Ibatoulline’s richly detailed illustrations, creating a stunning collectible edition.
