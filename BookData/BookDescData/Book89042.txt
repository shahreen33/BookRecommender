The perfect family... or the perfect lie?  When a child’s scream pierces the night, Mira does what any good neighbour would do: she calls the police. She wants to make sure that Rosie, the little girl next door, is safe.  Opening her front door to the police the next morning, Gemma’s picture-perfect family is forced under scrutiny of social services.  As her flawless life begins to crumble around her, Gemma must fight to defend the family she loves and protect her daughter from the terrible secret she’s been keeping.  But who has Rosie been confiding in when Gemma’s back is turned? And why has she lied to the police?  When Rosie disappears without a trace, Gemma thinks she only has herself to blame. That is, until she finds a little pink diary containing a truth even more devastating than the lie…  If you loved The Couple Next Door and Big Little Lies, you’ll adore this razor-sharp, tense and utterly engrossing page turner about the people we choose to trust and the secrets we keep behind closed doors.
