Elaina Maury Curtis inherits her family's estate in Maury, Florida, and moves in to the dismay of some local citizens. They know Elaina isn't going anywhere, though. Her uncle founded the town, and she's married to Rob Curtis, the local chief of police. Still, townsfolk want her gone, because murder didn't come to Maury until she arrived. Fortunately for Elaina, her tearoom and charming bed and breakfast businesses are going well. Unfortunately, she soon comes upon a ghost in her tearoom and finds a burial mound on her family's land just as murder rocks the small town once again. Rob and his sidekick deputy, Jimmy Dougal, take the case, but it's clear they aren't making any progress. Elaina makes it her responsibility to sniff out the killer with the help of Irish wolfhound, Chloe, but she uncovers more secrets in her own home than she ever could have expected. Now, suspects are plenty, as are motives, and why is there a ghost in her tearoom? As the suspense grows, it's possible Elaina could be the next victim unless she solves this mystery first.
