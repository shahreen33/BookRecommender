Welcome to Chipping Cheddar, where supernaturals are hidden in plain sightResidents are sneezing and coughing all over town and it seems like a brutal allergy season is upon us--until someone dies. When Dr. Verity reveals a supernatural cause, I'm on the case, but how do I track a culprit whose only evidence seems to be the infection it leaves behind? In the meantime, neighbors new and old bring trouble to Muenster Close and I need to intervene before the wicked witches escalate matters. With the annual cheese festival on the horizon and a stealthy demon on the loose, I know I'll need to set aside my misgivings and use my magic to prevent a catastrophe. Can I stop this outbreak before it becomes a full-fledged epidemic or will the entire town succumb to the deadly demon? Grace Under Fury (Federal Bureau of Magic Cozy Mystery, Book 4) is a full-length humorous paranormal cozy mystery with demon action and a budding romance.
