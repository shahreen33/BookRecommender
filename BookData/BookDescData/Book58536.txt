On the eve of Maoâ€™s revolution, brilliant linguist Peter Goullart made himself totally at home in Likiang, capital of the all-but-forgotten Nakhi Kingdom of south west China. He unpicks the complex society, which believed simultaneously in Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Animism and Shamanism. Goullart lets us in on the love affairs and rivalries of his neighbours, his meetings with ancient dowagers and handsome warriors, as well as allowing us to catch the sound of the swift mountain streams, the coarse ribaldry of the markets and the happy laughter of the wine shops.
