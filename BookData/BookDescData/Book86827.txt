Join the fun for a rollicking romp through the hippy dippy days of the 60s into the disco drug-addled decadent decade of the 70s as experienced by First-Year Baby Boomer, Francesca, a reluctant and burned-out hairdresser from when the nation's drugs of choice were lots of tranquilizers and booze. It was the Dawning of the Age of Aquarius. Everyone was trying to find themselves, look out for number one, and make peace at any price. The fear of Sputniks, invasions from Mars, and fallouts topped the list of things scaring the hell out of everybody. Music changed from country and folk to rockabilly to rock-and-roll by Elvis the pelvis. Then, there was sweet soul music, the British Invasion and disco.Hairdos went from French twists, Beehives, and Barrel Curls to the Flip, just in time for everyone to flip out, tune in, and turn on. The big blue, Valium, soon calmed the wave of high anxiety that was suddenly upon us. You know the old saying about the 60s...If you remember the 60s, then you weren't there.Enjoy, it's a keeper! Also included are a few poems and little life lessons we should learn to make this world a better place.
