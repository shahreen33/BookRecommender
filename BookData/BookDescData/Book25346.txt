Song of the Nightingale is the true story of Helen Berhane, held captive for over two years in appalling conditions in her native Eritrea. Her crime? Sharing her faith in Jesus, and refusing, even though horrendously tortured, to deny him. A sobering, painful, heart-rending account of true faith in the face of evil, this book makes for uncomfortable and yet inspirational reading. Helen says, 'I want to give a message to those of you who are Christians and live in the free world: You must not take your freedom for granted... If I could sing in prison, imagine what you can do for God's glory with your freedom.' Helen's story is a real challenge for the church in the West.'Other prisoners and even the guards very often wondered at how happy Christians could be under the most terrible circumstances. We could not be prevented from singing, although we were beaten for this. I imagine that nightingales, too, would sing, even if they knew that after finishing they would be killed for it.'From Tortured for Christ by Richard Wurmbrand, Founder of the Voice of the Martyrs
