By the coauthor of the best-selling book "Jesus Freaks," this daily devotional features hundreds of stories of ancient to modern day believers--many of whose stories are published here for the first time--who sacrificed everything for Christ. Each true account concludes with a life application and a Bible verse to challenge you to live out your own extreme devotion.
