She caught my attention the first day I was seated in her class.Her dark red hair fell in waves down her back and her alabaster skin appeared to sparkle under the lights of the lecture hallI'd admired her from a distance, never speaking or doing anything to draw attention to myself.Each day that I spent watching her in this room, I noticed how her eyes would flick up to me. She was wary of me - frightened - and she had reason to be.Allow me to introduce myself…My name is Holland Strong and at 21 years old, I'm the youngest Master within a society of wealthy and influential men.Claire Elliot is my psychology professor in college - that is, at least, until I make her my first courtesan.She believes she knows everything about how the mind works……and I believe I can prove her wrong.
