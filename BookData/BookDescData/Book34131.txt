The time has come to step out of the shadows . . .  Valeria McGregor was a better shot, a better fighter, and smarter than everyone she’d ever gone up against as an agent for the DEA. Then she’d uncovered illegal activity within her own organization and was fired as part of a cover-up. That was how she’d joined the secret group who reports only to the president. Valeria fully plans to find the men and women hell bent on ruling the world from the shadows, but she also has revenge on the mind.  Valeria left the secret team thinking she could go undercover and get to the bottom of how this shadow group was funded. Valeria discovered too late that when it comes to true evil, it’s best to face it with your team at your back. Alone and on the run, Valeria is being hunted by some of the most dangerous people on the planet. She has learned how the shadow group has been funded and what they have planned next, but she still has to find out where. If the shadow group pulls it off, then there may be no stopping them.  Desperate to escape, Valeria calls her team only to find they aren’t close enough to help her. Grant Macay, a trusted Air Force Pararescueman, is brought into the fold and sent to rescue Valeria. With her past at the DEA alive and threatening her survival, and the world’s most vicious drug lord hunting her, Valeria and Grant must make their way back to the team to prepare for the battle of their lives.
