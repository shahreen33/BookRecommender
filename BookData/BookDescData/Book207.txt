"Stephen is used to invisibility. He was born that way. Invisible. Cursed. Elizabeth sometimes wishes for invisibility. When you're invisible, no one can hurt you. So when her mother decides to move the family to New York City, Elizabeth is thrilled. It's easy to blend in there. Then Stephen and Elizabeth meet. To Stephen's amazement, she can see him. To Elizabeth's amazement, she wants him to be able to see her - all of her. But as the two become closer, an invisible world gets in their way." [from bibliographic record] (8 sound discs)
