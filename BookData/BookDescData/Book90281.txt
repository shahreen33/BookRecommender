Junior-high student Misaki Suzuhara has just arrived in Tokyo to live with her glamorous TV news star aunt and to attend the prestigious Eriol Academy. But what excites her above everything is Angelic Layer, the arena game where you control an Angel—a miniature robot fighter whose moves depend on your mind! Misaki's small, just like her Angel, Hikaru (named after her favorite manga, Magic Knight Rayearth), but her natural battle skills have been recognized by a very odd scientist, Ichiro “Icchan” Mihara. Before she knows it, Misaki is an up-and-coming contender in Angelic Layer . . . and in way over her not-very-tall head! This is Book One of two in the Angelic Layer saga.Set several years before Chobits, Angelic Layer also tells the story of Chi's creator, and is the book when CLAMP developed their art style later seen in Chobits and Tsubasa. Remastered from the original artwork in CLAMP's studio vaults, Book One and Book Two contain several bonus Angelic Layer illustrations in full color.
