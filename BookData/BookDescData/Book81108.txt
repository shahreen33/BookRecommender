Suzie and Mary are excited to welcome a birdwatching group to Dune House, the majestic bed and breakfast on the beach. The guests are a colorful bunch and some of them have some unusual requests. They are hoping to sight a rare bird in the area. But tensions rise and tempers flare when they donâ€™t see eye to eye with some surfers camping on the beach.  Then things go from bad to worse when someone lands up dead. With the suspect list getting longer, the police have their work cut out to find the murderer. Suzie and Mary, with a little help from their loveable Labrador, do some snooping to try and help the investigation along.  Will they uncover the truth before the killer strikes again?
