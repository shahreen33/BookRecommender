It's foxy business, but someone's gotta do it.Kenzie made a deal with the foxes to live with them for six months in exchange for the potion that saved her sister's life. What she didn't expect was how much it felt like home, more than the house she'd lived in her entire life.But this agreement doesn't change the one she made with the Alpha of the West Coast Pride - and it isn't humans breaking into his warehouses, but something much, much worse.This is a steamy reverse harem shifter romance with some MM. All paranormal books by Emma Dean exist in the same paranormal world - the Council of Paranormals.
