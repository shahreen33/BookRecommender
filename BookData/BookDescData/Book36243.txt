Ever wonder why the sales department never gets along with the accounting department? Or why some people always get a raise even though you deserve one more? It's because of their sun signs! This self-evident fact eludes know-it-all management, which explains why HR departments (a Libran invention) are always putting teams of incompatible astrological enemies together merely on the grounds that they all have Harvard MBAs--then they scratch their heads in wonder when the company goes into freefall. Readers will find out who goes with whom in office romances (do we really need to ask what the Aries and the Scorpio are doing in that broom closet?), why Leos are never late for work and Aquarians usually are, why you should beware of the Gemini's explanation for missing a deadline (most likely a lie), why Virgos color-code their erasers, or why Scorpios despise Capricorns (duh, that is so obvious since Caps think they should be the next V.P. in Charge of Everything). Darkside Zodiac at Work is the book for anyone who wants to find out how the rest of the zodiac intends to rig the market, move their cheese, steal their thunder, rain on their parade, sabotage their business plan, and generally ruin their workday (and how they can do it right back) then this is the book for them! They can always tell their boss it came free with the latest subscription to Forbes.
