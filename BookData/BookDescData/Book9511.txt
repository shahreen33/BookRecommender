Tiger-shifter Jonathon Reynell has spent a chunk of his immortal life serving his country. As an I-Op his life revolves around the next mission, the next natural high. A soldier sent into the deadliest of combats, he didn’t expect immortality to be an issue, to live on while everyone he knows and loves dies. When the toll begins to show and he finds himself at the bottom of another bottle, he decides to go back to his roots, back to his home to clear his head. Rock bottom is not where he expected to be when he found his mate with a rose in hand and his name on her lush lips. Tori is the very definition of perfection and beauty. She’s also in the crosshairs of the enemy. And if there is one thing this sniper knows, it’s that his sights are the only ones that should be set on her.
