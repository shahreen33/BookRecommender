Who's more dangerous? The serial killer you're hunting, or the one you never knew existed? Every year, thousands of women go missing in the UK, some of them never to be seen again. A killer stalks the streets of Edinburgh, trawling through the thousands of tourists during the Edinburgh International Festival, looking for prey. He finds a target, and she disappears, and despite a missing persons report, she's never seen again. This time he's made a mistake; the American female isn't a tourist. She's a local. And there was a witness. But shortly after seeing the woman die, the witness is incarcerated for an unconnected crime. When he's released, instead of going to the police, he decides to profit from the American's death. The killer is taking out anybody he thinks might have been told, but DI Frank Miller is assigned the case, and soon, the witness, the killer and the detective will clash in an explosive showdown...but not before more lives are taken...and somebody close to Miller is on the list...
