Second book in Starbirth series.Lock Harford, a teleporter (Shifter) who moves through another dimension using the power of thought, works alongside British Special Forces in trouble spots around the world. His employers at the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) need him to eliminate lethal weapons that will bring world warâ€”and ultimately world destruction. Terrorists are using the new weapons to inflict heavy losses on British Special Forces in the conflict zones of Afghanistan and the borderlands by Iran. Taking Special Air Service troopers with him, including his colleague Jimmy Mackenzie and his team, Lock is embroiled in fierce battle. The situation is precarious when personal enemies, bent on eliminating Lock and Jimmy before they can find the weapons, pursue them across the world. This is a powerful tale of terrorism in a dangerous world where new human powers are commonplace and growing. Intertwined with the action are elements of humanity and humour that make these books accessible to everybody, embroiling the reader in the lives and conflicts of the characters.
