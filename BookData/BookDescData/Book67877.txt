So much has changed since Jack and Channon first met. Channon's grown into his confidence, no longer paralyzed by indecision and self-doubt. But his anxieties still plague him. And when he thinks Jack wants a future that can't include him, he panics.  Jack's trying not to smother Channon, giving him space to breathe. But when he sees his boy struggling he can't just let it go. And when Channon brings up old fears and desires, Jack finds himself confronted with a truth he hadn't admitted even to himself.  He's too old for new kinks, isn't he? Or is that exactly what he needs right now?
