Catty has always wanted to find out who her birth mother was, and amazingly enough, she has the power to allow her to do just that. When Catty goes back in time, she not only manages to meet her mother, but she also inherits a secret scroll that is the key to destroying the Atrox once and for all. Catty will have to go head-to-head with the most ancient evil of all time - if she can live that long.
