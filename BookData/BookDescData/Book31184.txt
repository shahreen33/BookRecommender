Let me be clear: I’ve been friends with Caitlin Ng for more than a decade, and I’ve had a crush on her for just as long. And I’ve known, all that time, that I wasn’t her type.  When we met, we were both studying computer engineering at university. She was near the top of the class, and I was in danger of flunking out. Now, she’s a CEO, and I, well…  I’m wearing an inflatable T-Rex costume and dancing along to Christmas carols sung by an elderly barbershop quartet.  Yes, I’m being paid to do this.  And that’s how Caitlin finds me when she leaves work late in the middle of a snowstorm. She asks to stay with me because her house is farther away and her power is out. Of course, I say yes.  When the heat goes out in my apartment and she asks me to join her in bed to snuggle for warmth, I say yes, too.  But being so close to her is dangerous for my heart…or could a weekend of Christmas fun actually lead to the romance I desire?
