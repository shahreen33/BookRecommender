The Sacred Band Goes North - To War!Here is the first full-length novel from the notorious "Thieves World" fantasy universe, where gods still stalk the land, warring with demons and human sorcerers and trampling unfortunate humanity underfoot.If you like stories of bold brave knights employed in meritorious duty, or tales of ladies delicate and fair, be warned. Sanctuary-the meanest, seediest town in all of fantasy-may be too much for you sensibilities. There wizards, bards and maidens mingle with murderers and thieves, and the fight breaking out at the next table may be the one that ends your life.The hero of "Beyond Sanctuary" is Tempus, leader of mercenaries and warrior-servant of Vashanka, god of storm and war. But he is a hero cursed. Any woman that he loves must loathe him. And anyone, male or female, who loves him soon dies of it. Under such a curse his god's "gift" of immortality is one he would cast off - if only he could.In "Beyond Sanctuary" Tempus and his Scared Band go north to war against the deadliest demons and most malevolent mages conceivable. In this war there is no such thing as honorable defeat, or even honorable death in a losing cause. The winners will eat your soul, and you will live one in the Belly of the Beast.With Niko, Cime, and the Froth Daughter Jihan, Tempus faces the Archmage Datan and his unholy followers in a battle for the Rankan Empire's survival and that of his very soul.
