This unique and celebrated biography describes how a largely self-educated boy from a small village in Scotland entered the world of scholarship &amp; became the first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, &amp; a lexicographer greater by far than Dr Johnson. It also provides an absorbing account of how the dictionary was written, the personalities of the people working on it &amp; the endless difficulties which nearly led to the whole enterprise being abandoned.
