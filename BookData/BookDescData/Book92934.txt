Paris Talks: Addresses Give by 'Abdul'l-Baha in 1911 documents the extraordinary series of inspiring and uplifting public addresses 'Abdul'l-Baha gave on his historic visit to Paris in the early twentieth century. Despite advanced age and poor health, he set out from Palestine in 1911 on a momentous journey to Europe and North America to share the teachings and vision of the Baha'i Faith with the people of the West. Addressing such subjects as the nature of humankind, the soul, the Prophets of God, the establishment of world peace, the abolition of all forms of prejudice, the equality of women and men, the harmony of science and religion, the causes of war, and many other subjects, 'Abdul'l-Baha spoke in a profound yet simple manner that transcended social and cultural barriers. His deep spiritual wisdom remains as timely and soul-stirring today as it was a century ago.
