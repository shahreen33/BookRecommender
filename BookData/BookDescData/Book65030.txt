With a big white wedding on the horizon, Scarlett really should have decided by now . . . When she has the chance to house-sit in Notting Hill - the setting of one of her favourite movies - Scarlett jumps at the chance.

Scarlett soon finds herself starring in a romantic comedy of her very own: but who will end up as the leading man?
