The forces of darkness pour across the Anathrian continent in their pursuit of conquest. The Companions search desperately for their missing friend Cale, and the thief Gareth rushes to met mysterious benefactors who wish to use the Storm Shield for their own purposes. The Scythian invasion armada is met by forces they have vastly underestimated and war rages from one end of the Anathrian continent to the other. The dark ruler of the ancient Varanthian city of Oruc Xhuul has his own plans for the Companions, and if they do not accomplish the tasks he set forth, he will transform Cale into a creature similar to himself. Meanwhile, the dark deity Thuric Xhuul has discovered a weakness in the prison which holds him. He will return to the mortal realm and remind them all why he is called The Overlord of Death.
