The current generation's best and brightest "live and learn" on Northport University's picturesque Ivy League campusâ€” a mosaic of talents, creeds, and skin colors united in their desire to make the world a better place. Senior Jason Curran is the epitome of the Northport student: an Australian martial artist who speaks fifteen languages and majors simultaneously in Neuroscience and Engineering. Yet all his life Jason has been slightly out of tune with the world outside of him. Northport is no different: if he is a perfect fit on paper, the brilliant but reclusive student does not fit in on campus, whose hidden social curriculum he fails to navigate, instead focusing obsessively, and alone, on a mysterious project. Overnight, Jason's orderly life is thrown upside down when Northport abruptly and inexplicably suspends him based on grave allegations. Can he restore his reputation and overcome his social isolation, which is brought to a whole new level by these accusations? Turmoil, romance, exotic locations, and a relentless investigation by a determined Northport Dean are all brought together in Jason's thrilling multi-continent quest for understanding, invention, redemption, and the realization that social awkwardness is not a crime.
