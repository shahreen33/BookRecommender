It is 1904. A mysterious letter written in 1813 by an apparently dying man to his lover is discovered. This letter recounts the burying of a fabulous treasure brought out of Russia in 1812. It is a window on a story of love, war, struggles against adversity, betrayal, kidnapping, murder, and survival against the most terrible odds. This is a page turner of a story that you won't want to put down.
