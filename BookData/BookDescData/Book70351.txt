Aparajita is a tenacious go-getter. Her name means unconquerable in Sanskrit, and she lives up to its meaning.  Just like any other ambitious girl, she desires to fulfil her dreams and become an independent individual. Far and wide, the shadow of her melancholy past chases her passage. The fact that her widowed mother is a former sex worker irks the community. Nonetheless, she is not ashamed to reveal her mother's past.  Will she lose hope, or will she defy an enigma that is centuries-old? Will she ever conquer the hearts of a prestige-obsessed community?  See the world through Aparajita's prism in a tale stirred by some real life events.
