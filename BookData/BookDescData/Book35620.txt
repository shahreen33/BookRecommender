Canon William says of De Montfort's book, The Secret of the Rosary- "It goes far beyond mere research. We might say that it contains everything that can be said about the Rosary, its content and form, its real worth, about the instruction necessary for its appreciation and use."De Montfort calls the Rosary "the mystical rose tree of Jesus and Mary in life, death, and eternity." He says that the roses of your rosary will "never wilt or die, and they will be just as exquisite thousands of years from now as they are today."He warns us against both the ignorant and scholars who regard the Rosary as something of little importance..."The Rosary is a priceless treasure which is inspired by God."
