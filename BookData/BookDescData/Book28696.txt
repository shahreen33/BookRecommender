Andrew Beckwith has already devoted his life to one girl--and as far as he's concerned, she's all he needs. The rough-around-the-edges bad boy left his reckless ways behind six years ago when his daughter Bell was born. To the female population's dismay, he's unapologetically single. When Bell's mother walked out on them years ago, he vowed never to let another woman close enough to hurt them again.Amelia Van Ecken isn't just another woman. She's an independent, smart, and savvy businesswoman who doesn't have time for sex, much less love. In the midst of a drawn-out, bitter divorce, all she wants is to bury herself in work. But when sharp-tongued Amelia and stubborn Andrew cross paths, sparks fly--and burn. Two things are obvious in an instant: they want each other, and they're from different worlds. It's the perfect formula for an off-the-charts one-night stand. After all, it's not as if opposites ever attract.The First Taste is a dual-POV spin-off of bestselling Amazon romance, Slip of the Tongue. Both books are standalones available in Kindle Unlimited. It's not necessary to read them in order, however, it is recommended to avoid spoilers.
