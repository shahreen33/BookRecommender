This chronology examines the Nazi regime's tenure from the Night of Long Knives in 1934 through the fall of Berlin in May 1945. Each month is covered in a compelling narrative style that reveals the growth of anti-Semitism and other grim realities of everyday life under Hitler. Illustrated with maps and archival photographs, the book also relates the stories behind military action like the invasion of Poland, Stalingrad, the Battle of Kursk and D-Day, as well as touchstone events like the 1942 Wannsee Conference and the 1936 Berlin Olympics.
