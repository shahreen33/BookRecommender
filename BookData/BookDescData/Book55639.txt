Saxby Smart is no ordinary ten-year-old. He's the best detective in the world, or at least the best one who also happens to be in elementary school. With the help of his Thinking Chair and his two best friends, Saxby proves that age makes no difference when it comes to saving the day. As Saxby solves three of his most puzzling cases, the reader solves the mystery alongside him, getting peeks at pages of his casebook as the crimes unfold, and searching for clues rather than letting the main character do all the work and have all the fun.
