On a morbidly hot August day in the depths of the Grand Canyon, Lorraine Brodek and her friend Erma Bombeck found themselves caught without a smidge of shade or water. The next thing they knew, their knees buckled and they hit the sand. Gasping for air, they groaned and rolled under a crag from which a scorpion skittered. That's when Erma mumbled her obit. 'I can see the headlines now...Famous Humorist, Newspaper Columnist, and TV Celebrity Dies on Trail with Little Unknown Person.' At that moment, Lorraine promised God that if he let them live, she would write a book. This is her hilarious account of growing up in 90210 in the midst of A-listers. Go behind the scenes of show biz with her husband, who produced two B (bad) movies with Oscar-winning stars, and relive the embarrassment of her loss on the number-one television game show. With humor that jumps off the page, this book shows truth is way funnier than fiction and that a 'little, unknown person' can turn her crazy, bawdy, stories into a wonderful collection about A Nobody in a Somebody World: My Hollywood Life in Beverly Hills.
