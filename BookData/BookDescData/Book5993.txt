When everything that defines you is stripped away, who do you become? War has come to Atalanta, infecting its quiet villages and lush woodlands, igniting whispered worries in its glittering capital. All across the dominion, young men are being Selected for Military and sent to the front lines...and eighteen-year-old Aris Haan's childhood sweetheart is one of them. Pyralis Nekkos, Atalanta's leader, has kept the truth from his people, that their dominion will fall...and much sooner than anyone could guess. Galena Vadim, his reluctant ally, wishes she could forget their shared past...until her future seems to depend on it. For the boy she loves, Aris, a talented wingjet pilot, will give up everything - her home, her name, even her face... ...only to become the key to her dominion's survival.
