 In the Badlands, you keep your enemies close and the monsters closer.  Welcome to the Badlands Paranormal Police Department, where Chief Ezekias ‘Zeke’ Phoenix, a dragon who believes rules are meant to be followed, has accepted his new post. His job is simple: keep the fragile peace between dragons, hellions, and the denizens of hell. The rules in Infernal City are even simpler: mind your business, watch your back, shoot first, and don’t bother asking questions.When a dead hellion crashes into his life, Zeke and the Badlands PPD will break all the rules of the City. To find the killer, he’s going to make some powerful enemies who would prefer to see the new dragon chief of the PPD retired…permanently. If Zeke fails, the Badlands will plunge into a civil war. If he succeeds, he places a target on his back, and his enemies rarely miss.Will Zeke risk setting off the powder keg of Infernal City? Will he find the killer and bring him to justice before the Badlands becomes a wasteland? Or will they give him an early retirement package…sudden death?If you like Jim Butcher, Domino Finn, Michael Anderle, M. D. Massey, Rick Gualtieri, Eric Quinn Knowles, Noah K.
