 "What kind of good girl are you?" I ask. "That's not even something good girls do, Princess."  "I'm a very bad good girl," Ashley says, pouting. "I think maybe I need to be punished, Ethan..."   Rule #8 â€“ We both want this, so let's take full advantage of it. No holding back, no reservations, no restrictions, maximum pleasure...  Why am I dating this girl? I'm supposed to be the one teasing her and getting what I want. It's not supposed to be the other way around. I'll give her what she wants when I'm good and ready to do it. That's how this used to work. She's changed the rules completely.  I guess that's how this started in the first place. This is just one of those invisible rules that no one ever talks about. Ashley's Rule.  "You two really need to learn how to get along," my dad says, completely oblivious. "It's a work in progress, I guess."  "Oh, I'm sure they'll figure it out soon enough," Ashley's mom says, winking at me.  Yeah, so... we've still got to tell my dad what's going on, except the way things are going I'm pretty sure he's going to kill me when he finds out.
