Something is rotten in the state of California…  The dawning civil war has ended in a truce. Scavengers and traders all over the country are settling down for the long, hard winter to come. With their new camp outside the maze of New Angeles at the coast growing every day, Bree, Nate, and the gang have their hands full—yet something is not quite right. Maybe one last run before the winter is all that’s needed to cure that itch. What could possibly go wrong?
