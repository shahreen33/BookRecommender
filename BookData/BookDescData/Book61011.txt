I was born of nothing.  I’m a Void, a rare supernatural capable of absorbing powers at the brush of my skin.  Feared. Hated. Untouchable.  Thibault Academy is full of supernaturals that want me dead, and the most powerful of them, the Paragons, will stop at nothing to ensure I go back to the hell I came from. They’re cruel, heartless, and have created an unlikely alliance to take me down.  If I want to learn how to control the nothingness, I’ll have to survive them.  I was born of the void, but I’ll die from the power.  This is a reverse harem bully romance.
