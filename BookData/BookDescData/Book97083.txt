I’m a former SEAL and battle-hardened, trained to neutralize an enemy with ruthless precision. But this target is unlike no other I’ve encountered before. My job is clear cut. Isolate and hold my target for one week in a remote location. Easy. Until the moment I catch sight of her. Innocent. Untouched. Vulnerable. Charlotte Reed is the pawn in a dangerous game. And I hold her safety in my grasp. All it takes is one look at her fresh-faced beauty and generous curves and I am driven to make her mine. Using my brand of carnal interrogation, I break through her shyness, forcing Charlotte to share her most private thoughts and dreams. Nothing is off limits. I want to know every secret, every hope. The sweet and smart woman is left with no place to hide. So why do I feel like I’m the one whose defenses have been smashed? My ice-cool self-control melts under the primitive need to protect and win her—body and soul.  Bad Boy SEAL is a quick and naughty page turner involving an obsessed alpha hero, one shy heroine, and enough insta-love and sizzling romantic suspense to melt your kindle. HEA and no cheating in this emotional tale.
