In his long career as an English teacher at Holy Trinity High School, Michael Bishop felt that he was as good at reading people as he was at reading books. That all changes when he discovers the body of the school’s highly successful but universally disliked football coach, Albert Zappala. Even more disturbing is the news that the coach, whose net worth was in the millions, was murdered. Suddenly, everyone is a suspect, including students, colleagues, and even the Sisters who run the school. Bishop’s skill in reading people is put to the ultimate test. Like Captain Ahab searching for the answers in his pursuit of the white whale, Bishop searches into the dark past for the key that will unlock the mystery. Will the truth destroy his belief in the basic goodness of man?
