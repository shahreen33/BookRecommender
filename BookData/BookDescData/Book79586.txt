Voyager 1 has recently crossed the boundary of our solar system and passed into interstellar space, and Voyager 2 is likely to follow suit, on a different path, between 2016 and 2017. The two Voyager probes will continue to transmit details of discoveries beyond our solar system until at least 2020.
