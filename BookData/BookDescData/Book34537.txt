Left or right. It’s that simple, and it isn’t simple at all.If I turn left, the road will lead me back to the man I promised my life to, the one I’d imagined building a family with, the one who’s done everything in his power to get me back.If I turn right, the road will take me to the man I loved first, the man who brought me back to life, the man who would do anything to keep me.I knew the fork in the road was inevitable; it was the decision I never wanted to make between choices I didn't know I had. And I love them both.My heart is destined to exist in two equal halves — one with each man. But one half beats stronger, the vein running deepest, and holds my choice in silence long before I know it for myself. The realization of what I have to do, of the heart I have to break, just might break mine too. Left or right. All I have to do is take a breath and turn.
