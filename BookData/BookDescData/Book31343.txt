Ben - Free spirit. Nomad. Drifter. Those are the labels my family always threw at me. I’ve been on my own and on the road—nothing but me and my motorcycle—for a long time now and that’s the way I like it. When an old friend badgers me into going on a singles cruise, I moan and groan through the whole thing until I find myself in the middle of perfect blue water, getting to know the most beautiful—and uptight man—I’ve ever met.  Silas - My twin sister, Simone, is pure evil. Why else would she force a mandatory vacation from our co-owned bakery on me? While I don’t agree that I’m too high-strung, I will admit that my anxiety does sometimes get the best of me. But a singles cruise? I don’t want or have time for a relationship despite what she might think. I give in and go on the cruise, not expecting anything except plenty of sunshine and all the cocktails my drink package will allow, when the perfect stranger settles into the seat next to me and takes my breath away. The only problem? We couldn’t be more opposite if we tried.  Ship Off is a stand-alone novella of approximately 30,000 words. It features an exciting time at sea, a terrible Hawaiian shirt collection, and two completely opposite men who couldn’t be more perfect for each other. HEA guaranteed.
