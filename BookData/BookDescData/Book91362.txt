Ordinary moments that will one day reshape the galaxy...  A Seer in a spaceport fleamarket and a StarReader in his ivory tower - both with messages for Yesenia Mayes. The first days on Stardust Prime for a very special assistant and a very important class of tadpoles. The birth of two daughters - and the terrible sacrifices of the mothers who love them.  This is a volume of six short stories, companion tales that fit in my KarmaCorp world. They can be read before the existing books or after them - they are meant to fill in some of the small, interesting nooks and crannies in a world that has many of them.  (Existing readers will recognize one story from the Starbound anthology. All the rest are new!)
