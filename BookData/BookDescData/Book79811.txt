Famed spoken-word poet Laura Dockrill's hilarious read-aloud about an outraged baked good!Oooohhh . . . not you again!AGGGHH It's so bright! . . . Close this book this very second, you nosy noodle!Cookie has woken up on the wrong side of the bed and is very angry. You want to know why? Well, you'd have to keep reading to find out, but now Cookie's calling you annoying and telling you to mind your own business. If by chance you do stick around, you might hear about a certain roommate's terrible musical skills, why you should never let your barber try out a "new look," how it's impossible to find a hat that fits a cookie, and why an ice-cream parlor that's out of your favorite treat can be a source of desolation. Then there's the matter of a hungry bird who tries to snack on you. . . . Propelled by quirky humor and woes that every young child can relate to, Angry Cookie suggests that sometimes the best way to cheer up a grumpy lump is simply by being there -- and lending your ears.
