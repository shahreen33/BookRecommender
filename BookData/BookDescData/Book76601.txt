Featuring colors from Eisner nominated JOHN RAUCH, the disturbing and striking THE BEAUTY returns, merging characters and storylines from earlier arcs into a twisting tale of vanity, power, and the quest to obtain both at any cost. In a world where achieving pure beauty means dying for it, the question of what life is actually worth becomes more important than ever. With art from co-creator JEREMY HAUN and guest artist THOMAS NACHLIK. Collects issues 12 through 16.
