Love is like an avalanche. It hits hard, fast and without mercy. At least it did for me when Sculpt, the lead singer of the rock band Tear Asunder knocked me off my feet. Literally, because heâ€™s also a fighter, illegally of course, and he taught me how to fight. He also taught me how to love and I fell hard for him. I mean the guy could do sweet, when he wasn't doing bossy, and I like sweet. Then it all shattered.Kidnapped. Starved. Beaten. I was alone and fighting to survive.When I heard Sculpt's voice, I thought he was there to save me.I was wrong.(It is highly recommended to read "With You" the novella first).*Warning: This book contains some disturbing situations, strong language and sexual content. Over 18 years.This is a love story with some dark elements. Dark contemporary romance. No cliffhanger and next in the Tear Asunder series is Ream's story (the band's lead guitarist).
