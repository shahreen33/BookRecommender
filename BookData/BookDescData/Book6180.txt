Ivy always thought that breaking a curse with True Love’s Kiss was the ultimate romantic gesture in fairy tales. But when she has to plant one on a prince who’s been dead for 200 years, it’s just gross.After the “incident”, seventeen-year-old Ivy discovers she’s a witch, and she’s not at all happy about it. An underground organization of human warriors called the Eradicators are hunting her, like they do all other creatures tainted with magic—witches and wizards, werewolves, vampires, and fae to name a few. To escape, she’s found refuge in Salmagundi; a town hidden behind magical wards to anyone who doesn’t use magic. But she can’t relax yet. The secret she keeps about her past could get her killed if discovered. Keeping a low profile is her main goal. Too bad Garren—the most obnoxious, pretentious, and not hot guy she ever met—won’t leave her alone. No other person on the planet can get her blood racing like he can.Now the wards are failing, putting every resident in danger of being discovered by the Eradicators.Thankfully, a possible solution has been found and Ivy is the key. All she has to do is awaken the wizard prince who cast the wards over 200 years ago and bring him back to Salmagundi to save the town. Only two obstacles stand in the way: his whereabouts are unknown and only True Love’s Kiss can break the curse he’s under. That’s right. She has to kiss the dead guy.Together with her cousin and tag-a-long Garren, she sets out on a quest to find her prince. After putting up with dragons, vampires and one too many necrophilia jokes, can she survive long enough to take one for the team and PUCKER UP?Paperback edition only available at Amazon.com
