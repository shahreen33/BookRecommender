  HE'S READY TO PLAY . . . ARE YOU? 
 As the new owner of The Players Club, Brent "Mac" MacMillan is all about dirty sex, wicked sin and carnal pleasure . . . served up his way. After being burned in the past, he's always been careful to choose experienced females who enjoy submitting to his dark desires, and are willing to play by his demanding rules without expecting any emotional attachments in return.  Hiring beautiful interior designer Stephanie Randall to create fantasy bedrooms within his club is his first mistake. She's curious, flirtatious, and makes his blood run hotter than it ever has before. Innocent when it comes to all the debauchery his sinful world has to offer, she wants to take a walk on the wild side . . . with him.  His second mistake? Saying yes. And his third? Falling for the one woman he knows he can never have.
