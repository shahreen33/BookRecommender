  An Undiscovered Past. A Feud Between Families. A Unity Filled with Hope.    Harper Blake thought she had found where she belonged. A family who'd accepted her, a safe home that would protect her, and a love for the boy who saved her from death. Her life at Sacred Moon Shelter for Endangered Wolves was everything she could have asked for.  All of that changes with a spark of a fire and a confrontation that leaves her on the verge of death once more. After another close call with the Angel of Death, Harper soon discovers that everything she thought was true, was woven in lies.  The deceit puts a heavy burden on Harper's heart, and when she finally realizes who her true mate is, she's unsure which path to choose.  Or if she wants to.   As much as Harper needs time to figure things out, the tension between packs grows day by day, to the point where it's time for her to give up on her Wolf Tamer title and become a Wolf Seeker.  Her first quest? Bring the four Cardinal Packs together, and that will put her to the test, leaving her with the task of deciding whether love is worth the risk of losing it all.    For the sake of unity, power, and love, Harper is ready to protect the only pack she's ever known.
