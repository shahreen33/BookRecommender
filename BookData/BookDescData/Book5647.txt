He stole the treasure. She got him in the jewels. Last night I accomplished the single largest heist of my life -- the surviving swords of King Arthur’s Round Table. They are worth $140 million.  I celebrate the usual way, calling my favorite escort service to send a glorious dark-haired beauty.  This call girl is like none other. She’s passionate and wild, and I want to keep her for myself.  I’ve stolen some of the greatest jewels known to man. This mere woman should be no issue.  But in the morning, she is gone.  And so are my swords.  I know when I’ve met my match. But make no mistake, I will find her.  When I am done, both the swords and her lying, thieving body will be mine.
