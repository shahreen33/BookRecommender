Wylie Kogan is an aspiring artist, stumping for work in 1963 California (think Mad Men, but with palm trees). When a fawning fan letter grants him access to his cartoonist hero, the celebrated Joseph Ahlstrom, he's quick to take advantage of a proffered portfolio review... but winds up learning more than he ever wanted to about Joe when he stumbles across some of his idol's illicit fetish art.His hasty, ill-considered theft of a drawing triggers a series of events he never planned on... most of which involve Joseph's imposing and resolute partner, Roya. Yes, Roya is a 135-page graphic novel m/f/m femdom story, with ghost green on art, C. Spike Trotman on story chores, and kinomatika handling the cover.
