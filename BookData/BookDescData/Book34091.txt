Abigail Mueez knows all about being something you’re not. Everyone knows she works security in Washington D.C., but that wasn’t exactly the truth. There are many layers of deception in Abby’s life from her job to the man she’s with—a man she doesn’t have time to fall in love with when her life and so much more was on the line. Too bad she didn’t tell her heart that.  He knew there was more to Abby than everyone else saw, but he never asked. He had his own secrets to keep. But then the President called and all deceptions fell to the side as more than just their truths are laid bare. With bullets flying and lives at stake, could he and Abby do the scariest thing possible—become the couple that would set the town of Keeneston on fire?
