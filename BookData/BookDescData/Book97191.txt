Scott Freeman is a man of reasona college professor grounded in the rational and practical. But he becomes uneasy after finding an anonymous love letter hidden in his daughters room: No one could ever love you like I do. No one ever will. We will be together forever. One way or another. But the reality of Ashleys plight far exceeds Scotts worst suspicions. One drink too many had led Ashley, a beautiful, bright art student, into what she thought was just a fling with a blue-collar bad boy. But now, no amount of pleading or reasoning can discourage his phone calls, ardent e-mails, and constant, watchful gaze. Michael OConnell is but a malignant shadow of a man. His brash, handsome features conceal a black and empty soul. Control is his religion. Cunning and criminal skill are his stock-in-trade. Rage is his language
