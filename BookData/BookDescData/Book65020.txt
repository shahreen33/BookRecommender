Written by a respected maternity nurse, this text addresses the issue of sleep-starved nights, inconsolable crying and feeding on demand - stories that make the prospect of bringing a tiny baby home for the first time daunting for any proud parent. The book features input from clients, readers and mothers. It aims to give practical and reassuring advice to new parents by suggesting a strategy developed through years of research and experience. When implemented it should ensure babies sleep through the night from an early age, feed regularly and well from either breast or bottle and are less likely to suffer from colic.
