"YouTube Mastermind" Orion Carloto turns raw emotion into powerful, digestible verse in her debut collection of poetry.Flux is a somber narrative, an ode to change, a collection of poetry and prose written from the many states of grief over a broken heart.  With original illustrations by artist Katie Roberts, Orion Carloto creates a dream world for the brokenhearted and paints a whimsical picture around the themes of love, loss, solitude, depression, sex, nostalgia, and unrequited romance. Flux takes readers through a raw and sorrowful journey of each and every bitter moment of heartbreak. Forewarning, Flux is best read with a warm cup of coffee in hand.
