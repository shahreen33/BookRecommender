When Georgia "Peaches" Kent wakes up in a morgue, it's no wonder her first thought is that she's a vampire, but after a late night run in with a black cat named Bane, she's less and less sure she's a vampire and more on the side of Bane in thinking that she's a mystery. Peaches is dead, she's sure of that. What she's not sure of is what she is. But that's alright because a cat has offered to help her discover what she is. Except Bane isn't a cat at all, but a very attractive Egyptian vampire. Now they're on a mission to discover what Peaches is, which leads them into the heart of a vamp-goth club. But then Peaches goes and opens her big mouth, tension skyrockets, and marriage to the sexy Egyptian vamp is the only way out. Or is it? Join Peaches and Bane on this fun, fast paced adventure as they try to discover what she is, and hope they don't get killed in the process.
