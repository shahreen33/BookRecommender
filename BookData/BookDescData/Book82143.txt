Just 15 minutes with God? That sounds like a stingy amount of time to devote to the Creator of the universe. But I’ve found that 15 minutes can lead to a prayerful attitude for the rest of the day when I start out this way.This little exercise is not meant to trivialize our time with God or say that we can cram in a relationship with him in just a few minutes a day. Rather, it is meant to get us into a thankful frame of mind so we can look for God’s involvement in all we do, in everyone we meet, and in every circumstance we encounter.During my commute to work, I go through the alphabet and praise God through all the words I can think of about him that start with each letter. Verses that include some of the words come to mind, so I pray those to him.When I get to Z and my 15 minutes is about up, I begin to pray for the things, people, and situations I care about and then I finish that and ask him, “Speak to me, Lord, and help me to listen and obey.” I try to remain silent and listen. The A to Z exercise allows me to praise God before I get started on all my requests and needs. It somehow helps me focus on God’s greatness and his amazing love, mercy, and generosity to me. And usually that focus stays with me, at least to some extent, during the day.I hope it helps you to focus on his goodness as you pray and listen for what he has to say to you. Add your own words as you go through the alphabet.
