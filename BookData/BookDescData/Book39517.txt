The minute I laid eyes on Jenny Price in medical school she was mine — One look and she belonged to me. I had one chance to make her mine, but she ran away.Now I’m the Chief of Orthopedic Surgery and not much phases me.That is, until I walk into a room and see her. Dr. Jenny Price right there in front of me.She’s even more beautiful than she was years ago, and her scent makes me want her body to be my next vacation. Too bad she’s intent on picking a fight with me every other day.But when she barges into my office and brushes those soft curves against me, that’s when all the arguing turns into something else. And now that we’ve both gotten a taste, I don’t know if either of us can stop.
