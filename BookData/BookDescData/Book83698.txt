The last thing Chase expects is to fall for Annie, but he knows he’ll never live up to her idea of the perfect man. On the outside, Annie and Loden’s relationship appears picture perfect. But behind closed doors, Annie quickly realizes Loden isn’t the man he pretends to be. Every time her not so well laid plans crumble, and Loden proves to be not so Mr. Right, Chase is there to pick her up and brush her off. Will she realize the perfection she’s been searching for has been in front of her all this time?*Long After is a companion novel to Sometimes Never and Before Now.
