Kate It was a simple plan: go to a bar far away from home, hook up with a stranger I would never see again, and get my first experience before I head off to college. How was I supposed to know that stranger would turn out to be my dad’s good friend? And how could I have fallen for him in the span of a single day?  Jack I didn’t mean for any of this to happen. I had no idea she was my friend’s daughter. My minister friend, for Chrissakes. But once I’ve tasted the forbidden fruit I know there is no going back. She’s sealed my fate, and my heart, with her large expressive eyes and steaming hot body. I know my soul is doomed for the things I’m doing to her, but I don’t care. I’ve fallen hard, and nothing is going to keep us apart.  A Day And Forever is a standalone romance with no cheating, no cliffhangers, and a happily ever after guaranteed. It's a quick, juicy read!.
