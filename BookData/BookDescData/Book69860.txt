More than 100 fun food-crafting ideas that will engage, delight, and amaze kids-from actress, entrepreneur, and mom, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and former Martha Stewart Living contributor Gia Russo.Why stop with making basic brownies? Why not put them on a stick and decorate them? Why not take boring broccoli and turn it into a yummy cheese muffin instead? Sarah Michelle Gellar learned quickly that to get her kids to be adventurous with food, she had to involve them in preparing it. She wanted that process to be fun and help them develop self-confidence, creative thinking, and even math skills! So Sarah and co-author Gia Russo came up with more than 100 fun food-crafting ideas that take basic food preparation to a surprising new level.Organized by month, the book offers projects for every occasion and theme, including Super Bowl, Valentine's Day, Shark Week, Halloween, and even a Star Wars Day with licensed Star Wars creations!
