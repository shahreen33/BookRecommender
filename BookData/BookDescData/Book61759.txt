Crystal Cove's small town charm is what most people love about it.  Brady Lowe sure loves it. He is about as small town as you get. Bradyâ€™s content running his dad's construction company, eating at the diner every Thursday, and taking home a local lady from his sister's bar when he has an itch to scratch. Brady scratches that itch just fine, until Glory Falcone blows into town. Glory is mouthy, smart, and hotter than June in Crystal Cove and Brady knows she's the one he's been waiting for.  Glory gets as far as her jeep will take her; it just so happens to be cute, idyllic Crystal Cove. It also just so happens to have Brady Lowe as it's welcoming committee. Glory doesn't exactly believe in happily ever afters, not after the "after's" she's had. At least she didn't. Not until Brady Lowe's determined ways, crooked smile and home town charm make her want for more.
