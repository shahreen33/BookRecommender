I was Kira’s from the first moment I saw her. Maybe it was love at first sight, but I was only ten.She became my best friend.My crush.The girl I can’t live without.But I have to.She was almost mine, but my father took away my chance.Now she lives across the hall from me. Instead of possessing the title of girlfriend, she’s now my stepsister.But that doesn’t stop how I feel, how I want her. Thankfully, I’m off to college two hundred miles away, but even that doesn’t help.She’s under my skin, all around me, and all I can do is watch her morph from a sexy teenager to an irresistible woman.I can’t take it anymore, I need her.Is it possible to ever be happy without the one person you need?
