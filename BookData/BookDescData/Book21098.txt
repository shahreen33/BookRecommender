School. Tests. Scholarships. Goals. Senior class overachiever Geoff Miller thought he had it all figured out. All he needed to do was make it through the next six months, graduate, and get on with his life. College at the University of Virginia beckoned him-- and he just wanted to put the last horrible four years at Heritage High School in the "done" folder. Geoff just didn't count on one thing: Laine Phillips. For years, Geoff crushed on Laine from afar. He didn't think she even knew he was alive. In fact, the obsession seemed to him like a distraction from an unhappy life in a snobby Greater Cincinnati suburb. Until the day that all changed. And when it did, this unlikely Prince Charming got a chance to make his move. This is a Mature Young Adult Romance. Not suitable for younger readers. Contains sexual references and profane language.
