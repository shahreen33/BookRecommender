Only a handful of survivors, yet the little community of Rocheport is torn by war, repeated attempts at reconciliation are rebuffed, and lack of cooperation threatens everyone's survival as another winter approaches. There is even murder and then an old enemy returns. Through it all, Bill Arthur, former bureaucrat, one-time scholar, student of survival, and armchair libertarian philosopher, tries to hold together the tiny community which is dependent on him and of which he is the reluctant leader. And in the process, make of it the city shining brightly on a hill for all who are in darkness to see. The Shining City is a manifesto, showing how all can live together in peace and harmony if we only trust one another and live by the Golden Rule.
