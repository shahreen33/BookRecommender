Stephen Gregory uses the medieval castle and town walls of Caernarfon as the backdrop for his latest dark and disturbing novel.When David Kewish suffers an excruciating accident on his eighteenth birthday, the whole of his summer is blighted... and when a fledgling black-backed gull comes tapping at his front door in the middle of the night, and the town is besieged by flocks of gulls, it is this bird which fuels the tension of the story and increases the friction between the characters.
