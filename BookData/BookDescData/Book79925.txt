Words. Selig loves everything about them--the way they tast on his tongue (tantalizing), the sound they whisper in his ears (tintinnabulating!), and--most of all--the way they stir his heart. And he collects them voraciously, the way others collect stamps or seashells.But what to do with so many luscious words? Surrounded by doubters, Selig journeys forth and discovers that there is always someone--a poet, a baker, maybe even YOU--searching for the perfect word...a word that he can provide.
