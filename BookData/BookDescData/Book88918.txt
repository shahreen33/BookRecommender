It’s time to play dirty.  Jill Manor’s marriage is over, but the playoffs are in full swing. When she lands in bed with the enemy, she’s forced to decide between love and protecting her family. Luka Pedlanski’s an NHL enforcer for the opposing hockey team. He’s strong, rough and ignites a fire she thought had burned out after having three kids. He’s a decade younger with bulging muscles and a huge… hockey stick. Lines blur as he plays to win the Stanley Cup and her heart. She’s been burned by one hockey superstar, and she’s not sure she can handle another tour on the ice.  Each book in the Puck Battle series features a different couple and can be read as a standalone. HEA guaranteed.
