**ADULT ROMANCE**A classic fairy tale with a new twist, the Beauty and the Beast saga begins with Depravity...  Sixteen year old Benella is concerned with two things–avoiding the two village boys who torment her and scrounging for food to help feed her family. Unfortunately, the best wild fruit and vegetables are near the walls of the estate, a dark misty place inhabited by an unforgiving beast.  When her tormentors lock her behind the massive gates, Benella knows her fate is sealed. Yet, the fate isn’t one she expects. Her encounter with the beast starts a bizarre cycle of bargaining for her freedom, a freedom the beast seems determined to see her lose.  Note: Intended for mature readers due to sexual situations, violence (attempted rape), and moderate language.
