JESSE FEW PEDDLES LIES. His boss and clients order a couple. His married girlfriend gets a few. His family buys several. But he saves the top-of-the-line dishonesty to sell to himself.The forty-nine-year-old suburban rogue focuses on boozing with his golf buddies, chasing much-too younger women, and surviving the Great Recession that’s raging across the South like it’s the Big Bank’s March to the Sea. His rambling approach to life and love is challenged when his boozy mom believes she’s being stalked by her long-dead first husband and his woebegone son skirmishes with a megalomaniac preacher.A cowboy-up moment drives him to decide whether he’ll saddle up and rescue his loved ones from these imminent threats or retreat to the familiar comforts of denial, avoidance, and blowing up watermelons with black market machine guns. This is an irreverent mid-life coming-of-age story where an unwitting hero wrestles with his capacity to mature into a bona-fide adult.amazon page- https://www.amazon.com/Lying-Living-S...
