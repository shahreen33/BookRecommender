It is the end of days…Taken from her family at birth, and raised by the mystic Sisterhood, Anne understands she will fight the demons for the rest of her life. Often referred to as the Weird Sister, Anne longs for a life she knows she can never have and dreams of her five guards affections although she believes they hold her in disdain. She couldn’t be more wrong. Bryant, Mason, Garrett, Kieran and Milo see Anne for who she is and they’ve loved her every day they’ve known her, although they can never see her face. Fate has chosen them as her beloveds and when the already destroyed world falls apart, they will see they are meant to be…and that maybe all hope is not lost at all. Maybe it is just the beginning.
