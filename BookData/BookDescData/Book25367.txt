Taking an uncommon look at God's creation, this book will engage both children and adults with its combination of scientific accuracy, wide-eyed wonder, and subtle humor. Joanne De Jonge here presents a wealth of little-known facts about some fascinating creatures that we often overlook.All Nature Sings discusses the nature no one actually sings about. Although we generally don't see the slimy slug, the hairy tarantula, or the slithering snake as "nice" nature, these creatures also sing God's praises in their own way -- we simply don't know their song. But after looking through Joanne's eyes at worms, pill bugs, gerbils, yaks, and other interesting animals, readers will see anew how all of nature does indeed sing.
