In the same way that we fall into the arms of a loved one or drop our heads on the pillow before sleep, we can let go into the beauty and truth of who and what we really are. Falling Into Grace presents Adyashanti's response to anyone looking for a way out of suffering and into the freedom of spiritual awakening. With his first introductory book, he offers what he considers the fundamental teachings on "seeing life with clear eyes" to transcend the illusions that lead to unhappiness. Readers join this sought-after teacher to explore: - The concept of a separate self as the root of all suffering-and how to stop believing the thoughts that perpetuate our self-image - How to take "the backward step" into the pure potential of the present moment - Giving up the control we only think we have - The essential invitation of spirituality: wake up from the dream to embrace what is "When we realize that there is grace in every moment, our minds will open, our hearts will expand, and we'll be able to express the peace And The love that all beings aspire to," teaches Adyashanti. Here is an opportunity to welcome a revolution in the way that we perceive life through Falling into Grace.
