Mike St. George figured that working customer support during the Black Friday sale at SmokeSignals, a game distribution company, would just feature the usual sort of problem customers. He wasn't expecting an aristocratic, self-centered dragon to demand the company send someone to his house to install games in exchange for gold. And he definitely wasn't expecting that to somehow put him in charge of working with and protecting the digital side of the dragon's hoard of games.But with a possible promotion in his future, Mike's ready to take on anything. And while the blue-blooded Zali'thurg might be egotistical and prideful, Mike's wrangled worse customers on a regular basis. At least this one's cute, albeit in an 'apex predator' sort of way.
