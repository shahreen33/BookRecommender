NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND EYES is Woolrich's longest and most ambitious novel.  The noir classic follows Detective Tom Shawn on his nightly walk along the river which is interrupted when he follows a trial of money on the ground leading to a woman attempting suicide.  After saving her life, he is drawn into her story.  She tells him of a clairvoyant man that has recently predicted many strange and extreme events with stunning accuracy, and has now ensured the death of her father, with whom she is incredibly close.  The man predicts that he will die in the coming days after a deadly encounter with a lion.  These odd circumstances lead Detective Tom Shawn to believe there may be foul play involved and puts his best men on the case. What unravels is a thrilling,  “Woolrich Style” series of events that keep the reader on edge till the very end.   Cornell George Hopley-Woolrich (4 December 1903 – 25 September 1968) is one of America's best crime and noir writers, and sometimes wrote under the pseudonyms William Irish or George Hopley.
