The much-anticipated English-language debut of "one of the most original and entertaining voices of contemporary Mexican literature"(Revista Gatopardo): a collection of surreal, ironic, and madcap stories about the comedy and brutal tragedies of life in Mexico.The provocateur and cult sensation Carlos Vel치zquez has earned comparisons to Hunter S. Thompson, Charles Bukowski, and William S. Burroughs, and has been called "a grand storyteller" (Diario Jornada), "an icon" (Frente), and "one of the most original and entertaining voices of contemporary Mexican literature" (Revista Gatopardo). His English-language debut, a collection of seven surreal, unrelentingly ironic, and unsettling tales, portrays the comedy and brutal tragedies of a region that occupies a unique place in the North American imagination.Akin to M치rquez's Macondo or Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, PopSTock! is a fictional northern Mexican territory where Vel치zquez's stories take place. In addition to their common setting, central to each of these stories is the The Cowboy Bible -- a magical object that can drastically change shape. The Cowboy Bible first appears as the talisman of a Santer's a-practicing luchador, DJ, and art critic, but later morphs into an unbeatable marathon drinker, a reality television show in which contestants must burn pirated CDs at top speed, and the leather for a pair of boots so coveted that it leads a man to grant the devil a night with his wife. With these otherworldly scenarios, pop culture references, and Vel치zquez's linguistic inventiveness, The Cowboy Bible is a brazen social and political commentary on modern Mexican reality.
