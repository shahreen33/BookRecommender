The approximately 6693 km long Nile is the longest river on earth and one of the greatest wonders of nature. She has been playing a vital role in the development of the human race for 6,000 years. The water of the Nile is the source of life for an immense human population, which consists of dozens of breeds. Moreover, the Nile runs along an impressive variety of nature: from the 4,500-meter-high Moon Mountains - the Ruwenzori Mountains in Uganda, with an exotic alpine vegetation that turns into dense, tropical rainforests - to the scorching, cork-dry deserts of Sudan and Egypt. Between these two extremes lies the largest swamp in the world.Since the very beginning of human history, this great river has fascinated and challenged people. For centuries, countless expeditions have attempted to follow her endless course through Africa and to solve the oldest and most controversial mystery in geography: the secret of its origins.In 1950, John Goddard and his two companions, as the first in history, followed the river from its source in the heart of Africa to its mouth in the Mediterranean. The call of the Nile is the diary of Goddard: a travelogue in the best tradition of the great explorers of history.
