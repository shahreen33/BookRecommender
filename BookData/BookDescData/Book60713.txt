Silke left Grant under a gloomy and heavy cloud. Her best friend had become her enemy.Silke and Kai made their way home. It had been a few years and her family wasn’t aware that Kai existed. She had to right her wrongs. Kai needed to meet her relatives. But Silke wasn’t prepared in any way as to what was waiting for her. Grant doted on his daughter Claire. There were many questions that he couldn’t answer. She looked nothing like her biological mother but had the markings of the woman he had always been in love with. Once Grant realized Silke was home he had to clear the air. He had to explain what had happened. She needed to know the truth. What she thought was the truth was far from it. Emma didn’t feature in his life. She never had. He did have feelings for Emma though – pure hatred. He would get through to Silke even if he had to bide his time. Kai and Claire’s lives were entwined. Did their parents have the same?
