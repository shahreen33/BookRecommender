Things I'd love to say to Ryder Covington...I hate you more than a hole in my favorite pair of leggings. Your smirk makes me want to yell in all shouty caps.  You're really gorgeous...until you open your mouth.  Stop looking at me like that. You're not ripping my panties off.Saying those things to him would be the whipped cream on top of my rocky road ice cream, but I can't, because he's my client. And I'm up for a promotion. Oh, and the little fact that my boss told me to give Mr. Covington everything he wants. But the only thing he wants is me. And he can't have that.
