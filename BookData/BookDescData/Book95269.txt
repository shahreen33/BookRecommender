"A smuggler, a thief, a computer expert, a strong man and a convicted kiddie fiddler - what could possibly go wrong?"In January 2011, Neil Perryman convinced his wife, Sue, to watch 700 episodes of Doctor Who with him for a blog called Adventures with the Wife in Space. It was so successful, it spawned a 2014 sequel - Adventures with the Wife and Blake, in which Sue Perryman gamely watched every episode of Blake's 7, a series she'd studiously managed to avoid for 36 years.This volume collects Sue's commentary for the first 26 episodes of that ground-breaking series ('The Way Back' to 'Star One'), when idealistic terrorist Roj Blake was at the helm, Travis was on his case, and the galaxy was staffed by Space Vampires. What would Sue make of it all? Would she join Team Blake or Team Avon? Would she fall hopelessly in love with Vila? And how long would it take her to ask "Is it Servalan?"The book includes a foreword by Gareth Roberts, a new Introduction and exclusive episode annotations that you won't find on the blog.
