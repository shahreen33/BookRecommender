Everything is a joke to an easygoing shifter like Ryder Croy. At least on the outside, because inside, he’s on the hunt for a mate and is beginning to feel like he’s not meant for a bond. He’s on the tail end of a slew of bad decisions, but he’s determined to turn it around and get his life back on track. When Sexy Lexi Porter stumbles into his life, she’s nothing that he expected, and everything he didn’t know he wanted. She’s beautiful, sassy, a professional, and seven levels out of his league, but he’s going for it. Now all he has to do is convince Lexi that he’s the one who can make her happy.  Lexi Porter isn’t looking for love. She’s been burned and is building a life in the small town she grew up in. The last thing she expects is to attract the interest of a rare snowy owl shifter famous for his family ties, online presence, and wit. He attracts attention wherever he goes but he has his sights set on her and she has to admit, the attention is flattering. And when she gets a peek at the real Air Ryder, she’s stunned by what she finds. This smokin' hot shifter is not what he seems, and now he’s working his way straight into her heart. Too bad for Lexi, Air Ryder’s past has followed him to the serene mountains outside of Bryson City, and if she isn’t careful, she could find herself in deep danger and changed forever.
