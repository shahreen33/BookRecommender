This is the opposite of a self-help book. From humorist and story-teller Dylan Brody comes a masterful parody of the self-help book, promising not to help you out of your depression, but rather to sink you deeper into it. Mr. Brody promises to help you commit to your depression getting the deepest possible lows, the darkest possible blues.
