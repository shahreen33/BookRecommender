In a country where native land snails are mostly inconspicuous and secretive, the vast majority of the slugs and land snails encountered in settled areas are unwelcome aliens from Europe. These introduced species include the tomato-destroying Fieldslugs, ghostly subterranean Wormslugs, brilliantly coloured Grovesnails and garlic-scented Glasssnails. Some introductions have scarcely spread from where they were introduced, while others are now ubiquitous over large areas of Canada.Based on the field work of the late Wayne Grimm and Robert Forsyth's knowledge of the fauna, this book describes and illustrates 41 alien species now established in Canada. For each species, the distribution, habitat and often fascinating ecology is described, and the reader is introduced to the often extensive literature. To help distinguish introduced species from the diverse native fauna, 56 native genera are also described and illustrated, and keys to all genera are included.
