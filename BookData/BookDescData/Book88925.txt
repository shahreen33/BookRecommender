I thought I had everything figured out. Life was good.Then it was all turned upside down when I was pulled from Search and Rescue and forced to respond to medical calls and ride around in an ambulance for twelve hours a day with a guy who would rather read than indulge in any sort of conversation.But that’s how I met her. Katie Black. She was a nurse in the ER and she had me wrapped around her pretty finger the first second I laid eyes on her.Too bad she hates my guts. And with good reason. I’m not a quitter. I’ll do whatever it takes to get her to take a chance on me. Just a chance.Of course, I don’t know what I’m really asking of her, and when she lets down her walls to let me in everything gets blown apart. The skeletons from my past somehow manage to creep back into my life and threaten to swallow me whole. Suddenly everything is at risk: my career, my friendships, and my relationship with the girl with the red hair and green eyes.This time karma might get the better of me. I might end up back where I started.
