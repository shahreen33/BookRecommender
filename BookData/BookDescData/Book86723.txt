The God of Whispers has spread an omnipresent paranoia to every corner of the kingdom of Zhal; his spies hide in every hall spreading mistrust and fear. Adam Osidis, a dying knight from a disgraced house, must choose between joining a hopeless order of magical warriors and mercenaries in their desperate bid to free their world of the evil God, or accepting the God's promise to give Adam everything he's ever dreamed of.All men have surrendered their freedom for fear; now one last free man must choose between the fate of the world and his own heart's desire. Writer Rick Remender re-teams with collaborators Jerome Ope√±a (Uncanny X-Force, Fear Agent) and Matt Hollingsworth (Tokyo Ghost, Wyches) to take readers on a hard road through the strange and mind-bending fantasy world of Zhal.Collecting: Seven to Eternity #1-4
