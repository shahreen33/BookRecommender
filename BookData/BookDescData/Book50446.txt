Imagine a place where magnificent peaks soar more than 2.5 miles high, where alpine lakes reflect snow-capped mountains and evergreens in crystal clear water, where blooming wildflowers fill meadows with color while towering forests shade sun-dappled paths, where rushing creeks and waterfalls are as common as driveways in the suburbs. The place is real: it’s called Rocky Mountain National Park.  But with the park’s incredible size of 415 square miles and the large crowds, how can you ensure that you’ll see its main sights when vacationing or driving through? That’s what Best Sights to See at Rocky Mountain National Park answers. In this volume, we’ve listed the top 10 most popular sights and detailed the top day hiking trails to best experience them, as well give quick synopses of similar hikes in the park.  This book includes TWO BONUS SECTIONS: "Day Hiking Primer" AND "National Parks Primer."  Let's start planning your trip!
