What if a kiss could turn the tide of a war? In the war against the Forces of Darkness, the Royals are losing. With increasing omens foretelling an unthinkable future ruled by evil, Princess Ivy is determined to end this war once and for all—but her battle magic doesn’t work without a partner. Prince Zachariah’s unparalleled skill with a sword, enhanced by Ivy’s magic, should make them an unstoppable pair. But once they’re on the battlefield, Zach refuses to do the one thing Ivy knows will ensure their victory, because he believes love is the most powerful weapon they have, even in war. Now Ivy must convince Zach to listen to reason and fight with her magic, before everything they’ve been working to protect is destroyed by the darkest creature their world has ever seen.
