Beneath the quiet streets a rat cabal plots vengeance, while in the local cemetery the dead leave their graves. With the human residents unaware of the supernatural danger, it's up to a determined crew of dogs (and one cat) to keep their community safe. Lives will be lost, and bonds forged as the beasts of Burden Hill battle against an unknown evil rooted within their town.Award-winning comics creators Evan Dorkin (Milk &amp; Cheese) and Jill Thompson (Scary Godmother) come together to share the lives of some unlikely heroes."For pet lovers and enthusiasts of supernatural mysteries, the series is an absolute must. . . The surprise factor within this series is not the suspense or horror, but rather the emotional resonance that the writing and illustrations create. . . Beasts of Burden is one of the comic book highlights of 2009."--USA Today
