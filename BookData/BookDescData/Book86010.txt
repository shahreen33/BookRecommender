She takes my breath away. She’s so beautifully damaged. A mirror of my own tortured soul. I was powerless to stay away from her.

And dare I say... trust and love. We’re everything right in all our wrongs. We found redemption. We found happiness. A chance for a new beginning. but... she has no idea I’m the one who destroyed her life.** Vandal is a dark romance with light BDSM.
