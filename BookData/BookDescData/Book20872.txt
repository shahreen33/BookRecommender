So when her sorry excuse for a father suddenly dies, she wants nothing more than to leave her old life behind. But, with no money to back her, her options are very limited. Her only option is to go to the one person who should have been taking care of her all along - her mother. She's married to the president of the MC Outlaws. That's a motorcycle club. Maddie's never really been into that shit, but she doesn't have a choice. And surprisingly, she's going to come to rely on the Outlaws more than she ever expected.Cole isn't the type of guy a girl should fall for. He's rough.

She knows she should get some money under her belt and run. The past has an uncanny ability to always catch up with you. But something keeps her running to that sexy biker, Cole.But Cole has a past as well, and when both of their pasts collide, nothing short of a catastrophe ensues.
