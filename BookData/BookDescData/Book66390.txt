He doesn’t have room in his life for distractions. So when a cute, carefree blond makes a move on him, Clayton turns the guy down flat. But walking away turns out to be harder than he thinks. Clayton, driven to distraction, can’t get Pryce out of his mind. Will Clayton be able to push aside his doubts long enough to give love, and Pryce, a chance?
