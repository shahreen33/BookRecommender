Nearly two billion Christians and over 1.5 billion Muslims believe in him, yet he is perhaps the most misunderstood and misrepresented person in history.  This book explores and demystifies Jesus - his life, teachings, personality, and mission. It highlights commonalities but also examines differences between Christianity and Islam. Where and how the Qur’an challenges the traditional Church narrative authored over centuries of Christian myth and innovation, following Jesus.  In doing so, it presents the reader with a compelling and clear understanding of Jesus and his true message. The book also demonstrates why the Qur’an is the ‘missing link’, that all important ‘bridge’ connecting Judaism and Christianity, uniting all of the Abrahamic faiths.
