A delightfully bonkers graphic novel by Eisner-nominated artist Troy Little adapting Thompson's seminal book of the same name (in partnership with the Hunter S. Thompson Estate). Join Thompson's alter ego Raoul Duke on the mother of all Vegas benders, as he and his attorney Dr. Gonzo cover a motorcycle race, crash a drug-enforcement convention, and rack up obscenely large room-service bills, all while dosed to the gills on a truly spectacular assortment of mind-altering substances.
