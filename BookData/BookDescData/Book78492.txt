WARNING:There is a GRAPHIC suicide in this story and there is VIOLENCE. The heroine is going to kill things since she is a demon slayer. Bullied through high school, seventeen-year-old Justice St. Michaels is grateful for the help of her best friend Moira Oâ€™Fhey. Their only wish is to graduate high school, leave the sleepy town of Fallingbrook and all that happened behind them. The Heavens have other plans. Between growths on her back and being involved in explosive school fights, nothing seems to make sense. When an unexpected encounter with Darien Raventhorn causes worlds to collide it exposes the truth about Justice's real identity. To avenge a family death, Justice must embrace her birthright, and slay a demon before all Hell breaks loose.
