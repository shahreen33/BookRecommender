This is the report of two psychiatrists on the strange case of a patient with three distinct personalities. The Three Faces of Eve was the first popular account of a case of multiple personalities (now called Dissociative Identity Disorder). The authors had previously published a research article on their patient 'Eve' in 1954, documenting the psychiatric sessions and how they came to view it as a case of 'multiple personality'.
