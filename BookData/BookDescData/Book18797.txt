LOST CRATER IS LIKE NO OTHER PLACE ON THE PLANET...When Kate travels to Oregon for a quiet week at Aunt Melanie's cottage, her plans are dashed by the discovery of a grove of giant redwood trees in nearby Lost Crater. Caught up in the struggle to help protect the redwood forest from loggers, Kate is thrown back in time five hundred years and finds herself facing the evil creature Gashra, who is bent on destroying the very same forest. In this extraordinary quest, a girl discovers that all living things are connected in ways she never expected, and that true friendship can reach across cultures, and even across centuries."Barron fuses concerns over the natural world with fantasy lit."-The Huffington Post, "The 9 Best Trees in Literature"
