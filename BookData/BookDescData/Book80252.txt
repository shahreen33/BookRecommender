Life is beyond dangerous when you are caught up in the ongoing war between Bethany Anne's group and the Forsaken.Both Vampires and Humans have been targeted, but if there is one thing that those who work with Bethany Anne learn, it is you are NEVER FORSAKEN.Never Forsaken, The Kurtherian Gambit 05 follows the story after Bite This. If you haven't read the preceding books YOU PRETTY MUCH HAVE TO. These are a series and many of the characters have been introduced in preceding volumes.** THIS IS A 75,000 Word Novel (a little longer than previous books) - There are Author's notes and review comments at the back that are added as a part of how I write, NOT meant to surprise anyone that the story doesn't go all the way to the end. Â Please note the Table of Contents with the Look Inside for more info. ****Please note, as mentioned in another review, there is flagrantly foul language in this novel. The main character does not have a problem with cussing, just uninspired cussing.Series includes:Death Becomes Her - The Kurtherian Gambit 01Queen Bitch - The Kurtherian Gambit 02Love Lost - The Kurtherian Gambit 03Bite This - The Kurtherian Gambit 04Never Forsaken - The Kurtherian Gambit 05Under My Heel - The Kurtherian Gambit 06 (Feb 2016)Kneel or Die - The Kurtherian Gambit 07 (Feb/Mar 2016)
