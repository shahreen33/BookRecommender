One morning, six young ninjas are dropped off at Dojo Daycare. As soon as their ninja moms and ninja dads have left: KABOOM! KAPOW! The ninja boys and girls kick, push, punch, and quickly turn the place upside down in a full-blown ninja riot. Try as he might, the hapless master can’t control the children, and the disaster plays out through lunchtime and story time. No one heeds the master’s repeated mantra of honor, kindness, and respect — until one little ninja steps up and rallies his ninja pals to undo all that they have done, just in time for pickup.
