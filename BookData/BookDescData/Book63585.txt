A short story, set in the world of Laura Benedict's Bliss House novels.Nicole Martin needed a job, and she certainly wasn’t daunted by the notion of working at Bliss House, an inn that has a reputation for being haunted. (And not your average distant footsteps in the hall, and orbs in photographs haunted, either.) When the inn’s owners ask her to stay overnight while they travel to Richmond, halfway across Virginia, she jumps at the chance. She imagines an epic girl's night of drinking wine and watching movies with her best friend in the grand old house, but when a snowstorm hits, Nicole finds herself alone. Bliss House is restless, and as Nicole's darkest secrets surface, the house will use them to try to make her one more victim of its deadly games.Set in 2008, Cold Alone: A Bliss House Story, is a quick glimpse into the terrifying world introduced in Laura Benedict’s contemporary gothic suspense novel, BLISS HOUSE. The second installment of the Bliss House series of novels is CHARLOTTE’S STORY (October 2015), set in 1957, in which Charlotte Bliss can only learn the truth about the man she married, and the death of her four-year-old daughter by letting the troubled ghosts of Bliss House lead her.
