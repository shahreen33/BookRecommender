CROWN CHASER, KINGMAKER, POSER, PRETENDER, WANNABE HEIRThey had it all wrong.I never wanted to rule the world; all I wanted was her.But they couldn’t see past my bad reputation, so they forced us apart.That was ten years ago, and I’ve grown up.I’m still a rebel.I’m still reckless.But I’m also ruthless.Determined.And I have even bigger balls.So, when I find out she’s in trouble, I have to help her.It doesn’t matter that she hates me.She’ll get over it.Fighting for her is what I was born to do.I never wanted to rule until she needed me to, and this time I won’t stop until I get what I want.If they think I will…They have it all wrong.
