  The QUEEN is BACK...

  
    Her hair is white, her grin is nasty, and she's a little pissed.
  
The war is about to get a WHOLE lot bigger.
  A breakthrough with the Etheric has given Bethany Anne an edge—and an opportunity to take the fight to the Ooken. 

  What is a good Queen to do when not-so-good neighbors become royal pains in the ass? Baba Yaga comes out to play.
Family drama on Devon isn’t the only thing standing in the way of Bethany Anne’s liberation of Moen. A prodigal daughter returns to facilitate Bethany Anne’s solution to Jean’s production woes, her teenagers are being…teenagers, and there isn’t a place in the universe except for Earth she wants to call home. 
  Bethany Anne’s determination to protect her people has no limits. At least, none that she recognizes.
The Kurtherians have played a long game, and taken one too many people from Bethany Anne. Her response when she discovers the lengths the Seven have gone to? 
  
    Hold an Etheric Storm in her hands and bend it to her will. There WILL be hell to pay across the Universe.
