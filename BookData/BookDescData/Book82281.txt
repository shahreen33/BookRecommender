Karma Khullar is about to start middle school, and she is super nervous. Not just because it seems like her best friend has found a newer, blonder best friend. Or the fact that her home life is shaken up by the death of her dadima. Or even that her dad is the new stay-at-home parent, leading her mother to spend most of her time at work. But because sheâ€™s realized that she has seventeen hairs that have formed a mustache on her upper lip.With everyone around her focused on other things, Karma is left to figure out what to make of her terrifyingly hairy surprise all on her own.
