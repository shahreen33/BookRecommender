“Is it so bad to belong to us? This is what you’re in for, every day of your life. Your pleasure feeds us and we want nothing more than to give you as much of it as possible.”  Since Dakota was a little girl, she wanted to believe in magic, pretending to be a queen of witches even after most girls were starting to date. After her friend Edie falls in love with three sexy demons, the real world gets a little harder for Dakota to endure. How can Dakota get some magic in her own life?  What she didn’t mean to do? Accidentally cast a very real, very binding spell promising herself to the first demons who can get their hands on her. After a narrow escape from a shadow demon, Dakota is rescued…but also, kinda kidnapped...by three powerful demons from the Sinistral Realm who can shift into huge dragons. Loyal warrior Hiron, barbarian sorcerer Xado, and Rafe, a musician carrying an old grudge: by the laws of the Demon Symposium, they’ve been waiting for a human mate for fifty years, and they’re not about to wait a day longer for the highly pleasurable ritual that allows dragons to mate with a fragile human. If Dakota tries to escape her sexy captors, she’ll only be snatched up by the shadow demons again.  Don’t drink and spell cast, kids.  Captured by Dragons is a steamy paranormal reverse harem romance with a purely happily ever after ending. All the books in the Brides of the Sinistral Realms series have continuing characters but can also be read standalone.
