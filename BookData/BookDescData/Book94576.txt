A beautiful pilgrim finds one deadly end of the roadVivacious and outgoing, Lisa Springer is the most unlikely member of the free pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, the birthplace of Christianity in Spain. And Sister Mary Helen soon has reason to suspect the auburn-haired knockout knows the other members of the tour group—and some of their ugliest secrets—all too well. So when Lisa is discovered strangled to death in a saint’s crypt, Sister Mary faces no end of likely suspects—from Lisa’s dangerously disaffected “best friend” to the group’s charming, unreliable guide and the mild-mannered professor with a relentlessly snobbish wife. And when Sister Mary Helen becomes the target of a number of frightening “accidents,” she and Sister Eileen must race to uncover Lisa’s past and expose a clever killer hellbent on prematurely sending one sleuthing nun to her heavenly reward.
