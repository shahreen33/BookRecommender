The Shadow Over Innsmouth and The Whisperer in Darkness are counted amongst H.P. Lovecraft's most popular stories. In the first we are transported to the decrepit coastal town of Innsmouth, whose amphibian-like citizens betray a dark and sinister secret... The second takes us to Vermont, where a university professor becomes embroiled in a mind-bending, celestial mystery after strange things are seen floating in the rivers... Dark, brooding and suspenseful, this is Lovecraft at his very best.
