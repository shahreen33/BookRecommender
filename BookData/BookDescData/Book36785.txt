Hip-hop, Miami heat, and the Latin Lov-ah. The second half to this year-long journey has taken me to Magic City…Miami. I’ve been hired by the nation’s top hip-hop artist, Anton Santiago. His name is as sexy as he is, and it rolls off the tongue the same way his muscled form rolls to his music. He goes by the name Latin Lov-ah, and boy does he work that title from his rock-hard body, Latin hip-hop fusion dance moves, to the way he beds his women. He’s raw, dirty, and one hundred percent player...and I want to wrap my naked body all over him and forget about everything. Every word that comes out of his mouth is a siren’s song. Every thrust of his hips draws me closer. Every breath against my neck sends me into a tailspin of need and desire.After what happened in June, I need to rip the bandage off. Move on. Anton could be just the thing I need to get my groove back. I was hired to play the part of a seductress in Anton’s new music video, but, in the end, I’m the one being seduced. ***In the seventh book of the Calendar Girl serial, Mia is sent to Miami, Florida.
