From New York Times Bestselling Author Kristen Proby comes an all-new novel in her beloved With Me In Seattle Series, Dance With Me.   Starla. Just Starla.  She doesn’t have a last name, and she doesn’t need one. Not with that many Grammys on her mantel. Everyone knows her kick-ass, no-holds-barred style of singing, dancing, and living.  No one knows that America’s Sweetheart is still living with the wreckage of four years ago, when her world was torn apart. Losing her fiancé was devastating, but she’s channeled all of that into her music. Closing off her heart opened a hundred new doors.  Officer Levi Crawford, Seattle PD.  For almost twenty years, Levi has been consumed by the law. He eats, sleeps, and breathes work. Not just because he’s a workaholic, but because he loves it. Sure, he doesn’t have time for a woman and barely sees the rest of his family, but it’s a trade he’s always been happy to make.  Until Starla.  Two lonely hearts could learn to beat again, if they’re willing to dance together.
