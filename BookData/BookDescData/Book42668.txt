Book 2 in the GHOSTHUNTERS series of frighteningly funny paperback originals by the phenomenal Cornelia Funke! After banishing the Incredibly Revolting Ghost of book 1, Tom, former klutz, Hugo, still an Averagely Spooky Ghost (ASG to the uninitiated), and Hetty Hyssop, current world-renowned ghosthunter, have formed an agency dedicated to dealing with difficult apparitions. No case can defeat them--until they encounter a Gruesome Invincible Lightning Ghost. This smoking specter has claimed the penthouse suite of a beachfront hotel, where it passes its eternal vacation by turning guests into ghosts themselves. Could Hugo's slime douse the flaming phantom? Or are Tom and the team about to get burned?
