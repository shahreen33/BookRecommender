The bestselling memoir that inspired the Nora Ephron film starring Meryl Streep and Amy Adams, 
  Julia and Julia
 is "irresistible...Bridget Jones meets The French Chef"(
  Philadelphia 

  Inquirer
). 
  
Nearing 30 and trapped in a dead-end secretarial job, Julie Powell reclaims her life by cooking every single recipe in Julia Child's legendary Mastering the Art of French Cooking in the span of one year. It's a hysterical, inconceivable redemptive journey of life rediscovered through aspics, calves' brains and crème brûlée. "Bracingly original, Julia and Julia is clearly the work of a writer who has reclaimed her soul." --People
