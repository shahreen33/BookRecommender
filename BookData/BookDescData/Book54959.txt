Topical book exploring the meaning of poverty today; questioning whether poverty is specific only to money. The book explores poverty across contemporary society and cultures specifically looking at UK poverty (in Bath) in comparison to India. What does poverty mean today? Writer Matthew Small seeks to answer this question and witness the similarities and differences between poverty in the UK and India. Poverty stretches across all of humanity and by traveling East, Small encounters the raw faces of poverty in India’s slums; he works in a leprosy community, and joins the Sisters of Mercy on the smoggy and exhilarating streets in Calcutta. He then returns to the UK to see what the passing of three months means to those who are scarred by one of the most unglamorous of all humanities’ ills, being poor. Small engages with different community members who are living with poverty, to answer these long standing questions: What’s keeping them down? What’s pushing them out? And how can we move forward?‘Brings into sharp relief the realities of poverty…inspiring and uplifting.’ –Tracy Shildrick‘Enlightening and startling…The world needs more writers like Matthew Small.’‘A fascinating insight into what it feels like to live on the streets of the UK and India today.’ –Joanna Mack
