Luna has a knack of always ending up in over her head. From the clown school fiasco to the near torching of her sister’s restaurant, Luna’s work history has been a string of bad luck. She’s back on her feet with a new private investigator job which only requires her to look up credit reports and take the occasional photo. What could possibly go wrong?  Answer: Falling for the man you’re hired to investigate.  Maddox Castile knows he’s being stalked but after he gets a good look at the spy, he’s thrilled. He opens his curtains, takes long strolls for lunch, and makes sure that his new friend doesn’t get arrested for following him around. The real problem is that she’s not making any moves. What will it take?  Answer: Doing a little stalking of his own.  Luna may have thought she was the hunter, but in the end, she’s the one captured.
