Tor Jude and I managed to salvage something beautiful from the war torn rubble of our lives, a blissful happiness that we paid for in blood. We fought our way here, leaving pieces of ourselves along the way. I thought this was the happily ever after in our twisted fairy tale, but I was wrong. Jude I may be free by definition. That freedom came at a heavy cost and my family is about to pay the price. At any moment, this façade will come crashing down. Hard. The life I've lived—that kind of world—it stains you, and no matter how hard you try, you can never escape its wrath. Not even in death. Love. Fear. Loss. We're walking a wire and all that's beneath us is destruction.
