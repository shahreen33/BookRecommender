Seriously, is it really so bad when a love expert doesn’t believe in love? Psychology professor Bel Cutler is taking on an ambitious project about love. Personally, she’s never been lucky when it came to matters of the heart. Professionally, she’s determined to master it. Her first order of business: find a photographer to capture the different states of love. But the only one willing to work within her budget is the last man she’d ever stake her future on… let alone trust with her heart. Struggling photographer, Jimmy Callahan knows trouble when he sees it. Which is why, when he takes one look at Bel, he should run the other way. Only, she’s just the kind of laced up woman he likes to unravel. Old Jimmy would offer to teach the professor a thing or two about love, or better yet, lust. But Responsible Jimmy needs to fix his bad boy reputation…and fast. He’s in the middle of a nasty custody battle, so keeping his hands off her is imperative.
