Coming Soon!R.I.P. Part One: Rest In Peace~ Malakai ~On the outside, we look normal, like an all-American Christian family, but behind the walls of this church basement, we are far from it. My mother says it's her calling, my father says it's our blessing, and my sister says it's fun. I say we're fucked. I dont know if what we're doing is really what God wants us to do, I just know that the more we do it, the more natural it feels. Natural.What we're doing and the reason behind it is far from natural. In my family, love blends with hate, duty with torment, and blood with water.We are the Courtenay family and this is the story about how it all went wrong. R.I.P. Part Two: Rot In Pieces~ Adriel ~Her actions shattered my family, leaving it half alive.And I hate her for it.My brother is broken. His torment suffocates him as he claws his way through the aftermath of her decisions. Despite it all, he remains by my side. The life we knew has been gutted, rotting into a million pieces. We have no home, nowhere to go, but I don’t care because we still have each other. He’s the only one that can see beneath my flesh to touch me in my darkest places. Our choices have taken us on a new path. A shimmering sea of blood trails behind us on our search for purpose and reason. No matter what happens, I refuse to let anything or anyone keep us apart. I’ll burn the world to ash before I’ll let him go.*Trigger Warning: This is a dark story with taboo subject matter, disturbing content, graphic situations and many triggers.
