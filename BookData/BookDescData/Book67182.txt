Love.Everyone has their take on the most wonderful yet mystifying feeling and emotion around. When the author is able to have a conversation with his hard to find family member, the conversation is an engaging, insightful, humorous, sincere, painful, yet hopeful look at love. The author's retelling of his relative's take on love through the lenses of relationships with family members, friends, loved ones, and community is an intriguing yet easy to follow poetic journey; the journey changes when the relative interviews the author and challenges him to look at love through similar and divergent lenses, providing a whirlwind tour in capturing the wide range of experiences of loves past, present, and future, as opening up regarding matters of the heart can be one of the more vulnerable yet strongest conversations one can ever have.
