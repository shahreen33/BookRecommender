Boston's Little House Girl Meet Charlotte Tucker, the little girl who would grow up to be Laura Ingalls Wilder's grandmother. Winter is coming, and Charlotte's days are filled with cornhusking and candle dipping and helping Mama mind baby Mary. But the war is still going on, and Charlotte worries about Will, Papa's striker, who is marching north with the militia. Then one day Charlotte hears bells ringing from Boston, and that night every building in the town common is lit up with candles. Could it be that peace has finally come? On Tide Mill Lane is the second book in The Charlotte Years, an ongoing series about another spirited girl from America's most beloved pioneer family.
