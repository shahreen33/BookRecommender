LIGHTSPEED is an online science fiction and fantasy magazine. In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF--and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales.  This month, we have original science fiction by Rachael K. Jones ("The Greatest One-Star Restaurant in the Whole Quadrant," with a cover illustration by Lovely Creatures Studios) and Cadwell Turnbull ("A Third of the Stars of Heaven"), along with SF reprints by Charlie Jane Anders ("Because Change Was the Ocean and We Lived By Her Mercy") and Robert Reed ("Blood Wedding"). Plus, we have original fantasy by A. Merc Rustad ("The House At the End of the Lane Is Dreaming") and Mari Ness ("You Will Never Know What Opens"), and fantasy reprints by Tim Pratt ("A Wedding Night's Dream") and Sonya Taaffe ("The Boatman's Cure"). All that, and of course we also have our usual assortment of author spotlights, along with our book and media review columns. For our ebook readers, we also have an ebook-exclusive reprint of the novella "The Fullness of Time" (John Brunner) and an excerpt from the novel THE TIGER'S DAUGHTERS, by K. Arsenault Rivera.
