In this remarkable collection, Bowie reveals the fierce intellectualism, artistry, and humor behind it all. From his very first interview—as a teenager on the BBC, before he was even a musician—to his last, Bowie takes on the most probing questions, candidly discussing his sexuality, his drug usage, his sense of fashion, how he composed, and more.  For fans still mourning his passing, as well as for those who know little about him, it's a revealing, interesting, and inspiring look at one of the most influential artists of the last fifty years.The first interview : BBC tonight, November 1964 / interview by Cliff Michelmore --David Bowie tells all and more : Interview, March 1973 / interview by Patrick Salvo --Beat godfather meets glitter mainman : William Burroughs, say hello to David Bowie : Rolling stone, February, 28, 1974 / interview by Craig Copetas --The raw and uncut interview : Vox pop, March 18, 1987 --David Bowie : stardust memories : reflections on a life of wit and style : Rolling stone, April 23, 1987 / interview by Keith Loder --Bowie at the bijou : Movieline, April 1, 1992 / interview with Virginia Campbell --Fashion : turn to the left : fashion : turn to the right : Dazed and confused, November 1996 / conversation with Alexander McQueen --Bust's interview with David Bowie : Bust magazine, Fall 2000 / interview by Iman --As the artist said to the rock star ... : The guardian, July 18, 2001 / conversation with Tracey Emin --The last interview : BBC Extras, September 2006.
