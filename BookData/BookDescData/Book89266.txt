It takes a special kind of man to survive in a world torn apart by vampires, zombies, sidhe, and gods.  A man like Mr. Poe.  Brilliant. Handsome. Fluffy. A psychic cat who can shapeshift into a human.  A vampire's shriveled husk is found long-dead in a wine cellar underneath Haven, a retirement resort where immortals pass infinite time. The only rule in Haven is zero violence, and there's zero tolerance.  Mr. Poe must team up with the local sheriff, Gwyneth Gresham, in order to solve the murder, bring justice to the deader-than-usual victim, and survive Miss Draconia's Knitting Circle. For a budding detective like Mr. Poe, one little murder mystery won't even give him paws.
