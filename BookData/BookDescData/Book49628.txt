Screamer flicks can be fun, but someone in California is taking the latest slasher hit just a bit too seriously. Someone is taking people out just like in the movie, and from the way it appears the killer has an agenda that no one understands. The killer starts offing victims by emulating the murders, authorities initially think the culprit is just some kid who loves horror. But they soon discover they are looking in the wrong direction. Not only are the murders eerily similar to those which took place in the film, they are nearly identical. This is a very slippery madman indeed. The murders begin occurring at random, unpredictable places, throwing police for a loop and making them run to stop things. Because of the copycat murderer this movie is fast becoming one of the biggest horror films of all time, and itâ€™s all because of the killer.
