I'm a wolf in wolf’s clothing, and I’ll consume her if she lets me.  Ambition. Passion. Betrayal.  Rita Award-winning author Kennedy Ryan delivers the epic first installment of the All the King's Men Duet.  Raised to rule, bred to lead and weaned on a diet of ruthless ambition.  In a world of haves and have nots, my family has it all, and I want nothing to do with it.  My path takes me far from home and paints me as the black sheep. At odds with my father, I'm determined to build my own empire. I have rules, but Lennix Hunter is the exception to every one of them. From the moment we meet, something sparks between us. But my family stole from hers and my father is the man she hates most. I lied to have her, and will do anything to keep her. Though she tries to hate me, too, the inexorable pull between us will not be denied.  And neither will I.
