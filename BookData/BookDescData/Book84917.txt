This interactive book may seem to be on your side, reluctant sleeper -- but it's truly a bedtime book in disguise!Here's how it works: if you can avoid getting to the end of this book, you can avoid bedtime, simple as that. (It's a pretty sweet deal, actually.) But each time you blink, you have to turn a page. Those are just the rules. So whatever you do, DON'T BLINK!
