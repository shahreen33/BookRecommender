This basement was as familiar to her as the insides of her mind. She reached out, aware of everything in its place, and pulled on the edge of one ghostly sheet. The sheet slid off, sending clouds of dust into the already dusty air. "Welcome to the Land of the Dead," she announced. Dead, dead, dead . . . answered the echo.
