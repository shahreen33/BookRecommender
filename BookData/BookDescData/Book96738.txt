Seduction in the sands… Cabaret dancer Sylvie Devereux and Sheikh Arkim Al-Sahid have never seen eye to eye—not from their first antagonistic meeting to their last intoxicating kiss. And certainly not when she publicly stops his convenient society wedding to her beloved sister! Now Arkim wants revenge on the sinful seductress who cost him the respectable reputation he needs. Luring Sylvie to his luxurious palace in the desert, he'll get her out of his system once and for all. But with her sass and sequins stripped away, Sylvie is surprisingly vulnerable—and there's one last secret Arkim's not prepared for…her innocence!
