"Celebrity sTalker details comedian Suzy Soro's obsessive need to talk to celebrities, especially the ones who don't want to be bothered. It takes you inside ladies' rooms, restaurants, and even their homes. Why did Angelina Jolie offer to help her? Which sitcom star nearly trampled her at the movies? How many celebrities do you have to know to get on The Tonight Show? In this offbeat memoir of her run-ins with famous people, Suzy answers these, and other, ridiculous questions. This is not simply a dishy memoir about stars. Soro knows how to deliver pathos with deadpan, self-deprecating humor. Basically, sheâ€™s really funny, and you will relate to every self-conscious, star-struck, or hilarious moment."~ Jess Riley, author of Driving Sideways, All the Lonely People and Closer Than They Appear***********************"Darkly funny, unabashedly honest, and voyeuristic with every word, Celebrity sTalker will be relished by anyone on the other side of the red carpet."~Adam Heath Avitable, comedian and author of Interviews with Dead Celebrities***********************"See how Suzy Soro parlayed her chance meeting with one of America's biggest celebrities into a hilarious and embarrassing anecdote that she clearly has not gotten over yet." ~Caissie St. Onge, former assistant to David Letterman, former writer for Rosie O'Donnell and producer of Bravo's Watch What Happens Live!
