From an early age children are protective of their environment. This book celebrates the individuality of a cast of characters â€“ from the boy who seeks sanctuary in his treehouse to the children busily inventing in their shed to the child who plays games of knights and dragons. Their hopes and dreams are allowed to take flight. But in other parts of the world, ravaged by war, children can only dream of peace and freedom.
