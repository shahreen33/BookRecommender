San Francisco Bay Coven has been torn apart and no one feels this more than Mika Marshall. Kenzie Kavanagh exposed her father and brother's betrayal.  So Mika is starting at the University of Morgana a semester late and praying to the Fates that she'll be able to catch up and graduate with her class. But as a witch with an undeclared specialty she's trying not to bring too much attention to herself.  Because Mika has a secret and if she doesn't learn to control her powers, people will die.
