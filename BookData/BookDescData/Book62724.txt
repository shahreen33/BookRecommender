What’s meant to be will always find a way.  Perfection isn’t an illusion. I met it, held it in my hands. But then it slipped right through.  Perfection isn’t an illusion. It’s elusive, cleverly evasive, and, in many ways, a horrible tease.  I’m not a man to be toyed with. Quiet, thoughtful, and even sometimes careful, but never someone to taunt. Even the most controlled men have a breaking point. I just met mine.  Why mess with perfection? You don’t. Unless perfection messes with you.  This is book 6 in the GearShark series and is NOT a standalone.
