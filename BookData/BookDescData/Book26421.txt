ClaraOne phone call was all it took. A voice on the answering machine, a man oblivious to what calling me would do, uprooted my entire existence. He revived old hurts, dug up past nightmares. He destroyed everything I’d built for myself.But I found bliss through Grey, in Grey.GreyI had no idea that making a simple phone call, one that devastated me because of the reasons behind it, would make me question my truths, my friendships, everything I held dear in my little town. Calling her was the best and worst decision I’d ever made, but it brought her to me, to Bliss.And I could never take that back.Finding Bliss is a story about redemption, love, and finding true, irrevocable bliss. It’s about new beginnings and the heights attainable.Not intended for readers under the age of eighteen due to language and sexual situation.
