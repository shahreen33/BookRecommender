As the bad boy drummer for the multi-platinum band Vail, Ethan Fuller thinks he’s invincible. He acts on impulse and has committed to the stereotypes of the rock star life with no regard for consequences. The one girl who had the power to tame him is just a distant memory.  Now that she has landed the opening gig on Vail’s next tour, Maci Dane is on the path to everything she always wanted. Fame, success, and money are trivial compared to her real objective: to break the heart of the one who broke hers.  When they meet face to face for the first time in nearly two decades, Ethan is reminded of the one who got away while Maci works tirelessly to hide her past. As she attempts to even the score, feelings from the past are rekindled. Will she give into love or use her power to break him?
