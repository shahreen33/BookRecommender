People think that just because they know my name, my reputation, and my family that they know me. They don't.They say I’m a manwhore, but who wouldn’t be with my face and body? They say I’m a partier, and that's not going to change. They say I'm a fighter, and hell yes I am. F*ck with mine, and I’ll f*ck you back ten times worse.So, yes. Maybe what they say is true, but that’s not all of me.I'm loyal to a damned fault. If you earn it, I'll never leave your side. And when I love, I love hard, but there's another side to me where it's dark and painful. That side's been kept hidden, until her. Taylor saw inside of me, and the second she was there, she owned me.People think they know me……but only she can see me.
