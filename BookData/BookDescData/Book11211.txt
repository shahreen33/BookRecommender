One ordinary day, in one ordinary summer, Matt disfigured a childhood playmate with a cinder block. Five years later, he is released from a psychiatric facility and his circle of friends overlap with those of Hannah, the girl he maimed. He finds himself drawn to her, sadistically at first, but after Jared, an acquaintance from the hospital, covets her for his own disturbing uses, Matt struggles to protect her. Hannah's an outcast, not only because of the scars Matt gave her, but because of the ones she's given herself, too. Matt's heroin addiction and the way he exploits her body harm her in places sharp objects can't touch. Fearful that a dark secret will be disclosed, and with his addiction to heroin worsening, Matt chooses to abandon Hannah, allowing her to fall prey to Jared. Jared is a sociopath obsessed with a fantasy that Hannah can fly...a theory he plans on forcing her to test, even if the cost is her life. Vein Fire gives a startling portrait of Hannah, a young woman with Borderline Personality Disorder. This dark, voyeuristic story exposes the dysfunction she surrounds herself with as a method of self-harm. Its beautifully written passages will haunt the reader, compelling them to learn the fate of the girl who couldn't say no. Vein Fire is a stunning debut novel by Lucia Adams which editors have proclaimed, 'redefine the transgressive fiction genre'. "One of the great things about ‘Vein Fire’ is its bravery and directness. It’s a dramatic and enlightening story of drugs, abuse, and the grey-areas of society; it shines a brave light on facets of humanity that the media tends to either glamorise, satirise or completely ignore. It is also a compulsive and pacey read. Ultimately, this is a manuscript that demonstrates a significant level of craft and originality." -- Harper Collins UK
