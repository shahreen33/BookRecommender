The Vampire Uprising saved the world but ravaged humanity. Families were separated, covens created, and the back-world forgotten forever. Except by women like me.  Born with a dhampir mutation, I’m neither human nor vampire. I’m the ultimate predator. If only I didn’t need a coven to survive.  After entering the Blood Life Territory in search of my next blood source, I now find myself enrolled in the Academy of Vampire Heirs, a training program for region leaders. That’s right. I’ve been forced into a place where vampires consider me just a donor...until my nature shows what I truly am when I kill one of the school’s most elite.  His four, wicked hot brothers want restitution for killing their leader and jeopardizing their status. They want to claim me as their coven’s personal blood source. But no one can claim me. What they don’t know is I’m about to claim them.  This is a new adult reverse harem academy book for 17+ due to mature language and steam over the series. Don’t miss this sizzling, fun series with smexy vampires, classes on how to be a good little blood donor, and a feisty twenty-year-old woman who likes to break all the rules.
