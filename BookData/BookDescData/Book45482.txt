I am not who I thought I was. I am not a regular sixteen-year-old girl. I am a witch. A real, ancestral witch. My parents are not my biological parents. My sister and I share no blood.Even in the coven, I am too powerful now, too different to belong.I am alone except for Cal. Cal tells me he loves me, and I need to believe him.
