"Visceral and raw in a style similar to Chuck Wendig's. There's action aplenty here, furious gunplay, and characters knee-deep in the blood and guts of their eviscerated friends. This is a high octane story, but what makes it stand out among the rest is the drama between the human characters..."â€”Ryan Lawler, FantasyBookReview.comCollecting Those Poor, Poor Bastards and The Ten Thousand Things in a spectacular 420+ page omnibus edition of Weird Western supernatural horror with a "strong" female lead in the bleak 1860's American frontier.  The DEAD WEST OMNIBUS (vol. 1) takes Nina Weaver, her father Lincoln, and a motley crew of survivors through a gauntlet of magically-animated undead and demonic forces from 'deaduns' to giant, flying creatures, to hellish steam engines, to actual murders of crows. Guns, explosives, bloodletting, expletives, faith-based magic, gore, more expletives, and high emotion! DEAD WEST takes elements of HBO's Deadwood and AMC's The Walking Dead and Hell on Wheels, puts it all in a big cask-full of monsters and TNT, then watches it go BOOM!
