18+ Adult Content, Crime Noir, New AdultRunaway teenager Lilly Lessard has some secrets. For a start, that’s not her real name and she wants to keep her real age on the down-low too. Bumping into ex-hitman Bobby at a small town film festival is no coincidence either. She’s tracked him here. He owes her money and she’s desperate enough to come looking for it. And she’s not the only one who’s followed him here. Detective Davis is after him too. She’s been after him in Miami for years, but never quite managed to get him. Maybe this weekend she’ll get lucky. But the closer Lilly gets to Bobby and his money, the closer Davis gets to them both. One by one, their secrets are coming out. And Lilly’s about to find out, the worst secrets are the ones you keep from yourself.
