15 Views Vol. II: Corridor further explores the literary side of Orlando with 15 linked stories, told by 15 authors, and set in 15 distinct locales. This volume also includes 15 more authors, writing linked stories set in the Tampa Bay area. The result is a literary portrait of both cities. The Orlando thread delves into an Orlando plagued with violence and the large cast of characters who feel its effects, with stories weaving their way from the outskirts of Oviedo, down the Greenway Trail and into downtown’s Orange Avenue as the bars let out. The Tampa thread sprawls across the entire bay area to form a quirky tale involving Albanian myths, local history, an assassin, corgis, and a mysterious black plane.The subtitle of this volume, “Corridor,” comes from the name given to the stretch of interstate connecting the two cities––the I-4 Corridor––which is often highlighted in the national media as a political battleground, but is better known to the authors in this collection as a commuter’s nightmare. The book also contains 30 black-and-white illustrations (originally paper cuts) by Orlando artist Lesley Silvia. Silvia also designed the book cover to be double-sided, so that when readers finish with one city, they can flip the book over to begin the next.
