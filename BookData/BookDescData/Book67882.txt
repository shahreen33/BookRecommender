But, the past refuses to stay buried, wrongs start feeling right, and lines begin to blur. Sometimes, the heart wants what the heart wants, and nothing will stand in its way. Consequences be damned. Rules be damned. Sometimes, secrets are sinfully delicious.  **This book contains content of a taboo nature**
