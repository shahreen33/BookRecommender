This isn't your typical love story.  Lauren doesn’t know why she is such a bitch, but she is. She believes in being who you are and fuck those who don’t like it. Her ex is pissed, and she soon realises the hard way that she never should have betrayed him. Yet, pretty-boy Andrew isn’t as innocent as she thought. In fact, it turns out he’s connected to one of the biggest gangs in America. Lauren is beaten and abused in every way possible. Her human rights are stripped, and she is treated like an animal. Blindfolded and gagged, Lauren has no idea what is going to become of her, or if she will ever get out of the mess she has found herself in. Karma has finally caught up with Lauren Ashford, but is this the end, or can someone out there help her? Are there men strong enough, or even brave enough, to face up to her captors? When the Philadelphia Kings of Rebellion charter come crashing into her kidnappers’ motorcycle club's cabin, they find a beautiful girl chained up to a wall and made to live like a dog on the hard floor. From here, Lauren is given the greatest gift. To go home. Once back in the UK, Lauren is under the protection of the UK Kings of Rebellion MC and is shocked to find that even though they are dangerous, they treat her so much better. Here she meets Grim, the oldest son of the president. He’s covered in tattoos, drives a bike, likes to dress in leather and loves to protect her. Is this the man that Lauren needs? Or do her old habits of being a “do now, think later” kind of bitch, come back to bite her in the ass? One thing is for certain, Demon, the president of the motorcycle club who took her, wants her back...  ***WARNING. THIS BOOK HAS SOME STRONG SCENES THAT SOME MAY FIND OFFENSIVE.
