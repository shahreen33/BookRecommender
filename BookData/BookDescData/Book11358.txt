As old feelings resurface, and new attractions are explored, a storm of sexual sparks is unleashed that leads them into forbidden areas. Always the good girl, Kassidy blossoms under the attentions of two loving men, but neither she nor Chris are expecting the ménage to take a quarter turn toward Dag…and his feelings for Chris.

Might destroy everything.Product Warnings: This book contains a couple already in love, a couple falling in love and a couple in love who didn’t know it; also multiple scorching sex scenes including girl with boy, girl with two boys, boy with boy and two boys with girl...whew!
