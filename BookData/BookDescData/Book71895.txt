The Book of Genesis (transliterated from Greek γένεσις, meaning "origin") is the first book of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament. This is a sweeping and poetic look at the beginning of man's relationship with God. Tradition credits Moses as the author of Genesis, as well as Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and most of Deuteronomy. Estimates for the initial date of publication have varied wildly from 1500BC to 500BC.
