Heart-stopping and darkly comic stories from a writer of “brilliant authenticity” (New York Times Book Review).Akhil Sharma’s masterful stories focus on Indian protagonists at home and abroad and plunge the reader into the unpredictable workings of the human heart. A young woman in an arranged marriage awakens one day surprised to find herself in love with her husband. A retired divorcé tries to become the perfect partner by reading women’s magazines. A man’s long-standing contempt for his cousin suddenly shifts inward when he witnesses his cousin caring for a sick woman. The protagonists in A Life of Adventure and Delight deceive themselves and engage in odd behaviors as they navigate how to be good, how to make meaningful relationships, and the strengths and pitfalls of self-interest. Elegantly written and emotionally immediate, the stories provide an intimate and profound assessment of human relationships between mothers and sons, sons and lovers, and husband and wives.
