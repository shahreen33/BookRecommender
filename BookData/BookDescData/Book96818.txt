IN THIS LIFE by Cora Brent KATHLEENLoner. Volatile. Wickedly hot and unforgiving. Probably not the kind of man anyone should trust with an infant.Definitely not the kind of man any woman should trust with her heart.When Nash Ryan returned to town for the sake of his baby brother I thought I already understood who he was. I also thought I was done giving my heart away until he proved otherwise. But we don’t stand a chance. Everything is ready to unravel.And the secrets I’ve kept will be our undoing.NASH This isn’t the first time I’ve known tragedy.Maybe that’s why I’ve chosen to remain alone.But my life of solitude ends now because a terrible twist of fate has made me the guardian of my four-month-old brother.Suddenly I’ve got a kid to raise and a family business to save and there’s no time for anything else.That’s why Kathleen Doyle and I made this arrangement.Once a skinny nerd girl who used to follow me around everywhere, she’s now a single mom with flaming hair, a killer body and too many responsibilities.We told each other it was just sex.We told each other there were no strings attached, no expectations.We lied.And the consequences will cost us.But I’m not surrendering this new family without a battle.Because in this life we might only get one chance to have it all.
