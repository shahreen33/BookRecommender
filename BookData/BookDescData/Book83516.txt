The Saga Begins. An earthquake opened a crack in the earth, in the middle of the jungles of Peru, exposing a building inside the earth. Dr. Henry Jedidiah, who is a world-renowned archaeologist, and well trusted throughout the world, is asked to take his team into Peru. They discover ancient scrolls and tablets, which propel the Jedidiah family onto a path towards an artifact, which had been taken from someone, thousands of years ago, to protect the world. Throwing all caution to the wind, they ignore all the warnings written within the scrolls and tablets. Believing the warnings are nothing but superstitions, the Jedidiah family are compelled to find this artifact. Upon finding the artifact, one man is propelled to great power over the earth, while all life on earth, plant, animal, and mankind is being destroyed. The Jedidiah family must race against time, searching the scrolls and tablets to find the answer, to find the one who can save this world, before it's too late. What they find is not what is expected. With nothing left, the Jedidiah family must trust 'The Staff and The Sword.'
