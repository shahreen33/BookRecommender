It’s time I stop letting fear control me.For over a decade, I dedicated my life to raising our children and being the perfect housewife. But it wasn’t enough. My husband, the man who claimed to love me and promised me forever, needed more. He needed others. Instead of leaving, I turned a blind eye. I smiled. I remained faithful. I stayed for my children, and for the promise I made—for better or worse.But there comes a time when something happens, when bruises are discovered, and you realize staying is more dangerous than leaving. That’s when nothing—not the fear of the unknown or being nothing without him—can hold you back. That’s when you fight. You say . . . enough is enough. Because no one has more strength, more devotion, and more courage than a mother defending her young.A mother who is more than enough....If you love a strong heroine, a protective hero, and a sweet and sexy with all the goodness romance, then More Than Enough is for you.
