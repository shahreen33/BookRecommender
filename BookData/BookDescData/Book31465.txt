‘Twas the night before Christmas and all of your favorite characters from the Cold Case Psychic series are showing you how they’re getting ready for a visit from the big man himself.  Ronan is testing out new family traditions. Let’s just say he’s “Nailed it!” Meanwhile, the Craig brothers are trying to put their broods down for a “long winter’s nap” with varying degrees of sugar-fueled success. Bertha and Erin are stopping by for visits, as Tobin and Niall are partying like it’s 1968. Jude’s saying a little prayer, and Jace and Fitz are the ones getting down for a change. Kaye’s back in town and making so much fruitcake, Salem might just be overrun with it. Greeley drops food off at a local homeless shelter, while Hunter feeds the entire ER staff at the hospital. Tennyson and Ronan are back for a discussion about what next Christmas will be like with their bundle of joy. Last, but not least, is a special guest you won’t see coming and you won’t want to miss.  Join in the fun as The Witch City becomes Christmas Towne. All of these tales are guaranteed to make you feel merry and bright. Dreaming of a white Christmas is optional.
