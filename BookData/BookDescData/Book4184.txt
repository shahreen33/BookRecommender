From the moment she laid eyes upon him, Marley knew in her heart that James was not just another client, and the difference wasn't even the large sum of money he offered in return for a single night of submission. No, what set him apart was the fact that when she called James "daddy," it was her own heart which beat faster and her own body which ached with need. After that night, Marley does her best to put all thought of him behind her, using the huge payday he provided to get on her feet again and start over... until James knocks on her door and walks right back into her life. He makes her a simple offer: if she will live with him and submit to him whenever he wishes, he will provide for her every desire. Even before she accepts his offer, Marley knows that what she truly wants is not money or clothing or even a fancy new car. What she longs for is a daddy who will give his little girl what she really needs... a daddy who will spank her bare bottom when she is naughty, tie her up and take her any way he pleases, and then cuddle her until she falls asleep in his arms. Can she dare to hope that James will be that daddy? Publisher's Note: Daddy Morebucks is an erotic novel that includes spankings, graphic sexual scenes, elements of age play and BDSM, and more.
