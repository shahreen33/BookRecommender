  Warwickshire, England, 1938
   While Hitler and Chamberlain are preparing to sign the Munich agreement, the murderer of a Jewish shopkeeper is being hanged in Birmingham.  After witnessing the execution, Inspector James Given, who brought the killer to justice, is surprised to find he has been taken off the investigation to pursue something completely different.  Grovestock House, owned by the wealthy Barleigh family has witnessed a triple death.  With the terrible events neatly written off as a murder and a double suicide, Given is supposed to tidy up a few loose ends with the help of local constable, John Sawyer.  But Given is sure there is more to the case than meets the eye.  What dark secrets were the Barleigh family hiding? Could there be another killer involved?  And how will Given react when he is forced to confront the ghosts of his past…?  A SHADOWED LIVERY is an intriguing historical mystery – a traditional British investigation set in England immediately before the Second World War.  ‘This complex mystery centred on identity, deceit, and past crimes, is genuinely thought-provoking and an excellent read. I look forward to a return for the troubled, but engaging Given – this time as his own man’ - 
   Crime Review
  ‘the plot is tightly woven, and it plays out well. This is as decent a pastiche of a Golden Age mystery as you are likely to read’ -
