I’ve got a secret.  Savannah, Georgia is full of debutantes and greed. The Heirs own this town. They own me, too.  I don’t know what I did to ruin what we had. But their kindness turned cruel almost a year ago. I was prepared to leave it all behind and start over at a new school. But Rogue Kelly, the king of the Heirs, ruined that.  He doesn’t want me anymore but doesn’t want anyone else to have me either. I know too much to be set free, but not enough to stay.  The Heirs aren’t through with me yet. And I crave their cruelty too much to give up now.
