Enjoy this fast-paced love story by bestselling author Jennifer Youngblood.  A love he couldn't forget. A chance to make things right. In the game of life only three rules apply: play hard, love more, and never give up!  When single mom Silver Coulter gets a chance to plan the bachelor auction event of the season, she has no idea it’ll bring her face-to-face with the very man she’s spent years trying to forget—Ace Sanchez, superstar running back for the Texas Titans, whose devastating good looks and quick-silver personality make him one of the most eligible bachelors in Texas.  Long-held attractions sizzle to the surface as Ace tries to get back into Silver’s life. But Silver has a sordid past that includes a nasty ex-husband and ruthless ex-mother-in-law who’ll stop at nothing to keep Silver in her clutches.  Torn between her need to protect her young daughter and her desire to be with Ace, Silver must decide if she’s willing to give up on her dreams or lay it all on the line for love.
