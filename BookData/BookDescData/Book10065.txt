This is a novelette length work (a prequel to book 2 in the Dangerously Dimpled series, Plus None) is no longer available for purchase. Limping her way through a high society birthday bash, Charlie would like nothing more than to trade in her high heels for a pair of old cowboy boots. But when she finds herself tail over tits in the hydrangea, and Alex Ramirez appears to lend a helping hand, four-inch stilettos seem like the least of her worries. What's a country girl to do when her knight in shining armor turns out to be a rich boy with a mysterious agenda, and a pair of panty-dropping dimples? Two star-crossed lovers, one night, and a really naughty leather belt. Maybe Charlie should get out of Harlow County more oftenâ€¦
