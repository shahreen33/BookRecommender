I Will Always Love You is comforting, thought provoking and deeply moving.It has a very interesting story itself! The words found their way into Melissa’s journal very unexpectedly one morning in Thailand, January 2017, after a series of monsoon rains. They were thought provoking and powerful in a very kind and comforting manner. Although the words alone spoke volumes, Melissa knew that there was an opportunity to add illustrations so that people of all ages could benefit. She felt that the message was one that would appeal to adults and children alike, however she felt that the addition of characters, colours and imagery would help inspire the imaginations of the readers.The words truly are “For everyone big or small, for the child who lives within us all.”Whether reading the story to one’s self or reading aloud to another, the comforting thoughts and possibilities begin to play around in the imagination. The “What it?” and “Why not?” ideas begin to take hold and a sense of peacefulness can often replace other less comforting emotions.As you read through the story, notice how the children’s hearts change colours and how their faces and skin colour are neutral. Observe how the journey starts at home in the dawn and ends at home in the evening. The idea of travelling ‘home’ can be a comfort to many. There are other subtle hints of images and messages throughout the pages that will evoke different reactions from each unique reader. Notice if one page resonates more with you than another. There is something unique in the story for every reader.
