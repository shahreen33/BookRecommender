Darkness is the only thing I see. Ever since the day my life changed. The day that everything and everyone I held close to me ceased to exist. The day I lost it all and the demons of my past consumed my every waking moment. I tried to keep others at arm's length. Tried not to let my darkness taint them. Ruin them. Harm them. And whether I want to admit it or not, as much as I wish I could keep them locked out, they refuse to leave. Refuse to let me suffer alone. If I hadn't been so focused on keeping those demons from flying free, I wouldn't have missed how one perfect angel was able to sneak her way under my skin-refusing to let go. Making me want things I don't deserve. She consumes me. Her beauty knows no end. The love she promises tempts me every time she's near. But that pure heart that makes her MY Emmy is the one thing I'm convinced I'll destroy if I ever let her close. I'm a broken man. A broken man with too much darkness in his soul to ever let her light shine upon me. But even that doesn't stop me from craving her with every single breath in my body. **This is the final book in the Corps Security series. This book is not suitable for younger readers.
