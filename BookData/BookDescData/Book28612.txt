Representing Truman Capote's finest work, the delightful pieces in this collection span thirty years, travel the globe, and profile an extraordinary range of people. Through Truman Capote's eyes and artistry we visit such places as Hatti, Tangier, Hollywood, Paris, Manhattan, Italy and Brooklyn, we encounter such figures as Isak Dinesen, Mae West, Louis Armstrong, Colette, Humphrey Bogart, Ezra Pound, Marilyn Monroe, and Marlon Brando, and we observe the evolution of Capote from a young man in the golden glow of early success to a renowned author viewing his life, work, world and the creation of his last incomplete novel -- Answered Prayers. Reprinted in its entirety is The Muses Are Heard, Capote's fascinating, excruciatingly funny account of the "Porgy and Bess" touring company's visit to the Soviet Union.Every page is stamped with the unique sensibility and inimitable style of Truman Capote and provides vivid evidence of why Norman Mailer has termed him "the most perfect writer of a generation."
