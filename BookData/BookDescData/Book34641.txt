Pizza, Pancakes, French Toast, Lasagna, Ice Cream, Brownies—you thought they were off-limits forever but now they’re back on the menu!   The Dairy-Free &amp; Gluten-Free Kitchen offers more than 150 flavor-packed recipes created especially for those who must avoid dairy and gluten in their diets—proving that you no longer have to abandon the foods you love, even when you do have to give up the dairy and gluten that doesn’t love you. Denise Jardine’s The Dairy-Free &amp; Gluten-Free Kitchen addresses these issues and many more, demystifying the confusing and often conflicting data about what defines healthful eating. Along with a deliciously varied selection of dishes, Denise shares her “master” recipes, including her all-purpose Gluten-Free Flour Mix, Dairy Milk Alternative, Fiber-Rich Sandwich Bread, Creamy Macadamia Pine Nut Cheese, and Soy Velvet Whipped Cream—key staples that make Classic French Toast, Mushroom Kale Lasagna, Rustic Heirloom Pesto Pizza, and Pumpkin Cheesecake possible.   In addition to being entirely dairy- and gluten-free, each recipe has been calibrated to reduce or eliminate the need for refined oil and sweeteners. And for those who must avoid eggs, nuts, and soy products, recipes that are free of these components are clearly labeled. So whether you’ve been diagnosed with a particular food intolerance or sensitivity, or you’re just trying to consume a less refined, more healthful diet, The Dairy-Free &amp; Gluten-Free Kitchen has something for just about everyone!
