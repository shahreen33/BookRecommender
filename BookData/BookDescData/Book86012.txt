They steal our breath.They steal our sanity.And we let them.Over and over and over again.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *They say you never forget your first time. Mine was with a homeless musician who effed my brains out under a bridge. He was my first love. And fourteen years later, I still can’t get him out of my head. He broke all my rules.He also broke my heart.I watched him climb to stardom, cheering him on from afar.But I was never a fan; just a girl in love.Like a tornado, he spiraled, leaving a path of destruction in his wake.But love conquers all, right? It has to. Because here I stand, ravaged and ruined, needing it to be true. You can’t go back, but I want to. Back to the bridge. Back to when he sang only for me. Before he was famous. Before he shattered my heart. I thought I knew everything about him.But I could not have been more wrong.He promised me every tomorrow. And here I am, waiting. And hoping. Again.**there is no cliffhanger and no cheating in this book
