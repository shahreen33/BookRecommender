The Spider-Women of two worlds join Silk for a story too big for just one of their books! New mother Jessica Drew is taking a mentor role with Silk and Spider-Gwen, and the trio enjoys a brunch break on Gwen's Earth-65. But when nefarious spy organization S.I.L.K. and its leader — a certain Cindy Moon — notice the interdimensional interlopers, everything goes wrong! Can the arachnid adventurers find a way home, or will they be trapped in a world they never made? And if they do escape Earth-65, will their troubles follow? Jess meets the Mary Janes, and Silk comes face-to-face with her counterpart's family — but who's looking after little baby Drew? It's an epic that will shake all three Spider-Women to the core!Collects Spider-Women Alpha #1, Silk (2015B) #7-8, Spider-Gwen (2015B) #7-8, Spider-Woman (2015) #6-7, Spider-Women Omega #1
