Only the lost magic of Dragon Songs can save the world.  The Dragon Singers of old summoned typhoons and routed armies, liberating mankind from the orcs before fading into legend. Now, with the world again teetering on the brink of a cataclysm, the power of music stirs in Kaiya, a gangly misfit with the perfect voice.  Without a master to guide her, she must rely on the lessons of a foreign paladin, an enigmatic doctor, a flippant elf lord, and an evil sorcerer to rediscover lost magic. Yet doing so means taking dire risksâ€¦  Because invoking a Dragon Song can kill you.
