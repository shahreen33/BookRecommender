“You’ve been the first that I’ve kissed since her.”“So I’m the rebound...” she trailed off.I’m Jackson, Jack, or Jax. I don’t really care what you call me as long as you scream it out in bed. Going back home to my parents at twenty-four is not my proudest decision, but after my shack-up girlfriend of two years went and f*cked someone else, I am left with no choice. She won’t f*ck me but easily f*cked him. The cheating whore could go to hell for all I care, but she broke my heart for sure.Six weeks into moping around in my room, my bitter, intoxicated arse had to get out and get moving. Getting over things isn’t easy, but it had to be done.Then I meet her, Sienna, a redhead with the brightest green eyes you’ll ever see—those same eyes I imagined looking up at me as I jerked off in the shower months ago. She’s perfect, almost too perfect, and she got me intrigued.I have to man up and get my own place, so I got a bachelor’s pad… in Sienna’s building. Not that I’m expecting anything. But one thing leads to another, and I find myself wanting her—falling for her. There’s something more to her shy, nervous smile and the way she fumbles over her words whenever I push too hard… there’s something more to that girl across the hall.But am I even ready to be in another relationship? To try again? Will I ever get to quell her doubts about us? And when my past comes knocking on her door, will she let me in or send me walking out her life?Sexy, steamy, and romantic, His Rebound Love is gonna make you believe in second chances, all while leaving your senses—and inner desires—tingling.
