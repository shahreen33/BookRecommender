In The Guns of Santa Sangre, three 1800s gunfighters battled a ferocious pack of werewolves in Old Mexico. In the sequel, The Wolves of El Diablo, the three outlaws rob a Federale steam train in the badlands of El Diablo transporting a fortune in silver bars. But when a savage werewoman, hungry for revenge on the men who killed her brother, leads her bloodthirsty gang of wolfmen in an attack on the train, the outlaws find themselves trapped on a highballing railroad in the middle of the desert fighting fifty werewolves. This time itâ€™s bigger action, more lycanthropes, more silver bullets, and much more Werewolf Western thrills!
