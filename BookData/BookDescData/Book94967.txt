This debut collection of poetry from Sara Tantlinger takes a dark look at all the horrors of love, the pleasures of flesh, and the lust for blood. For discerning fans of romance and the macabre, look no further than Love For Slaughter."Sara Tantlinger has just sent a Valentine's present to your funeral. Seduction is a slaughterhouse in "Love for Slaughter" -- the first poetry book from this brilliantly evocative and subversively disturbing new horror writer -- a woman dead set on beheading Cupid and reminding us all how weird love really is. From the charm of the corpse to the beauty of butchery, Tantlinger's poems roil with dangerous desire and are relentlessly provocative -- satanically sultry stuff that you won't be able to stop reading."-Michael Arnzen, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of Proverbs for Monsters and The Gorelets Omnibus“Sara Tantlinger’s Love for Slaughter is full of dark moments of exquisite beauty. She is particularly adept at making even the bleakest of sentiments sound sensual and captivating. Full of clever wordplay, haunting rhythms, and excellent phrasing, Tantlinger’s work is a must for readers who like their poetry with a side of sexy gloom.” -K.W. Taylor, author of The Curiosity Killers
