The stunning new legal thriller from the New York Times-bestselling author of The Hanging Judge, "a talent to watch" (The Washington Post). When FBI agents barge into Sidney Cranmer's home accusing him of a heinous crime, the respected literature professor's life becomes a nightmare. Cranmer insists the illicit material found by the agents isn't his, but the charge against him appears airtight, and his academic specialty--the life and work of controversial author Lewis Carroll, creator of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland--convinces investigators he's lying. Presiding over the case against Professor Cranmer, U.S. District Judge David Norcross fears his daily confrontation with evil has made him too jaded to become a husband and father. His girlfriend, Claire Lindemann, teaches in the same department as the defendant and is convinced of his innocence. Soon, she will take matters into her own hands. Meanwhile--with his love life in turmoil and his plans for the future on hold--a personal tragedy leaves Norcross responsible for his two young nieces. Unbeknownst to him, a vengeful child predator hovers over his new family, preparing to strike. Michael Ponsor's debut novel, The Hanging Judge, was praised by retired Supreme Court justice John Paul Stevens for reminding readers "that the judicial process is not infallible" and by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Tracy Kidder for bearing "the heft of authenticity." The One-Eyed Judge again draws on Ponsor's thirty years as a US district judge, offering readers an insider's view of one of the most harrowing kinds of cases faced by the courts. Fast-paced, thrilling, and thought-provoking, this is legal fiction at its most realistic and compelling. The One-Eyed Judge is the 2nd book in the Judge Norcross Novels, but you may enjoy reading the series in any order.
