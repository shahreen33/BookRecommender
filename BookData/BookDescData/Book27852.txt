Michelle Mitchell isn’t the kind of girl you’d expect the most popular guy on campus to like. She has blue hair and favors ripped jeans to mini-skirts and Doc Martens to heels. Of course, Sebastian Winters isn’t the type of guy you’d expect her to go for, either. Her taste tends to run more “bass player” than “baseball player.”  But things are about to get very unexpected...when an intelligent, artistic, outspoken alt girl meets a sweet, sexy, southern charmer, watch the sparks fly!
