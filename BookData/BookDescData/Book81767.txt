I believe we have all been created for greater things than we can comprehend, writes Elder Jeffrey R. Holland. But such accomplishments are not achieved by fierce competitiveness, calculated one-up-manship, or cold indifference to others. True greatness will always be predicated upon love, respect, compassion, dignity, prayer, hard work, God. In this collection of memorable quotations, selected from Elder Holland s talks and devotionals given over the past twenty-eight years, his remarkable insights and words of encouragement particularly to women are paired with inspiring visual images in a beautiful gift book designed to lift and strengthen readers in all walks of life.
