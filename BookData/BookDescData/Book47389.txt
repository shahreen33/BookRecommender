Insane innkeepers, cannibalistic cooks: the staff of the Brant Hotel would like to meet you!Massive nights, picturesque days: there is nothing Claire doesn't love about her summer job in Mission, Massachusetts. Claire is just trying to keep her head down and start a new life after burning out in the city, but those kids out in the woods seem like they throw awesome ragers...It's only once she's in too deep that Claire discovers the real tourist trade that keeps the town afloat, it's then that her soul-searching in Mission becomes a fight for her life.Crazed parties, dark rituals, and unexpected betrayals abound in this modern folk horror novel from the author of The Con Season and Video Night."The prologue of The Summer Job is one the best and scariest openings to a horror novel I've ever read...The rest of the novel is equally great." -LitReactor"Cesare's latest is a knockout...There's a potent retro vibe running through Cesare's work, in general--he's the closest thing literary horror has to its own Jim Mickle or Ti West." -Complex"The textbook definition of a nail-biter. The Summer Job is a kissing cousin to inbred classics from masters like Ketchum and Kilborn. Cesare's best novel yet." -Bloody Disgusting
