In a decaying world that's lost its battle against the undead, a group of desperate survivors search for shelter deep in the Texas woods. But they discover something far worse than the dead that command the earth. Prepare to meet the Him Deep Down! Authors Chad Lutzke (Night as a Catalyst) and Terry M. West (What Price Gory?) team together to offer a zombie story with a different kind of bite.
