Why did someone kill Olive Pendleton and hide her body?  When bakery owner Lexy Baker and her posse of iPad toting grandmas witness a murder remotely through the camera of a drone, they go straight to Lexy's homicide detective husband, Jack, to report the crime. But with no body and no crime reported, Jack can't do a thing, leaving Lexy and her grandmother no alternative than to solve the murder themselves.  Armed with nothing but their gigantic patent leather purses and a dogged determination to see justice done, the ladies dodge a pack of overzealous Pekeapoos, nosey neighbors and an ornery husband in order to flush out Olive's killer before he kills again.
