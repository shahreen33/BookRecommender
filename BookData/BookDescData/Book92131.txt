Dante Gabriel needs Erin Hamilton’s blood. The hunger is all-consuming, but flashbacks of his time in captivity, as well as his quest for answers, leave him questioning everything. With the help of his cousin, his father’s ghost, and a Shakespeare-quoting voodoo priestess, he’s determined to decode the book his grandfather claims will lead him only to darkness.Erin loves Dante and has finally accepted him for what he is, but she feels like she’s been transported into another world. Ghosts, werewolves, and vampires are all real? Even her best friend might not be what she seems. In addition, the mystery at the hospital deepens—a doctor is now missing—and Erin fears there may be a connection to Dante.
