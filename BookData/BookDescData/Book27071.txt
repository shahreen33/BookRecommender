The Black Mountain Camp for Boys. Summer of ’89. It is a time for splashing in the lake and exploring the wilderness, for nine teenagers to bond together and create friendships that could last the rest of their lives.But among this group there is a young man with a secret — a secret that, in this time and place, is unthinkable to his peers.When the others discover the truth, it will change each of them forever. They will all have blood on their hands.ODD MAN OUT is a heart-wrenching tale of bullies and bigotry, a story that explores what happens when good people don’t stand up for what’s right. It is a tale of how far we have come … and how far we still have left to go.
