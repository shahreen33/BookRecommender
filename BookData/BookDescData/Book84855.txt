Rainbow Fish is missing! Where can he be? Children will enjoy this sweet story about the search for Rainbow Fish. They'll have fun assembling the 9 puzzle pieces (take one from each spread) to create a beautiful picture of Rainbow Fish's undersea world. And they'll be challenged to find the subtle difference between each puzzle piece and the almost identical picture beneath it.
