Are those who have faith in God’s goodness supposed to grieve? Bob Kellemen reminds us that the Bible is both painfully honest and eternally encouraging about our hurts—assuring us that it is normal to hurt but also possible to hope. This devotional offers suggested resources and reflection questions to help you to apply gospel truth, day by day, to your grief. Be honest with your grief and give voice to it—then see how you can find comfort and even bring comfort to others.  In the 31-Day Devotionals for Life series, biblical counselors and Bible teachers guide you through Scripture passages that speak to specific situations or struggles, helping you to apply God’s Word to your life in practical ways day after day.
