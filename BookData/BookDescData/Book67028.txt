Collects The Astonishing Ant-Man #1-4, Ant-Man: Last Days #1 &amp; Ant-Man Annual #1.Scott Lang's All-New, All-Different life as Ant-Man is a social whirl — including a team-up with Sam Wilson, the new Captain America! But Scott's reunion with ex-girlfriend Darla Deeling, a.k.a. Ms. Thing, may be a lot less amicable. Business is on the up, but Scott's still a little guy with giant-size problems. Like his daughter. His love life. An old foe crossing his path. And Hench, the super-villain app that's sending a steady stream of enemies his way. If being a hero is this hard, Scott, why not go back to a life of crime? Hey, there's an idea! Plus: Ant-Man is seeking some friends for the end of the world — and beyond! Pals like Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man — and a Golden Age dance partner!
