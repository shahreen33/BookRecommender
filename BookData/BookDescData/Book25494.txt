Marla’s day might begin with an email like this:Marla,I hope you don’t plan on charging me for the last two setups—Penny and Lydia. Let me make it crystal clear for you, even 5 pounds overweight is a deal killer.… I won’t waste any more time on another date with a plump gal.ClarencePenny and Lydia are both under 110 pounds—including implants. Marla facetiously refers to the dating service as the Double D—which doesn’t stand for dream date—and often finds herself introducing SHBRs (short fat bald rich guys) to GDGDs (gosh darn gold-diggers) and, despite the odds, countless couples find that Marla has linked their hearts. The exasperating clients stand out, but many are terrific people, and you’ll follow their dating stories with interest, as Marla struggles to work for a boss who requires her to cross ethical lines, pushing Marla to her limits.A tiny spark is all it takes, and Marla goes from being vice-president of a multi-city enterprise to being unemployed—which takes her career in matchmaking to a whole new level, all while staying true to her most authentic self.
