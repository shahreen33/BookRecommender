Despite the fact she's a woman in a man's world, Morgan Lane works hard at Goldsen Park. Wielding a chainsaw and felling trees, she tries to keep up with her bosses' constantly contradicting orders. Staying busy in the woods keeps her from thinking about Wade Newland, the one man she'd loved who left her without an explanation.Yet the photojournalist can't stay away. Wade crashes back into her life—literally—when he carries her tumbling over a ravine to save her from a stranger bearing a weapon in her park. Connected again, albeit out of danger, they attempt to figure out why someone would be toting a gun in the dark.As they sleuth their way through the tangles of bureaucracy and the many layers of deception within the Goldsen crew, they discover there is more to this incident than what meets the eye. The deeper they dig, they realize no one can be trusted, not even the law. Not only do they have to tiptoe around their still-burning feelings for each other, they need to come to a simple truce. Can they watch each other's backs and find the answers in the darkest part of the forest?
