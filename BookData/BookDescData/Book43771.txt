Teenage Wasteland details the surprising beginnings of the slasher movie and lifts the lid on the g(l)ory days of the subgenre - when for six bloody years (1978-84), cinema screens and video stores were stalked by bogeymen and homicidal maniacs with murder and mayhem on their minds.Packed with reviews of the best (and worst) slashers, essays on the history of the subgenre and heart-pounding colour movie artwork from around the world, it is a must for anyone interested in film and culture.
