Winter Nobleman is complicated. To say the least.It was supposed to be simple. Go to Paris, find a client’s daughter, and close a multi-million-dollar deal. Easy. Then I meet her. Stormy blue eyes, quick wit, and the secrets she keeps on the tip of her tongue make me forget my mission for a moment, or six, and why I’m in Paris in the first place—to bring her home.Distracted by her beauty, I fail to notice the others lurking with missions of their own.Bennett Everest is the twist I never saw coming. Talk about perfect timing.He steals my breath the first time I see him and breathes hope back into my heart. He’s a giant in my eyes, a king among men with patience and love to share in spades. Six foot three. Whiskey-colored eyes. Solid gold on the inside.Despite the dirty deeds of my past, he sees the person I am meant to be and not the person I have become.If the lies don’t kill us, will the truth set us free?
