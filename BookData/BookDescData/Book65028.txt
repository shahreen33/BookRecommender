Attention parents and grandparents, nurses and nannies: If the child in your life is under five, this convenient eBook bundle is for you. From respected pediatrician and child development expert Dr. Harvey Karp, national bestsellers The Happiest Baby on the Block and The Happiest Toddler on the Block will help you calm a crying baby, survive the “Terrible Twos,” and much more, resulting in more loving time for you and your child.   THE HAPPIEST BABY ON THE BLOCK The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer   “The best way I’ve ever seen to help crying babies.”—Steven P. Shelov, M.D., editor in chief, American Academy of Pediatrics’ Caring for Your Baby and Young Child   With Dr. Karp’s sensible advice, you will be able to soothe even the fussiest infants and increase their sleep. His highly successful method is based on four revolutionary concepts: The Fourth Trimester (re-creating the womblike atmosphere your newborn still yearns for), The Calming Reflex (an “off switch” all babies are born with), The 5 S’s (five easy methods to turn on the calming reflex), and The Cuddle Cure (combining the 5 S’s to calm even colicky babies).   THE HAPPIEST TODDLER ON THE BLOCK How to Eliminate Tantrums and Raise a Patient, Respectful, and Cooperative One- to Four-Year-Old   “An informative and engaging romp about toddlers. Roll over, Dr. Spock.”—The New York Times   Dr. Karp provides fast solutions for molding toddler behavior by combining his trademark tools of Toddler-ese and the Fast-Food Rule with a highly effective new green light/yellow light/red light method. As you learn how to boost your child’s good (green light) behavior, curb his annoying (yellow light) behavior, and immediately stop his unacceptable (red light) behavior, you will be able to alleviate stormy outbursts with amazing success—and better yet, prevent these tantrums before they begin.
