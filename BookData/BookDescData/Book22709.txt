She is well-educated and intelligent, and when she catches the eye of a wealthy goldsmith her father sees in her an opportunity for an advantageous marriage. But the marriage is soon annulled and she becomes the favourite mistress of Edward IV.Her compassion for London's poor brings her widespread popularity, and she uses her favour with the king to beg forgiveness for those who have angered him.
