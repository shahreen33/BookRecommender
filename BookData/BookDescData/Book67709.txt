Maxon Chambers has a way of stealing all the attention. All my affection, and all my dreams. What I needed to remember was he’d stolen my good judgment and my virginity, too. When he broke up with me, I ran across the country and swore I’d never return to Broadshire Rim. But here I am, thirteen years later. Maxon is all grown up.Sexier than sin and more tempting than ever. A detective on the Charleston force, he lives on the outside of safety, devoted to protecting the people of his city.But with the way he’s looking at me now? I’m pretty sure what needs protecting is my heart.Can we mend the pieces of us? Or will he leave my heart shattered forever . . .
