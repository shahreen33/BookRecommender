Lexy Baker is finally tying the knot with hunky homicide detective Jack Perillo. She’s planned the perfect wedding right down to her custom designed gown. Nothing can go wrong. ... Until Lexy stumbles across a double murder and one of the victims is a Bridezilla that Lexy had a major fight with just hours before. This time Jack can’t help her because he’s been taken off the case and the gum chewing ditzy rookie that’s replaced him has put Lexy at the top of the suspect list. Lexy calls on her amateur detective grandmother to help her find the real killer while she’s juggling wedding plans, trying to run her bakery and entertaining her parents who are in town for the wedding. Will Lexy end up with handcuffs slapped on her wrist instead of a wedding ring slid on her finger?
