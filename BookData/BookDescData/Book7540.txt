Rookie sportswriter Catriona McDaniel is on deck in Sin City for the job of a lifetime with baseball's hottest team. The Las Vegas Chips have the best record in baseball, snagging two trophies in their first three years. Two men are vying for the position of "boyfriend of summer." Her new boss, Erich Kï¿½nig, is a German wunderkind and the Desert's most eligible bachelor. Then there's her neighbor-a biology professor whose fetal pigs know more about baseball than he does. Not all the men admire Cat. As the team's junior reporter, Dusty Carlyle was on-deck for her position. Now he's desperate to get her out of the lineup. Save for the scheming coworker, Cat has everything she ever wanted ... until a star outfielder's heart stops. Suspecting that his death was no accident, she starts nosing around, becoming the newest player in an extreme game of hardball. Will Cat become the next member of the team to be taken out of the lineup?
