A ghost falling in love with a mortal? It’s just a bunch of hocus pocus…DaniSo, I think my apartment is haunted.No. Really.Spooky things have been happening to me ever since I moved in last year. At first, I ignored them. Later, I got used to the idea that I shared my place with a ghost. I even called him Casper. We got along just fine.Until a sexy hunk showed up the night before Halloween and told me that his name wasn’t Casper--it was Zack. And that, on All Hallow’s Eve, certain ghosts sometimes have the power to cross over into the human world. Which he did, because he loves me.Okay then.ZackI’m in love.The only problem?She’s alive. And me?I’m kinda not.At least, I’m not on every day except for October 31st. Because on Halloween? Anything goes.I want Dani. And even if it’s only for the one night when ghosts can cross over to the living world, I’ll take what I can get. Because I love a mortal, and it’s not just hocus pocus.***Dani Williams doesn’t believe in ghosts. But this Halloween, after a year of watching over and falling in love with his mortal houseguest, Zack Banks is ready to prove that this particular ghost might just believe in her.This sweet Halloween treat is chock full of insta-love, over-the-top Halloween magic, and enough Hocus Pocus nods to make you cackle like a sexy witch in between moaning for more. A Sarah Spade HEA guaranteed!
