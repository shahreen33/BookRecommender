How would you feel if, one day, you discovered everything you thought you knew about your family was a fabrication? Your mother wasn't your mother, your father was a liar and your whole upbringing was a sham. Confronted with this exact situation, Dave Fazackerley doesn't feel great. It doesn't help that he has just buried the woman he thought of as his mother. Or that his wife, his one true soulmate, recently jumped into bed with a librarian. Even his band, his only escape from reality, is going through a rough patch. How will Dave respond? Will he discover the truth about his family? Will his band ever play a gig again? More importantly, can Dave entice his wife back from the arms of the book-dork or will he take a chance on a new love?"Six Lies reads in humour and brilliance akin to Nick Hornby's High Fidelity. A wonderful book. I loved every moment of reading it." Becky Walsh - BBC Radio Presenter and author.
