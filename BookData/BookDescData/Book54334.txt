They call me the Ice Princess. As the King family lawyer, I keep all of the family secrets. And as a woman in the high-powered world of million-dollar business, I have to stay cold and in control.  I’ve earned my way to the top, and I’ve never met a man who makes me weak. Until Dylan King, the family’s exiled son, comes home.  He’s former Special Ops, the family rebel, a mystery, a myth. A man who seems like he can do anything—including becoming the heir to the King empire if he chooses. He’s also the only man whose touch can melt my ice. And he wants me.  But nothing is simple, and love doesn’t come without a price. When I offer Dylan a devil’s bargain—and he takes it—there’s no telling who will win. And if he discovers the secrets I’m keeping, I might lose everything—including the heart I’ve so carefully put on ice.  The King Family Series: Book One: The Tycoon by M.
