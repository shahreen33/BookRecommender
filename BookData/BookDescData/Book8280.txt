They say that before you die your life flashes before you eyes.You think it's going to be the good stuff - every kiss, every party.Don't count on it.I was Bridget Duke - the uncontested ruler of the school. If keeping the wannabes in their place meant being a mean girl, then so be it! I never thought there'd be a price to pay.Until the accident.Now, trapped between life and death, I'm seeing my world in a new light: through the eyes of five people whose existence I've made hell.And I've got one chance to make things right. If I don't, I may never wake up again...
