The Kree Empire intends to conquer the universe using an army of Norse Gods! Four heroes united by their past - Captain America, Namor, the original Human Torch and the Winter Soldier - must now wage war against the Kree to save Earth! The Invaders face the Kree's ultimate hunter, Tanalth the Pursuer, and take the fight straight to the Kree Homeworld and the Supreme Intelligence - but how does Aarkus, the original Vision, figure in? How will the Winter Soldier find him? And how does the Kree threat relate to a secret Invaders mission from decades ago? Eisner Award winner James Robinson (Starman, Earth 2) returns to Marvel, uniting with Steve Pugh (Generation X, Animal Man) to create a unique, modern day take on the Invaders!COLLECTING: All-New Invaders 1-5, Material from All-New Marvel Now!
