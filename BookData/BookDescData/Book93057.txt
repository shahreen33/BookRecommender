Sweetfern Harbor Bed and Breakfast Cozy Mysteries can be read in one to two hours. It is perfect for those moments when you are waiting at an appointment or want to enjoy a quick read.  At Sweetfern, there are more than rare relics on display.  Before the arrival of the collectors at Brenda’s family establishment, The Sheffield Bed and Breakfast, she was ignorant to what a wampum is until a kindly collector shows one that will feature at the highly anticipated Native American Market.  However, the sight of a wampum triggers a memory in Brenda – she recalls her uncle Randolph Sheffield possessing one, a rare relic that could be in the dusty attic. Why would something so precious be left to gather dust?  Brenda and her housekeeper, Phyllis, decide to go hunting through the large attic for the ‘lost’ wampum. However, someone else is willing to tip the place upside down to get it first.  Some secrets can’t be kept in a safe box – but someone can be trapped in one.
