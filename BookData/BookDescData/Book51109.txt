He was trouble from the start, but I couldn't resist. 
  She was the best kind of trouble. The kind that was so wrong, it felt right.
I’ve tried and failed to stay away from him. 
  I’ve done everything in my power to make her mine and keep her.
He’s almost impossible to say no to. 
  She never tells me yes.
We’re always fighting. 
  When we’re not fighting, we’re… well… making up.
He makes me laugh so hard. 
  I miss her laugh the most.
I'm a liar. 
  She knows the truth, but won’t admit it.
Sometimes, I wish I'd never met him. 
  I wish we could meet all over again. I'd do better.
His girlfriend knows. 
  The guy she’s with is a fool.
I’ll never love anyone like I love him. 
  She doesn’t love me enough to choose us.
It was the wrong place. 
  It was the wrong time.
It should have been him. 
  It will always be her.
