He must decide whether to stay on land and become like her, or continue to live without her in the depths of the ocean. Trapped in a centuries long battle between his kind and hers, his decision will rock both their kingdoms. With a sea witch that needs repaying and the small matter of Erica's engagement to someone else, Ari knows the odds are stacked against him.
