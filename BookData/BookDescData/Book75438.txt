"I loved this novel! It was charming but also thought provoking. It wasn’t one of these novels with lots of action or lots of laughs but it was beautifully written and I was really engaged with the story." Joanne B.  "I loved this book. I did not want it to end."  Kim H.  "What an absolutely lovely romantic read this was with such likeable characters too. I love Linn’s writing, it has a different edge to any other books I have read and I always look forward to reading her work." Tracey F.  When destiny calls, you need to pick up … On the surface, Kristi Danielson has it all. She’s lifestyle coach to the rich and famous, has a bestselling book to her name and is described by her fans as “the veritable Queen of how to lead a fulfilling life”.  But the harsh truth is that Kristi has never practiced what she preaches. Her home life is a mess, her relationship with artist boyfriend, Tom, not much better – and now she has to redeem herself before all is lost. At her wit’s end, Kristi is driven to seek out the help of Patrick Blakeslee, a tarot card reader and psychic medium, in an attempt to make sense of the mounting panic she’s feeling.  But Patrick’s visits have an unexpected effect on Kristi, leaving her with more questions than answers – and a life-changing decision to make.
