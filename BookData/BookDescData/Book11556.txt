Through a mysterious map depicting far-flung lands, a Chinese sailor in 1424 and a Portuguese cartographer in 1519 share a vision of an Earth far greater than the reality they know. Unknown to them, an even stronger thread unites themâ€”the alien probe, Prometheus. What will it take to unlock the priceless knowledge contained in its flawless databanks?  A short story from The Prometheus Saga.   INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR   Q - What is the Prometheus Saga?  A - In The Prometheus Saga, thirteen authors unite to interpret how an alien presence would interact with the human condition over a time period that spans from the dawn of man to the present. The stories cross genres and genders, allowing for entirely different narratives and insights on historical events and the human experience.  Q - Where should a reader start when selecting a short story to read in The Prometheus Saga?  A - Each story is self-contained and can be read in any order. The reader is free to select any of the stories at random to begin their experience. Each short story has a different setting in history. The book description will explain the time period setting for each particular story.  Q - What is this alien probe?  A - An alien civilization landed a probe on Earth at the dawn of mankind. This probe, a form of artificial intelligence, can morph into any human form, take on any human identity, either male or female. Its life spans hundreds of thousands of years. Its mission is to report everything it can about us to its home planet. What this humanoid observes and learns over centuries of human existence will be interpreted through each short story in the saga. The alien probe is as mythic as Prometheus, the Greek Titan who was said to have brought fire to mankind.
