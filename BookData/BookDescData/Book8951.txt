Joie is a high school graduate that recently lost her father and ends up reluctantly trailing after a rock and roll band with her best friends only to find love in a very unexpected way. She must avoid letting her mother know what she is up to, keep one friend from jumping from one frying pan into another while helping the other hook up with the love of his life and all this while attempting to thwart a killer who is seeking revenge. The dialogue is humorous, the characters engaging and the dramatic tension both romantic and murderous.
