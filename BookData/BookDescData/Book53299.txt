By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes....It's not easy being a witch. Especially when you're the youngest and least talented of four sisters. But Persephone Gosse manages the same way she manages her Duluth bar, Toil &amp; Trouble. With hard work, a smart mouthâ€”and a lot of whiskey. Seph likes her quiet life...as quiet as it can be when the king of the bears wants her as his queen, a werewolf (or three) wants her dead, and her cold-as-ice ex, Jack Frost, wants...Well, she hasn't quite figured that out yet. But with a bounty on her head and time running out on a half-forgotten prophecy, Seph better get a clue before this witch's brew blows up in her face.*This book is the first of a 3-book serial*
