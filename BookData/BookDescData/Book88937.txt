It is 2005, and Brock Albert is fresh out of business school. He landed a marketing research job for an ad agency, but quickly grows bored with it. For an intellectual distraction, he creates a statistical model to predict the outcomes of men's college basketball games. He does this as a hobby until a huge misunderstanding costs him his job, leaving him no choice but to take all of his cash, his best friends, and the model to Las Vegas and go head-to-head with their sportsbooks. For the first time in his life, he's faced with betting big - on himself.
