Jerry Hopkins’s Elvis: A Biography was the first book on popular music to top the U.S. bestseller list, and its sequel was equally popular. Long out of print, both books, along with a wealth of exciting new interviews, are brought together in Elvis to form the most exhaustive account available of the King’s life. Telling the complete story of Presley’s rise and fall, from his poverty-stricken childhood in Tupelo through his musical development and emergence as pop’s first superstar to his decline and death, the book explores Presley’s singular appeal, his far-reaching influence, and his extraordinary legacy. Featuring newly published firsthand interviews with people close to Elvis — including high school teachers, girlfriends, directors, agents, recording engineers, bodyguards, sidemen, karate instructors, medical professionals, and even his personal jeweler — Elvis presents a comprehensive and amazingly intimate look at this cultural icon.
