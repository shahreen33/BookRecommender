Fight demons. Fall in love. Save the world.  Welcome to Angel Academy.  My name is Celeste Venoix and I’m no angel.  I never had a family, so I’ve been taking care of myself ever since I was a kid. One night, some creep decides to follow me home from work, and I use my fists to put him in his place. After the brawl, a handsome stranger approaches me and tells me that I might be an angel.  What the hell?  The next thing I know, I’m enrolled at the Angel Academy. The academy is a place for angels-in-training to learn how to fight demons and become fluent in an ancient language or two. It’s hard enough trying to keep up with my classes, but somewhere between working on my swordsmanship and my Latin prepositions, I find myself falling for my best guy friend...  And falling for a handsome stranger.  And falling for a guy who totally hates my guts.  All at the same time.  Oh, and did I mention that demons keep trying to kill me and I have no idea why?  God.  It’s going to be one hell of a year.  *Angel Academy is a university-age reverse harem series. 18+  #WhyChoose
