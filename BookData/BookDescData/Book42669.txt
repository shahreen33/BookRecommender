Horrifying things are happening at Gloomsburg Castle. To begin with, the creepy place is crawling with Tiny Biting Ghosts (or “TIBIGs,” in official ghosthunter code). And now it appears as if the murderous spirit of a brutal Baroness has taken hold of the land-lady, infecting her with a killer case of hic–hic–hiccups! Of course Hugo the Averagely Spooky Ghost is instantly smitten with Her Hideous Highness, only to find out that love stinks! And it smells something awful, too. Looks like the time has come for Tom to put an end to the “foul” play and concoct a plan that will dispel this decaying royal for good.
