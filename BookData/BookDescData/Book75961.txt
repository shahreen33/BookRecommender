Homer's epic poem telling the story of the darkest episode in the ten-year-long Trojan War, retold for younger readersThe Iliad is one of the greatest works of literature ever written. It has inspired readers and listeners for millennia. The story tells of the Trojan War, fought between the Trojans, led by King Priam, and the Greeks, led by King Agamemnon. At its center is Achilles, the greatest warrior-champion of the Greeks, and his refusal to fight after being humiliated by his leader Agamemnon. But when the Trojan Hector kills Achilles' close friend Patroclus, he storms back into battle to take revenge—even though he knows this will ensure his own untimely death. This retelling has been shortened and illustrated for younger readers.
