After receiving some news, Kathrine Harrison leaves Atlanta, Ga to return to a town she only remembers as a nightmare. Abandoning a broken Bryce behind to deal with the destruction he’s caused.  There’s nothing but chemistry between the two, but they can’t seem to get the science right. Passion and lust only get you so far and once they decided to be more than friends, things only grew deeper.  Bryce Grant is damaged, but he’s not letting his past destroy his future. He goes after his girl, desperate to win her back.  But Kathrine gets more than she bargained for while visiting her ten-cent town. She runs into someone she thought she’d never see again and finds out truths she never expected.  Will she lean on Bryce when she’s at her lowest or will she break, and push the one good thing in her chaotic life away?
