  Meet the amazing woman who put astronauts on the moon! Katherine Johnson is the mathematical genius who not only helped make the historic moon landings possible, but also made sure that all the astronauts returned safely home when the mission was in critical danger. 
As a child, Katherine loved to count. She counted the steps on the road, the number of dishes and spoons she washed in the kitchen sink, everything! Boundless, curious, and excited by calculations, young Katherine longed to know as much as she could about maths, about the universe . . .From Katherine's early beginnings as a gifted student to her heroic accomplishments as a prominent mathematician at NASA, this is the true story of a groundbreaking African-American woman who went above and beyond what was expected of her in the 1960s, saving lives and making enormous contributions to history. Featuring Dow Phumiruk's gorgeous full-colour illustrations throughout, Helaine Becker's Counting on Katherine: How Katherine Johnson Put Astronauts on the Moon is truly a gift to treasure.
