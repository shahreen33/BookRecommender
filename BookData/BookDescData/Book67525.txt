My friends always bitched about their parents and their rules. Their consequences. Well, I had them beat. My dad tortured souls for a living. Dealt their punishments. Condemned them to suffer in the fiery pits of hell. Literally. So what consequence does the devil give his own daughter? I've always been labeled as the disruptive one. The one to act impulsively, to take matters into my own hands. I can't help it, it's just the way I am. My father, Lucifer, didn't seem to care what I did until I was expelled during my senior year in high school for breaking a guy's nose. He's sending me to a school for angels. Only problem is, I'm half angel and have no wings. Now I must decide if I want to live a mediocre existence as a high school flunkey or as the Celestial Academy's pariah. Being the devil's daughter in a school full of angels is no walk in the park. It's a tough pill to swallow, but with three men at my side anything is possible.  That is, unless the Fallen get what they want.   Ascend is book 1 in a trilogy. This novel is full length and reverse harem.
