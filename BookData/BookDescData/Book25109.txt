Last time, Yuiko proudly declared to Taiga that she'd picked up a "girlfriend" for herself! Thankfully(?), it turned out to be none other than Kouji's cosplay-loving little sister, Akari. But now, Yuiko's getting wary that Taiga may have found a little piece on the side of his own! The truth is, he's still trying to keep his part-time schoolboy tutoring gig a secret from his girlfriend, lest her "rotten" tendencies run amuck with the, er, suggestive situation. But Taiga's innocent desire to spare himself from being dragged into another homoerotic scenario only serves to stoke the fires of Yuiko's suspicions of philandering. After all is said and done, will Taiga even have a girlfriend to spend his hard-earned money on?!
