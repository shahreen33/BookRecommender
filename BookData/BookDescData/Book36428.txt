An alternative cover edition for this ASIN can be found here.A Wizard, an Angel, and a Horseman of the Apocalypse walk into a bar…The ancient pact between mankind, Heaven, and Hell has been broken. And Nate Temple’s quest for vengeance may have just kicked off Armageddon. So, time to grab a stiff drink…or maybe four.Already plagued with sinister night terrors that could qualify him as a card-carrying psychopathic insomniac, Nate can barely even manage to put his pants on in the morning, let alone pick teams for the Apocalypse.But when he’s framed as a demon sympathizer, condemned by the Armies of Heaven, and hunted down by both his allies and the Four Horsemen, this wizard doesn’t think it can get any worse…Then they take away his magic. And a wizard without magic stands no chance against the forces of Heaven and Hell…Mardi Gras in St. Louis is really going to suck this year…If you like Jim Butcher, Kevin Hearne, Steve McHugh, Michael Anderle, Ilona Andrews, Patricia Briggs, Shannon Mayer, or K.F. Breene, you won't be able to put down the highly addictive Nate Temple Series.
