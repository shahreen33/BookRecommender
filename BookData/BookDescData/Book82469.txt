An old friend is in possession of a map that leads to a place that lies outside our world. But the map is known to one other--a vicious man who has Annja and her companions right where he wants them. Her hand forced, Annja sets out in search of the fabled Shangri-La--an expedition of danger and subversion.And her journey will end only with triumph...or tragedy.
