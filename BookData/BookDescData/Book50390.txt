Exploring writing as a practice, Amanda Boulter argues that the writer should be open to ideas and learning that might expand creative possibilities. Boulter draws from the work of writers, critics, and theorists to show how cultural and literary debates can help writers to enhance their own fiction. Negotiating the creative-critical crossover, Writing Fiction is a lively and approachable book that enables students to develop practical writing skills and a greater critical awareness of creative possibilities.
