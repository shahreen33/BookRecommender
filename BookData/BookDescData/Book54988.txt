Alice has been playing the perfect Southern wife for over twenty-five years. So when Bob dumps her for some blonde bimbo twenty years her junior, Alice figures she's entitled to every dollar she can bleed from him. And, once she's got the money, she's entitled to use it on a much-needed vacation to Nanm Paradi, a Caribbean resort that sells itself as her "soul's paradise".She's never experienced anything as luxurious as Nanm Paradi. The staff know her every desire and cater to her every need before she even knows she needs it. She figures this is how the really rich live and she's ready to take advantage of all of it--the fabulous drinks, the beautiful views, and the handsome men. And when she discovers that voodoo magic is also on offer... well, Bob hurt her bad. She can take some time away from paradise to exact a little pain. Alice would have been happy to leave things at that. But when she gets hit where it hurts--her bank account--Alice's game changes. It's no longer about post-divorce romance. Now it's about revenge.What Goes Around is a little bit thriller, a little bit witchy, a little bit romance, and a whole lot of sass.
