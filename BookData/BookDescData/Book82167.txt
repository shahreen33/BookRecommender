  There’s no escaping a Dire Wolf on the hunt...
  Long thought to be extinct, the Dire Wolf shifters have been hiding in plain sight—hunting, tracking, and killing those who threaten their beloved Omegas. But when the hunter becomes the hunted and the first mating bond in the modern history of the breed is realized, one wolf will have to fight off an entire enemy pack armed with a secret weapon in order to save not only his mission but his soul mate.  Savage Surrender is the lengthened version of a novella originally released in 2015 in the Masters Of The Hunt boxset.
