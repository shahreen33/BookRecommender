Mira doesn't like her hair. It curls at the front. It curls at the back. It curls everywhere! She wants it to be straight and smooth, just like her Mama's. But then something unpredictable happens . . . and Mira will never look at her mama's hair the same way again! A delightful celebration of natural hair and the courage it takes to be yourself.
