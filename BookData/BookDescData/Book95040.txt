Theodore was an unfortunate bear. Exquisite, knowledgeable, well-mannered and immaculately dressed (with his impressive red bow tie), he was what you would call a ‘gentle-bear’. For a teddy bear of his distinguished pedigree, one would expect nothing but the best of what life has to offer. But luck should have it that he would end up in the worst possible place on earth- the Chow family!The most terrible kind of family imaginable, his days were miserable.... to say the least. Every day he wished that the horrible family he's living with would disappear from his life. One day, the family went out for what seemed like a normal outing... But they never came back... Theodore's wish had come true....
