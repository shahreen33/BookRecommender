Tyler Grace was many things.A killer. A myth. An outcast. A hero.My prince.My childhood and innocence were stolen when I was kidnapped at five years old. For eleven years I clung to my childhood fairytale books, waiting for the prince I hoped would someday save me and carry me off to a happily ever after. I had no idea my savior would come in the form of a scarred recluse, covered in tattoo's, who can't--or won't--speak a word. But the moment our eyes met I knew he was the one. My prince. Tyler Grace is haunted by his tragic past and he's sentenced himself to a lifetime of solitude in the woods. He's as lost in society as I am; scarred just as much on the inside as the outside. Just like me. He saved my life that day he found me and killed my captor with his bare hands. I was warned to stay away from him. But I can't stop thinking about him. I ache to hear his voice and see him smile. And I want nothing more than to be the one to break through his walls. I think he's the only one who can break through mine, too.Together we can have love, happiness, and a closeness that once felt impossible to have. But can we overcome the horrible twisted past that ties us together?** Tied can be read as a single book.
