For decades, the Holy Grail of physics has been to find a unified "Theory of Everything" that reconciles the general theory of relativity and quantum theory, combing them into one mathematical package, a single equation that contains the proverbial answer to life, the Universe and everything.In this landmark new book, master of popular science writing John Gribbin tells for the first time the dramatic story of the quest that brings those two theories into alignment: the discovery of the true age of the Universe at 13.8 billion years. This discovery, as Gribbin explains, is one of humankind's greatest achievements and paves the way for a future in which the secrets of the cosmos could be united on the largest and smallest scales.
