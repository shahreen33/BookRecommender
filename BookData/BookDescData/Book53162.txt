Gemini, Book 3  Camille Ellis has gone rogue agent, and there’s no turning back now. The conclave might have put the Charybdis case to bed, but Cam isn’t willing to let it lie. No badge doesn’t mean no backup these days.  As mate to an alpha warg, she has access to new and lethal resources. A whole pack full of them. And they all want justice for the sins committed against them.  But the stakes are higher than she knows, the secrets exposed darker than she feared, and the cost of winning higher than she ever imagined.
