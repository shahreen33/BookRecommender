Peyton Stone never quit his day job. But it's his other profession that might just get him killed. Islamabad, Baghdad, Shanghai, Kazakhstan, Kabul, Langley. For Peyton Stone, that's a work commute. But his is no normal job. On the surface he's a world renowned security expert. But his real occupation is serving as a "nonofficial asset," a contractor working for the CIA when the government needs complete deniability. While advancing American interests globally, Stone discovers that those interests can exact a personal price. And when his business partner is murdered in a Shanghai hotel, ominous ghosts from his past return and he's drawn deeper into the covert maze, on the hunt for a stolen nuclear weapon and the rogue Iranian admiral hell-bent on using it. His skills, training, tactics, mettle and allegiance to family and country are all pushed to the limit as he races to prevent nuclear catastrophe.
