Be small. Be invisible. It's an odd life mantra for a human woman in a world of monsters. But Jane's blood contains a touch of vampire magic, making her a target. With her faster-than-normal healing time, she's an ideal punching bag for the abusive vampire she's been living with, the one she thought might protect her this time.Paul owes a debt to the werewolf alpha, and Cole doesn't care how he gets paid: flesh or coin. $10,000 or Jane? The human is a small price for the vampire to pay to be debt-free.Cole is attractive and warm---so different from the coldness and death Jane has grown used to. If the werewolves didn't have a worse reputation than the vampires, being taken by the alpha might feel like rescue, but Cole's growing possessive nature, makes Jane fear he'll only abuse her like the others. If he doesn't, could becoming an alpha's mate free her from the vampires for good?Books in the Preternaturals Series:Blood Lust (book 1) (Kept, Claimed, Mated)Save My Soul (book 2)The Catalyst (book 3)Life Cycle (book 4)Shorts:Cat FightDark Mercy (Hadrian and Angeline's prelude for the upcoming book 5)
