A centuries-old werelock playboy meets his match in a fearless single mom on the run...
  He was supposed to be an easy target. I had a clean shot at him while his back was turned and his pants were down. I wasn’t supposed to get distracted by his scent … or by the sight of his perfectly sculpted naked ass cheeks on display. He was never supposed to turn around and see me.Or start stripping the rest of his clothes off. And the greatest threat to my daughter’s life definitely wasn't supposed to start kissing me—after I’d just shot him five times.CONTENT: 100k word, full-length novel. HEA with no cheating. Although this is book #4 in the Werelock Evolution series timeline, it was written to work as a STANDALONE, so it is not necessary to have read the trilogy that precedes No Light. This book contains violence, foul language, adult content, and a lot of over-the-top werelock characters. If such material offends you, please do not read.
