Kaylee Jones is a trouble magnet. Chaos and disaster are her faithful companions. She belongs to the thin blue line protecting Earth from the Tai-Kok, alien predators who consider our world an all-you-can-eat banquet. Her crappy luck puts her on the alien freaks- most wanted list and lands her in one of their prison cells. Her roommate? A very hungry vampire. Okay, Talree's really a Coletti Warlord who decides to make her his mate. Kaylee's definitely not willing but isn't strong enough to fight him off and now he owns her mind, body and soul. She'll admit the sex is hot and the bossy jerk has agreed to save Earth from annihilation. The bad news is, Warlords aren't benevolent do-gooder types and there is a price for his help: the women of Earth. And the really bad news is, Talrees' low-down conniving brother, Malik, has joined forces with the alien freaks and now Kaylee and Talree have to stop them from destroying both their worlds.
