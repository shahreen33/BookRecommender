WENDY’S OWN FAIRY TALE!She may be only 12 years old, but Wendy Marvell is already a member of magical guild Fairy Tail, and a powerful dragon slayer wizard. Even so, she’s a little nervous when she sets out for the town of Nanalu for her first solo job: to discover why some of the locals have been mysteriously disappearing! They say the disappearances are the work of the spirit of a dead dragon. It sounds like superstition, but could it be true? Wendy, and another young local wizard named Yoshino, are determined to find out.
