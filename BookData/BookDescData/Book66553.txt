Although it doesn’t take long for the magic in the air to begin to make her wonder just a little curious about what a proper family Christmas might be like.But just as she’s beginning to settle in she spots a familiar face. Lex… more like a missile than a blast from the past. Despite the wonderful festive cheer, Meg suddenly wants nothing more than to get as far away from Lex and their past secrets as she can.
