LoriPlanning weddings is my dream job. As a single Mom, I live vicariously through my brides. From picking the dress to cutting the cake, I’m there every step of the way. When I meet the best man at the latest wedding, sparks fly. Graham Frazier is more than I bargained for. The charismatic soccer club owner is disillusioned with marriage after his divorce, so it’s part of my job to make sure he won’t slip any sarcastic jokes in his best man’s speech. It’s not part of my job to notice his washboard abs, or that he kisses like a dream. Graham’s touch is sizzling. Before I know it, he bosses me into accepting gifts and spending the night at his house (his excuse is good: I can’t possibly drive after working a wedding, can I?)I say yes to both. There are no two ways about it. I have the hots for this bossy man. GrahamSince my divorce, weddings aren’t my favorite events. But when my best friends decide to tie the knot, I promise to throw them a party they won’t forget. I was counting on sitting through long hours of preparations, but I didn’t count on meeting someone like Lori Connor. I pursue her relentlessly, wanting those long legs wrapped around me and her smooth skin under my lips. Then I meet her son, and that boy charms me even faster than his mother did. Before I know it, he has me wrapped around his little finger.But are Lori and I ready for our lives to intertwine in ways we haven’t even imagined before?
