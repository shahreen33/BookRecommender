Don't Think, Just Love« is the fruit of my inner balance; the female and male energies coming together in unity, from which a new Aleksandra« was born, awoken from a long dream of an unkind world, into a world of love.  Stories from my diary recollect everyday situations from my life, evincing the turning point at which I have stopped thinking and started to love. Perhaps some of these stories will help you recognize and better understand events of your own life.  It's very likely that there are many readers who are just like me; kind, loving and good people, but who don't seem to be able to find their way through life, even though they have plenty of love deep within themselves - the love they consider to be too risky to express. That's why I invite all of you good-hearted people, similar to myself, to wake up, start living the love and reach your full potential, just as your heart is telling you.  This world needs your love! The picture on the cover was made by the author. It represents her way of sharing with the readers a piece of her inner world.
