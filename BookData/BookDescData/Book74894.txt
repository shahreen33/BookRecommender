But with war threatening to put an end to their budding romance, there time together became precious, forcing them to live for the moment.Was she just another stupid girl who had got taken in by a good-looking GI?1940’s Historical Romance with Heat. Contains language and descriptive scenes that are only suitable for the over eighteen/adult reader.This WW2 historical romance originally appeared in the Help Our Heroes Charity Anothology in May 2018, which is now no longer available. When it was released back to me, I decided to switch it to duel perspective and extended it. So, if you’ve already read it as a short, please don’t skip the beginning. Re-read from the start. It’s the perfect chance to get to know the characters a little better and find out what happened to this charismatic couple.
