A year on from the events of Charles Dickens’ 'A Christmas Carol', Ebenezer Scrooge finds himself visited once again by the ghost of his late business partner, Jacob Marley, who brings with him a new proposition. Just as Marley helped Scrooge to avoid the cruel fate that the last of the Three Spirits foretold, Marley wants Scrooge to help him reduce his time in Purgatory.  And so begins an epic adventure that will see the former friends face off against all manner of phantasms, freaks and fiends, with only one thing at stake… Everything!  * * * * * * * * * * * * Have you ever wondered what happened after the events of Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol'? In what is barely more than a footnote, we are told that Ebenezer Scrooge became, "as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the old city knew," but did this transformation happen straight away, or more slowly over time?  We are also told that, "he had no further intercourse with Spirits," but what if Dickens wasn't telling us the whole truth. And what became of wretched Jacob Marley, doomed to walk the earth for all eternity, "captive, bound, and double-ironed," for failing to make mankind his business?  Well now you can find out, in 'Scrooge and Marley (Deceased): The Haunted Man', in which acclaimed author Jonathan Green cunningly weaves together disparate elements of Dickens' Christmas stories to create a new and thrilling narrative that is a must-read for fans of seasonal ghost stories and Green's own Pax Britannia steampunk novels.
