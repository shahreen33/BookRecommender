World famous Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh has inspired millions of readers in the practice of mindful living. Never before, however, have his calligraphy artworks, equally renowned, been available in book form. This Moment Is Full of Wonders collects more than 60 full-color artworks by the beloved figure in a richly textured hardcover package. As beautiful as they are inspirational, the ink-rendered phrases offer eloquent distillations of Buddhist wisdom, such as "Peace is every step," "Be free where you are," and "Smile to the cloud in your tea"â€”seemingly simple sayings that resonate with meaning. Interspersed throughout the book are iconic passages from his best-known teachings, printed on semi-transparent overlays that faintly obscure, then illuminate, the artworks beneath. At once a tool for personal growth and a visual treasure, This Moment Is Full of Wonders will delight spiritual seekers of all backgrounds.
