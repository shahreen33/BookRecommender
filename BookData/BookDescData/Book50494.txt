Beanie is a sweet, lovable tabby cat who sometimes, but not often, gets into mischief. He enjoys people and never misses a chance to be at a party. The author tells the story as if it were written by Beanie himself: "I looked up and saw two beautiful, sparkling blue eyes looking right at me.I didn't know who she would choose, but I hoped that it would be me." "I met a big dog named Rex. He started barking at me so I hissed and raised the hairs on my back." This is a true story of the life of a happy cat, and is written for cat lovers of all ages.
