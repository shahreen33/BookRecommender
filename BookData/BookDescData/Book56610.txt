Book 2 of the Father/Son DuetI laid my husband to rest....Scott was my world and my future. His love for me transcended the dimensions of time and space—having made provisions for me in the event of his death. He was after all in a war zone and the odds were high he may not come home. But now I can’t help but think about the new man in my life – my husband’s father.Maguire creates a desire deep inside of me I never knew existed. This is more than lust. I keep on asking myself the same question. Have I fallen in love with him because he's so much like my late husband or because he's his own man? Only time will tell. After all, you can't choose love, it chooses you.
