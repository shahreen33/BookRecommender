You take out one annoying vampire in revenge, and now you have to clean up the mess? What a pain in the ... something.  Bethany Anne and crew are back! They need to grab a ship, figure out who is trying to dig into her businesses, get their hands around the potential for creating an A.I. and the ongoing mess with Anton and South America.  One of these days, she will get a break. Fortunately for us, it wasn't today.  Got an attitude? That's nice. Just don't show it around Bethany Anne. When she slaps a face off, the whole head goes with it.  Bite This, The Kurtherian Gambit 04 follows the story after Love Lost. If you haven't read the preceding books YOU PRETTY MUCH HAVE TO. These are a series and many of the characters have been introduced in preceding volumes.  **Please note, as mentioned in another review, there is flagrantly foul language in this novel. The main character does not have a problem with cussing, just uninspired cussing.
