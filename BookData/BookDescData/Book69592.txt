A collaboration between writer Jamie Rhodes and the National Trust, A Castle in England is a unique and fascinating graphic fiction project inspired by Scotney Castle in Kent.Using the rich history of this fourteenth-century castle as a starting point, Rhodes has created five short stories that take place over different eras in the castle's past: The Labourer (Medieval), The Priest (Elizabethan), The Smuggler (Georgian), The Widow (Victorian), and The Hunter (Edwardian). Each of these stories has been illustrated by experienced comic and graphic novel artists Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg, creating a visually striking graphic collection that is steeped in historical context.Jamie Rhodes is a London based writer working in screen, prose, and comics. He studied Philosophy at Manchester Metropolitan University, where he focused on Heideggarian studies and Phenomenology. He later trained as a script reader and co-founded the filmmaking collective, Donkey Stone Films, in Nottingham. Jamie has been supported by: EM Media, IdeasTap, Arvon Foundation, Spread the Word, and the Arts Council England. He is the author of Dead Menâ€™s Teeth, launched at the British Library in 2014.
