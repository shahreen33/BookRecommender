 I’m used to getting what I want.  But I’ve never wanted anyone like her.  I’m the CEO. I dominate the boardroom with my presence. What I want, I get.I have the world at my beck and call.  But that no longer excites me. Nothing does.Until she comes along.  My Rose. Her deep blue eyes. Her tempting curves. They call to me, holding my attention like nothing has in years.I should walk away, but the soft sighs spilling from her plump lips are addictive. Even more, I want to force them from her lips myself.I’ve never felt such desire.  I’ve never wanted like this.  Even though I know I shouldn’t.There’s a reason I keep everyone away, and I need to remember that. But now that I have her in my grasp, I won’t let her go.*Mr. CEO is a full-length standalone romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger.
