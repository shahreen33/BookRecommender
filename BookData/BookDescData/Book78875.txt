Graham Greene's first novel, written when he was twenty-one and published in 1929, tells the story of Andrews, a young man running and hiding from fellow-criminals he has betrayed, and Elizabeth, the young woman who shelters him and persuades him to give evidence in court. But that is only the beginning of the trouble for them both...'A great writer who spoke brilliantly to a whole generation' -Alec Guinness'One of our greatest authors...Greene had the sharpest eyes for trouble, the finest nose for human weakness, and was pitilessly honest in his observations...For experience of a whole century he was the man within' -Independent
