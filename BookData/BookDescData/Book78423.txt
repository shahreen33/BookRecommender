A sexy single billionaire businessman. A YouTube star. And the hottest night of their lives.When I first saw him, I thought he was too hot for his own good and too cocky to resist. The perfect rebound from my break-up from hell. So I threw my usual rules out the door and challenged him to an anonymous hook-up. No names, no strings attached. It left me aching in more ways than one.So imagine my surprise when I show up for the first day of my new job to find him leading the company's annual meeting. We lock eyes through the crowd of employees, all the intensity from our hook-up like a live wire between us. And then he embarrasses me on purpose. Dick.I just need to keep this job and make it big. I won't let this arrogant hottie get to me or into my panties. But he is so powerful and sexy, that when he gets me in the elevator alone again, I know my plan is flawed.
