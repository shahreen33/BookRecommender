A Jamie Begley AnthologyHEAVEN SENT There wasn’t anything Shade didn’t know about his wife, or so he thought. When another man wanted Lily, it didn’t come as a surprise. What did was that she hadn’t told him. His “Angel” had been sent from heaven just for him, not for another who was trying to steal what was his. Some lessons had to be learned the hard way and “when you burn, you learn” was his favorite lesson to teach.  CHASING RAINBOWS Ice had never believed in happily ever after … until he fell in love with Grace. He had put a ring on her finger, trying to tie her to him before she came to her senses and realized there was nothing redeeming about him. So, he wasn’t surprised that their marriage was on the rocks. She might be chasing rainbows, trying to find the man she believed he was, but rainbows never lasted, and Ice had never pretended to be anything but what he was—a cold-blooded Predator. She didn’t realize you don’t have to chase after something that’s already been caught.  HALO FOR THREE Hammer and Jonas were on the hunt for a woman to share. However, either they couldn’t agree on the right woman, or she wanted no part of being in a ménage. That they found Mika on Valentine’s Day gave them hope that they had finally found the woman that they could spend the rest of their lives with … until she disappeared the next day, leaving them with an empty bed and no way to find her. She might have escaped for now, believing she had gotten off scot-free, but the bounty hunters were determined to catch their fleeing third. She might not know it yet, but some halos were made to be shared.
