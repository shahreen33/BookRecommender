KISS. MY. ASS.All those former fantasies about him kissing me with his "mouth of perfection" or bending me over my desk and filling me with his cock are long over. OVER.Your bestie,MyaPS--Please tell me your day is going better than mine...Subject: Re: My Boss.No, you haven't already told me that you hate your boss today, but seeing as though you've sent me this email directly, I know now...Yes, I did ask you to pick up my dry cleaning the second you arrived to work to day.
