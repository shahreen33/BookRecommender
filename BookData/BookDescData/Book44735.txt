A small therapy group arrives at Grief House hoping that a combination of isolation and hard work will help them begin the healing process each of them so desperately needs. But their presence has awakened something in the old dwelling. Something linked to the ancient stone megaliths at the rear of the property and a terrible crime, committed centuries before. Before the weekend is over, the group will learn the secrets of the Grieving Stones, and come to understand the true meaning of transformation.
