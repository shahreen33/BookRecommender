Meet Sergeant SexyAs a Sergeant in the Army I'm used to doing whatever needs to be done with no whining. Yeah, I'm kind of a badass.Until one injury changes everything. Now I'm haunted by the memories and broken in mind and body. I'm not used to admitting when I need help but I wonâ€™t qualify for the Special Forces unless I do something drastic. Like call in a favor from the one woman who makes me hope for more than duty to my country...
