Most of us are familiar with the exciting adventures of David and Goliath, Noah, or Daniel in the lions' den, but we don't always understand how they fit together. We lack context, and so we sometimes miss the point.The Most Important Stories of the Bible will give you a working knowledge of the key events in Scripture and how they flow into one big story. The book's 75 stories are compact, easy to read, and enjoyable. Each chapter includes a brief introduction that gives historical context to help you grasp the overall narrative of the Bible, and concludes with an explanation of why that story matters in our lives.There's a reason most of the Bible is made up of stories. They speak to us in a deep way, helping us internalize God's message. And in the end, understanding the stories of God's Word will help us connect more closely to Jesus, the greatest storyteller of all.
