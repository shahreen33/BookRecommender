It was the summer of my life.I’d met the guy of my dreams.Unfortunately, he was the son of my uppity employer—and very much off-limits.But Gavin was a rebel. He knew his mother would disown him if she found out about us; in his eyes, we just had to be careful.He never treated me as his mother did—like hired help.Instead, Gavin put me on a pedestal and loved me harder than I’d ever been loved in my life.What a summer it was. Until it all ended—badly. I was never supposed to see Gavin again.That didn’t stop me from thinking about him every day for ten years.I knew little about his life now, just that he was an entrepreneur living an ocean away.When a twist of fate had me working again in the very place our love affair started a decade earlier, I knew it was only a matter of time before I might see him again. But I wasn’t prepared.What if he hated me?What if he loved someone else now?I wasn’t prepared for all the unknowns.And most of all, I wasn’t prepared for today to be the day he came back.
