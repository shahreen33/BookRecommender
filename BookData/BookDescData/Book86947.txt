My name is Tala Phoenix. I'm a dragon shifter. And I'm on the run.Quick catchup. I can fly. I'm dating a freaking Greek God. Oh, and apparently busting a gang of magic kids out of a creepy school means I'm in charge. Like I need that kind of pressure in my life. I can barely walk and breathe fire at the same time...As if that's not enough, Hera's evicting us from Olympus. We've got one week, and we've nowhere else to go. Except, maybe, the Phoenix clan's stronghold. My family home. The problem?1. They might all be dead.2. It's not like they know who I am anyway.3. Oh, and it's in the Dragon Badlands. Where even the gods fear to tread.It's not exactly a trip to Hawaii. But we don't have a choice. The DSA are hot on my tail, and we need somewhere safe. To hole up, train, and figure out how to survive.Because right now we're down. But we're definitely not out.
