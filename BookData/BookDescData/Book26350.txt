My siblings refer to me as the responsible one. I've had a set plan for my life for as long as I can remember, and everything I've achieved up until now was to help me reach that goal.I was finally where I wanted to be, until a sexy as hell brunette crossed my path. Without even trying, she's made me aware that my life wasn't as complete as I'd once believed.She is the other part of me I didn't know I needed.Will things beyond our control or imagination tear us apart, or give us what we both never realized we needed?
