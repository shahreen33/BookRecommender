Do you know what an endangered species is and why animals become endangered? Who Will Roar If I Go? will introduce you to thirteen animals around the world who have one thing in common: they need your help. With beautiful watercolor illustrations and rhyming verse, each animal is sharing a message with you that you will remember long after reading."The King of the Beasts - that's my claim to fame.I've got a big crown of hair that's called a mane."You will meet many animals in Africa: lion, rhinoceros, and gorilla all have something to tell you."With black-patchy eyes, I'm chubby and cute.I'm a lazy bear who chews bamboo shoots."Next visit snow leopard, elephant and tiger in Asia, quetzal in South America, panda and salamander in China, red -crowned amazon and blue karner butterflies in North America, and the pangolin in Australia. Their message is simple, but very important for you, the stewards of the earth:"We need you to care and let us live free.Or there will be no more wild animals to see."Who Will Roar If I Go? will introduce the basics of endangered species to young children and open up conversations of what we can all do to help.Will you roar before they go?
