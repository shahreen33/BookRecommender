There’s going to be a war.  Between the Broken Academy and my family, the Kyrie. I need to see the capability of the academy.  I’m here to infiltrate.  My every move is calculated. Every new friendship, each love interest. It’s all planned out. I’ve been taught to think of magic as my duty. Not as a gift. But I’m getting derailed. The family I love and trust is starting to betray me. Their operations affecting people that I care about. The pressure has intensified. And I’m left with a choice. With a question about magic. Is it a gift or a duty? The answer to this question will either make me or break me.
