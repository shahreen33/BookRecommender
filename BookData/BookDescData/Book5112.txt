The world beheld the Rapture. The plague on humanity continues. 1.3 million American adults are now ravenous killers. 35 million infected children now hunger for flesh. Shane Nettleton and his band of survivors must continue their struggle trapped on a tug boat adrift in the Gulf of Mexico. "But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day: For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved..." - Mathew 13: 20-22
