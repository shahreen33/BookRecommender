J.R.R. Tolkien's class children's story, published between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.Farmer Giles of Ham did not look like a hero. He was fat and red-bearded and enjoyed a slow, comfortable life. But after inadvertently scaring away a rather deaf and short-sighted giant, Farmer Giles' heroic reputation spread far and wide. Unfortunately for him, when the wily dragon Chrysophylax visited the kingdom, it was Farmer Giles who was called upon to do battle with it...Like The Hobbit and Roverandom, Farmer Giles of Ham was invented by J.R.R. Tolkien at first to entertain his children, then grew and became more elaborate. Its final version is for readers of all ages who enjoy a good story told with wit and imagination.This edition reprints the text first published in 1949, together with its original illustrations by Pauline Baynes, which Tolkien thought to be a perfect accompaniment to his tale. It also includes the earliest written version of the story and Tolkien's notes for a sequel.
