A woman vanishes on a solo hike in California’s Desolation Wilderness and leaves behind a family reeling from the loss of this charismatic, enigmatic wife and mother, who, they come to learn, was very good at keeping secrets. A bold departure from the author of the national bestseller All We Ever Wanted Was Everything.Billie is vibrant—a beautiful, outdoorsy California mom, a far cry from the reckless youth she’d been, but her troubled past seems only to enhance her natural charisma and allure. She and her husband Jonathan have an enviable life - a great house in Berkeley, a lovely, sensitive daughter, friends, nice things. As their daughter Olive reaches adolescence and needs her mom less, Billie throws herself into extreme sports—marathons, scuba diving, rock climbing. These challenges make her feel alive, but one day, on a solo hike in the Desolation Wilderness, she vanishes from the trail—no body, only a hiking boot, is found. Her family is devastated. Jonathan drinks; Olive grows remote. But a year after Billie’s death, Olive starts having waking dreams—hallucinations?—that her mother is still alive. Jonathan worries about Olive’s emotional stability, until he uncovers a secret that sends him on his own quest for the truth—about Billie, their marriage, and the stories we tell ourselves about the people we love.
