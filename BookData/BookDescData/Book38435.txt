An intense, psychologically charged domestic drama, The Return is a brilliant and haunting exploration of the insecurities that lie at the heart of human relationships. When successful businessman Alvan Hervey begins his daily journey back from the city, he has no idea what awaits him at home—for there, on his bedroom table, is a letter from his wife, confessing her ultimate betrayal: she has left him for another man. But no sooner has this awful truth begun to sink in, than Hervey finds himself face to face with his wife as she returns to make one last desperate attempt to save their marriage. With their world in tatters around them, husband and wife are forced to confront the truth. Acclaimed by F.R. Leavis as one of “the very great novelists in the language,” Joseph Conrad is best known for his chilling work Heart of Darkness.
