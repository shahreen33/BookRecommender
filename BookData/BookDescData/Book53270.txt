Trigger  Tess was under the Devil’s watch while I suffered behind bars with my demons…  The ace in my pocket brings power, and the temptation to flip overwhelms me.  I’m playing chicken with the reaper, and it’s only feeding his thirst.  The smell of blood is a drug. It fuels me. Consumes me.  I am lost.  Tess  The Devil stole me, but I refuse to belong to someone else.  I’m a fighter.  I will do whatever it takes to get back to my family.  Treachery and betrayal surround us.  The only way out is to turn the greatest loss into the greatest victory.
