With a new introduction from best‑selling author Ann Patchett, the National Book Award–winning story collection that is one of the great works of twentieth‑century American literature    Eudora Welty’s Collected Stories confirms her place as a contemporary master of short fiction. Welty wrote novels, novellas, and reviews over the course of her long career, but the heart and soul of her literary vision lay with the short story. The forty‑one pieces collected here, written over a period of three decades, include “A Petrified Man,” “Why I Live at the P.O.,” “The Wide Net,” and “The Bride of Innisfallen.”
