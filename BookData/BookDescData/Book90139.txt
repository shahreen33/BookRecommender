Club Vampyre brings together the first three Anita Blake novels, this collection looks at the adventures of the woman vampires call The Executioner.I'm Anita Blake, expert on creatures of the night. Vampires call me The Executioner. What I call them isn't repeatable. Ever since the Supreme Court granted the undead equal rights, most people think vampires are just ordinary folks with fangs. I know better. I carry the scars. . . In my job -- I'm an animator; I raise the dead -- I've seen just about everything. I've dined with shapeshifters, danced with werewolves and been wooed, but not won, by Jean-Claude, the most powerful bloodsucker in St. Louis. When a serial killer started murdering vampires, it was Jean-Claude who wanted me to find the killer. Later a rogue vamp named Alejandro hit town and wanted to make me his human servant. A war of the undead had begun. Over me. I'd have been flattered, if my life weren't at stake.Books in this collection:* Guilty Pleasures (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Bk 1)* The Laughing Corpse (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Bk 2)* Circus of the Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Bk 3)
