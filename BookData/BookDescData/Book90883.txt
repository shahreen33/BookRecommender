An atheist city-slicker unleashed on a medieval holy village...A simpleton village priest's boy who blindly worships and guards a pantheon of Gods and Their traditions...Strange things happen when their worlds collide!This is a tale of that turmoil on a lonely night in a jungle, when the ghosts you never knew till a few hours ago are let loose on the ghosts that you always carried within, unknowingly.Welcome to the unholy clash of beliefs, fears and frailties with unknown Gods and demons. A clash that will test your convictions. A clash that will rabidly claw and unmask your subconscious, leaving you naked and paralyzed in front of your demons - in a climax that is as ambiguous as it is certain...Welcome to the madness of 'Lucifer's Lungi'... where What-You-See-Is-NOT-What-You-Get...-----------------------ABOUT THE AUTHOR:Nitin Sawant has tried to make a living by being a software programmer, engineer, stock market analyst, copywriter, journalist, tele-shopping expert and jewellery designer at various stages in his life. He's travelled far and wide across the world, and has led a nomadic life for past 20 years. This gives a unique perspective to all his tall tales and offers a distinctive colour to his writing.Firstly, he doesn't believe that a good story can be written purely through imagination or by adhering to a set formula. Great stories always come from within, from moments that we've lived and experienced. This tale - 'Lucifer's Lungi' also happens to be an amped up version of what he has experienced himself.Secondly, he doesn't believe in genres and patterns. Real life, which he believes can be stranger than any fiction, can't be classified in any single genre. There's usually a tinge of sadness to every joke he's experienced. And he's always ended up laughing, whenever he's lived through a horror moment, like in the 'Lucifer's Lungi'.
