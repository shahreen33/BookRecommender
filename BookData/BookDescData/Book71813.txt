While Frannie and Stu struggle to find a balance between their personal lives and their public personas, an unholy, unspeakable alliance is born between Harold Lauder and Nadine Cross. It's a date with destiny, orchestrated by the Dark Man, and it could very well mean doom for the Boulder Free Zone. It's time to commune with the spirits of the dead, True Believers, and their message is clear: "You cannot miss what's coming next!" Collecting THE STAND: NO MAN'S LAND #1-5.
