"Liza Wiemer opens doors to the soul that few of us realize even exist. Read this book, explore its methods, and open yourself to the wisdom to which each of us is heir."Rabbi Rami M. Shapiro, author of Wisdom of the Jewish SagesA complete guide for readers of any religion, Extraordinary Guidance  teaches how to contact the spiritual guides that watch over every soul and apply their wisdom for practical results in your everyday life as well as for a richer spiritual life.In the late 1980s, channeling was the popular way to receive spiritual guidance. In the early '90s, angels became accessible. Now we know we can go directly to the source--to the spiritual guides themselves--and Liza Wiemer reveals how everyone can contact his or her own spiritual guides for invaluable life guidance.Extraordinary Guidance explains what spiritual guides are and provides easy and effective step-by-step instructions for connecting with them, including how to get in the right state of mind to talk with these powers that guide us. Through examples and personal anecdotes of her own spiritual guide, Wil, Wiemer shows how the discovery of the wisdom within enables people to make positive changes in their lives and help others to do the same, and, ultimately, to work toward bridging the gap between the spiritual and physical worlds.
