The first rule of business is that you don’t mix it with pleasure. But if you do get involved with your business partner? Try not to knock him up… it goofs up the dividends.  Tired of the playboy lifestyle, Gabe Smythe is ready for change. To start his new life, he’s come to Hollydale with one goal—to reunite with his long-lost brother, Rafe. Along the way, if he happens to meet a sweet omega who’d make a nice little homemaker, even better!  Cody Harper isn’t looking to settle down, and he’s definitely not ever tying himself to anyone. Casual sex and friends with extra-special benefits? Sure! Romance and relationships? Nope. Not gonna happen—especially not with Gabe, his sexy business partner at Nut Juices, the hot new smoothie shop they run together with the help of their quirky employee, Tofer.  Can their friendship and partnership survive an accidental pregnancy? As Cody and Gabe laugh their way from partners… to friends with bennies… to co-parents, they’ll discover that life isn’t always black and white, and sometimes a little compromise comes in handy.  Return to the world of Hollydale with a quirky, holiday romance full of all the fluffy feels and sweet heat that you’d expect from a Hollydale story. This is the tenth book of The Hollydale Omegas series but is absolutely able to be read as a standalone. This is a 34k novel and definitely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.
