Infuriating.And yet I can't seem to keep my panties on for five minutes when we're alone together.He keeps melting them right off.

She drives me crazy sometimes, too. But she's also sweet, loyal, fearless, and so much fun she's making it damn hard not to fall for her.But how to convince a woman who's put me in the emotional no-fly zone that I deserve a place in her heart? Not just her panties...
