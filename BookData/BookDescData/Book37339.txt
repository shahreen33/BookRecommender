In his hometown of Central City, The Flash--a.k.a. Barry Allen--is constantly deflecting the criminal schemes of his Rogue's Gallery. Money hungry, cunning and powerful, these villains have the Scarlet Speedster running at a pace faster than even the world's fastest man is used to. But when Gorilla Grodd and his army descend on Central City, The Flash will have to contend with a threat he's not used to: murderous, ruthless and without principle. With mammoth strength and mind-control powers, Grodd will not stop until he conquers the city with its heroes blood on his hands. Knowing full well he cannot defeat this new foe alone, The Flash will have to turn to his former enemies, the Rogues, if he wants to keep himself and Central City alive. THE FLASH: GORILLA WARFARE is the third hardcover graphic novel from the best-selling creative team of Franics Manapul and Brian Buccellatto. Collects THE FLASH #13-19.
