 My dream of becoming prima ballerina is dead.  Dropped by the Royal Ballet, I return home to my empty house in Cornwall with nothing but ghosts, and memories of a past I am desperate to forget. It takes months of depression before I pull myself out of the bleakness and attempt to start living again.

My name is Rose, and I am their muse.  ***Warning: This is a dark story that contains suicide, self-harm and other topics that may be triggering. Read at your own discretion.***
