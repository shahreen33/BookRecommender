Roxanne Bloom is through with love. Fresh on the heels of a bad break-up, she’s decided to devote all her time to her man-slamming website—and her man-hating dog, Lilith. But this pit-bull-Boxer is so good at unleashing her fury (and her owner’s) that the male victims keep piling up…and now it’s time to get some sensitivity training. Enter Eli Gallagher, one of the best—and hottest—canine experts in town. The more Eli gets to know Roxie, the more he senses that she’s been hurt by men in the past—just like her dog. With a little gentle prodding, and a whole lot of patience, Eli hopes to gain Roxie’s trust and soothe her broken heart. Eli can see that Roxie’s bark is way worse than her bite. But she’s not putting her guard down just yet—even if she is falling deeply, madly, doggedly in love with him...
