First published in 1899, Stalky and Co. is a collection of school stories based on Kipling's own experiences at the United Services College. Kipling himself appears as the central character called Beetle and through him shows how school is a pattern-maker for the experiences of life. The Complete Stalky &amp; Co., first published 30 years later, includes five stories not published in the original edition.
