DI Tracy Collier has a complex case on her hands. An arm has been found, without a body, and on top of having a rapist terrorising the town, she now has a murder—or has the limb been cut off and the woman is still alive, being held captive?  Upon the discovery of a body in the stream, it’s clear someone out there is on the hunt. With a gruesome discovery in a garage, Tracy and her team have their work cut out for them. Then other bodies are discovered, and things get more perplexing by the minute.  To top it off, someone from Tracy’s past arrives to muddy the waters, and Tracy is sent back to The Past, where she finds out what she thought was truth is a lie. When can she put her tragic upbringing to bed? Will it ever go away—or is she destined to always hear the skeleton in her closet rattling?
