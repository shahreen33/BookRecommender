Dashing and devilish Major Kiptyn Llowell is the opposite of reasonable. But when his top secret mission on exotic Hainan Island, China, goes belly up, Kip throws himself on the mercy of the eminently sensible (and irresistibly sexy) DeAnne Lovejoy to hitch a ride to his rendezvous point. But he gets far more than he bargained for? As an officer of the U.S Department of State, DeAnne helps American citizens in need of aid on foreign soil. Yet, when DeAnne sets eyes on Kip’s impressive body, she’s the one who needs rescuing—from her own X-rated thoughts! But before Kip and DeAnne even get the chance to flirt, an enemy platoon storms in, guns blazing. Covers blown and running for their lives, the pair must complete Kip’s mission together. Amidst escalating feelings, they just hope to survive long enough to enjoy this wild ride to a loving future?
