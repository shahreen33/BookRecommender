Channon Beaumont has so much to be grateful for. An amazing Dom (who is also an amazing boyfriend), kinky friends, and people who care for him. What more could he possibly want?  Nothing, he thinks. But when Jack invites a stranger home with them, Channon discovers something about himself he never knew.  New kinks and new desires can't come between him and the man he worships. That's simply not allowed.  As for Jack, his obsession with Channon drives him toward a resolution only he can make happen. All he has to do is recognize it, and take it for himself.
