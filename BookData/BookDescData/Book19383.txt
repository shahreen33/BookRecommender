Poetry. Translated from the German by James Mitchell. Readers of these carefully crafted translations by James Mitchell will profit not only by their economy and clarity of expression, but also by the fact that the same translating technique allows Hölderlin's imagery and remarkable spiritual imagination to shine forth in English. Friedrich Hölderlin was born in Germany in 1770 and studied in Tubingen from 1788 to 1793, where he became friends with fellow-students Hegel and Schelling. Thereafter he wrote some of the most fascinating lyric poetry in the history of German literature. Translator James Mitchell has lived and worked for many years in Germany and San Francisco as a writer, book publisher and college teacher.
