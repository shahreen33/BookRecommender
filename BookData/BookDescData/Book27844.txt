She's completely off limitsIn my eyes—and those of every woman on Temperance Falls—Doctor Josh Hutton is the ultimate catch: single dad, handsome surgeon, and lonely widower all rolled into one. He’s also my boss. I shouldn’t want to take our relationship from professional to personal, but I ache thinking about even one night in his bed.  His control is slippingI know better than to lust after Bailey, but that doesn’t stop me from doing it. She’s my employee, the person who cares for my son when I can’t, which only makes the dirty thoughts I have about her even more inappropriate. But she’s also a beautiful, sexy woman living under my roof, and that temptation is hard to resist. A door left ajar and a breathy moan is all it takes. One night of pushed boundaries, and all my rules go out the window.
