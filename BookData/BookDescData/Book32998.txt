“We all lose, son. Either I’ll be in there tonight, or I’ll end up there as one of them when I’m dead.”When the dead first rose, the world thought they could just kill them. But they only return to their graves with bellies full of flesh and more dead littering the ground. Out of desperation the zombie lottery was born. One night a year, the dead rise, and every adult gets their name entered into the lottery. No matter their ability, health, or status. The winners are herded to cemeteries and only one will come out alive, but all pray for the scientists working around the clock to find the answer before the killing is done.
