To really know and appreciate a country, you must explore it far and wide-not just the tourist spots. That's what William Elliot Griffis believed. After becoming enamored of the Netherlands and its people and history, he endeavored to explore every corner. In The American in Holland (originally published in 1899), he guides a tour through each of the eleven provinces, with an added stop in the court of Queen Wilhelmina. He subtly illustrates the epic poem of the political and social trials and tribulations that shaped the Netherlands by way of showing what is best and most interesting about each province-from tulips to giants' graves to the regal Rhine and all the art and architecture in between. American author, educator, and theologian WILLIAM ELLIOT GRIFFIS (1843-1928) was born in Philadelphia. He is also the author of Welsh Fairy Tales, The Firefly's Lover, The Unmannerly Tiger, Brave Little Holland, and Bonnie Scotland.
