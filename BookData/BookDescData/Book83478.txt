In Quoin Ataraxis, the compelling second installment of the young adult Quest of the Staff and the Sword saga, John's quest continues as he searches for understanding of his purpose. With control of the world's media, Luke is able to convince the world that they are in danger from "the hooded man." Luke will attempt to use his power not only to destroy the hooded man but also to immobilize the people of the world. If Luke goes to extremes, a terrible change will overtake the world--a change that could return the world to the Dark Ages. John must protect the Jedidiah family, along with their friends--and he must inspire them to join him on his quest. In T. K. Kohl's exciting Quoin Ataraxis, Luke's darkness grows in him, and the fate of the world trembles in the balance, but John is ready to establish the foundation of peace, save those who wish to be saved, and assure those around him that all will be well.
