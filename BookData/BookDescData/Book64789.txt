Be careful what you pick up on the side of the road.In the Town of Lasting, summer is typically a time to relax and enjoy the warm weather with family and friends. That was before the arrival of Dale Hawks. He has it all: good looks, great body and a killer smile.Unknown to the mayor’s overachieving son Jeremy Atkins, the amicable hitchhiker he gives a ride to has a horrifying past. His ability to blend in with total strangers is almost supernatural. Jeremy’s girlfriend Susan soon finds that out, as does his secret admirer Olivia and best friend Edward.As the days get hotter, one thing becomes clear: 20- year-old Dale Hawks is much more than a sociable drifter. He’s a mystical manipulator with a plan to bring the community to its knees. The only question is if he can escape his personal demons long enough to carry it out.For Jeremy and the unsuspecting townsfolk, this year will be one they’ll never forget, no matter how hard they try.
