A sweet holiday love story about the magic of synchronicity and fate set at a quaint Vermont inn during the week after Christmas. Emma can't believe her luck when she finds an open pawn shop on Christmas Eve in Manhattan. She's there to sell the beautiful bracelet her ex-boyfriend gave her when a familiar looking watch catches her eye. It's the same engraved watch she gave her college boyfriend, Fletcher, years ago. On a whim, she trades for the watch and wonders at the timing.Practical Emma thinks it's just a coincidence, but her best friend Bronwyn believes it's the magic of synchronicity that caused Emma to find the watch. Fletcher was the one that got away, and somehow Emma never quite moved on.When Bronwyn finds out that Fletcher is in snowy Vermont at a romantic inn for the week, she can't help but give synchronicity a push. She signs Emma up to help the inn keeper as the children's activity coordinator. Emma agrees that a week filled with quaint shops and maple syrup would do her good... and maybe Fate really does have a Christmas gift in store for her. That is until she sees Fletcher with his daughter and fiancï¿½e.Suddenly, the fairytale trip seems doomed to fail... much like the innkeeper's dwindling cashflow. It will take a miracle to save her heart and the inn. And that just might be what Fate has in mind.CHRISTMAS IN VERMONT is a delightful and charming love story about the magic of second chances during the most festive time of year.
