I think it's because death is coming for one of them, or both.All I know is that the present and the past are piling up, and I am here to dig.I am looking for the things that are buried.From bestselling author Jodi Lynn Anderson comes a friendship story bound in snow and starlight, a haunting mystery of love, betrayal, redemption, and the moments that we leave behind.
