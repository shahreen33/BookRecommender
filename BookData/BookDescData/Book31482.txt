A Cold Case Psychic Spin off NovellaMuseum curator, Harrison Kirkpatrick, has been fascinated by the American Revolution since childhood, but never in his wildest dreams did he ever imagine falling in love from afar with a soldier who fought for America’s freedom. Through a series of events too wild to be believed, Harrison is thrown back in time to 1775, mere days before the Battle of Bunker Hill, finding himself at the business end of a musket held by the very man he has been pining for.  Massachusetts Militiaman, Gannon Chalmers, does not know what to make of the strange man he finds wandering around Bunker Hill days before his unit is to engage the British Redcoats. Is this man friend or foe? What he does know is that there is an undeniable attraction growing between them that he must resist at all costs.  As the battle draws closer, so do Gannon and Harrison. Can they deny the passion threatening to explode between them like a powder keg? Or will Gannon’s abundance of caution keep him from giving in to the one man who could lay claim to his heart?  On the brink of a war that will change the history of the world, the pair must decide what price they are willing to pay for freedom, and how much they are willing to sacrifice for love.
