While Zinnia's classmates are celebrating the last day of seventh grade, she's in the vice principal's office, serving detention. Her offense? Harmlessly yarn-bombing a statue of the school mascot.

Zinnia’s day surely can't get any worse . . . until a colony of honeybees inhabits her hive-like hair!
