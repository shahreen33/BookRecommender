Mark Beckett is the most annoying, patronizing, arrogant jerk on the face of the earth. So, naturally, I can’t get the damn man out of my head.Fiona: Like the old saying goes, I’m a jill of all trades but a master of none. What I lack in skill, however, I make up for in enthusiasm—something certain people (ahem) find irritating. But I have my reasons for living my life the way I do, for diving into one project after another and trying to make a difference. And if Mark Beckett doesn’t like it, he knows where to find the door. I don’t need his approval … or his panty-melting kisses.Mark: I enjoy the simple things in life: a job well done, a cold beer, a hot woman … you get the idea. But there’s nothing simple about the mess I just found myself in. The last thing I need is a pint-sized princess sticking her nose in my business and pushing every damn one of my buttons like it’s her job. But Fiona Pierce may be the only one with the tools to solve my problems—and the power to change everything.**Winner of the 2017 National Indie Excellence Award for Romantic Comedy**Winner of the 2017 Readers’ Favorite Silver Medal for Romantic ComedyIf Vi Keeland and Kristen Proby wrote a book with your snarky best friend, it would be a lot like The Spark … just sayin'Get your copy of The Spark today and see what everyone’s been talking about!PLEASE NOTE: This product is a republication of the 2016 version of THE SPARK.
