Braden WilsonI've spent more time in captivity in the last six months than I have out of it. Thankfully, an injury from when I was young makes me less valuable to the people who might want to use me as breeding stock, so I've managed to escape being claimed. When a gorgeous but gruff man who specializes in interrogation shows up to save me, I know there is something about him that makes him special to me, but he's reading hot and cold, and I can't figure him out. He thinks he's too rough around the edges for me, but nobody has ever done for me what he does or treated me like I was worth anything. If only I could make him feel as worthy as he makes me.Meyers AndrewsSomeone doesn't enjoy the job I have so much unless they are just as messed up as the people they interrogate. I might not think hurting innocent people is okay, but I have very little remorse about hurting those who have, and I've never felt bad about my jobâ€¦ until I meet my mate, a man who has been neglected practically his whole life but somehow manages to keep from getting bitter. He's beautiful and strong both inside and out, and I would give anything to be the man he deserves, but I don't think I have that kind of goodness in me, and I'm terrified of tainting something so precious with my darkness. I need to walk away for his own good, but I don't know if I'm strong enough.Warning: Mpreg elements! Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses::
