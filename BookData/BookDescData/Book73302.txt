"If Grisham wrote political thrillers, they'd feel like this!" The first woman U.S. President is impeached in an international conspiracy to destroy her. She’s the target of an assassination attempt to kill her. She’s a U.S.-born Mexican-American whose family background is both historic and criminal. She’s what Kirkus Reviews calls “An enthralling protagonist at the heart of a gripping tale.” Best selling author Lawrence De Maria says, “It wasn't that long ago when a plot like this would seem far-fetched. No more!” This thriller skims the surface between fiction and reality, told by an author who spent decades immersed in the tense and turbulent world of high stakes politics. The Latina President is suspenseful, topical, important. And it’s one hell of a good read.
