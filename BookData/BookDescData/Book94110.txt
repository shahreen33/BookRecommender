Appalachian author and activist Harry Caudill published the first edition of his landmark bestseller, Night Comes to the Cumberlands, in 1963 — fifty years ago this year. He dedicated the book, "With affection and respect to my wife, Anne, without whose assistance and insistence it would never have been written and to the Kentucky coalminers whose trials and tragedies are its central theme."Anne Frye first met Harry Caudill in 1945. She was a student at the University of Kentucky at that time, and Harry had just returned to UK after being wounded in World War II. After a brief courtship, they became engaged, then married in 1946. It was a perfect match and, as history has proven, a perfect partnership.After the Caudills moved to Whitesburg, Kentucky — Harry's hometown — Harry practiced law and, with Anne's assistance, wrote 10 books. Night Comes to the Cumberlands attracted world-wide attention when it was published. Thousands of visitors, including government officials, journalists, members of the media, historians, volunteers and curious individuals from all over the world traveled to Appalachia to see what "night" had wrought. Many of those visitors actually stayed in the Caudills' home — and while they were there, they swapped stories with their hosts.Harry was a renowned storyteller, and so is Anne.
