Seven years.  Seven damn years of wondering whether the woman was still alive whether she d spent the last two thousand five hundred fifty five days wondering if he was still alive.  Wondering whether that night was as burned into her memory as it was his.  Seven years having his heart tethered to Addison and now she s back. With even more reasons to run than she d had then.  Only this time, Caine isn t letting the gorgeous little flight risk out of his sight.  Regardless of how noble her reasons may be. EVERY NIGHT WITHOUT YOU (Bk 2) takes place seven years after BEFORE THAT NIGHT (Bk 1), and is the conclusion of Caine &amp; Addison s story of love, sacrifice, and the lengths one will run and chase when their past threatens their future."
