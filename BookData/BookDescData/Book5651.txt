Two season tickets. One genius idea. Zero interest in a relationship.  The plan is simple: a brand new, hot, preferably funny, definitely single male will fill one of those seats for every Bears game at Soldier Field. And I’ll fill the other.  I can’t think of a better way to use the season passes I’d bought for my ex-husband. I am a woman of plans, and this one’s foolproof.  Until Zach Bowen offers to be my practice round.  He’s infuriating. Presumptuous and overbearing. And absolutely, undeniably gorgeous. Any woman with a heartbeat would be attracted to him, and mine picks up speed every time he speaks.  But as I said, I’m a woman of plans — and I’m not backing down on this one.  One night. One game. And then, his time’s up.  He can try to change the rules, but here’s the truth: he can’t win if he’s playing the wrong game.   The Wrong Game is a stand-alone, angsty, enemies-to-lovers sports romance.
