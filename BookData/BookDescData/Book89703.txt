The Avengers are dead — long live the Avengers! Earth's Mightiest Heroes — Captain America, Thor, Vision and Iron Man — are living separate lives, not tied to any team. But when a threat from beyond the stars targets our world, fate draws them together again, alongside a group of young adventurers who will reinvigorate the Avengers like never before! Welcome to the big leagues, Nova, Ms. Marvel and Miles "Spider-Man" Morales! But as Warbringer makes good on his name, the reassembled Avengers struggle to put their differences aside. One among them may find their membership short-lived, but two are definitely getting along — when passions flare between Captain America and Thor, it leads to Earth's Mightiest Kiss! But who is the familiar villain pulling the Avengers' strings? Collecting: All-New, All-Different Avengers 1-6 &amp; material from Avengers 0, FCBD 2015
