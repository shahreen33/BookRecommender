From New York Times Bestseller, Corinne Michaels, comes a new Standalone Contemporary Romance.I have two rules in life:1. No relationships, falling in love or attachments.2. No sleeping with clients of my interior design firm.Since the last guy turned out to be married, they’ve been easy to follow.Until him.Callum Huxley is a ridiculously sexy Brit, and the connection we have the moment our eyes lock scares the ever-loving hell out of me. Thank God I came to my senses before going back to his hotel where I would’ve ended up naked, panting, and unable to forget him.Thinking I walked away from that night unscathed was stupid. Sure enough, at the biggest meeting of my career waits the CEO of Dovetail Enterprises—him. It might be the most embarrassing moment of my professional life. And breaking my no-client rule might just be the hottest moment of my personal life.Learning to trust has never felt so good, but falling has never hurt so bad.
