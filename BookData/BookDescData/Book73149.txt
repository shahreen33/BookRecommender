With a Foreword written by HackerOne Co-Founders Michiel Prins and Jobert Abma, Web Hacking 101 is about the ethical exploration of software for security issues but learning to hack isn't always easy. With few exceptions, existing books are overly technical, only dedicate a single chapter to website vulnerabilities or don't include any real world examples. This book is different.Using publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, Web Hacking 101 explains common web vulnerabilities and will show you how to start finding vulnerabilities and collecting bounties. With over 30 examples, the book covers topics like:HTML InjectionCross site scripting (XSS)Cross site request forgery (CSRF)Open RedirectsRemote Code Execution (RCE)Application Logicand more...Each example includes a classification of the attack, a report link, the bounty paid, easy to understand description and key takeaways. After reading this book, your eyes will be opened to the wide array of vulnerabilities that exist and you'll likely never look at a website or API the same way.
