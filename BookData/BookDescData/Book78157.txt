When Ella attends a s√©ance for a report in her local paper, she gets sucked into the world of Mysterius (the Unfathomable), a magician who's more than just a performer of flashy tricks. Sensing Ella is the perfect person to play the role of his assistant, Delfi (the latest in a long line), Mysterius hires her. Their cases drag them deep into the modern world of magic, at least one pocket dimension, and the wicker effigy about to be set alight at a Burning-Man-esque festival. Acclaimed creators Jeff Parker (X-Men: The First Class, Agents of Atlas) and Tom Fowler (GREEN ARROW, CAPER) make their WildStorm debut with this exciting, offbeat new miniseries!
