I was never meant to have a happily ever after.It was a fate I accepted a long time ago.Before he came for me, taking away who I am, I needed to escape.Just for one night.One man turned my entire world upside down.I should have walked away, but something about him wouldn’t let me.Now I’m lying to him.He’s going to find out the truth, or my life will catch up to me.Either way, I lose him.It’s a thought I can’t bear.People have always told me love is amazing and powerful.They’re wrong.It makes you weak…exposing your vulnerabilities…making you easy prey.Love is heinous.
