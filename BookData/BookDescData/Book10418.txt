His name was Joshua Carter. Now it's whatever she wants it to be. She is a Deliverer. She lures young men and delivers them to be sold. She delivers the strikes that enforce their obedience. She delivers the sexual training that determines their purchase price. As long as she delivers, the arrangement that protects her family will hold. Delivering is all she knows. The one thing she can't deliver is a captive from slavery. Until him. And her stubborn slave thinks he can deliver her...from herself.DELIVER series (HEAs with no cliffhangers - must be read in order):Deliver #1Vanquish #2Disclaim #3Devastate #4Take #5Manipulate #6Unshackle #7Dominate #8Complicate #9
