"We're off to Cherry-Tree Farm! We're going to go wild!" the children shout as their train pulls out of London.So of course when Uncle Tim tells them about Tammylan, the wild man who lives out of doors and knows all about the animals and birds, they decide to look for him. Once they meet him all sorts of wonderful things start to happen, for Tammylan introduces the children to his animal friends, and soon the ways of badgers and squirrels, rabbits and frogs, moles, otters and snakes are familiar to them, and London seems far away and unreal.
