In 1997, Terry Brooks reinvented the fantasy genre with Running with the Demon, a dark contemporary urban fantasy. Now he returns to that Word and Void mythos with a novella sure to delight his readers and a story as powerful as that previous trilogy.  Sinnissippi Park, in Hopewell, Illinois, has long been a place of magic.  Jack McCall learned this at a young age when confronted with a deadly childhood disease. He overcame that threat with aid from the unlikeliest of companions -- the woodland creature Pick and his trusted owl Daniel -- and the magic that existed within his own heart.  Now grown, Jack has graduated from college, leaving behind that terrible time and having never witnessed magic again. That is about to change. Lacking direction in life, he is summoned by the Lady, who recruits men and women to the service of the Word. For she is in dire need of Jack's unique history to help preserve the world's future -- a service that will be needed only once but on which all things hinge.
