A NEW STANDALONE Title from Samantha Lind in her Lyrics and Love Series! NICKBeautiful, broken, and abandoned.The second I see her in my bar,With cover charge stamps plastering her hands,I know what I have to do.Take her home,Get her into bed,Where I know she'll be safe. I do exactly that.Leaving her keys and my number,As I lock the door behind me. She deserves more,So much more.ASHLEYShattered, vulnerable, and alone,Trapped in a lifetime of hurt, Trying to break the cycle.But he came in,Saved me,From myself,From my circumstances.Showing me compassion,And respect.Proving I am so much more.More than just a pathetic drunk girl.
