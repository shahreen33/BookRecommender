  Nothing has stopped the Greshian Empire's expanse, but all hope isn't lost... 
  The illusion of peace shrouds a hidden darkness. Just as the crew of the Replicade are getting settled on a seemingly tranquil world, they encounter a young girl with special abilities—and she’s being hunted by a secret, powerful organization that will stop at nothing to have her.   When Anki and Brendle intervene to help the girl, they are caught in the organization’s crosshairs. The crew must make a decision: give into the looming threat of the organization, or die fighting to protect her.   Meanwhile, Lieutenant Commander Ilium Gyl has taken command of a Greshian scout ship. A breach in protocol raises questions of his loyalty to the Greshian Empire, leading to a power struggle as a rebellion sparks in a distant sector of the Alorian Galaxy.
