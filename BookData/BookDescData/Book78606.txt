Cut off from natural resources, they only have one hope for survival.Us.The tsunami riders.Risks high and survival rates low, we ride at the peak of a mountain of water at five hundred miles an hour and love it. The rag-tag crew of the Ištar and I never miss a wave or lose a shipment container.But the ocean isn’t the only bitch we have to contend with.Admiral Parker wants to monopolize the trade routes with her state-of-the-art schooners, and she’s not opposed to taking out riders who won’t yield the wave. If she wins, all of the settlements in North America will live or starve at her say so.We’re not going to let that happen.Surf’s up, and as all tsunami riders know: you gotta catch the wave or die.This book contains polyamory (one woman in a relationship with two men), non-explicit sex, and a lot of cussing.
