Librarian by day and haunted tour guide by night. Rip, as her friends call her, discovers books that possibly contain secret messages. When a young girl is murdered, Rip has to put her sleuthing skills to the test.  With the help of part-time paranormal investigator and full-time handsome police officer Brannon Landon, they must work together to solve this potentially paranormal related crime. Brannon and Rip can't let an ex-wife, dark entities, stalkers, or defaced library books stand in their way.
