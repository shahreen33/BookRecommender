Four hunky, supernatural plumbers.One reluctant, slightly drunk human.A match made in heaven… or in the bathroom, rather.My name is Arizona Smoke, and I’m the proud owner of a house haunted by my dead Gram, best friend to a cocktail dress loving werewolf, and apparent soul mate to four plumbers who also happen to be elemental dragons. Besides rippling pectorals, tattoos, and… uh, nice, long pipes, the guys also have control of the elements.Supernatural law (whoever heard of such a thing anyway?) dictates that since I stumbled upon the guys in their alternate forms, I have to marry them. All four of them. Oh, and apparently one lousy (okay, awesome) night of sex means that I’m an elemental, too — and no amount of magical penicillin can cure this disease.All I wanted was hot running water and toilets that flushed, but now I’m dealing with monsters lurking in the sewers, supernatural politics, and four penniless (but totally hot) plumbers living in my crumbling old Victorian.I’m Ari Smoke, wine aficionado, ex-barista, and a girl who is completely out of her element.Having four hot husbands is nice… but the death threats, not so much.
