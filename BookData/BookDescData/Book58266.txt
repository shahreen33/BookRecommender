Archie Andrews and the gang have seen it all since the characters made their comics debut in 1941, and this fall they're going back to their roots in a tale set in Riverdale during World War II.Written by comics legend Mark Waid (Archie, Captain America) with longtime collaborators co-writer Brian Augustyn (The Flash, JLA) and artist Peter Krause (Superman), Archie: 1941 finds Riverdale dealing with the impact of the impending conflict on the small town and in the personal lives of Archie, Betty, Veronica, Jughead, and Reggie. The story will allow fans a chance to see the real-world consequences and drama of the war through the eyes of some familiar faces, but with the humor, heart, milkshakes, and dates that come with any Riverdale tale.
