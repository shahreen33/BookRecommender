It’s a story as old as time when an ancient immortal falls in love with a human. Except this time, there’s a hitch: our “hero” is a vampire and he’s fallen in love with a vegan. Let us count all the ways this could go wrong… We begin our tale in Napa, California. Land of sun, wine and relaxation. The perfect setting for our romantic disaster. Sebastian Nod is elegance and control personified. He may be the bearer of a biblical curse and a monster but he refuses to act like one. Sebastian finds himself tempted in fresh and torturous ways after he agrees to help a gorgeous young chef but he’s determined to guard his heart. He’s been around long enough to have learned that a romance between a vampire and a human can only end in heartbreak. All Sebastian has to do is pretend that he’s a vegan and keep his hands and lips off his new personal chef. And that brings us to Jasper Abel. Bright, young and talented, he’s fled an abusive boyfriend in L.A. for a dream job in Napa. Unfortunately, things go wrong as soon as he arrives and Jasper is forced to accept help from the beguiling and mysterious Mr. Nod. Jasper is determined to be the master of his own fate, but fate has a very wicked sense of humor. He quickly realizes that something is very off about Sebastian Nod, but Jasper can’t help himself, the man is as deliciously tempting as he is befuddling. It’s a dangerous and intoxicating concoction of coconut water, yoga, vegetable-based deception, a cruel curse and just a sprinkle of capricious fate. *This is a "happy for now" romance. Crave is the first book in the Curse of Cain series and just the beginning of Sebastian and Jasper's love story.*
