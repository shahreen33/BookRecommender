This is the 2nd episode in the first season of Royally Yours, a 6-episode serial from Serial Box. This episode written by Megan Frampton.Becca is a huge fan of the royal family. She's come all the way from Minnesota for the big day. Not even a pessimistic (if handsome) Scot is going to convince her that romance isn’t real and she’s going to prove it. After a whirlwind tour of London's most romantic spots she may have succeeded in melting his heart but their one-day romance is at an end. Or is it… One day. Five couples. The most anticipated wedding in the world.But this story’s not about the bride and groom, the dukes and duchesses, this story is about the palace maid with a heart of gold, the milliner who dreams of seeing her designs adorn the pews, the American bodyguard who learns some British charm, the paparazzo after that one great shot, and the ordinary girl who dreams of being a princess.Rumors of a missing bride threaten to ruin the day, but nothing can stop the romance running rampant on the streets of London the day before the royal wedding.
