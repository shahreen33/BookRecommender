Alec is a brilliant and insightful romp through Eddie Campbell's own life, and it represents one of the best -- and first! -- works in the autobiographical-comics gegenre. In it, we witness Eddie's progression from beer to wine, or to put it more accurately, his inevitable maturation through time. Whether it's tales of his early pub-crawlin' days, or glimpses into his current private life with wifey and kids, there are truths here that transcend the factual and paint a picture of the way life should be. This collection -- numbered at 51 in The Comics Journal's top comics of the century -- has been much sought after by collectors of the serious graphic novel as well as r readers new to the idea of comics.
