I was one of the lucky ones.  I found my soulmate back in high school, when my next door neighbor wrote me a love note that changed my life -- a love note that promised me "always."

The only problem? He's not marrying me.  NOTE: This is a 20K SHORT STORY that was first available as part of a promotional giveaway. No new content has been added.
