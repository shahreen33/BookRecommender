It happened in stages.⁣My father left.⁣My twin sister died of an incurable autoimmune disease.⁣My mother started breaking down.⁣Then I was diagnosed with the very thing that took my other half from me.⁣That was when I realized Mama’s eyes turned gold when she cried.⁣So I moved in with my father and his new family—new wife, new son, new stepbrother.⁣Kaiden Monroe made me feel normal.⁣Hated. Cared for. Loathed. And … loved.⁣Somewhere along the way, I’d found solace in the boy with brooding eyes.⁣But everything happens in stages.⁣And nothing good ever lasts.⁣
