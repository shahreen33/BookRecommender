Excerpt from Illusions and Realities of the WarWe are about to enter a phase of existence so new, so strange, so unlike, so fantastically paradox ical, so extravagantly unhistorical, so ironically be Wildering, that it is hardly possible to bring home to the minds of the people anything like an ade quate sense of the situation. The awakening will be more bewildering than that of optimistic France in 1870. Millions will rub their eyes and ask questions no one will have the time to answer. Authority will dominate both the masses and the classes, and under the new regime a duke will have no more inï¬‚uence than a smart soldier of the ranks. The question will be not 'who are you?' but 'what do you know?' A few iron-willed men will assume control, and their judgment will be come law. The new dispensation will be a forcing time, not only for grains and fruits, but for individuals.About the PublisherForgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.
