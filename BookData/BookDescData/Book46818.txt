On June 6, 2015, inmates Richard Matt and David Sweat escaped from New York Stateâ€™s largest maximum security prison, Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora. The media became instantly obsessed with the story: two convicted murderers sliced their way through the brick and steel wall of their cells, meandered through a maze of tunnels, popped out of a manhole, and walked off into the night. Only a handful of inmates had successfully broken out of Clinton since the facility opened in 1845, and not many have made the attempt. Barbed wire, concrete walls, and the wilderness of the Adirondacks all serve as physical and psychological barriers to freedom. The seemingly impossible Shawshank-esque escape had the makings of a Hollywood film, and the public hung on to every twist and turn in the developing plot. After nearly three weeks on the run, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent Christopher Voss shot and killed Matt June 26, 2015. Two days later New York State Police Sgt. Jay Cook shot Sweat twice in the back. He survived. While we have come to learn how Matt and Sweat pulled off perhaps the most elaborate modern day prison break, no reporter, except Chelsia Rose Marcius, has talked directly to Sweat to ask perhaps the most important question in the case: Why?
