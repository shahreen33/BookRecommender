Two strangers in Paris ...One passionate, earth-shattering kiss. He was the artist upstairs with the tantalizing smile and laughing eyes.He was the devil inviting me to sin, seducing me to dance in the bright moonlight.He was desire and need.When he touched me, my body sang. My soul came alive.But I belonged to another man, and he didn't want to let me go.
