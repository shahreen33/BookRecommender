Previous works on the medieval cavalry arm have generally been confined to the battle record of the Western heavy cavalry. This new book examines the entire world of the medieval warhorse, how the animals were bred, trained and doctored, as well as their use in combat.Mounted warriors of all classes are covered, both in Europe and among the Persians, Arabs, Turks and Mongols. The numerous illustrations depict the horse as represented in medieval manuscripts and sculptures, saddles, bridles and spurs, and a collection of photographs showing modern horses of surviving medieval breeds.Hyland offers extensive coverage of medieval horses at war in both East and West, including ground-breaking research on the use of the horse by the Anglo-Saxons. Her text is supported by a glossary of equestrian and veterinary terms, comprehensive bibliography, and index of horse-related subjects, making for a unique blend of historical scholarship and professional equestrian expertise.
