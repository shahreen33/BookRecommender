St. Kleio Academy is a very exclusive school. To enroll, a student must be the clone of a famous historical figure. Wolfgang Mozart, Queen Elizabeth, Sigmund Freud, Marie Curie, Adolf Hitler—with such a combustible student body, it's only a matter of time before the campus explodes!IKKYU SOJUN (1394–1481)A Buddhist monk of the Rinzai school in the middle Muromachi period, Sojun was rumored to be the illegitimate son of Emperor Go-Komatsu. After leaving home in 1399 to enter the Ankoku-ji temple, in 1410 he became the student of an abbot called Ken'o at Saikin-ji temple. There he was given the name "Sojun." He was known for his poetry, comical tanka poems, calligraphic works, and eccentricities. Many stories of Sojun’s legendary wit were composed after his death.
