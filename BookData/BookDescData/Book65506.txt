Featuring beautifully illustrated portraits, Pocket Queer Wisdom is a tribute to some of the most inspirational people of all time. LGBTQIA+ people are some of the coolest in history – legendary figures such as Freddie Mercury, Virginia Woolf, Laverne Cox, Harvey Milk, and Audre Lorde have made an unforgettable impact. Queer subculture has had an enormous influence on style, music, art, and literature – the queer community were the first to vogue, throw shade and say YAS to life before it hit the mainstream. This little book brings you their best pearls of wisdom in your back pocket.
