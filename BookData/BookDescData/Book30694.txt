Bailey Ruth loves to return to earth as an emissary from Heaven's Department of Good Intentions. Problem is, she's a bit of a loose cannon as far as ghosts go - forgetting to remain invisible, alarming earthly creatures - so she's far from the top of department head Wiggins's go-to list for assignments. That's why she's surprised when the Heaven-sent Rescue Express drops her off at a frame house on the outskirts of her old hometown, Adelaide, Oklahoma, where a young man is playing the drums. When a window cracks and a rifle barrel is thrust inside, only Bailey Ruth's hasty intervention saves Nick Magruder from taking a bullet. When she materializes to reassure him, she finds she can't go back to vanishing. What gives?
