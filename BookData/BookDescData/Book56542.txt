I am the queen of my world, owning the dark nights.He is the king of his world, ruling with a firm hand. Unknowingly, we both fight for our freedom.He needs the freedom to breathe, whereas I fight for my freedom to live.Three worlds collide:•	Mine•	His•	OursThey smashed together, obliterating the last little bit of morality I had. He will never forgive me because I will never give him the chance. Secrets have been buried. Lies have been told. Betrayal is at the highest degree.My real name is Jessica Winthrop, A.K.A. The Queen of Hearts. I am an underground poker player. I don’t play in the comfortable basements of family homes with the "good ‘ol boys" from around the neighborhood. No, I play in the depth of dark basements against men that will slit my throat at the turn of a card or the drop of a chip.Since the tender age of four, my decisions were made by my mentor, my father, that is, until he became my adversary. His decision making came to a screeching halt when I turned seventeen. Three years later, I had to make some of the toughest decisions I’ve ever had to make, but I made them, and I’ve stuck by them. Six years later, those same decisions are now coming back to haunt me.
