In a town where spirits dwell, one will rise. Headless Horseman? Meet the Twenty-First Century. My name is Kat Aleson. My dad named me after Katrina - if you've heard the Legend of Sleepy Hollow, you know the one. I didn't know my dad well, because after he and my mom divorced, I only spent my summers in Sleepy Hollow. But when I get news that my dad is dead, I have to go back. Sleepy Hollow hasn't changed. Its people still believe in the legends, and especially the one about crossing that particular bridge. My childhood friend, Bones, is all grown up. The town hero, all muscles and dimples. My childhood crush that I thought was gone? Not so gone after all. And let's not even talk about Crane, the strange, rich eccentric who was working with my dad until he died. I'm drawn to them both, almost like fate wants a replay of the legend. Kat torn between her childhood friend and the new man in her life. The only problem is that there's another part of the equation, and he's the most dangerous of them all. The spirits want me, and soon I learn they'll do anything to have me. I'm the key to this whole thing. Sleepy Hollow will never be the same. The Cursed Hollow is the first part of a RH/why choose duology, drawing inspiration from the Legend of Sleepy Hollow.
