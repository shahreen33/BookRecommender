Vincent likes nothing more than rootling round second-hand shops in search of the interesting and unusual. Items that are lost and forgotten.Why not? He needs the diversion. Time on his hands and money to burn. His life is affluent and empty. Little on the horizon and memories tinged bittersweet.That’s all about to change. He’s about to find something that is perhaps better left unfound.Call Drops is a darkly swirling mix of horror and mystery that will stay with you long after the reading is done. It’ll maybe make you think twice about impulse buying, those moments when you simply must have something, even though you don’t need it.It might cause you to look again at the apparently mundane and everyday ...and possibly, just possibly, wonder at what twisted marvels lurk within your mobile phone.Call Drops is a short (ish) horror story, the first in a series of sinister tales from the Dead Boxes Archive.Some objects are scary things. Dead Boxes definitely fall into that category. They can be easily overlooked. They’re ordinary on the surface. At first glance anyway.If you look a little closer, you’ll see something unique.You could have one and not know it.Be careful.They hold miracle and mystery. Horror and salvation.None are the same. Except in one regard.You don’t need one.You might think you do, but you really don’t.Believe me.
