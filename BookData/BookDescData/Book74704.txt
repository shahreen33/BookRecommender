Reka Simonsen at S&amp;S/Atheneum bought at auction Calla Devlin's YA debut My Body Was Made for This, the story of three sisters who travel with their mother to Mexico so she can receive alternative treatments for her leukemia, while remaining unaware that an illness far more insidious than cancer poisons their home. Publication is scheduled for fall 2016; Faye Bender at Faye Bender Literary oversaw the six-figure deal for world rights.
