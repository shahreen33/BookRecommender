 Meet—or should I say meat—Porter Duke. He serves up a large portion of big beef all alone, but he doesn't want to claim Jillian Murphy by himself. Liam Hogan has what it takes to satisfy the hungriest appetite—and their woman is insatiable.  When Jill's life is in danger, should she go to the sexy DA and new sheriff who have stolen her heart? Or should she protect her men from the one thing that could destroy them—herself?  Remember: With a Vanessa Vale book, one cowboy is never enough. In this smokin' hot series, each heroine gets an extra helping (or two) of Grade-A Beefcake.
