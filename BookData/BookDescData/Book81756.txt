When eleven-year-old Eva is sent to stay with her great-aunt Rose for the summer, she can think of a thousand reasons why she does not want to be there. But as the summer progresses, she discovers that Great-Aunt Rose had learned some things about life that have made her the happiest person Eva has ever known.The story of Eva's discovery is contained in President Dieter F. Uchtdorf's insightful parable originally delivered at the October 2015 general women's session of general conference. With charming full-color illustrations by fine artist Salvador Alvarez (the creator of Joy in the Journey, the pioneer-girl painting referred to by President Uchtdorf), this modern-day parable will teach and uplift women of all ages and life situations.
