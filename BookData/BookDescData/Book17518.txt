The castle is cursed. The servants are losing their humanity and memory. Crow, a young man surprisingly resistant to the curse, is their only connection to the outside world, observing as a bird. Helene is the latest girl obtained for breaking the spell. Her belligerent brother, Roi, is being held hostage to keep her obedient. When Crow is assigned to help care and keep watch of the brother, he regards it as a sort of punishment… with the exception that he finds Roi quite pleasing to look at. Initially keen to make the other miserable, prisoner and servant reluctantly align to seek an alternative way to break the spell. But this is no simple task with time running short, increasing abuse from the senior staff, and so few to be trusted. Furthermore, Roi’s own interests in Crow grow increasingly apparent, and Crow has no idea how to handle this zealous man. This mature story features a slight twist and different perspective on a classic fairy tale.
