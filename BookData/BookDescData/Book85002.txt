Peter and his Aunt May have perhaps the most important conversation of Peter's life. It's a gut-wrenching, emotional roller coaster you'll never forget. And Spider-Man is on the call when there is a huge explosion in the side of the Triskelion - the side housing superhuman criminals. From the acrid smoke emerges a man seething with vengeance - a man who wants Peter Parker dead! That man is Norman Osborn, the Green Goblin! And for the web-spinner, things are about to get out of control! The artistic baton is passed from longtime penciler Mark Bagley to stunning new ongoing artist Stuart Immonen, of Ultimate X-Men and Ultimate Fantastic Four fame!Collecting: Ultimate Spider-Man 112-117
