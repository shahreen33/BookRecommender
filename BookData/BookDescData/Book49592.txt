My name is Jack Steen.  That name shouldn’t mean anything to you. Unless you’re about to die. And then I’m your bloody guardian angel.  I work as a night nurse in hospital for the criminally insane.   THIS STORY: Ken and Barbie. He was a small town country boy. She was a city girl with a thirst for adventure. Thirteen deaths later they were finally caught. Nicknamed The Babysitter Killers, they were known for luring unsuspecting girls and destroying their lives. Ken had one final story to tell. His deathbed confession is about their first murder - the one know one knew about.  Until now.  If you read any of the other confessions, then you’ll know what to expect.  You picked up this book because of the title, right? Deathbed Confessions of the Criminally Insane. That’s exactly what you’re about to read.   My name is the only real name you’ll find in this book.  I won’t tell you which hospital I work at.  I won’t tell you the names of those dying. But I won’t lie to you. You’ll read exactly what I’m told.   If you’re smart, if you’re deranged enough to read between the lines, you’ll know who is telling the story. These sadistic bastards could be playing their final game with me by messing with my head.  Now, maybe they're messing with yours too.
