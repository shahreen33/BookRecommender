When Laney Murphy walks into Muldoon's Pub in San Francisco, she has no idea that her life is about to change forever. The Muldoon family's offer of a job and a place to stay seems just too good to be true. And once she meets Sean Muldoon, the suspicious and distrustful son of the pub owners, she knows she was right - he clearly detests her. Sean is on the fast track as a bodyguard with Woo Security and he isn't going to allow some grifter to get in his way or to mess with his family. But he soon discovers that Laney is not all sharp tongue and sarcasm, and he finds himself wanting to kiss her more than deck her. But Laney's past comes back to haunt her and she soon must put her life on the line to save Sean and the family she has come to love.
