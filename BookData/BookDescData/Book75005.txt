Rylynn Ember to a flame, our pain started a passion fire that I couldn’t burn out. I wanted to be his light in the dark. He needed me. I would give him everything I had to give.  Crow I had seen a lot in my life. Felt even more. Nothing touched this.  Every time I had something good, life had this way of taking it from me. Could she be different?  Only with a passion burning so hot I didn’t know if life would allow me to handle the flame.  We were connected in pain, fueled in fire, and we could only hope neither of us would come out of this … scorched and scarred.   We were Ravage MC. Rebellion Chapter. Ride free.
