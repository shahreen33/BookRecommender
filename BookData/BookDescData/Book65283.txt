A Lady touched by scandal, a wealthy merchant, a misunderstanding, a madman’s threat, a surprise ennoblement, an enduring love. ***FREE ON KINDLE UNLIMITED*** Lady Serafine Parkington, her family disgraced by scandal, has found new hope in a successful business venture, and perhaps love, as well. She may never be able to go about amongst the ton again, but for love, she can accept that. Mr Raphael Morton, a wealthy successful merchant, doubts that he is worthy of Lady Serafine – but he cannot deny that his attraction to her is growing. When his hopes are destroyed, and his business takes him overseas for months, his enemies take action.  Can past scandal be overcome? Can devastating hurt be forgiven? Can a merchant raised to the nobility ever be accepted by the ton? Will the actions of a madman destroy a family, or make it closer? Will the challenges they face bring Lady Serafine and Mr Morton together, or tear them apart forever?
