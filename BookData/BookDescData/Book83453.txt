Pick Your Poison builds on the first two novels of the series, Drunk on Peace and Quiet and Hung Over with Grandma, but all the reader really needs to know is Stella and Jonas are middle aged newlyweds who are plagued by Stella’s troubled brother Timmy Lee.  In this sequel, Stella and Jonas face a new obstacle, a huge unwanted natural gas pipeline crossing their mountain farm. At the same time, her brother, a suspected murderer, is pretending to be a preacher at a sunny beach town in South Carolina and is targeting a wealthy woman who lives in a nursing home there. The two plots intersect in a conclusion that features Stella’s usual pragmatic decision-making. She ‘picks her poison’ in a way that may the reader may not expect.
