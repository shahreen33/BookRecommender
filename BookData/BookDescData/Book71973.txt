This timechart is based on an original Victorian Wall chart, published in 1890. It follows the entire history of mankind and shows what was happening concurrently right around the world with illustrations of many major events, discoveries and prominent people. The section from beginning of time to 70 AD follows the chronology of Archbishop of Canterbury, James Ussher (1581-1656).While maintaining the Victorian design, the chart has been updated and extended so that the time stream continues into the twentieth century, right up to the present day. There are new maps, charts, and lots of fascinating facts and figures. A "HOW TO USE THE CHART" graphic on the inside cover details the symbolism, fonts and coloring used throughout the chart. Moreover, on the reverse of the timechart there is a vast store of charts and extra information on family trees, and different nations' rulers and dynasties, much of it in time line form. These panels include: China, Japan, Russia and the Soviet Union, Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, USA, Germany, Great Britian and the UK, The Great Explorers, 500 years of Great Inventions, Wars and Rebellions, and Significant Events of the Twentieth Century.
