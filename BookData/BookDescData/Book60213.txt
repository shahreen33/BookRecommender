Six of today's leading pastor-theologians-John Piper, Voddie Baucham, D. A. Carson, Tim Keller, and David Wells-have joined together to offer Christians a practical, biblical vision of Christ's supremacy, so they will be better prepared to present the undeniable truth to a searching society. After grounding readers in the important truths of Christ's deity and the gospel, The Supremacy of Christ in a Postmodern World strives to help believers understand how to share these truths in a postmodern society. As readers begin to apply the lessons from this book, they will gain a practical, biblical vision of ministry for the twenty-first century.
