This fascinating anthology is in essence the Middle Ages speaking for itself. Just a glance at the table of contents will prove that, for it contains excerpts from medieval literature on 138 different subjects, such as "A Warning Against Wine", "A Portent of Death", "A Miraculous Icon", "A Byzantine Emperor Abroad", "Rape", "Dangerous Games", "Calculating the Date of Easter", and so much more. All this is made even more important by the copious color illustrations, all of which have been reproduced from medieval manuscripts. It is a gorgeous sampling of medieval art and life.
