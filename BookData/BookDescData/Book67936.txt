Allie  When I moved to River’s Edge, dating was the last thing on my mind. I definitely didn’t expect to fall for him. Jesse Shepherd. Popular. Star athlete. Cocky as hell. You know the type. But as time passed, I realized there was more lurking beneath that gorgeous exterior. Secretive. Angry. A little bit broken. The more I peeled back his layers, the deeper I fell. Until I slammed headfirst into his sea of lies.   Jess  I blew my shot. Pissed everything away—college, lacrosse, my future—only to end up right back where I started in River’s Edge. I was content to revel in my misery, spending my days drowning in a bottomless pit of booze and girls. Until I saw her. Allison Parrish. Beautiful. Sarcastic. Perpetual bad attitude. The pretty little distraction from the shit show that was my life. But the sins of my past were closing in on me, and I learned the hard way that nothing gold can stay.
