Beloved book of the Old Testament contains 150 hymns of praise, prayers of crisis and songs of faith fundamental to both Christian and Jewish liturgies. Its English translation in the King James Version of the Bible (1611), from which this edition is reprinted complete and unabridged, is long regarded as a classic of English literature.
