Readers first met the elephant Mama Jumbo in Niki Daly's Welcome to Zanzibar Road. Here she is sporting her flippy-floppy, flappy-slippy, this-way-that-way pompom hat in five easy-to-read adventures including a bubble gum rescue and a brand-new tutti-frutti shirt for Mama Jumbo's adopted child, Little Chico the chicken. Full-color ink-and-watercolor illustrations bubble over with tiny details of the vivacious African village and Mama Jumbo's comfortable home under the pawpaw tree. A charming picture book/chapter book hybrid that's terrific for reading aloud.
