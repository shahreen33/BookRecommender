But the sheriff is in the Tullers' back pocket, and nobody in law enforcement cares about finding Sammy's dad.As she struggles to keep her family--and her new relationship with Brayton--from falling apart, Sammy realizes that if she wants answers, if she wants someone to pay, she'll have to handle it her damn self. Because in a place like Lake Bittersweet, justice ain't something you're given--it's something you take.
