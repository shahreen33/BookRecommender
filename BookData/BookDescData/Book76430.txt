A Dark Gay Romance Revenge has no happily ever after.  Bobby likes to think he's the boss. A brutal twenty-two year old gangster prodigy with a vendetta against an heir to billions, he's about to wipe his biggest enemy off the map. But Bobby's been making some powerful enemies himself, and he just landed on the radar of a man it's better not to know.  Angelo Vitali is the real deal, a dyed in the wool Sicilian who knows exactly how to deal with a wannabe mafioso. He'll take Bobby, break Bobby - and love every minute of it.  TAKEN BOY is a very dark gay romance, and a parallel stand alone to events which take place in bestselling books Shamefully Broken, and Broken Boy.
