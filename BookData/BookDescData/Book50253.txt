What’s a big, bad (sometimes green) alien to do when he wants a mate who isn’t motivated by greed? Contact Celestial Mates. After all, their business is romancing the galaxy.  Since she’s creeping up on the age of bearing service, the Earth government wants Jassa to have a baby and then hand it off for a family to raise, but Jassa wants her own family. Which means calling Celestial Mates. One questionnaire, a bit of blood, and a race to get away from the Department of Population, and she’s got her wish—tall, sexy as hell, and occasionally green alien Vroe, the High Warlord of Vialea.  Vroe aches for a mate who doesn’t see him as just a rise in status. He wishes for warmth and affection and goes to Celestial Mates to find… Jassa Marizen. Yet his ideas about mating—Jassa mating him and forever being known as only Vrya—collide with hers. She doesn’t want to lose her past. He wants her to embrace her future.  And then there’s this other woman… She just wants Vroe to herself.  Part of the CELESTIAL MATES shared scifi world-o-awesome!
