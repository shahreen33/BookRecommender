Murray, Foreword ReviewsDr. Emily Norton is a recent med school grad starting her surgical residency at a renowned hospital in Baltimore. She's dedicated her life to science and reason--so when she receives a supposedly magical amulet from an eccentric neighbor, she ignores the old man's warning.Almost immediately, Emily's well-planned world begins to unravel. At first, the problems are minor, like finding herself in trouble with the hospital administration on her first day at work. But soon Emily is dealing with much bigger issues, from losing her job and fiancé to being framed for a patient's suicide.As Emily struggles to comprehend the amulet's strange effects, she also faces a dilemma about coincidence and fate: none of these disasters could have been caused by a mere amulet, right? Because everyone knows: there's no such thing as magic.Desperate and confused, Emily will need to use every bit of her reason, love and faith to confront and conquer the cursed amulet--even if it means forsaking everything she's ever believed.At turns darkly suspenseful and playfully lighthearted, More Than Bones chronicles Emily's mystical journey with humor, empathy, and more than a few surprises.
