Have the other books in the chronic illness genre made you feel sicker? Long narrations of others’ medical histories are not always helpful. This book is different. It’s not about the author’s symptoms or what illness she has. It’s about you and the illness you have. "Living Incurably Despite Chronic Illness" is a little bit of tough love and a little bit of irreverent humor. It’s self-help, but of the direct and concise variety, because when you have an incurable disease, while you do need someone who can relate to what you’re going through, what you don’t need is collective misery. Chronic illness is everywhere - Diabetes, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Multiple Sclerosis, Fibromyalgia, Cancer, Lupus, Epilepsy, Heart Disease, Asthma - sadly the list continues on and on. This book takes what’s common in all of these conditions, and focuses on making the patient feel less alone but all the while encouraging them to avoid being a victim. The rut that is an incurable disease tends to hold other parts of your life hostage, preventing you from living as vibrantly as you deserve. This little book will captivate you, amuse you, and inspire you to flourish - to live incurably - despite chronic illness.
