When you committed to follow Christ for life, did you wonder what your next steps should be? Did you think your life would automatically become perfect? What does being a “good” Christian look like anyway?  Maybe you still have lots of questions about the Christian faith and have yet to decide whether or not you are ready to commit your life to Christ. Open Bible Churches published We Believe: Core Truths for Christian Living to provide answers to these types of questions, to provide a solid foundation for those new to or still considering the Christian faith.
