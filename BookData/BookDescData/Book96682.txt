Three things sum up Valentine Marsden at this moment: she’s got a sweet tooth so deep she opened her own bakery; she hates the holiday that is her namesake; and she just might be charged with murder tomorrow morning when she strangles the contractor next door banging on the walls during the busiest week of the year. Valentine finds herself bumping into the completely sexy and totally cocky stranger more and more often. So often she’s beginning to think he’s a working man with a serious sweet tooth...Ford Knox has spent almost twenty years secluding himself from the public, retreating to his mountain cabin after work everyday without a second thought for complicated things like women and relationships. But when the syrupy sweet and dangerously curvy bakery owner next door seems to fall right into his lap this Valentine's Day, he winds up drunk on her and desperate for more. Knox is a real man with a wicked appetite, and Valentine is the only thing he can see.Warning: Sweet Valentine is cocky, blue-collar alpha goodness with a dash of sweet candy hearts, lush chocolate-dipped strawberries, and sawdust-scented first kisses. Grab a chocolate martini because Knox and Valentine are about to melt your insides!
