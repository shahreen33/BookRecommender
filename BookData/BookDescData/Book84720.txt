Elaine has found her potential event horse and her career is being sponsored by the impecunious and eccentric Fane sisters. But there is professional training to pay for and equipment and saddlery to buy and the Fanes, naturally, are short of cash.

Just as they are beginning to realise that no amount of prize money will be sufficient for their needs, a golden opportunity for professional training presents itself only to end in catastrophe. Will Elaine and Another Legend ever get to the starting post?
