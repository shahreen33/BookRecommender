Magic and Martial Arts meet head on in a war that will change the world. "This is fantasy in a very different setting - as traditional sword and sorcery meets the House of Flying Daggers." - Amazon ReviewZhou is a diplomat, on a mission to bring peace between his city and the city of Yaart. A mission that will, if successful, end the war that has lasted thirty years. But, not everyone on his team wants peace at any cost. There are scores to be settled that could jeopardise the treaty and plunge the two cities into another thirty years of bloody conflict.Haung has no family but the army that raised him. Peace could prevent him from reaching the heights of glory he desires. But then comes an offer from an unexpected source and Haung must train to be a Jiin-Wei; a master swordsman, magician and spy. He will find that life as a spy is a lot more complicated than that of a soldier, and his loyalties will be tested to the full. Deception is a weapon that all sides wield with skill. Behind it all, an Emperor is readying the land for a war against a new enemy. One that he knows too little about.
