For many teens, adolescence is an uncertain time filled with angst, peer pressure, and personal identity crises. In the halls of a suburban high school, the lives of four teens intertwine as they search to discover who they are and overcome their fears. The social media-obsessed world, which they find themselves in, reveals that support is an illusion and truth languishes behind pretenses. Emma, a poor teen with an abusive stepfather, has just lost her older sister in a horrific accident. Shaun, a shy and appearance-obsessed boy, is drawn to her. Sophia is a sophisticated rich girl whose life isn't as perfect as it seems. Jackson is a star athlete grappling with a secret he fears will undermine his carefully cultivated image. While Emma struggles to resolve her parental conflicts, Shaun strives to overcome his awkwardness. As Sophia fights to change the labels the world has placed upon her, Jackson battles to protect his secret. This rewarding and unpredictable journey highlights the difficult choices the teens face as they fight for independence, attempt to define themselves, and protect their social facades.
