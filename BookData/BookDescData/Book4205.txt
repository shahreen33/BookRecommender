Life in New York City is fantastic for ambitious investment banker, Paul, his successful artist wife, Candice, and their beautiful and talented daughter, Sally. They are the model of an affluent, high-powered urban couple -- until the day the carefully constructed wall of their secrets comes crashing down. Paul and Candice have been venturing into the gray areas of monogamy, and during a passionate escapade, Paul discovers that Candice has been a closet drug addict for the better part of their relationship. Resisting to face his own denial, having to deal with his suddenly weakening health, facing death and grasping at the threads of his failing relationship with his daughter, Paul needs a revelation. When he joins a cutting edge research project on the effects of stress, Paul discovers that there isn't much of a difference between an addict, like his wife, and himself, who chooses to badly manage his type one diabetes. The New York City Marathon becomes the riveting and unexpected backdrop for the new bright life about to begin.
