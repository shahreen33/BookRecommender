Smooth talking. Ambitious. Loyal. Twenty-year-old Shay Reilly has proven himself to his Irish-American Gypsy clan on small-scale cons, but now the clan leader has a bigger mission for him: playing the long game. To rake in the big score he's after, he needs to con co-ed Spencer into falling in love with him. He knows he should see Spencer as a mere means to an end, but that's easier said than done when there's a witty, attractive girl in your arms. Now the only thing that can keep them apart is the thing that brought them together: Shay's plans of revenge against someone who wronged his clan and family years before-Spencer's father.
