Emery Ashworth is a dreamhunter. She spends her time fighting the nightmares of mankind with her partner, Wes, the lowest-ranking boy in her class and the biggest pain in Emery's neck. When Emery and Wes are sent to gather intelligence on a rogue dreamhunter, their bickering lands them in the midst of the Dream-humanity's collective subconscious, where real matter warps until it can no longer return to the waking world-pursued by one of the most dangerous dreamhunters on Earth. Traversing the darkest parts of the human mind and hunted by an unbeatable foe, the two must work together to return to their families, their friends, and their lives before the Dream unravels them both.[COMPLETE]
