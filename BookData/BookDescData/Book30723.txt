BLURB FACES BEHIND THE STONE Driving down the rocky path I saw the overgrown grass, weeds and poison ivy overtaking the outer perimeter of the bushes. The smell of mildew, the stench of the dried bones of animals killed by cars along this dirt road coming up from the ground, the sadness on the faces of the drivers in the cars behind us; you could feel the pain and sorrow. As you looked inside the cars and saw the faces of the drivers, you began to wonder what they were thinking, their thoughts and feelings as they travelled down life’s highway, possibly for the very last time. What stories lie behind the faces behind the wheel of each car? What stories lie hidden? Faces: So…so many stories. Here are seven that will make chills run down your spine and make you wonder: What lies behind the stones? Who lives there?
