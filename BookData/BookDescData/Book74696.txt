Robin Hood, along with her group of friends, has been aiding the poor of Nottingham for four years. They have become an hindrance to the Sheriff of Nottingham, terrorising the rich lords and ladies and robbing gold right from under the Sheriff's nose.  Helping Robin from inside, and proving her most useful ally, is Lady Marian Fitzwalter.  After hearing about a special shipment coming through Sherwood - filled with gold, jewels and weapons - Marian agrees to help Robin gather information so she can ambush it. It is risky and dangerous on both sides but Marian would do anything for Robin. And Robin would do anything to feed her people.  But as the shipment draws closer and tensions rise, Robin finds herself having to decide which is more important: love or duty.
