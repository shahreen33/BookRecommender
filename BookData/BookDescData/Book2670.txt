Sculpt is an illegal fighter.He’s also the lead singer of a local rock band.No one knows his real name.And from the moment I met him, he made me forget mine.In order to convince Sculpt to give me self-defense lessons, I had to follow his one rule—no complaining or he’d walk. I didn’t think it would be a problem. I could handle a few bruises. What I hadn’t anticipated was landing on my back with Sculpt on top of me and my entire body burning up for him.I tried to ignore it.I failed of course. And having a hot, tattooed badass on top of me week after week, acting completely immune to what he was doing to my body—it was frustrating as hell, so I broke his rule—I complained.Then he kissed me.
  Author’s Note: This novella is Sculpt and Emily’s beginning and how they met. It is an extra and not required to be read before “Torn from You”. Their story and what happens to them is the novel “Torn from You”.
*Warning* Huge cliff-hanger. Like huge! But “With You” and “Torn from You” are released on the same day.*
