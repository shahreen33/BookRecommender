Diana Cooper is 18, eager to graduate and go to Yale, and too shy to really look a boy in the eye. No one suspects the sexy lingerie hiding under her vintage dresses. No one suspects the dirty fantasies running through her mind.  Brendan and Ian O'Brian, the hot twins next door, are home from UConn for the summer: gorgeous, athletic, basking in popularity. Brendan, the "good twin," attracts everyone with easygoing friendliness. Ian, the "bad twin," leaves a mess of pranks, collisions, girls, and attitude behind.  As kids, the O'Brian twins were practically Diana's brothers. But a year away changed everything. Now, Di can barely handle a hello to Brendan. And Ian — well, it’s easier to look the other way and pretend she doesn’t see his smirk.  Right before graduation, Brendan breaks the silence to invite Di for a swim. She figures she’ll test the waters, but that night pulls her into the steamiest deep end imaginable. And it’s just the beginning.  Can she dive in and live out her fantasies?  Can she let the past go and learn to trust?  And when no one’s who they seem — good twin, bad twin, or shy honors student — will her heart tell a different story?  She’d never admit it. But she might be over her head.
