Detective Richard Fell is transferred over the bridge from the big city to Snowtown, a feral district whose police investigations department numbers three and a half people (one detective has no legs).

In a place where nothing seems to make any sense, Fell clings to the one thing he knows to be true: everybody's hiding something.
