I’m told the dead are all around us. I wouldn’t know about that. I see only the violently slain. They could be victims of hit-and-run, innocents caught in cross-fire, the murdered. I’ve come to terms with that. In fact, I’ve made a career out of it. They whisper to me and they never, ever, forget the face of their killer.They aren’t the only supernatural things I see. No, they’re not vampires, werewolves or fae – those things don’t exist. We live side by side with what some call the Otherworldy. That’s too much of a mouthful for me. I call them demons. If you saw them as I do you’d know why.Right now I’m trying to find a missing boy whose mother was murdered. Or was she murdered? To further complicate the case, Clarion PD gave me a partner I would rather shoot than work with.I can’t tell them he’s a demon.They’d think I’m crazy.I’m Tiff Banks. Welcome to my world.
