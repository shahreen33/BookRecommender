The only thing NYPD Vice Detective Nick Palladin wants for Christmas is a transfer to the K-9 Unit. He just needs to close this one last big case first, by shutting down a human trafficking ring run by a scummy veterinarian. Which is why he’s out on the street street corner dressed as Santa Claus, ringing a damn bell and taking covert photos of the vet’s customers, hoping one of them might be the link he needs to put the vicious bastard out of business.But his irrepressible Airedale terrier has very different ideas. K-9 Zenon has lasered his sights on a cute little perfumed fluff ball trotting his way...along with the adorably sexy lady holding her leash and teetering on a pair of too-tall stiletto heels. When the pretty lady tumbles to the pavement, well, what’s a gentleman—canine or Santa—to do? Why run to the rescue, of course!
