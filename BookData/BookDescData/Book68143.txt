Deep waters are treacherous enough, but Everly Mantel never thought she would lose her heart there. But when the hunky, gruff captain of a local fishing boat turns her tender ass bright red, all her former ideas about how love didn’t fit into her life are turned upside down. James Morelock took one look at those khaki shorts and the wild tangle of red hair and something inside him caught fire.  Years of telling himself love was for fools broke over the bow of his heart and opened a spot he’d forever thought closed.  Only, he’s not sure his version of love is something this smart newcomer to Port Hope will understand.  Will these two weather the storms of their past and finally give love a chance?  Or will James’s rough love and possessive obsession be more than Everly is willing to accept?Author’s Note:  Liam and Wyatt will smoke your sardines straight out of the can with their debut collaboration.  Hot, rough, safe and just the right amount of adventure, you will be fanning yourself and rooting for these two to find their happily ever after.  Which they will.  Guaranteed.
