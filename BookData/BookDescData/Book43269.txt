With the beginning of the school year approaching, the gang returns from summer break--and what a vacation indeed! A new student council has been assembled, with two new secretaries: Naohito, who has declared himself Yuki's rival, and Kimi, who is known as a devil woman--and a thief of men's hearts. Later, when Tohru goes to see her grandfather, he brings up a part of Tohru's past that she had tried to shut away. And with a parent-teacher conference on the horizon, Mayuko gives Shigure some good advice.
