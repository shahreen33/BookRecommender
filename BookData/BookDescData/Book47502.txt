I have a crush on Nolan Archer, Boston University’s freshman running back. He’s the definition of tall, dark, and swoon worthy. My knees weaken every time our eyes meet. There’s only one problem… he’s a virgin.  As much as I try to convince myself he’s too young for me, or that I prefer experienced guys, I can’t deny the flames of attraction flaring between us.  When his fraternity brothers decide to auction off his virginity, it forces me to make a decision. Should I forget about Nolan once and for all, or place the winning bid and be his first score?
