Thousands of books have been written about the latest and greatest diets that will help people lose weight and improve health. But a key element in any successful nutritional health program is a tried-and-true method that most people haven't thought aboutâ€”yet it could be revolutionary for taking health to the next level. This ancient secret is fasting.  Fasting is not about starving oneself. When done right, it's an incredibly effective therapeutic approach that produces amazing results regardless of diet plan. In fact, Toronto-based nephrologist Dr. Jason Fung has used a variety of fasting protocols with more than 1,000 patients, with fantastic success. In The Complete Guide to Fasting he has teamed up with international bestselling author and veteran health podcaster Jimmy Moore to explain what fasting is really about, why it's so important, and how to fast in a way that improves health. Together, they make fasting as a therapeutic approach both practical and easy to understand.  The Complete Guide to Fasting explains: 
   why fasting is actually good for health 
   who can benefit from fasting (and who won't) 
   the history of fasting 
   the various ways to fast: intermittent, alternate-day, and extended fasting 
   what to expect when starting to fast 
   how to track progress while fasting 
   the weight loss effects of fasting 
   how to ward off potential negative effects from fasting 
  The book also provides tools to help readers get started and get through their fasts, including a 7-Day Kick-Start Fasting Plan and healing liquid recipes.
