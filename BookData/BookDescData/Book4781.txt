With love for one another resting within their inseparable hearts, and a secret occupying their active, yet silent souls, seventeen-year-old Prince Nicu II and his sixteen-year-old sister Victoria, First Princess of Exubertis, must make a choice between their incestuous love affair, and the maintaining of stability within their royal family. Prince Nicu II and Princess Victoria's immutable, romantic feelings for one another forces them to engage in extremely risky actions and fabricate various falsehoods. Throughout the play Nicu II and Victoria deceive everyone; including their parents King Nicu I and Queen Isabella.

Despite Victoria's worries, she continues with the relationship as Nicu II emboldens her more and more.
