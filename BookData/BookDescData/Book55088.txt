Snow is falling in Little Pondale, lights are twinkling and the smell of pine trees and roasting chestnuts fills the air…  But Mia Ward is in a bit of a jam. She’d planned to rent out Corner Cottage for Christmas but thanks to best friend, Ella Swann, it’s double-booked. Now Mia’s got to let one ‘party’ down, or find another cottage – fast.  Best friends and single mums, Cathy Cole and Christy Franks want their kids to have an old-fashioned Christmas. Ice-skating, carol singing, making decorations, and tobogganing are on their list of festive fun … but their kids have other things in mind.  City bankers, Leo and Hal Hardman are wondering if renting a cottage for Christmas and their parents’ anniversary is such a good idea. Little Pondale is tiny, there’s only one pub, mobile phone reception is non-existent and the cottage doesn’t even have a TV.  Meanwhile, Jenny Lake in settling in at her cousin’s bakery, but she’s left her (broken) heart in Florence, and Christmas was never her favourite time of year. And Reverend Glen Fox has taken over at St Michael and All Angels. He’s glad it’s a temporary post because village life is definitely not for him.  But luckily, for locals and visitors alike, there’s a sleigh-load of Christmas magic heading for Lily Pond Lane; enough to put a sparkle in everyone’s festive season. Although Christmas may not go quite as each of them has planned.
