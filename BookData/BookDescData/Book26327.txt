Dr. Emily Dawson has made a nice career for herself. She has a practice of her own in which she spends her free hours treating patients at Princeton's Center of Mental Health. It is at the center where she meets Sophia for the first time.Sophia enters Emily's life strictly as a patient. What begins as a simple diagnosis evaluation soon blossoms into a full fledged midlife crisis for the good doctor.Right from the very start Sophia begins to influence Emily into evaluating her very own well-being. To get a clearer thought at what she is certain is her exact life lived through another person, she asks about her everyday life, her sex life with her special man, and the power behind it. The more she questions, the more she is reminded of the words of Oscar Wilde: "Everything in the world is about sex, except sex; sex is about power."
