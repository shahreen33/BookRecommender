From New York Times bestselling author K. Bromberg comes the raw, sexy, and jaw-dropping finale to the Wicked Ways series.I play to win, and I won’t let anything—or anyone—get in the way of what I want.The first time I met Vaughn Sanders, I knew I wanted her. Confident, intelligent, and downright sexy. I thought I knew how to play her game. I was ready and willing for the challenge. Little did I know she was full of secrets and surprises.But so am I.Charming a woman into my bed has never been my problem. It’s the relationship part that is. They want it. I don’t. But can you blame me? Broken marriages are how I make a living. Hell, no self-respecting man would let a woman own his thoughts, invade his dreams, and steal his heart. So how in the world has Vaughn done that to me?I’ve fallen in love with her. There. I said it. But that acknowledgment comes with a heavy price.Everything and everyone seem to be working against us, leaving us both to question whether what we have is worth the cost.I’ll be damned if I go down without a fight.
