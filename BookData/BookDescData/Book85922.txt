Fortunately, she had someone in her life to pull her from the gutter and help set things right again. As penance for her past, she pledges to suppress her baser desires and focus on finding a steady, dependable connection with a man, even if that means embracing a boring lifestyle.  Zach is anything but dull. As Enforcer for the Hell's Handlers MC, he embodies the outlaw lifestyle, rife with violence, women, and motorcycles. When Toni moves next door, Zach can't resist the possibility of a quick, hot, fling. He discovers, however, that she's not the easy conquest he's used to.  While Zach works to convince Toni she belongs in his bed, a tenuous relationship with a local gang blows up and threatens his MC family. Zach's world is turned upside down when he's unable to keep the danger from touching his club. As Toni fights to resist Zach's pull, her own peace is shattered by demons from her past. With enemies both old and new barreling down, Toni throws out her rules and turns to Zach for aid.  Before she can help it, Toni finds herself entrenched in Zach's outlaw world. Is it possible for her to curb her desires, or is she doomed to repeat the mistakes of her past?  None of it will matter if Zach can't keep the enemies at bay.
