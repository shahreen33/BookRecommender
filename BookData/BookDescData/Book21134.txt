One of the most popular artists working in the YAOI/BL genre of gay-themed manga for more mature readers, C. J. Michalski here offers a half dozen related stories about love. Typical is the title story, a romantic comedy about the half-human, half-cupid Tsubasa. In order to progress to full cupid, he must unite a couple. However, the target is an evil man named Norimasa, who shows no love for anyone. By accident, Tusbasa makes himself Norimasa’s love match. Tsubasa and Norimasa are attracted to each other, but is this cupid magic or true love? Both sexy and comedic, the stories in  Delivery Cupid appeal to a broad range of adult manga readers.
