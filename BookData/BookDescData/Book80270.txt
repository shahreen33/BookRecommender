 When being different leads to the best years of your life.   There are three key components required to get into the most prestigious, top spy school in the world:   Skills.   Strength.   Survival.   My name is Silver Spell Solange. No, I didn't plan for my initials to be the same rank needed to enter the spy school. But I would do anything to get into the one of a kind school. I have the magical capability of an Elemental Witch, the strength to kick anyone's ass, and quick problem-solving skills to get my teammates out of any jam. There’s only one small problem – the other 'S' I’m missing.    I'm not a part of the supernatural race.    After realizing the my only shot at my dreams is at the brink of extinction, I'm unexpectedly teamed up with a werewolf, a dragon, a fallen angel, and a hellhound. The four of them carry the assets and abilities I need to gain my spot into the Supernatural Spy School (SSS).  With the clock ticking and not much leg room for an SS score, I accept their bet, knowing I’ll easily handle whatever they request from me.    I didn't think their bet would lead me to date all four them.    It's time for me to buckle up. This four-year roller coaster is about to begin, and its a bumpy one-way ticket to becoming the next "supernatural" spy.
