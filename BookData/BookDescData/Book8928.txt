Renee Evans has a knack for trouble.

Dylan’s piercing gaze and womanizing demeanor make him exactly the type of guy that Renee should steer clear of – which is most likely the reason she falls for him. But when Renee’s troublesome ex comes back and threatens to drive her and Dylan apart, Renee is forced to face her past and save her relationship with Dylan before it's too late.  Sound Bites dramatizes what happens when Renee finds herself caught between a painful past and an uncertain future.
