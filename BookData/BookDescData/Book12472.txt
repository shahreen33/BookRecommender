I thought he'd always be mine, even when I was forced to say goodbye.  We were never meant to let go, but it happened anyway. Too bad I didn’t know someone was waiting to take my place, or I would've held on a lot tighter.  Two years later, we were exactly where we'd always planned to be. I'd kept my promise. He'd forgotten all about his. Not only had he moved on, but the person he'd moved on with was my best friend, leaving me to begin college with a broken heart.  I guess this is the part where I’m supposed to tell you some other guy stepped in, repaired my shattered pieces, and made me smile again.  This isn't that kind of story.  My heart might have been broken, but it refused to fall out of love.  WARNING: this book contains cheating.Each book in the Gray Springs world can be read as a standalone.
