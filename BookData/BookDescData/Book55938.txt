The book 'The Boss' hoped would never be published — an explosive unauthorized biography written with the help of Mike Appel, Springsteen's former producer/manager. Based on exclusive interviews and previously unreleased material, including depositions from the lawsuit that prevented him from recording for over a year, Down Thunder Road traces Springsteen's rise to fame and reveals the man behind the myth. Originally published in 1992, this title is now available for the first time in the United States.
