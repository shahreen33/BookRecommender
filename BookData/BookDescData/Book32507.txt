Publisher's SummaryA sexually charged and wickedly funny thriller starring Tony Award-winning actor Billy Crudup, Harry Clarke is the story of a shy Midwestern man leading an outrageous double life as the titular cocky Londoner. Moving to New York City and presenting himself as an Englishman, he charms his way into a wealthy family's life as the seductive and precocious Harry, whose increasingly risky and dangerous behavior threatens to undo more than his persona.Harry Clarke was originally produced by The Vineyard Theatre, in association with Audible, in New York in 2017. In a rave review of the stage production, The New York Times hailed Crudup's performance in a "a sly role terrifically suited to his gifts." And The Hollywood Reporter praised Crudup's "tour-de-force performance; effortlessly delineating his multiple characters, switching accents at the drop of a hat."Also included is David Cale's Obie Award-winning solo play Lillian, performed by the author. A perfect companion character to the enigmatic Harry Clarke, Lillian - as described by The New York Times - "is a luminous embodiment of the ineffable in life, a reminder that even the most mundane existence is shaped by currents beyond comprehension."Â©2017 David Cale (P)2017 Audible Originals, LLC.
