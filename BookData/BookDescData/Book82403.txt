LIGHTSPEED is an online science fiction and fantasy magazine. In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF--and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales.  This month, for science fiction, we've got original shorts by Ashok K. Banker ("A Vortal in Midtown") and Charlie Jane Anders ("Cake Baby"), along with SF reprints by Leslie What ("The Mutable Borders of Love") and Philip Raines and Harvey Welles ("Alice and Bob"). We've also got original fantasy by Kathleen Kayembe ("The Faerie Tree") and Max Wynne ("A Wound Like an Unplowed Field"), and fantasy reprints by Rachel Swirsky ("The Day the Wizards Came") and Jonathan L. Howard ("The Commission of The Philosophical Alembic"). All that fiction, and of course we also have our usual assortment of author spotlights, along with our book and media review columns. Our interview this month is with novelist Molly Tanzer--plus, if you're an ebook reader, you can check out an excerpt of her new novel, Creatures of Will and Temper. Also for our ebook readers, we have our ebook-exclusive reprint of Gene Wolfe's novella "Tracking Song."
