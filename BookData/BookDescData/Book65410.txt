~ Available as an audio book in download format at LoDingoThe Civil War — the bloodiest, most dramatic moment in this nation’s history — also produced some of the country’s greatest literature. Blood reflects the violent hatred, love, patriotism, and heroism this conflict generated through the vivid stories of the men and women who were there. This collection includes Ulysses S. Grant (via the rumored pen of Mark Twain) recounting the taking of Vicksburg; Theodore Lyman watching Grant come into his own on his first drive toward Richmond; George Templeton Strong describing the horror of the New York Draft Riots; and plantation owner Mary Chestnut’s report on the final days before the fall of Atlanta. Also included are firsthand accounts ranging from Pickett’s Charge to Sherman’s March, from Lee’s Virginia campaigns to the heroism of African American foot soldiers, as well as excerpts from some of the most notable fiction on the subject.What the Critics are Saying "This collection of eyewitness accounts of the Civil War presents a wide range of experiences; civilian, officer, slave, and poet all tell of what they saw. Among the most prominent are: Grant, Sherman, Pickett, and Whitman. The five readers all give distinctive voices to each character as they read. All are believable and make one realize that history is the story of people."
