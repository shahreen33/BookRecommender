My family's past threatens my future...  It's my second year training to become a Sentry of the South at Spellslingers Academy of Magic and I'm still fighting a reputation I don't deserve. It was my grandmother's addiction to magic that tarnished our family name--a grandmother I still love and adore. When she asks a favor of me, I can't refuse her dying wish...and it sets off a chain of events I never expected. With the help of a charming and sexy druid, I set out to locate a missing professor, but what we discover is far worse than we ever imagined.  A fight to restore my family's honor has become a fight for my life and the lives of everyone I hold dear. Will we be able to find the professor in time and preserve life in the quadrant as we know it?
