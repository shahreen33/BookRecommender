A must read! Longing to Belong by Judi Bergen is beautifully written in a style reminiscent of Faith Sullivan’s Good Night, Mr. Wodehouse. Turtle Creek, Iowa comes to life through the eyes of Amanda MacGregor, a young woman struggling to fit in with others in town. Her life is haunted by a family tragedy and secrets held by her father’s maiden sister who runs their household. Bergen’s characters drive the story within the milieu of small town life.
