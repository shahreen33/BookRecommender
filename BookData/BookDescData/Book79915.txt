Trio is a kitten who was born with three legs. He lives his life as any other kitten would. He loves to play with the chickens, even climbing into their nesting box and finding his new favorite place. One day as he lounges in the hay, an egg hatches beneath him, and he makes a new best friend. This story is delightful and the brightly colored linocut illustrations are endearing, sure to charm adults, children, cats and chickens alike.
