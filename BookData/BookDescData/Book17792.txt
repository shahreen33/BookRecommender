There is a girl.... lost in despair, alone in a world she doesn't recognise, bound to a prophecy she doesn't understand and a destiny she refuses to accept... Seventeen year old, Psyche Darnell's world is in chaos. Everything she once took for granted is gone. Food is scarce, communications are down and fuel is worth more than diamonds. To escape the grief and destruction that surrounds them, Psyche and her mother head north to the small mountain community where Psyche was born. There they find safety with Libby, Psyche's grandmother and a group of survivors who spent years preparing for the 'end of days'. Psyche must learn to trust Libby, a woman she barely knows and rely on the support of this strange community. After weeks of grieving, she makes friends with Phoenix, the 19 year old boy next door. Phoenix holds a secret he can't reveal, but then, it seems that everyone is keeping secrets from her. With her grandmother as teacher, Psyche learns about magick, a family legacy and a prophecy that dates back to the 16th Century. At first, this seems irrelevant, but when Psyche discovers that she has a role to play, she refuses to participate. She doesn't understand the prophecy and doesn't believe in magick. However, the prophecy isn't her only problem and while she thinks it's all a crazy mistake, she wonders what will kill her first, the beasts who stalk her in the night, the raiders searching for food, or the magic. Psyche is led on a journey of discovery and destiny as she learns the secret to the prophecy. Some secrets are designed to protect us, but the greatest secrets are often held by the people we trust the most.
