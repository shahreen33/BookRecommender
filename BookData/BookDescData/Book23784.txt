THIS BOOK WILL BE AVAILABLE IN AUDIOBOOK ON THE READ ME ROMANCE PODCAST DURING THE WEEK OF NOVEMBER 12. The last place ex-Special forces soldier, Kyle Musgrave, expected to find himself was in a joust at a renaissance fair. There’s a prize for winning, however—her name is Cameron and she’s just as horrified by her medieval circumstances as Kyle. She needs his help badly to escape her would-be suitors. For Kyle, that means donning uncomfortable armor, galloping to victory on a stubborn steed and claiming a reward he never expected. If she’ll have him.
