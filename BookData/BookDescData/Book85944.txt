He needs someone to work with his son, she needs a job. They need to keep their hands to themselves.Welcome to Seattle, the Emerald City and home to The Single Dads of Seattle. Ten sexy single fathers who play poker every Saturday night, have each other’s backs, love their children without quarter, and hope to one day find love again. This is Mark's story …  Single Dad of Seattle Dr. Mark Herron can’t believe anyone would celebrate their divorce. The dissolution of his marriage left him and his son with a huge hole to fill in their home—and their hearts. So when he overhears a lovely stranger and her friends celebrating the end of her marriage, he’s mystified—and then intrigued—by her determination to put the past behind her. But when he learns that Tori Jones needs a job, he knows this can’t be a coincidence.  Tori might be telling the world nothing’s got her down, but the truth is she’s hit rock bottom. Her husband didn’t just cheat on her, he took all her money, including her college fund, which means her marriage is over, and so is her dream to go to grad school and help children with special needs. So when a handsome stranger offers her a job caring for his special needs son, she knows she can’t turn it down—  Even if what she’s feeling for Mark is far from professional.  Now Mark’s finding it hard to keep his hands to himself and Tori’s struggling to keep her thoughts from straying to dangerous territory. Will they be able to keep their distance from each other or will being hired by the sexy single dad be Tori’s biggest problem of all?
