****Miles &amp; Mistletoe is a 37,000+ word holiday novella****  Ian Zerlinger is a man who is used to getting what he wants. And he definitely isn’t a man who takes no for an answer. It’s that drive, learned from childhood, that aided in his ability to turn around his company, Zerlinger Beer and Spirits, into the success it is today. That’s why’s it’s especially imperative that Zerlinger Beers’ holiday season goes well with its many holiday brand extensions. The last thing on Ian’s mind is women, more specifically, dating, unless it’s his need for a date for one of the many holiday events he’ll be attending over the season. Naturally, in walks Stacia Langton, a flight attendant for the private airline Ian readily uses. Upon their first encounter, Ian is as dismissive of Stacia as he is of just about everyone else he encounters. However, on the night of Thanksgiving, while both are volunteering at a shelter, Ian’s callous comments rankle Stacia’s nerves one too many times. Unable to stop herself, Stacia let’s Ian know exactly what she thinks of him. Now Ian can’t keep the seemingly perfectly quaffed woman, with a sometimes sharp tongue, off his mind. That’s when he makes her a proposition she can’t refuse: Be my date over the holiday season or else …  What started out as merely a means to acquire someone to have on his arm at the holiday events he has to attend, quickly turns into something deeper. After thousands of miles traveled together, and a few kisses (and more) shared under the mistletoe will Ian and Stacia decide to remain dating once the holiday season is over? Or will one of Ian’s meddling employees destroy what the couple have come value as a genuine friendship leading to something more?
