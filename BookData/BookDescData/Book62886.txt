Elora Laiken broke Sir Storm’s heart when she chose his best friend. Now the handsome vampire hunter wants nothing to do with love or even women for that matter. Litha Brandywine is a witch who has other ideas. Like Storm, she works for The Order of the Black Swan and is known as the best tracker on earth. When he arrives at headquarters in Edinburgh, where Litha is currently assigned, she falls hard enough to be up for a test of wills. Though LItha might be perfect for Storm, he's hardened his heart and is determined that he won't be taking any chances on romance. When B Team arrives in Edinburgh, the afterglow of an elftale wedding ends abruptly when Sir Kay's fiancé, Katrina, is kidnapped by a demon with a grudge. While the tracker, Litha, searches for the missing girl with Storm assigned as her escort, other members of B Team are tasked with bringing in a stray werewolf causing havoc in London and finding him a suitable new home.
