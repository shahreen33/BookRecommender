In the wake of her handler’s death, Jesse has never felt more alone. Her best friend is distracted by a new love. Her mentor Rachel is missing and her boyfriend Lane isn’t returning her calls.  Worse, a Necronite with the ability to heal any wound wants to kill Jesse and absorb her power of pyrokinesis.  With little to hold her to Nashville, Jesse agrees to work as a freelance agent for Jeremiah Tate, a pharmaceutical tycoon in Chicago. Together they plot revenge against Caldwell, the mastermind responsible for the genocide of over 100,000 Necronites worldwide.  When Jeremiah fails to dominate Jesse and her pyrokinesis, tensions escalate, dividing her from her allies.  Then Caldwell gives Jesse an ultimatum she cannot refuse.
