When a stranger walks up and punches him at a bar, he assumes there’s a good reason. But he’s stunned to learn it’s over a one-night stand that never happened —with his friend’s straight-laced sister. When he confronts her about the lie, she apologizes, but he realizes he doesn’t want her to be sorry…he wants the night they supposedly spent together. The last thing she needs is to add to her long list of commitments. But when tempted with the chance to go crazy and fulfill a few fantasies, she can’t resist. Thank goodness one night isn’t enough time to fall in love…*this title was previously published as She's the One, Counting on Love book one*
