Holly's got a big problem...  And this time, there's no dead body involved.  At least, not yet.  Her boyfriend's parents are coming into town for the Yule Feast and they're staying at the Beechwood Manor -- for an entire week!  With a paranormal meet-the-parents on the horizon, the last thing she needs is to stumble into yet another murder investigation, but when she becomes a key witness, there's no way of avoiding it. Especially not if vampires are involved and her human partner-in-sleuthing is racing right into their path.  Holly has to stop a ring of power-hungry vampires, charm a pair of uptight shifters, and keep herself out of supernatural prison. Piece of cake, right?  Witch Slapped is a paranormal cozy mystery with a little romance and a whole lot of suspense mixed in! This is the third book in the Beechwood Harbor Magic Mystery series. Come see what's brewing!
