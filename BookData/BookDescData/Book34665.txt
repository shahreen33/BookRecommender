This is the message of the Gospel of Luke, a detailed account of the life and ministry of Jesus, from His birth in Bethlehem to His ascension into heaven. As we read through this five-week plan, pay close attention to Jesus seeking out the marginalized and engaging the religious leaders of the day. Watch Him minister in the power of the Holy Spirit, praying at key points in the narrative. Listen as He teaches parables about the kingdom of God, confounding the conceited and bringing hope to the humble. Experience afresh the wonder and joy of the in-breaking of Godâ€™s kingdom through Jesus, friend of sinners and Savior of the world.
