Lizzie plucks up the courage to tell Stamatis everything about the witch, who has now revealed her true motive and doesn’t seem to ever intend to let her go. Soon, Lizzie teams up with a powerful ally who proves to be her only hope. All she has to do now is trust… But can she do it? Will Corfu ever be again the perfect paradise she once knew?"I'm usually good at guessing endings, but this one floored me. Would it finish with a cop-out? No, Effrosyni came up with the goods, with a brilliant twist that pulled the plot back from the brink." ~Hilary Whitton Paipeti, author of In the Footsteps of Lawrence Durrell and Gerald Durrell in Corfu
