The author is adept at moving from one group of characters to another while simultaneously ensuring that the reader remains gripped by the central plot, and glued to the edge of their seat. Would love to see a film adaptation. McDermott is sheer class!”“A fantastically written story which demonstrated an intelligently written and well researched text. All this and a it's a debut!!”“Thrilling, gripping and fast moving. A great 5 * adventure on a par with the best.”
