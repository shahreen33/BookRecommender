I barely survived my first year at Darkhen Academy, and now with Ryder gone and my heart shattered I’m not sure I’ll outlive the second.  But I have to, right? Because Luxora and her evil minions aren’t waiting around for me to get over my broken heart. With increased attacks in the human world, the supe slayer squad must ride on!  Then there’s my father. He’s kind of obsessed with unlocking my new super powers. As the first female warlock ever, he’s dead set on harnessing my abilities, even my darkest ones. But if I do, will the dark oracle’s prophecy prove true?  The problem is, I can’t focus on any of that when all I want to do is tear apart the Underworld until I find Ryder. But after months apart, will the man I find be the same one I fell for?  ***This is an upper YA/NA crossover with schmexy supernatural guys and is best suited for age 16 and over. Be warned, the steaminess factor does increase through the course of the series!
