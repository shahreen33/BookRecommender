After tonight I knew things were going to change. For the better that is…I had a secret and I was finally going to tell the boy of my dreams, the love of my life, soul mate and boyfriend of the last four years. I wasn't prepared for what actually happened…I didn't expect to lose my boyfriend and best friend in one night…. Things weren't supposed to end this way. My heart was ripped out, split in two and stomped on for all to see. I was humiliated and betrayed.How deep can the knife of betrayal cut before it’s too late to wrench it out and let the forgiveness heal?Is forgiveness even possible when you’ve been hurt in the worst possible way? Can a soul so broken and ruined ever be restored? How am I supposed to heal from this when I have a reminder of the beautiful man whom broke me looking up to me every day?****Harley is the product of a one night stand.
