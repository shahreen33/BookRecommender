This is an Emily Castles short mystery.  When amateur sleuth Emily Castles and her friend Dr. Muriel meet Gareth Crabbe, newly-appointed poet-in-residence at Brixtonâ€™s windmill, he reveals that an intruder has been breaking in at night. While Emily and Dr. Muriel try to discover the identity of the intruder, Gareth must find the inspiration to write a poem, or funding for his residency will be withdrawn and the Gala Open Day at the windmill will be ruined.
