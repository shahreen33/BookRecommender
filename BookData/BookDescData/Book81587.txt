This is a practical and comprehensive introduction to the principles, skills and application of Low Intensity Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (LICBT). Avoiding jargon or terminology and relating theory to real-life practice examples, the authors guide the trainee step-by-step through the therapaeutic process. LICBT requires a different set of skills and competencies from 'high intensity' or usual CBT - this book is tailored specifically for the low intensity practitioner. It shows how to deliver the approach to service users presenting with common adult mental health problems such as anxiety or depression, and how to use therapy 'vehicles' like supported self-help.Beginning at the initial assessment, the book takes the reader all the way through the implementation of interventions to the management of endings - with key case examples threading through the book to illustrate each step. Interactive exercises encourage self-development and a deeper understanding of the approach.This accessible, evidence-based book is essential reading for Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners (PWPs). It will also be useful for health professionals of all kinds who need a practical guide to applying this cost-effective therapy in clinical settings.
