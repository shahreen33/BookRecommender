When two suburban Chicago high school seniors skip graduation to go on a road trip to Wisconsin they crash head-on into an adventure that will forever alter their lives.Praised by New York Times No. 1 Best-Selling author James Finn Garner as a “tragic tale” that “richly captures the bravado and heartbreak of damaged boys who grow up into damaged men,” Randy Richardson’s "Cheeseland" is about loyalty, friendship and the self-destructive nature of secret-keeping and unresolved anger.Told in two parts, the novel's long and winding road comes full circle when these two friends must finally confront their past and come to grips with their present lives. But is it too late to heal old wounds? Robert W. Walker, author of "Titanic 2012," says Cheeseland “touches the reader” with “a dramatic touch that rivals Nicholas Sparks,” while Christine Sneed, author of the award-winning story collection, "Portraits of a Few of the People I’ve Made Cry," describes it as “Easy Rider meets a warped version of It’s a Wonderful Life…“a page turner…that you won’t soon forget.”
