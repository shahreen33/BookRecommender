Anne encounters spirits far more troubled than her own when she's sent off to a small seaside village, away from her parents' disintegrating marriage. A dead man scrawls desperate messages to her in the dust. A demonic dog digs up the bones of drowned sailors in the graveyard.Through dreams and hypnosis, Anne opens herself to otherworldly (and violent) forces. She's drawn deeper and deeper into a century-old tale of shipwreck and unsolved murder -- and she's haunted by anguished phantoms in the old Watch House on the cliff and on the deadly rocks below. At first, the new friends Anne has made try to hold her back. But when they, too, succumb to the lure of the supernatural, Anne finds herself marooned in a time and place from which it seems no one can save her. Gripped by ghosts, she must fight for her sanity -- and for her life.[https://www.fictiondb.com/author/robe...]
