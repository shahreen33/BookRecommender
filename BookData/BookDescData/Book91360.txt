My name is Everly Dupree. When my marriage fell apart, I did what every normal, red-blooded woman doesâ€¦  I moved back to my hometown, and bought a haunted house for the back taxes.  Okay, I realize I might have been a bit hasty, but it seemed like a good idea at the time. Then again, so did staying at the Bide A Way Motel, until a dead body turned up in the next room.  All I wanted was to come home, find a job, and start a new life. I didn't plan on getting tied up in the afterlife. Or solving a murder, but here's what I learned:  You might not believe in ghosts, but sometimes they believe in you.   The Hauned Everly After series featuring the spunky Everly Dupree is a cozy mystery with a hint of the supernatural.
