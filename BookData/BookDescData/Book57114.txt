  Sarah Lark’s epic Sea of Freedom trilogy reaches its sweeping conclusion in a story of courage, strength, and sisterhood.
The dawning twentieth century brings change to New Zealand—and new opportunities for any woman bold enough to grasp them. Atamarie Turei, whose mother fought for suffrage, has enrolled as the first female student at the Canterbury College of Engineering. On a surveying trip she meets Richard Pearse, who shares her passion for aviation. Being part Maori, part white, and thoroughly independent, Atamarie is soon vilified by Richard’s conservative farm community, forcing her to navigate the next step in a liberating life.Roberta Fence, Atamarie’s best friend, has just graduated from college. Obsessed with charismatic, womanizing doctor Kevin Drury, Roberta follows him to South Africa, where their work together in the brutal Boer concentration camps will change her—but not define her.Soon, Atamarie and Roberta will discover that destiny lies closer to home. There, each woman forges a path through star-crossed love, family upheaval, and a shifting social landscape. And by reconciling ambition with the spirituality of her ancestors, Atamarie endeavors to make her dreams take flight at last.
