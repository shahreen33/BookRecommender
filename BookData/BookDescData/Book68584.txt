What’s to Love: We’re so thrilled by the response to our Mighty Morphin Power Rangers comic series that we wanted to focus on some of the individual Rangers and let them shine in their own stories. First up is a series centered around Kimberly Hart, the Mighty Morphin Pink Ranger, and who better than Batgirl and Gotham Academy writer Brenden Fletcher and A-Force and Jem and the Holograms writer Kelly Thompson to bring it to us!
