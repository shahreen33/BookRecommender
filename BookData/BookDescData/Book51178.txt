What if Alice didn’t fall down the rabbit hole, but instead, traveled through Lincoln Tunnel into another kind of Wonderland:New York City.Alice Leighton may have stopped chasing rabbits a long time ago, but that doesn’t mean she’s not up for some grown up adventures. What’s not part of her Alice 2.0 plan: losing her head – and heart – to the rugged and enigmatic Dare Grangeworth. Women go mad over him, but not Alice. No way. She may be curious, but she’s not stupid. Now the man used to being pursued is the one doing the chasing. He has to get to know this girl, even if it means allowing himself to be the subject of her research. Before too long, everything between them feels larger than life and upside down, like a heady rush, but is it enough to keep Alice by his side in Wonderland?
