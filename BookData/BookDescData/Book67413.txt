Mistaken identities, a human in a magical world, and three sexy warlocks. Sounds like the start of a joke, but nope...It's my life.After one too many kamikazes on my twenty-first birthday, I've made a few interesting discoveries.First of all... magic is real.Secondly... there's a whole supernatural dimension that exists parallel to ours.Thirdly... I've somehow gotten stuck in that dimension.FML.There are about a billion things wrong with this picture, including the fact that I don't actually have any magic. Everyone here thinks I do though. They also think I'm a witch named Roxie, the star student at Radcliffe Magical Academy.Ummm. Nope. Not me. Sorry.I don't know where the hell the real Roxie is, or how I'm supposed to get back home, but I'm determined to find out.Unfortunately, I keep getting distracted by three hot-as-hell warlocks I can't seem to avoid. Cross, a snarky bad boy who pushes all my buttons, Theo, an incorrigible flirt with a devastating accent, and Kasian, a teacher's assistant who's totally off limits.Even though I'm drawn to all three of them, I'm not sure I should trust them.Because if anybody finds out I don't belong here...I'm screwed.Magic Swap is the first book in the Hidden World Academy series, a fast-burn reverse harem story about a sassy human who's out of her depth and the three men who fall in love with her.
