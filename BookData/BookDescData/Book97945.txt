In the middle of a quiet, not-so-special clearing in the woods, a wee tiny whatsit wakesÂ up without any memory at all. So he sets off in search of his maker, as well as some sense of purpose in Life. Along the way, he encounters a bizarre cast of silly, helpful, and oddly poignant characters who teach him how to survive this crazy game called Existence.The Big Empty Life of Alphonse Tabouret is an existential fairy tale about Life, Love, Loss, and the search for answers to questions we all ask nobody in particular. While cute and silly on the surface, almost every encounter is metaphorical (without being heavy-handedly so). This adorably engaging and heartwarming tale invites the reader to decipher the life lessons gleaned by Alphonse in personal terms that speak to today's social conditions. Through the innocent lens of simple, cute characterization, readers are presented with honest questions about parenting, materialism, addiction, codependency, narcissism, depression, and the search for meaning that we all undergo every day.
