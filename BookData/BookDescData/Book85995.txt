Don’t sleep with your teammates. It was the one rule they emphasized to us ladies at the Fire Academy. The kind of rule that existed for a crucial reason. And it was an easy rule to follow… Until I got transferred to Miami Fire Station 47.  With just two weeks until Christmas, Firefighter Amy Pederson is transferred to a special new fire station in the suburbs of Miami. It’s a tremendous honor to have been selected out of hundreds of applicants, but Amy can’t help but feel like she doesn’t belong.  And it only gets worse when she meets her three sexy unit mates, some of whom aren’t too thrilled to have a woman on their team.  Yet as they take holiday calls together they begin bonding in ways only a close-knit group who risk their lives together can. Every time they throw on their gear and stride into the swirling smoke their petty differences seem silly by comparison—especially with rumors of a holiday arsonist plaguing Miami.  But now Amy has the opposite problem: she and her new unit mates are beginning to like each other too much, a temptation that’s impossible to avoid while living with three delicious firefighter hunks. Can Amy douse her unrelenting feelings while searching for the arsonist, or will everything go up in smoke?  Five Alarm Christmas is a sexy, stand-alone reverse harem romance filled with humor, action, and mystery. It also contains sizzling hot MFMM menage sex, in single and multiple partner scenes. HEA guaranteed!
