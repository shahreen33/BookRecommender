Bereaved by the death of their parents, five sisters live in a seaside villa full of nooks and mysteryâ€”growing up together, sharing their grief, experiences, and love. The oldest becomes the head of the family. Book One is narrated by the youngest sister, Enid. A free spirit, she enjoys wandering alone and talking to animals and anything she meets. Her best friend Gulliver is, like her, offbeat and creative. When Enid begins hearing ghost-like screams, the two friends embark on a scary adventure. These sisters are not perfect, and they may not always get along, but in times of need, they can always count on one another.
