"For every light there is a dark." For Harley Finn, life had never been easy. She overcame a tragic upbringing, a childhood filled with pain. But her trials were only just beginning. A random hook-up changes her life forever. At first Levi Bonham seems like the ideal, no-strings-attached kind of guy, but Harley soon realizes that he is as dangerous as he is enticing. She finds herself plunged into a world plagued by creatures that prey on human suffering and misery. Still reeling from tragedy, Harley has to learn to adjust to her new, not-quite-human life and all that comes with it. A confusing and complicated love life. Enemiesâ€”both new and old. And above all else, she must confront her own demons to save herself and those she loves most. Her desire for revenge propels her into a centuries-old war waged in shadows. Harley must choose to put aside her vendetta and risk her own humanity if there is to be any hope for mankind.
