The heart revs harder with gasoline in the veins.  Tesla’s love for dancing runs deeper than her toleration of her father’s MC lifestyle. That’s why she left the Razorblade Tumbleweeds motorcycle club in the first place. The academy seemed like her best bet, but all that fire in her heart and hatred in her soul keeps her dancing in a fit of rage instead of elegant grace. Realizing she can’t escape her past, she heads home to try and face all the heartache she thought she’d left behind.  Link is the new President of his MC. It’s been years since Tesla, the princess to the Razorblade Tumbleweed throne, stomped out of his world on her way to dance for fancy rich folks under bright spotlights. Of course, when things didn’t work out, she headed home. Now, not only does he need to harness all those hidden desires, he also has to help her with her new strip club idea, which means pissing off the locals, the cops, a rival MC, and some sick and twisted reverend from a religious cult.  Rye is about to turn eighteen, and in his religious community of Red Chapel, that means he can start to choose his wives. Life seems good until he finds out the young woman he loves more than anything in the world is betrothed to The Reverend, their sadistic religious leader with an insatiable appetite for power, pain, and pleasure. His only escape seems to be that ruthless band of outlaws he’s always been warned about. If he can only convince Grace to join him and Link to accept him.  Bikers, strippers, and religious zealots collide to create the Calm’s Storm.
