Hideki is used to getting the short end of the stick. He can't get into school, his parents cut off his allowance, and he's a 19-year-old virgin. So when he found a perfectly good humanoid computer - a persocom - lying in the garbage, it seemed like his luck was finally starting to turn around. Chi isn't like any other persocom ever created. She is self-teaching - a true artificial intelligence - and best of all, she's hot. Hideki should have know it was too good to be true. The diagnostics said that Chi's memories were erased, but something, or someone, is hidden away in her cybernetic soul, and now it is trying to contact her. If Hideki doesn't figure out her mystery soon, he may lose Chi...to herself.Chapters 13-24
