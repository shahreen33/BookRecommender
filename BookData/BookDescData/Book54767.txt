The innocent girl with a delinquent heart has to live with her bad choices. Secret hope and hurt feel like falling while she learns how to breathe again, but there's still freedom in trouble.The runaway with blacked-out eyes is losing his grip. Crushing two hearts in one fist, his addiction bends rules and breaks deals, but the boy born for bliss isn't going anywhere without a fight.Love is knowing they should stay away, but love is illogical at best.She's afraid to let go.He won't let her.This is how silliness and foolishness grow up.Here, forever is a lie.
