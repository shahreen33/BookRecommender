Elisabeth Dumn is a strong, rebellious girl who's determined to make her own way. Good thing too, because her father long ago promised her to the Devil and he's come to claim what's his. This is a story that will haunt you long after you've turned the final page. Part horror adventure, part surreal dreamscape, this original graphic novella features the amazing artwork of new Brazilian sensation ARABSON, with translation by Eisner Award-winner JAMES ROBINSON.
