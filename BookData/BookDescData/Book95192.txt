"I remember you! I brought the others back, I can bring you home too! Raggedy Man, I remember you and you are late for my wedding!" Amy Pond, The Big BangSince its revival in 2005, Doctor Who has been transformed from cult franchise into an award-winning, multi-platform, flagship BBC One drama watched by millions each week. A prime example of the 360-degree television experience that British broadcasters are hungry to commission and develop, Doctor Who is also central to the revitalisation of family viewing long thought impossible to resurrect. In 2010, the regeneration of Tenth Doctor David Tennant into Eleventh Doctor Matt Smith saw the keys to the Doctor Who kingdom ceremonially handed over from Russell T. Davies to new showrunner Steven Moffat. His first series was a highly anticipated moment of change in the production regime of this long-running show. Moffat and his team proved that they could again catch lightning in a bottle, with their Doctor Who continuing to entertain audiences in the UK and internationally. Matt Smith, joined by Karen Gillan as new companion Amy Pond, was an immediate critical success as the new Doctor.Cult television and film blogger Frank Collins has significantly expanded upon the original reviews from his popular Cathode Ray Tube website to examine this latest series of adventures. He provides an in-depth analysis of episodes, characters, themes and ideas, and places Doctor Who within the wider cultural context of contemporary social, political, historical and psychological debates. A unique view of a television icon, providing much food for thought, this book is essential reading for fans of the new series.
