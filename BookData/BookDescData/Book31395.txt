Museum Curator, Riordan Quinn, is still reeling from the tragic death of his husband a year ago. He knows life must go on for him and his two young daughters, and the first step is a dance recital for Isla, his oldest child. Things start to go awry the morning of the dance when the ballerina can’t find part of her costume. The day goes from bad to worse when his tiny dancer refuses to go onstage and dance with her class.  Sitting in the audience, Cold Case Detective, Faulkner Hayes, can’t believe his eyes when a handsome man runs up onstage at his niece’s dance recital and starts dancing with his young daughter, who’s suffering an obvious bout of stage fright. He’s stunned a second time when he finds out that the dancing man is the father of his niece’s best friend. Thrown together later at a party, Faulkner realizes Riordan is tailor-made for him. He’s just not sure what the protocol is for courting recently widowed men.  When Faulk makes his move and asks Riordan out, strange things start to happen. Is it just coincidence or the spirit of Riordan’s husband not giving his blessing to this fledgling relationship?  There’s only one man who can settle this question once and for all. When things seem darkest for Riordan and Faulk, Tennyson Grimm steps in to decipher what Stephen Walker-Quinn is really trying to say to his surviving husband and his tiny dancers.
