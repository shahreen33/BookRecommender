  
    I'm stranded in an isolated cabin with a possessive billionaire.
  
  
    He has some very demanding ways to pass the time.
  
  
    
  
  
  My new, older boss is super handsome and filthy rich.
  We're on a business trip when a blizzard causes an emergency landing.
  Now we're snowed in, and his private jet isn't the only thing going down.
  He wants to keep me locked up in a cabin in the woods.
  So he can own me, claim me and dominate me while we're here.
  Then, we'll return to the real world.
  I'll keep working for him so I can take care of my son.
  And he'll keep making his billions and raising his daughter.
  I'm just his temporary plaything and I can't fall for him.
  
  
  
    
      But while he's having his way with my body,
    
  
  
    
      what if I steal his heart?
