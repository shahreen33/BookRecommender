I thought I was signing up for a luxury retreat on a lonely, windswept island. I didn’t realize that I would be the only guest of three sexy demons hungering for a mate...  Social media addict Edie can’t remember the last time she spent time in the sun or hung out with anyone but her geeky roommates. The curated life of her feed is so much better than reality. But after getting trolled by an online creep, she's determined to detox. Her summer vacation spot has no phone service or internet--just ocean views and the old-fashioned charm of Marchcliff Manor--plus, three smoking hot guys that weren’t listed on the brochure.  Scholarly Alistor, rugged Van, brooding Dante: ferociously protective demons who can take monstrous forms and offer unimaginable pleasures…with a catch. They're cursed, forever bound to the island unless they can find a bride strong enough to handle more than her fair share of sexy supernatural men and surrender her human life.  Well, the love of three demons might be just the thing to distract a girl from the internet, and the ferry won’t return for two weeks. Edie will have to decide…is a human life worth keeping if you barely had one to begin with?  Tempted by Demons is a standalone reverse harem romance with plenty of steam on the way to happily ever after.
