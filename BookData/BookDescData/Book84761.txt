For three-day event rider Jules Thornton, courage means riding her horses forward through the most daunting cross-country courses in the sport. She's already proven she's willing to do whatever it takes to make her name as an eventer, even spending the summer in an intense dressage program.Now she's back in Ocala and ready to tackle the winter eventing season with her usual bravado, but neither she nor her partner, Pete are ready for the next struggle the eventing gods have cooked up. Their farm is locked in a legal battle, their income depends on galloping racehorses, and Amanda the Hunter Princess is way too friendly with Pete for Jules' tastes.This fall, Jules has to learn courage goes deeper than kicking on through sticky situations. Courage means hanging on for dear life, and knowing when to let go.
