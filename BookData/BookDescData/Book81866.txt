Although Leila is a married woman, she is enticed by this bold Renaissance man. Lance seduces her, surprising her with the most erotic weekend of her life … with a vampire. She convinces herself that it was just an affair, but she can’t get Lance—or the time they shared—out of her mind.  As owner of the Caprice Casino and the exclusive Club Moroii, Lance has more money and heartbreaking good looks than any one man deserves. He soon introduces her to an underground world that she never knew existed, fraught with sex, booze, blood … and danger.  When Leila’s life crumbles around her, Lance is there to pick up the pieces … but her connection with him has a price. Can Leila leave the past behind and become eternally his, allowing her heart—as well as her body—to be touched by a vampire?
