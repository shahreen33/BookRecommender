For Seth Roman, his younger brother Raymond and their friends, it was supposed to be a few days of relaxation and fun, a getaway from their dull corporate jobs and troubled lives, a week of card playing and drinking at a cabin in the remote woods of northern Maine. But when a young woman staggers into their camp with her clothes covered in blood, their lives are changed forever. The woman brings with her something ancient and deadly, evil and inhuman, and something secretly familiar to Raymond, a man plagued by inexplicable night terrors as a child, the horrors of which still torment him as an adult. As an unexpected snowstorm moves in, the night will unfold and come alive, changing the very nature of their lives and beliefs, the very nature of time, and the very nature of good and evil.A year later, with only sparse memories of that horrible night, Seth and the others struggle to hold their lives together while being haunted by vague but terrifying flashbacks. Something is pursuing them and their families, their friends, their coworkers, forcing them to question everything they see and hear and feel, everything they hold dear. As they begin to unravel the truth, the answers they find stretch the boundaries of their sanity and put the love of two brothers to the ultimate test of sacrifice and faith. Using fear, lies, deception and relentless paranoia as its weapons, it nests within them, stealing their bodies and minds. Now, it wants their souls. Held in the clutches of something they cannot even begin to fully comprehend, they must fight an all-consuming evil from which there is no escape, an evil born of the darkest corners of human existence--the darkest corners of DEEP NIGHT.
