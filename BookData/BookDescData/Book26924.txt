Finn Jupiter lives in the idyllic mountain town of Victory, Colorado. She’s a smart, daring, and fiercely independent young woman. She also has a gift for seeing the small things that others can’t. Connecting lines that, for most, don’t exist. While happy to live out a quiet life, hiking and climbing in The Rockies, fate has other plans for Finn. Victory is about to become ground zero for one of the most shocking disasters in U.S. history. And when her father goes missing, a victim of the catastrophe, Finn is forced to make an extraordinary decision. A decision that will question everything she knows about herself. And about what she is truly capable of.
