This collection of Trakl's essential poetry contains the two books published in his lifetime, "Gedichte "(Poems', 1913) and "Sebastian im Traum" (Sebastian in a Dream', 1914), together with the later poems published in the magazine "Der Brenner" which might have formed the nucleus of a third collection.His starkly beautiful, musical poems are rightly regarded as being among the early twentieth century's most original poetry. From a life marred by drug addiction and breakdowns, he created work of great depth and power, brought hauntingly to life in Margitt Lehbert's close and sympathetic versions.Georg Trakl (1887-1914) was born in Salzburg, Austria, where he lived apart from spells in Vienna. After qualifying as a pharmacist he spent his year of military service in the Innsbruck garrison hospital pharmacy.
