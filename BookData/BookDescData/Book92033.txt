The most celebrated society portraitist of his day, American painter John Singer Sargent (1856–1925) spent much of his life in Great Britain and Europe. His study of European art undoubtedly helped him develop a virtuoso ability to handle paint, based on the loaded-brush style of such European masters as Hals, Manet, and Velázquez. Today, he is renowned for the sensual richness of his brushwork, inventive composition,  and the refinement and flattery of his portraits. All these qualities are evident in the 16 beautiful portraits reproduced here as pressure-sensitive stickers. Included are Doctor Pozzi at Home, Lady Agnew of Lochnaw, Emily Sargent, Frederick Law Olmsted, and a dozen others.
