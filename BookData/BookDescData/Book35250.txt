When Sunrise Elementary advertised for a thick-skinned librarian with a burning love of books, Miss Lotta Scales knew she was perfect for the job. Who could guard books better than a REAL dragon?"She kept a fiery eye out to make sure no one removed any books from the shelves...The very thought of sticky little fingerstouchingandclutching,pawingandclawing,smearingandtearingher precious books just made her hot under the collar."The teachers, singed and scorched, formed a delegation. But not even sweet Miss Lemon could convince Miss Lotta Scales that "the library belonged to the children."Fortunately, nearsighted Molly Brickmeyer stumbles into a copy of "Snuff the Magic Dragon" and reads the tale out loud. Her storytelling beckons the children back to the library and brings them face to face with the Library Dragon.Can an open book temper the flames of the school's hot-headed librarian?
