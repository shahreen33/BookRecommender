 
  Knowledge is power. Dark power...
 Wren Cooper felt the sting of her vision. The Dark Witch was back and she'd taken the chief of the New Orleans Paranormal Police Department.  The door was open for Wren to wipe the slate clean and get the hell out of there. She could go back to her normal life of thieving, forgetting that her brush with Chief Lambert and the NOLO PPD ever happened.  Too bad she has a conscience.  Even worse, she happens to like Lambert. Yes, I'm talking like like.  But this isn't a simple rescue. Even with her ability to sink into shadow, Wren has never gone toe-to-toe with a Dark Witch.  To even have a chance, Wren must fully engage with the PPD. She'll have to learn to work with Officer Bibbette, which is nearly as bad as fighting a Dark Witch. She'll have to call on the members of her guild of thieves for help.  She'll need to give up everything she's ever known and become something that is dark and deadly.  In a nutshell, to save Chief Lambert, Wren Cooper has to become a badass.  *** THOUSANDS OF READERS HAVE FOUND A HOME WITH THE PARANORMAL POLICE DEPARTMENT. GET YOUR BADGE TODAY! ***
