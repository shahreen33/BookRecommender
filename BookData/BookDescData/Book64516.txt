A practical guide to identifying and targeting toxins with the most appropriate and effective detox methods• Reveals the two main types of toxins: colloidal, which affect circulation and organ function, and crystalline, which cause tissue damage and pain• Explains the toxins behind specific illnesses and which of the 5 excretory organs--liver, intestines, kidneys, lungs, or skin--should be stimulated for optimal detox• Details how specific foods can produce these toxins and trigger illnessesThe lasting benefits of detoxification and internal cleanses are becoming well-known and accepted—in part, because these practices are more vital than ever for optimal health and longevity and in the fight against environmental and dietary toxins.Christopher Vasey shows how accumulation of toxins is the primary cause of illness and how the key to successful detoxification is identifying the type of toxin--either colloidal or crystalline--polluting your biological terrain. He explains how colloidal toxins hinder circulation and organ function, while crystals move around the body damaging tissues and causing lesions and pain. Left unchecked, the two forms can combine to create “stones”--such as gallstones or kidney stones. Beyond finding the cause of an illness, the most important reason to correctly diagnose your type of toxin is to ensure you choose the most effective method of detoxification and stimulate the appropriate excretory organ--liver, intestines, kidneys, lungs, or skin. For example, a person seeking to purge his system of crystals should increase his fluid intake to stimulate the kidneys not encourage bile production, because crystals cannot be expelled via the liver.With clear, practical instructions and guidance, Vasey explains how to identify which type of toxin is triggering your illness and which medicinal herbs, hydrotherapy techniques, or nutritional options are the best choice for each specific condition or combination of ailments. He reveals which foods produce colloidal and crystalline toxins and should therefore be avoided. This targeted method of detoxification enables each of us to cleanse our bodies of accumulated toxins safely, accurately, and successfully.
