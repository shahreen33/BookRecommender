Terrified by strange noises in the night, Rebecca Linwood, the headstrong owner of an Egyptian museum, believes she is suffering from an ancient curse. Out of desperation, she seeks the help of the only man with the knowledge to reverse the evil incantation, a man whose cold heart and sinful gaze pose such an enticing contradiction. As a scholar of Egyptology and a man consumed by the pain of the past, the enigmatic Gabriel Stone shuns polite society, choosing to bury himself in his books. When a flame-haired temptress pesters him with tales of a curse, his first instinct is to flee. However, his sense of obligation proves to be a dangerous thing and the potent lure of desire too difficult to resist.
