California attorneys who represent tenants in unlawful detainer actions relied for 20 years on the first edition of this book. The second edition restructures and builds on the first edition to aid both novice and expert practitioners in quickly deciding what actions are necessary and possible, and to present a comprehensive treatment of the law.This edition retains, updates, and expands all of the substantive law discussion in the first edition, in a new and readily accessible format. Chapters were added on office procedures, negotiating strategies, and special considerations governing evictions from commercial tenancies and in rent-controlled jurisdictions. This edition also greatly expands the coverage of the first edition by adding plentiful practice tips, warnings, practical advice, checklists, sample forms (in both the book and in the accompanying CD), timelines, charts, sample fee agreements, intake forms, and other materials designed to speed and simplify the attorney's task.This book was written by Myron Moskovitz and San Francisco Neighborhood Legal Assistance Foundation attorneys. Chapter 18, on special considerations in government-assisted housing, was written by Catherine M. Bishop of the National Housing Law Project, San Francisco. Since publication in 1993, other attorneys have made substantial contributions in updating and expanding the scope of this book.
