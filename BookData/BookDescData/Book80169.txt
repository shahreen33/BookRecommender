I thought I’d left him behind in high school.Aiden was always hard to resist.Bad boy with a chiseled chest to die for.Now, years later…He’s a billionaire.And I’m in danger.Aiden is my only hope.I know he’d save me.But what happens after I fall in love?He’s still a playboy.Still drool-worthy.And me?I can’t stay away from him if I tried.My heart is on the line… again.
  Is history going to repeat itself?
