"Sharp, snarky and slick, Visaggio gives us a clever rewind to an unfolding mystery set in the early 80s." –– CHUCK WENDIG  It's 1983, and when mysterious monsters start overtaking a small town in Ohio, it's up to a teenage girl gang to save the day in this new story for fans of Paper Girls and Stranger Things.Created by powerhouse team Magdalene Visaggio (Eternity Girl) and Claudia Aguirre (Kim &amp; Kim), Morning in America follows the Sick Sisters, a group of friends and small-time delinquents who may be the only people standing between their suffocatingly small town and complete apocalyptic destruction. The Sisters know there's something wrong in Tucker, Ohio—and they also know that the authorities aren't doing anything about it. When the girls take the investigation into their own hands, they run into wild conspiracy theories, abandoned homes... and something that screeches in the night. At the end of the world, four girls with bikes and baseball bats are there to stand in the way.
