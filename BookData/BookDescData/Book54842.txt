The starlings dance in mesmerising patterns. In and out, they fold. Up and down. Far below, a Victorian pier juts out into the cold sea, standing the test of time as each generation comes before the next.  As the birds watch, they see everything. From a controversial comedian with a dark side to a fortune-teller who gets a little too close to the truth. A seaside town can be the perfect escape, but while secrets are held, it's easy to repeat the fates of those who have gone before.
