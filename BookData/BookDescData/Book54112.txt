I've managed to survive my first week in Euphoria Online. But I couldn't have done it without my new friends. Lotharia. Falkon. The Green Liver goblins.But now Lotharia's gone missing. Swallowed by that nightmare keep. Lost to the darkness.Everyone's telling me that going after her is madness. That I don't have a chance in hell.But I'm not the kind of guy to turn my back on my friends.Damn the odds.I'm going to find her.
