Kent Fisher gets more than he bargained for when Detective Inspector Ashley Goodman enlists his help with a ten year old murder. She’s on a mission and needs a big case to put her career back on track.  And they don’t come much bigger than Miles Birchill, Downland’s wealthiest and most divisive resident.  Not for the first time, Kent has doubts about the case, forcing him to make choices. But who do you trust when everyone has something to hide?  Caught in the middle, he has no alternative but to solve the murder, unaware that his every move is being watched.  The Kent Fisher novels offer a fresh and contemporary reworking of the classic whodunit and murder mysteries of authors like Agatha Christie.
