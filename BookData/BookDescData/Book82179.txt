The next delectable treat from the Cake-ily Ever After bakery in Kinship Cove will have your mouth watering. This recipe for happily ever after includes one feisty baker with a short attention span and a dragon who’s been hunting her for decades. All of the fated yumminess, none of the guilt.  * * * Try everything once. That was my rule in life, food, and dating. I never missed the opportunity to have a new adventure, play with the right flavor profiles, or spend an evening with the perfect guy. Who needed Mr. Right when there were a thousand Mr. Right Nows running around? So, when a handsome man with heat in his eyes and a little silver in his hair came waltzing into my bakery, I knew I was in trouble. He’s annoying. He’s rude. He’s demanding. And he just might be the perfect match for me.  Too bad he’s a dragon shifter, and dragons don’t do the whole fated mate thing. But maybe rules—mine and his—were meant to be broken.
