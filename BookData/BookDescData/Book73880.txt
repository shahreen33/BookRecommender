When Uncle Scrooge decides to take Donald and the nephews on a world tour to inspect the many businesses in his far-flung empire, he never dreamed he’d wind up uncovering the fabled lost treasure of the even-more fabled King Solomon! Then, to settle a bet over who’s the better salesman, Scrooge and Donald wind up in Southeast Asia - and Donald’s winning! Until Scrooge notices something unusual about the local architecture in "City of Golden Roofs." And the Beagle Boys come calling again with a devious scheme to drill Scrooge’s money right out from under him! Plus: the oddball inventions of the ever-eccentric Gyro Gearloose! Carl Barks delivers another superb collection of clever plot twists, laugh-out-loud comedy, and all-around comic book brilliance.
