This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN B01M7UCT3P.In the seedy underworld of 1940’s New York, revenge tastes like cherry pie with a side of lipstick and perfume. The Avon Lady is in town…  Betty Jones is a woman with a dark past, which she paints each day with Avon cosmetics and a picture-perfect smile. She’s created a new life with her naïve-but-loveable husband George, and their children, Nancy and George Junior. Despite the protective walls that she has built around her world, Betty is unable to live with the continuing existence of the people who once ruined her, so she embarks on a cold-blooded vigilante mission to be rid of them once and for all.
