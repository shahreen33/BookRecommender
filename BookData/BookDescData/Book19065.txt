This book started out as being a guide to the league table of the best and the worst of food and drinks companies for fairness, honesty, speed of response and friendliness. This soon changed, though, when police were called in by some of the companies being researched by the author and his team. Fear of what could be unearthed brought this about. The gloves were off in this David Vs Goliath battle. The author takes the role of consumer champ. FROM THE AUTHORA jewel of a bad book, and when I look back at the writing style and setting out … they are cringeworthy! I wouldn’t say it is the worst book ever written, as a lot of emotional effort went in to it. Some really badly written stuff gets published for various reasons. I hold this book up as an example of how not to write a book. If you are bored or have half a day to spare then by all means invest the time in reading this, otherwise consider getting it for free from Amazon’s Kindle Owners’ Lending Library. However, I recall having great fun writing this back in 1999! It was raw writing and, perhaps, misdirected anger at anything I could aim at. Since writing this I have changed writing genres and solely concentrate on self-help, although I guess this could be considered, in the loosest sense of the word, to be self-help. One reviewer claimed that this book is a confused jumble of complaining letters to manufacturers and retailers, an interview with the police, some product testing, exposé of a kebab factory, plugs for the author's other books and is littered with typos. I agree! But I had great time writing it.
