Camden  I had spent so much of my life alone, disconnected, unable to form any kind of lasting bonds. After so long, I had begun to believe that was all there would ever be for me, had come to accept it as my reality. Then there she was. Everything I wasnâ€™t, everything I convinced myself I could never have. But, God, I wanted.   Annie  I had been on my own for so long. Hopping states, changing towns, never able to put down roots, make friends, form connections. It was how it had to be. There was no other option for me. I had long since learned to come to peace with that. Until Cam. Until there was a reason to want to stay, to want to build with someone, to finally get all the things I had been denied. Even as I started to let myself believe any of that was possible, my past found me once again, ripped everything away from me. Ripped him away from me. And everything we had just begun to explore.
