Once again Tom Booth, author of Don't Blink!, breaks the fourth wall to delight and entice readers young and old in this sweet and funny, experiential picture book.How did you find this book? Don't you know this book is a secret book?Readers will delight in being asked how they found this book. Did Monkey tell? Was it Owl? Giraffe?Maybe the animal who "told" would rather share than keep a secret. Especially when sharing a book as good as this one makes him so happy!
