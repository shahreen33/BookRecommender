Abandoning the format of workbooks-as-you-know-them, the Wild at Heart Field Manual takes men on a journey through which John Eldredge encourages them to be dangerous. Simply look at the dreams and desires written in the heart of every boy: To be a hero, to be a warrior, to live a life of adventure and risk. Sadly, most men abandon those dreams and desires, aided by a Christianity that feels like nothing more than pressure to be a "nice guy." It is no wonder that many men avoid church, and those who go are often passive and bored to death. In this provocative book, Eldredge gives men permission to be what God designed them to be -- dangerous, passionate, alive, and free. This book is filled with questions, exercises, journaling ideas, and guided exploration of the arts that will lead men on a journey to discover the masculine heart that God gave them.
