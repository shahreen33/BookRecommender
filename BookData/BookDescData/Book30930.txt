  The steep descent into Hell is always paved with good intentions.
My name is Jemma Blackburn, and I'm a Slayer. Finding out I wasn't human was only the beginning of my problems. My best-friend, Taylor, is still missing, and so is the Immortal Amulet, and it's my job alone to get them both back. I don't know who I can trust, and I'm still not sure I'm cut out for any of this, but I'm determined to figure it all out, or die trying.As if that wasn't bad enough, there's a new enemy in town and they've come bearing gifts—an ancient prophesy that is going to blur the very lines between good and evil. And, apparently, my blood is tied to the center of it. I don't have all the answers yet, but I’m getting closer and closer to discovering the truth. The truth about my bloodlines, and about who I really am. And, believe me when I say, it's going to change everything.
