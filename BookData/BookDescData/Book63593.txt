Spies are as busy now as they were during the Cold War and intelligence generally has wider ramifications. This work shows how espionage, the craft or trade of spying - together with counter-espionage - is extensive in its variety and enterprise. More money is spent on it than any activity other than the arms trade, with which espionage is connected. Millions of people will never meet a spy, and they wouldn't recognize him or her if they did. The spies of the real world sometimes live through more dangerous experiences than those of fiction.
