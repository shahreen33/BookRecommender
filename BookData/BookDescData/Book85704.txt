 One uncovered truth shines a light on the throne of lies I’ve been sitting on for years.  A revelation with the power to test the bonds of brotherhood like never before.  My ruthless obsession to protect what’s mine burns hotter than ever.  Promises I’ve made to my brothers I burn to keep.  Vows made to my wife I swear to honor.  Through the web of tangled loyalties, one thing remains clear.  Hope is embedded in my soul.  A love so rare I’ve spilled blood to protect it.  Together, we’ve built something beautiful, significant, and ours.  With her by my side, my reign is complete.
