One story. Two couples.I proposed on our first date. She laughed and told me I was insane. Less than a day later, she said yes.It was a whirlwind, but we were happy… Until we got greedy and wanted a family.It was a life I couldn’t give her, not for lack of trying. Fertility just wasn’t on our side. We sought out doctors and treatments. Spent money we didn’t have. Lied to our families. Smiled for our friends. Put on a brave face for a world that didn’t understand.Finally, we were successful…Until we were forced to bury our son.We were left broken, battered, and destroyed.They say love is in the details, but it was the details that ruined us.This is the story of how I took back what had always been mine.The retrieval of my wife and our family.
