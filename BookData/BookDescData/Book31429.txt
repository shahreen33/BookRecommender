Valentine's Inc. Book 2. Rough and tumble biker, Harold Jackson, has no interests beyond making sure his grandmother, MiMi, has everything she needs, stepping into the boxing ring every once in a while, and working his life away in his automotive garage, Jackson’s Auto. When a sassy little number walks into his life through an open bay door, Jackson doesn’t know what to think. Westley is witty, adorable, and has no qualms about going head to head with him. Then Westley announces that he works for Valentine’s Inc. and has been hired to help Jackson jump back into the dating scene. Will he dig his heels in or open himself up to find out what he’s been missing?  Work, school, work, repeat. Westley’s life feels like it’s on a constant loop running from one job to the next trying to make ends meet and pay for his online classes. Being a dating specialist for Valentine’s Inc. isn’t the most steady work, but it’s always an adventure. Only he never imagined someone’s grandmother hiring him to woo her grandson out of his shell. Jackson isn’t like anyone he’s ever been on a date with, for work or pleasure, but he’s determined to help the rough man let out more of the tender side he keeps under wraps, even if Westley can’t keep him for himself.
