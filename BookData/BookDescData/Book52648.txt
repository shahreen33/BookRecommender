Everyone expects the fairy tale from me. Because on the outside, I look like I live in a fantasy. I'm a hopeless romantic. I fall in and out of love. I change careers, zip codes and hair colors on a whim. I'm a free spirit without a care in the world. I'm the one that loves everyone and hates no one.  But I've got a secret...  I'm not a free spirit. Not really. I'm not free at all. My life is only designed to look chaotically peaceful. I'm only designed to look like that. Peace is lost to me. Because I'm trying to escape something. Trying to escape him. My life isn't a fairy tale. It's time the world saw that.
