The second and final book in the Dirtier Duet by Lisa Renee Jones.  Abbie swore that she was done with rich, powerful men. They've hurt her. They've hurt her mother, who she will do anything to protect. She's done playing the submissive. She's ready to fight back.  The problem is that Gabe Maxwell is one of those rich, powerful men and he refuses to be ignored. He's in her path and she can't seem to steer clear of him. He wants her. She wants him. But it's not that simple.  There is more to her story, more than Gabe knows, but then, there is more to Gabe's story than Abbie knows, too.
