This is what I signed up for.I knew it from the start.I'm the newest prospect for the Deathstalkers MC Club.I'll do whatever they ask--whenever they want it done.No questions.I'll take their bullshit and follow orders, like nobody's business.Cuz once I get that patch, that label, I'm in.But when one of the old ladies takes in a stray,I can't help but feel the pull toward her.Izzy makes me question everything.But I can't.I have to sit back and pray like Hell that someone else,One of these bastards doesn't claim her for himself.If he does, I have to let her go,Let her walk away,Into his arms,His bed.And I can't do that.Deathstalker prospect or not,I know what I want,And I want her.
