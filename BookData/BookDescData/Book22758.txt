She hates him from the bottom of her heart, but, even so, she can’t deny her growing attraction. Thinking it’s high time to put on the brakes, Emely turns her attention to Luca, the intriguing new man she’s only ever met online. With two men pulling her in different directions, Emely must decide which of them is showing her his true self. After all the work she’s done to learn to trust again, will Emely’s efforts be for nothing?
