Japanese edition of Scarlett. Scarlett Flynn is not adjusting to her parents' divorce, causing lots of trouble at school and at home. Her mother had enough and sent her to her father to live in a remote Irish town. Infuriated at the move, she isolates herself and spends time at the lake (lough) where she meets a gypsy boy and his horse. She eventually transforms into a loveable family girl. In Japanese.
