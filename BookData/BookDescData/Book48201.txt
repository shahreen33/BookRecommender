"Ma'am, you sound like a very reasonable person. Can I advise you to just move?" A young family moves into a neighbourhood with a reputation for crime. As they make their home in one of the oldest parts of the city, Carissa Halton reflects on the changing view from her little yellow house. While others nervously examine the less than-stellar reputation of her surroundings, she heads out to meet her neighbours, and through them discovers the innate beauty in her community. Halton invites us to meet a cast of diverse characters including cat rescuers, tragic teens, art evangelists, and crime fighters, whose walks of life, though very different from her own, has led to them being the people in her neighbourhood. Threaded through this collection of essays are questions about the social and economic forces that shape and reshape our cities.
