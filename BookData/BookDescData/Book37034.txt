It's 1930s London, and Lady Georgiana -- thirty-fourth in line to the throne -- has a lot on her plate, but little in her cupboards, in this national bestseller...Baked beans and boiled eggs. That's what my houseguest, the Bavarian princess, will have to eat if I don't get help posthaste. The Queen of England has requested I entertain said princess, placing her in the playboy prince's path, in hopes he might finally marry.But queens never consider money, of which I have little. And which is why I moonlight as a maid-in-disguise. My plans:1) Clean house in manner of palace.2) Blackmail brother, Binky, into sending a few quid.3) Unteach Princess Hanni English from gangster movies -- lest she address the queen as "old broad."4) Keep eye on princess at parties, where she drinks like a fish.Then there's the matter of the body in the bookshop and Hanni's unwitting involvement with the communist party. It's enough to drive a girl mad...
