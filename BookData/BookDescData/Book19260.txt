Hibino Tsubaki is a young girl starting her freshman year of high school who is addicted to one thing - doing hair. Although she does not have the confidence to make herself look cute wearing "in style" clothing and great hairstyles, she enjoys creating cute hair styles for her little sister. In her new high school, it is a custom to have the top scoring student make the entrance speech, however, on the day of the entrance ceremony, she is beaten ironically by a male student named "Kyouta Tsubaki" who has very long hair for a boy! Even though he is the smartest, he is also the rudest guy she's ever met - and she unfortunately ends up sitting next to him in class. This leads to her chopping off a good chunk of his hair because of the rude things he says to her. He demands for her to pay the price, which is either 50,000 yen, or her body. Misunderstanding what he says, she does something totally different from what he expects.
