In the darkness under the Tower, Majilda must face the dread thing that lurks there, because if she doesn’t then the story would be highly unlikely to go anywhere. Also, her beloved eagle-type bird has been injured, and has hinted at all sorts juicy mysteries it might be able to reveal, if only it were to be healed… But when she emerges, Majilda finds the Tower itself is under dire threat. Now Majilda is embarking on one of those things heroes really love: a quest. Accompanied by the dour yet broodingly erotic Ravenglass, his muscular steed Muncaster, the impossibly tall librarian, and the almost professionally annoying Elainer, Majilda must ride forth into the world and do a load of magic stuff. But threats threaten the party from both inside and out (really threatening ones) - and if Majilda is to face them, will magic be with her?
