From despair comes loathing, from loathing comes solitude, from solitude comes wisdom, from wisdom comes growth, and from growth sprouts a new perspective on life. This is the core of The feeling May Remain: The icebergs of pain, loss, and grief, submerged in the ocean of love, selfâ€“care, and healing. The Feeling May Remain brings the first substantial collection of Akif Kichloo's work to the public. The title Feeling May Remain can be interpreted as an adjective or as a short declarative sentence, something to think about right away. Amidst the uncertainties of this amazing, terrible, magical, horrible yet beautiful life, as Akif puts it, his writing brings new perspectives to existence, with poems that range from cute and sexy to stark and dead serious, hence speaking in more than one way to the sensibilities of his readers.
