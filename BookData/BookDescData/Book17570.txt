What if the fairy tale came true?In this bittersweet love story, it isn't Beauty who needs to discover the man inside the Beast—but the man himself.When Alix Miller takes off for a remote spot in New Hampshire to paint a portrait of the reclusive aristocrat, Leland Crompton, nothing has prepared her for what's in store. The housekeeper is unnerving. The castle-like house—with its massive chimney, mullioned windows, and ironwork gate with wrought-iron roses—gives her chills. And Lee himself is disfigured by a rare, genetic disease. In the long hours of work that follow, deep in the wintry woods, Alix discovers that beneath Lee's exterior lies a remarkable man, a man she could come to love. The problem lies in convincing Lee.
