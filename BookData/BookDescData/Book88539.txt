There’s a new badge in the land of crime fiction… and it’s pinned on a man who can stand tall alongside lawmen like Raylan Givens, Walt Longmire, and Jesse Stone. Sheriff Colt Harper lives by his own moral code. His relentless crusade against drug crimes in his rural Mississippi County infuriates a Memphis mobster who sends Hack, his cold-blooded assassin, to stop him. ATF Special Agent Molly McDonough, looking to save her troubled career, follows Hack’s trail of corpses to Harper’s turf. The fates of Harper, McDonough and Hack collide in a bloody, brutal showdown for justice, redemption and survival that can only be fought outside the law.
