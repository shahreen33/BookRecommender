Adam	spotted a woman on the ground.”		Adam, an eighteen year-old with autism, unwittingly gets caught up in the evil network of human trafficking the day he finds Marina on the ground.

He can't fathom, however, the horrific existence Marina has led prior to appearing in his neighborhood.	Marina, abducted from her country of Moldova, has landed in America and somehow managed to escape. Starving, filthy, and exhausted, she has nowhere to turn and desperately needs Adam's assistance. But what will Adam's father think of him allowing this emaciated refugee into their home?	Adam's father Bruce has his own troubles as the sole caregiver of Adam while trying to hold down a regular job. How will he take on the added responsibility of protecting Marina from the traffickers who are intent on recapturing her? Can he successfully protect both her and his childlike son?
