Rio is hot, steamy, and a little bit dangerous.Gabe Rocha hasn’t been back to Rio since he and his mother left more than ten years ago. He’d always dreamed of showing his best friend Nick the real Rio, but when disaster strikes, he’s stuck with Jemma instead.Jemma Keane doesn’t like her boss, and she really doesn’t like her boss' best friend. He’s bossy and rude and makes her want things she can’t explain. She’s supposed to be working in Rio, but all she wants to do is play--with Gabe.Jemma’s nothing like what Gabe imagined, and definitely nothing like Nick described. Gabe’s seen enough romantic comedies to know how a summer fling with Jemma might end, but what he anticipates the least is that he never wants it to.
