Cambridge Books announces the publication of C. M. Albrecht's fourteenth novel, a step away from crime and mystery. In "Hail Mary" his latest tale, the only mystery is how three slightly tarnished "Golden Girls" manage to survive a wake for Mary's husband. Booze, marijuana, an aircraft Mary doesn't know how to fly, and out of gas at 3,000 ft. along with some bad-ass actor bikers converge upon them with a vengeance but Mary's son Creighton probably suffers more than the girls do. Available in July from Cambridge Books, amazon.com. nook.com and most venues. "I laughed more at this than at anything I've ever read." — Martha A.
