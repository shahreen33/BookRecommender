The South Louisiana Sleep Disorders Institute promises to let you live out your dreams in your sleep--to experience them so strongly that afterwards you won't be able to tell the difference between them and real memories. The Institute Director claims to use these lucid dreams only as therapy for her clients. But when one of the clinic's clients and two of its neighbors are murdered, Detective Mark French finds that the institute also has more sinister purposes.
