New York Times bestselling author Lori Foster turns up the heat with these two timeless talesÂ 
  TRAPPED!
Firefighter Ethan Winters may be his hometown's new hero, but he's played a starring role in Rosie Carrington's fantasies for years. And Rosie has had just about enough of waiting patiently for Ethan to get over the past and see what's right under his nose. She'll do whatever it takes to fan the flames between them...but will Ethan prove too hot to handle?
  RILEY
Regina Foxworth has no clue why an unknown assailant is out to get a small-town reporter like her. Or why the police won't take her concerns seriously. So Regina gets a guard dog - make that a four-pound "guard" Chihuahua! - and signs up for self-defense classes. But defending herself is the last thing on her mind when sexy instructor Riley Moore has her pinned to the mat.
