  In Apalachicola, FL, what goes in the river doesn't always stay there.
When some locals find a dead woman in the jaws of a gator, it's fairly upsetting. When Lt. Maggie Redmond finds lifelong friend Axel Blackwell in the dead woman's hotel room, it's a little more upsetting than that.Axel becomes the chief suspect in his ex-wife's murder, but Maggie is convinced that he would never harm the beautiful but tragic Marisol Corzo.As Axel deals with his loss, and the potential loss of his freedom, Maggie works to unravel the evidence, evidence that suggests Marisol brought about her own demise. Drug dealers from down south seek to expand their commerce to the sleepy, coastal town of Apalachicola, FL, and it seems that the dead woman is the one who led them there.As Maggie tries to understand who Marisol really was, she also comes to terms with who she really is, and with her true connection to town crime lord Bennett Boudreaux.Told with the dry humor, rich coastal atmosphere, and character-driven suspense for which the series is known, Apparent Wind is the 7th book in the Forgotten Coast Florida Suspense series. Although the series is best enjoyed read in order, Apparent Wind can be read as a standalone novel.&lt;
