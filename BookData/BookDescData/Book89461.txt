America's intelligence security is in the hands of a million private contractors. Now one woman may bring down their entire system.Four months ago, Alex Vane lost his friend James Stacy, killed by private security contractors working for the intelligence-industrial complex. Though Alex exposed the killers, most of the system survived, including the amoral torturer known only as Amand. Now, he and others continue to operate a web of security companies worldwide, off the record and accountable to no law.James's widow Innerva Shah is taking a different route to her revenge. From within Cuba's internet desert, she has quietly penetrated the system of contractors that run America's security. Now she's launching the largest ransomware attack in history, with the aim of burning that system to the ground.When he learns that Amand and his forces may be closing in on Innerva, Alex makes a desperate attempt to save her. With Innerva's surrender-or-die deadline only hours away, Alex finds himself in Cuba, threatened from every direction, and the only person he can count on is the wife he almost lost.
