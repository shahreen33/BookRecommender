Mia wants a dog more than anything. But according to her mom, there is just NO ROOM in their very small apartment. Then one day, when she and her grandma are visiting a friend who is giving away puppies, Mia falls in love with a small spotted pup who crawls into her lap. She knows she just has to convince her mom to let her keep him! With help from Grandma --- and some of her pet-owning friends --- can Mia show her mom how much room there really is in their apartment?In this charming picture book from Elizabeth Suneby and Laurel Molk, an I-want-a-dog story meets the Yiddish folk tale about how things could always be worse --- to comic effect! With a narrative and illustrations that are action-packed, this is a terrific read-aloud. The timely messages about the importance of gratitude for what one has, the need for generosity and the inclusion of others --- ?there's always room for one more? --- resonate. This book makes a wonderful social studies resource for discussions about families and communities, with an intergenerational storyline full of endearing characters --- Mia, her mother and her grandmother live in the same apartment building, along with a diverse cast of neighbors. It also works for character education lessons on kindness, perseverance and initiative.
