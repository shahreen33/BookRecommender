In The German Messenger, David Malcolm spins a gripping and sombre tale of a daring attempt by British and German spies to stop the gratuitous bloodletting of WWI. British secret agent and cosmopolitan man of violence Harry Draffen journeys from the slums of East London to an Oxford college, from the trenches on the Western Front to an isolated house on the Scottish coast, on to a bloody showdown in the North of England, to chase a phantom and elusive German messenger.
