The mess all started when I punched a 400-year-old fairy reality TV star in the throat.Things got really weird from there.Before I could blink, I was fighting wererats, getting kidnapped by superheroes, stealing a cape inhabited by the ghost of a magical genius, and trying to save the world alongside a 2,000-year-old immortal who wields a piece of Noah's Ark. All while struggling to not get evicted or fired from my job.That was just Monday. Tuesday is shaping up to be busier.My name is Sage Hawthorne: butt-kicking sorceress, professional bodyguard, amateur superhero, and occasional screwup.For the world's sake, let's hope this isn't one of those times I screw up.
