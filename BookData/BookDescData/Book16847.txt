Two men, who have every reason in the world to run from what they're feeling, find they cannot deny themselves a chance at a love like this.  Lincoln McCaw lost everything after he caused a fatal accident. A year later, he's drowning the guilt and despair in whiskey, but he needs to move on. His sister and her kids are counting on him. Then he meets a man who ignites a passion Lincoln thought he'd never find. Too bad one night is all they can have together. Now he needs to figure out how to turn away from the only person who makes him feel alive before whoever is sending him threats decides Lincoln needs to suffer more than he already has.  Jay Miller is surrounded by grief and misery until he finally gives in to all those years of sexual fantasies about being with another guy. Realizing he's ended up in the arms of the man who caused his wife's accident, he tries to pull away. But how can he give up a friendship he needs more than anythingâ€”a friendship and a love that could save him? He may not have time to make the choice before someone else destroys it all.
