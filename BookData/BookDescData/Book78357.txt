Everything in my life has had a predetermined path. The success of the band had to come first. Iâ€™ve put my feelings on hold long enough. The time is finally right. Mason Wilder is America's most eligible rock star. Now, I'm going to make him mine. She's my best friend's little sister. She's off limits. She's Tessa Blade Garcia, a girl who knows what she wants and isn't afraid to go after it. And now she's after me. I've know her since the day she was born, but it's taken me 22 years to realize how much I love her. Just when everything seems perfect, my world get turned upside down, and I need to take sides between people I've loved and trusted my entire life, and someone I never thought I'd see again.
