Pride is the devil’s bullet, but envy pulls the trigger.  Nobody gets Tribal. Not like she did. No one understands what he went through or what made him temporarily flee the MC lifestyle. It was that kid. It all started with the kid. He couldn’t save him, and now he’s wrought with inner turmoil. His old rage is set to simmer and only one woman knows his deepest, darkest secrets, but she wants nothing to do with him anymore.  Horizon is in an all-female MC of her own now. She’s the Iron Butterfly, a knife-wielding enforcer hellbent on shutting down a Russian human trafficking ring. When she’s sent to her grandmother’s casino to investigate its role in this Black Market Railroad, she finds herself face to face with a past lover, ripping open old scars and tearing fresh wounds.  Mel has messed everything up. She’s lied, she’s cheated, and she’s single-handedly destroyed her ability to hang with the Razorblade Tumbleweeds MC. They want nothing to do with her now. Her two options are to leave town and start over someplace new or stick around and begin that fresh life in the RZBT MC’s backyard, in a place nobody would ever imagine she’d go.  Bikers, strippers, human traffickers, the Bratva, and a serial killer collide in Pride’s Envy, book 3 in the Razorblade Tumbleweeds MC series.  Please be advised that the books in the Razorblade Tumbleweeds MC series should be read in order.
