A graphic novel about spooky thrills and how ghosts may not behave the way you expect them to, especially if the person looking for them is British.Harsho’s story is anti-colonial and deals with one of Bengal’s favourite ghosts, Siraj Ud Dowlah who was defeated by Robert Clive at the Battle of Plassey, having been betrayed by Mir Jafar who was made Nawab by the British in return for treason. Siraj ud Dowlah’s body was never found, but Harsho puts his own twist on the story — after showing the Nawab running and having a sword thrust in the back by the British.
