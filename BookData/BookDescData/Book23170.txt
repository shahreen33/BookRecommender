The Tallowmere Annual is a unique collection of words, sound, and ink paintings by musician and artist Keaton Henson.This hardback, special limited edition, mixed-media book tells the fragmented story of a town that never existed, Tallowmere, seemingly empty, showing only outlines of living things, words once spoken, and the sounds of distant mourning.The first of its kind, the bookâ€™s front cover holds an MP3 pack embedded with an audio jack for headphones and sound controls. Readers can plug in and listen to a recorded score created specially by Keaton as an accompaniment to reading the book and viewing the artwork.
