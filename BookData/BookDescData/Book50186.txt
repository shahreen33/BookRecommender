Obsessive sexual submissive, Eden Rose, is sometimes a shy waif, sometimes a sultry vamp, sometimes an unruly brat. Running in panic from her master, Jacob, to attorney Adam Cady, she seeks a safe haven from the ruthless man that owns her life. However, telling the astute attorney half-truths, she quickly learns that he can see behind her charades and lies. And when he delivers her into the safety of his summer home, far from her former lover's grasp, she discovers a new master she must meet face to face.Serving this man requires surrendering to all she fears, to whips and chains and bondage, to anal sex and orgies, to his initials fused to her ass with fire and ink, and nights of captivity bathed in his unusual brand of love.For the extremes in sexual dominance/submission rendered graphically, to shock, provoke and please, follow Adam &amp; eden into their garden of light and dark, pleasure and punishment, love and surrender.
