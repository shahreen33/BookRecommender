I didn't see it coming, didn't realize how different everything would be within the space of a month. I would fall in love with one man, I would kill another, and I would lose my body, my mind, my soul - my freedom to them. I was an operative, a strong woman, someone sent in to save others, but under these two men I became weak - or pretended to be. I didn't like being weak, it angered me. If I had free rein I could cut my masters in two. But I wasn't there for pride, I was there to free those women and to take down the two men who sold them as sex slaves.Those men needed to be punishedAnd I would do itNo matter the costOr how much I lostBecause I am Rita KovakMY MASTERS' NIGHTMARE#Dark EroticaPlease note: Like a television series, this book series is broken up into episodes. Each episode is approximately 20,000 words long. There are fifteen episodes in Season 1 with three collections containing five episodes each. There are no plans for a second season. Instead, the characters will be moving to the three spin off series: The Santini Brothers, The Five Families, and possibly Frano & Rita.Warning: This series is a soap opera, so has crazy plot twists. It also has M/F and M/M non-con and dub-con. It is very dark and violent, so if this isn't for you, don't read it. R18
