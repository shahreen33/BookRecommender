Dear Mum and Dad,This is just to let you know that I took the torch, the hammer, the gardening trowel, the plastic strainer, the chocolate biscuits and the stuff that&amp;#39;s missing from the bathroom. So it&amp;#39;s OK, you haven&amp;#39;t been burgled. Please don&amp;#39;t worry, things are looking better than I thought opal-wise.Love, KeithWhat does a kid do when his Mum and Dad are worry warts?Make them rich, decides Keith. Very, very rich.It&amp;#39;s a brilliant planâ€“if it works.
