  What is a reverse harem?
 A harem is not all sex. A true harem focuses on the relationships between a group of individuals centered around a single person. In reverse harem, that one person is female. The Messenger series is a true slow-burn reverse harem. The female main character forms relationships (some sexual, some emotional) with more than three males. Slow-burn means the sexual elements of the harem develop over the course of the series.
