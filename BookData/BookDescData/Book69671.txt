"Between Lost and Found is moving, thoughtful, and entirely original. The small town of Mammoth Falls, with its cast of characters that are wild, imperfect, and human, leaps off the page. Shelly Stratton is adept at portraying just how complicated the human heart can be." - Taylor Jenkins Reid, author of Maybe in Another Life Janelle Marshall's life is finally going according to plan. Her perfect, upscale career and her perfect, successful boyfriend will make her future as secure and predictable as her childhood never was. And with luck, Little Bill, the grandfather who raised her, will someday understand why she d rather play it safe than be impulsive. But just when she should be happiest, she gets a distressing call: Little Bill has gone missing. Now Janelle must go to the one place she's long avoided the tiny mountain town of Mammoth Falls, South Dakota. Tracking down her eccentric grandfather is easier said than done, and Janelle has no choice but to stay as long as it takes. Yet little by little, she's drawn in by the unique town, the helpful locals, and their distinctly straightforward ways. Before long, she realizes that those who also care about Little Bill are struggling with their own vulnerabilities and secrets as deep as the mistakes they try to set right. As Janelle learns to draw on their support and hard-won experience, she'll challenge her past, come to terms with her present and chart her own surprising course forward. Vibrant, heartfelt, and uplifting, Between Lost and Found is about gaining the courage to take chances, learning to let go, and rediscovering the family and the self you thought you knew "
