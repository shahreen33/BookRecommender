One bad decision, and Maddie is thrown into a detention center where she's forced to undergo secretive treatment meant to squash her rebellious streak. The powers that be call it rehabilitation. Maddie calls it torture.Alone, Maddie will not survive. But if she can find something to hold on to - an image of Justin, their love - maybe she can fight.
