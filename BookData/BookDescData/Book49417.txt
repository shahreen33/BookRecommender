“Sandra Hill writes stories that tickle the funnybone and touch the heart.”—Susan Wiggs, New York Times bestselling authorOh those Vikings! Fans of Sandra Hill adore the sexy Norse studs the New York Times bestselling author so masterfully brings to life in her brazenly original, outrageously funny, and scorching hot love stories. In Truly, Madly Viking, the phenomenal Hill transports her muscle-bound Scandinavian warrior hero magically across centuries and lands him in a modern-day mental hospital—where one lucky female psychologist who gets to “treat” the gorgeous Norseman she calls “Joe.” This is One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest Sandra Hill-style—a gift of love and laughter from the author who superstar Christine Feehan says, “always delivers smart, sexy, laugh-out-loud action.”
