All Bella wants is a family who loves her for the dog she is. And perhaps some popcorn now and then (with extra butter). But with Christmas growing nearer and a new baby on the way, her adopted family finds that they have little patience and even less time for a dog. After she accidentally topples their Christmas tree, Bella finds herself being dropped off at the pound. When a new couple adopts her, Bella wants to believe she has found her forever home. But upon realizing that the Laras are expecting a child of their own, Bella begins to wonder if she will ever find a family who truly loves her, or if she will always just be “Bad Bella.”
