"Japan is in ruins after the second World War. Takuya, a demobilized officer returns to his native village only to learn that the Occupation authorities are intensifying their efforts to apprehend suspected war criminals. Will they learn of his involvement in the execution of American prisoners during the last days of the war? To avoid prosecution, Takuya becomes a fugitive in his own country." "As he travels on crowded trains through a land of defeat, humiliation, and hunger, he fears that his past will catch up with him. And yet Takuya doesn't feel like a criminal. After all, he had only been following orders. Why should an honest and dutiful man be prosecuted by the very people who dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, slaughtering countless innocent civilians?"--BOOK JACKET.
