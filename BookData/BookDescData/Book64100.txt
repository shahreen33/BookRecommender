Three years after the catastrophe that almost eliminated the human race, the little town of Rocheport, Missouri struggles to survive. Enemies without and dissension within tax Bill Arthur’s ability to govern the community and bring about the long march back to the 21st century.  But Bill learns Rocheport is not alone. Other communities are attempting to create their version of utopia and some of those versions look more like hell than heaven.  As opposition to his dream grows from within the community, Bill finds help from a most unlikely person — an eighteen-year old girl, who also wants to be the leader of Rocheport. The question in Bill’s mind is whose side is she really on?  The Troubled City continues the saga of Bill Arthur, armchair libertarian philosopher, former bureaucrat, and survivalist, as he tries to pull together disparate groups to form a community that will endure and bring back civilization.
