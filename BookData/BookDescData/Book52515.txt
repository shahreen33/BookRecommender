StormI had one job, get Jessica "Rabbit" Finley to sell her property to Reed Security. I could do that. I was Army Strong. Hell, I took down bad guys for a living. I could handle this sexy vixen. No problem. Except, she's a little crazy. She thinks that there are ghosts on her property, and she has the men at Reed Security believing her too. But then I found out her history and it had me wondering....Was she really crazy?JessicaI've never known who I really am. My family history has been contorted into something that I can only hope to unravel in my lifetime. But then I got a clue that led me to buy this creepy insane asylum. I was told there were answers here and I'm finding them, along with ghosts that still haunt this estate. There's an upside, though. There's a sexy man here to keep me company. But the closer I get to finding my answers, the closer I get to being locked up in the asylum myself.
