A Book to Die For is the second book in Houston's To Die For series. Jake Martin is not your ordinary sleuth. He's an outsourced software engineer, handyman and writer. This time the story takes place in the foothills of Denver. Jake is accused of manslaughter and he has to prove the accident was really murder. Along the way he encounters a poaching ring and falls in love with a beautiful game warden. The characters are memorable and the plot is multilayered. It keeps the reader guessing who dun-it until the very end.
