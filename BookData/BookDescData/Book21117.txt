The beautiful land of Bantaniomos had everything - the great smell of the ocean, the pathways were made of cobblestone, and the streets were gray bricks. The buildings looked like they were centuries old, but they had been kept up. And the best thing? They had a hunk as a Prince.  But for Anna from Montana, going there was the perfect escape from her usual life, and she didn't care much for the Prince - until she was suddenly kidnapped and was woken up in the palace.  She suddenly found herself in a competition for the Prince's heart - Anna sure doesn’t know how, but she knew that she had to stay away from the Prince as much as she could. With her mischievous ways and un-royal manners, she was sure that the Prince wouldn’t pick her.  But what if the Prince was as determined to be with her as she was determined to stay away from him?
