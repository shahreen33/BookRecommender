  The Abyss is full of terrors, but the mines aren't much better. Gareth is with me every step of the way, protecting me and giving me more pleasure than I believed possible...
  I thought once we reached the mines our journey would be at an end. With or without Clotty, we would travel to the winter realm and start our life together just as I'd sworn to Gareth all those months ago. But how can I stop when freedom for all is so near?
  Risking a rift between us, I plot a new course - one that has its own dangers. But I promise, at the end of this adventure, I'll be with my mate just as I vowed... Unless fate has other plans...
  Lily's Note: Book 8 is the final chapter of Beth and Gareth's love story. There will be more books in the Fae's Captive series and another series set in the world of Arin coming very soon. Thank you for coming with me on this journey, and I hope you all find your fated mates ASAP. Much love, Lily
