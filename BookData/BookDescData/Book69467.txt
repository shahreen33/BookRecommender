The Christmas season is often one of the busiest and most stressful times of the year, and it's easy to lose sight of what makes it special. Helping us refocus on what's truly important, well-known pastor and author John Piper leads readers through twenty-four short meditations on Advent. The devotionalsâ€”drawn from Piper's extensive preaching and teaching ministry--lead readers to ponder afresh the birth of Jesus, Israel's long-awaited Messiah and the Savior of the world. Reflecting on several Scriptural texts, this accessible volume aims to direct individuals, families, and churches to the most glorious dawning of indestructible joy the world has ever seen: the incarnation of the Son of God.
