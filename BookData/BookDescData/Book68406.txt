FIRST BATTLEWith sure ans steady moves, Sai and Hikaru are making a name Hikaru Shindo as the one who might possibly beat the venerable Akira Toya. Wait. Who are we kidding? Hikaru: sure and steady...? Yeah, right! In between all the shenanigans Hikaru gets himself into during school and after, and dealing with Sai's unhappy sobs when Hikaru tries to run away from playing Go, his fame is growing. Principals, teachers and Go tournament kids alike are all wondering who this unruly bronco of a Go player is. Tetsuo, a Shogi punk who has a beef of his own with Akira, harasses poor Hikaru at first - then later puts him on his own Go team! Meanwhile, Akira, looking for a rematch with Hikaru, is surprised to find Hikaru playing with a third-rate Go club. You won't be disappointed with the further adventures of this dynamic Go duo!
