  Can a gentle giant with a trampled heart show a man who’s been running all his life that sometimes there are monsters worth running towards? 
 A werewolf walks into a bar. Tank is working as a bouncer when he notices something odd about the new sexy-as-sin bartender. He’s odorless, he’s amazingly popular with shifters, and he’s terrified.  A man without a smell. Isaac is trying to escape his past. He hides in San Francisco because everyone knows that there are no werewolves in the Bay Area. Until one walks into his bar.  Can Tank figure out Isaac’s secrets in time to save him? And can Isaac forgive Tank for being a wolf in time to learn how to love? New York Times best selling author Gail Carriger (writing as G.L. Carriger) brings you the next in her charming gay werewolves series. The San Andreas Shifter books stand alone and do not have to be read in any particular order. But if you're a stickler this book is preceded by Bryan &amp; Max's story, The Sumage Solution. Delicate Sensibilities? This book contains M/M sexy times, mild themes of dominance and submission, and horrible puns. If you get offended easily, then you probably will. San Andreas Shifter stories contain bad language, dirty deeds, and outright admiration for the San Francisco Bay Area. Not the faint of heart/mouth/tongue.
