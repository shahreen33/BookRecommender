Three Shilenti Stalkers were on a mission to capture a sorcerer-priest who had committed unspeakable crimes against their people. Little did they know that events were transpiring that would engulf their world in a conflict that would pit darkness versus light and bring back an ancient enemy who did not simply mean to conquer the Anathrian Continent, but prepare it for war against a far greater threat. The only hope in defeating these powerful enemies lied in recovering an ancient artifact once wielded by a legendary king. An artifact that could control the weather and banish the foes of all living things: The legendary Storm Shield.
