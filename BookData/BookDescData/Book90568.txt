For the first time ever YouTube personality Miranda Sings is sharing her life lessons and tutorials on paper, full of her own illustrations and photos.In it you'll find Miranda's instructions on all you need to know in life, from how to get a boyfriend (wear all black and carry a fishing net) to performing magic tricks (magic is lying). This is a self-declared lifesaving book, and if you don't like it..., well as Miranda would say... 'Haters, back off!'
