Love is in the details.In the fingers finding a hand in the dark. In the stretch and curve of a spine. In goosebumped shoulders and the taste of skin.Gabriel Gadfly’s much anticipated second anthology is a vivid and tender tribute to the life cycle of love — the sex, the laughter, the pain, the sweetness, the fear, the vacancy. Filled with yearning, this arresting collection finds beauty in all that love has to offer, from the mundane to the abstract.With Ventricle, Atrium, Gabriel Gadfly explores love at all its junctures, through sickness and health, in good times and in bad, offering sharp and remarkably precise observations on the tiny, all-important details of love.
