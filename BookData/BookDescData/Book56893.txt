Spider-Punk is back and better than ever. After SPIDER-VERSE, Hobie Brown was a Web-Warrior, but that didn't mean things back in his universe were solved. The writer of the Spider-Punk story in SPIDER-VERSE is back and joined by VENOM's Gerardo Sandoval! Spider-Punk's Earth is under attack both on the ground and from space, meaning his responsibility seems to outweigh his power. After Gerard Way (My Chemical Romance, The Umbrella Academy) and Jake Wyatt created SP//dr back in SPIDERVERSE, she was one of the most requested heroes. With Spider-Geddon on the horizon, SP//dr is back. Zac Thompson and Lonnie Nadler are joining the team to bring you the next chapter in Peni Parker's life and set the table for the Spider-Event of 2018!
