Caught up in the fighting, Steven ends up on a boat bound for Constantinople, the heart of the Roman Empire.Rescuing Steven, however, is the least of the Doctor's problems – because he shouldn't be mixed up in this particular adventure at all.

The truth is about to be revealed – but at what cost to all of the Doctors, and to the whole future history of the planet Earth?
