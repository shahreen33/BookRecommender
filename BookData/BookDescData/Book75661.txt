The result was a year offocused engagement with spiritual practices--both ancient andmodern--that fundamentally reshaped and revived his life. Bycontemplating apples for an hour before tasting them (attentiveness),eating on just $2.00 a day (simplicity), or writing letters of thanks(gratitude), Michael discovered a whole new vitality and depth throughthe intentional life.Guided by the voice of Father Solomon--alocal monk--Yankoski's Sacred Year slowly transforms his life. Bothentertaining and profound, his story will resonate with those who wishto deepen their own committed faith as well as those who aresearching--perhaps for the first time--for their own authentic encounter with the Divine.
