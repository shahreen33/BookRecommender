During the beginning of the zombie apocalypse, a mutated strain of the zombie virus created a new type of zombie with the ability to regenerate skin and bone tissue back to normal. They walk, talk, and look human, but in order to survive and maintain their appearance, they must feed on another human once every three days. However, how does a zombie who looks human - survive in a lawless, savage, zombie post-apocalyptic world while trying to convince other humans they're on their side (when they really just want to eat them)? This is the story told through the eyes of one such zombie... one who is self-aware.
