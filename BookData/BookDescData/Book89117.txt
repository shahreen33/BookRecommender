17-year-old Ryann Carroll thought she knew who she was... a small-town Southern girl just trying to survive her parents' messy divorce and find some peace for herself. She thought she knew what she wanted... a summer job, a car, a first date that didn't suck, and NO complications from a serious relationship-any guy in her life would simply be icing on the cake. But now... she's not only in love, her boyfriend Lad is a member of an ancient race that's lived secretly among humans for thousands of years, mentioned only in flawed and fading folklore. Things could hardly get more complicated than that. More importantly, she's learned the world's top celebrities... those actors, musicians, athletes, and politicians who seem a little too beautiful and talented to be true... actually are. They're not human, and they're using their glamour and the increasing popularity of fan pods to control more and more humans. But why? With her best friend Emmy leaving soon to join the fan pod of a famous actor, Ryann has to find out the answer. And she can't do it alone. But after a shocking murder, Lad can no longer fight his destiny or his duty, and Ryann's not sure whether his top priority is their relationship or his people. In this second book of the Hidden Trilogy, true friendship will take Ryann from rural Mississippi to the glittering city of Los Angeles. And true love will take her to places she never expected to go...'
