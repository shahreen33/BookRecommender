In the year 2068 A.D., the world has united under the fist of Altieria Corporation's wise and powerful CEO. Not without its complications...The wife of a robotics engineer turns up dead in a cheap motel, and all evidence points to a telekinetic suspect that doesn't exist to the public eye--or even the eyes of the man who sees everything.Two veteran detectives, a rebel faction, and an aggressive reporter approach the case from their own perspectives and rapidly descend into a web of lies, secrets, illegal operations, and violence. In their struggle for survival, they begin to suspect that the Altieria Corporation may somehow be involved. And if it is, how can they hope to learn the truth and expose it to a world that the Company now controls?
