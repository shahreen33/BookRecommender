There's more than one way to rape a straight guy, and Curt's been through them all. Now he's out to do some damage. Curt has been beaten, betrayed, and brutalized by nearly everybody he's known. Even his mother -- once a prostitute but now married and born again -- has banned him from contact with his younger brother and sisters. Then he went through six years in prison and came out ten times harder than when he went in. Demands from his wife and zero prospects of a decent job are making it impossible for him to even think of having a normal life...until he's hustling two gay men in a bar, one afternoon, and mentions his experiences in prison -- which included forcing straight cons to get off as he raped them. A very satisfying method of revenge. It seems the two men, Wayne and Lenny, want some revenge of their own against a straight guy who's caused them trouble. If Curt can get the bastard off while being assaulted, they'll give him a car, cash, and a chance at a new life. Being in the mood to do some damage, Curt agrees...but step-by-step a stupid little bet begins to spin out of control and threatens to plunge him headlong into disaster. And he's not sure he wants to stop it.
