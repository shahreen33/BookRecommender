Ten-year-old Evie has a talent. A SUPERTALENT. Evie can TALK to animals and HEAR their thoughts. Pretty amazing, isn't it? One day at school, Evie sets Kahlo the rabbit free from her too-small cage. Evie knows she's done A Good Thing . . . but it lands her in BIG trouble. Evie's dad and Granny Flora say her talent is a curse; she must never use it again. Until a year later pets on her street - including Lady Gaga the cat and a hamster named Cheryl - start disappearing. Evie is determined to find them. But it's dangerous for her to help. Because the villain has a talent of their own, and only wants to use it for evil . . . Can Evie save the pets before it's too late, even if it means DARING TO BE HERSELF?
