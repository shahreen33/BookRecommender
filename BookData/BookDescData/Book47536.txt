From the best selling series, Something So comes the spin-off Series This is...ZoeWhen you grow up surrounded by hockey players you know one thing for sure, I was never going to settle down with one.Heck, I didn’t even know what icing was. I was too busy climbing the corporate ladder, becoming one of the most successful realtors in New York City.I wasn’t interested in dating or anything that got in my way.First, he was my client and then he became my friend.ViktorMy parents told me I skated before I walked. When I was eighteen I was drafted into the N.H.L third overall, playing in Los Angeles—the city of dreams. What more could I ask for? I played hard, but eventually, I partied even harder.Five years later I was traded a week after I entered rehab.There was no time for anything except my health and making sure I’d come out on top. I had to be better. There wasn’t another option.One of the rules of recovery was ‘don’t fall in love’ and I made it a top priority. She was off limits in every single way.Until it was too lateOne night, one decision, one act can derail everything.When push comes to shove, I’m only certain that, This is Wild.
