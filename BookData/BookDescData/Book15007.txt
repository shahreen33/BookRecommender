AN 18-YEAR-OLD GIRL FALLS IN LOVE WITH A HANDSOME, WEALTHY MAN. HER LIFE IS PERFECT...EXCEPT HIS FAMILY HATES HER! Montreal, 1951. Rebecca Wiseman, 18 years old, from a Catholic-Jewish family, briefly meets a handsome young man at a local dance. She has little hope of seeing him again. When Sol Gottesman tracks her down and asks her on a date, her joy mingles with disbelief: he is the son of a wealthy Westmount businessman. Sol takes her in a chauffeured Rolls-Royce to the most expensive restaurant in the city and Rebecca enters a world of upper-class wealth and privilege. She believes her life is perfect. She soon learns that despite Solâ€™s outward charm, he lacks self-confidence. On a visit to Mount Royal overlooking the city, Sol reveals the simmering conflicts in his family. When Rebecca tries to help him stand up to his family, she puts herself squarely in the midst of it all. Class, religion, family conflict and sexual secrets test their love. And then, a late night telephone call changes her life forever. "A bittersweet story of love and loss set in one of the most colorful cities on the planet in its film-noirish heyday." - Peter Behrens, author of Law of Dreams and The O'Briens
