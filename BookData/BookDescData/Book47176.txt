Malcolm Fox works in the Complaints and Conduct Department of the Lothian and Borders Police. No one likes people who work here, not even his own kind: these cops investigate other cops. When Fox is given a new task he is a little reluctant. There is a new cop, Jamie Breck, who is corrupt but no one can prove it. But soon he learns there's more to this cop than people think. This proves dangerous to know, especially when there is a murderer killing people a little too close to Fox for comfort
