Tattooed and Pierced, 1It all started when Kiera gave the bad boy her virginity...Kiera knew Reese Trenton wasn't for her, but she couldn't stay away. He was rough around the edges, tattooed and pierced, and fiercer than any guy she had ever met. He knew too much about sex, got drunk, and started far too many fights. He was a bad boy, but Kiera still wanted him in the worst kind of way.Reese's life is lonely, despite always being surrounded by people. He's only wanted one thing, and that is Kiera Sheppard, the girl he has watched from afar for four years. As they grow closer, Reese wants to give her everything and show her he is worthy of her love. But his sordid past tears their bond and he doesn't know if he can redeem himself and show her she is the most important thing in his broken life.
