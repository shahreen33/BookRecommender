Charlie MacLeod, a young and beautiful girl, was gifted at birth with the power to set the world alight; a power she neither wants nor can easily control. A victim of tragedy, Charlie is adopted by David and Catherine McAuliffe, a young couple with similar god-like powers who only wish to live a quiet, normal life. Events quickly spiral out of control as Charlie is marked for death by the NSA, and later pursued by another, far more dangerous entity that seeks to exploit her power for its own dark ends.
