It was supposed to be a dream vacation … until I found myself stranded on the beach in a foreign country––helpless, broke and in tears. When a group of ripped and rugged athletes find me and bring me to their waterfront mansion, I know I’ll be safe for at least one night. It quickly turns into so much more. Not only do these men get me hot and bothered … they know what they want. Me. I’ve already been through so much ... and I'm scared of getting hurt. They promise to protect me ... but it's my heart I'm frightened for.  Dear Reader, This story has a different sort of HEA … one lucky lady and the four men who adore her. Set in Jamaica, this is more than a beach read … this is a sex-on-the-beach read— just like you deserve! Is it just me or is it gettin' hot in here?! xo, charlie &amp; frankie
