I wrote this story as a tool to help me with writing Hidden Huntress, and it turned out well enough that I decided it would be fun to share it with fans of Stolen Songbird rather than leaving it to languish on my computer's hard drive. It takes place four years prior to the events of Stolen Songbird, and it will give a taste of what CÃ©cile's life was like before the trolls.
