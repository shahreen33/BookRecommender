Lizzie Flint learns things a 10-year-old shouldn't know. During WWI, she learns that her father, Peter, is missing in action, that she and her mother will have to live with her grandmother until he is found and that her mother, Beth, refuses to believe him dead. She learns that her father was a hero, saving other soldier's lives, but was finally blown up by a land mine and, ultimately, that Beth will never recover from hearing the news. Grown, Lizzie develops an adventurous streak. She travels to Hong Kong to take up a teaching post. There, she meets and falls in love with an author, Jonas O'Neill. They marry, but Jonas is sent to Shanghai to report on the Japanese bombings and the two are separated. Not knowing the fate of the other, Lizzie frantically searches for Jonas, all the while fearing that, just like her father, she may never see Jonas again. Dragon Land is an epic story set across generations of the Flint family as they battle war and conflict throughout the world as World War I, the Japanese invasion of China, and finally Word War II rage on around them and rips the family apart. It is a story of love, hope, and survival.
