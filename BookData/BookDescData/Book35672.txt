I didn’t mean to kidnap the groom.It was an accident.Mostly...At least I didn't take much time to plan it. It was more of a spur of the moment kidnapping. Does that count?One minute, the town’s bad boy is standing at the altar about to marry the world’s most evil kindergarten teacher. The next, he’s passed out in my Vespa sidecar with his bride hot on our tail.But I didn't have a choice! I couldn't stand by and watch Jace O’Dell be blackmailed into a loveless marriage. And besides, what’s a little kidnapping between friends? Okay, so maybe we’re not just friends...And maybe I can’t quit thinking about that night at his bar when he closed up early and had me on the rocks.And maybe this crazy stunt is going to blow up in both of our faces.If it does, I’m blaming the moonshine.Even though the only thing I’m hammered on when it comes to Jace is love—straight up, no chaser.
