The Ridpath projection has brought a tantalising alternate reality to its willing participants: Wessex. There they can find a different set of relationships, jobs, responsibilities, attitudes, preferences. Only memory eludes them; for in Wessex nothing is constant except the Castle. It stands, solid, a beacon, a gateway between centuries. Julia has always enjoyed her alter life. Until the arrival of a malicious and violent ex-lover. A man bent on destruction, a man willing to play with past and present. A man she will fight.
