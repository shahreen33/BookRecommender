LIGHTSPEED is an online science fiction and fantasy magazine. In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF--and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales.  Our cover art this month is by Alan Bao, illustrating a new science fiction short by Adam-Troy Castro ("The Streets of Babel"). Susan Jane Bigelow gives us our other piece of original SF ("The Eyes of the Flood"). We also have with SF reprints by Catherynne M. Valente ("Golubash, or Wine-Blood-War-Elegy") and James Patrick Kelly ("Someday"). Our fantasy originals are from Jos√© Pablo Iriarte ("The Substance of My Lives, The Accidents of Our Birth") and Sarah Pinsker ("The Court Magician"). Our fantasy reprints are by Joanna Ruocco ("Auburn") and Roger Zelazny ("Divine Madness"). All that, and of course we also have our usual assortment of author spotlights, along with our book and media review columns, and an interview with author Fonda Lee. For our ebook readers, our exclusive novella is by Will McIntosh ("A Thousand Nights Till Morning"). And of course we have a book excerpt just for our ebook readers, too--it's a snippet from THE NIGHT MARKET by Jonathan Moore.
