Our Story Begins With is an original Romance/Drama story:"All stories begin in an apparently trivial world, in a daily object, or in a forgettable accident. All are made of small moments that are stored away in boxes, gathering dust. All stories deserve to be told, and now it's time to tell those stories, and those of all the small objects that have built - and destroyed - their relationship."
