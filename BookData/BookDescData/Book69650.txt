The genius and the prodigy ...  Nazio “Naz” Donati is brilliant, sinful, and criminal. A genius from the moment he was born, and a man who's still trying to learn how to navigate and balance this thing called life. He certainly wasn't expecting love to practically fall right into his hands, never mind for love to take the form of his best friend's little sister.  Rosalynn ”Roz” Puzza is talented, beautiful, and driven. A pianist prodigy from the second they sat her at a piano as a little girl, and a young woman who isn't sure if she's truly earned her spot on the stage. She wasn't expecting a man like him to take her focus and change her muse, never mind to distract her from the thing she thought she wanted the most.  Sometimes, first love is intense. All-consuming. Crazy. And you just have to ride it out.  When brilliance and talent crash together, it can make magic.  Naz &amp; Roz is a contemporary romance that is meant to be read as an add-on to the Cross + Catherine series, and is not intended to be read as a standalone.
