New Orleans, childhood bonds, voodoo and gangsters, all kick up heat and mystique in Mickie Turk's debut novel. After a long absence, Dr. Dominique Doucette returns to her hometown to open a reform prison for violent male offenders. Immediately, bullying by a local sheriff and a backlash of community resentment threaten to shut down the facility. But when a series of assaults occur in nearby New Orleans, Dominique is forced to confront twin devils: the evil lurking inside the walls of the antebellum institution, and the disturbing secret that haunts her own past. The Delilah Case is an atmospheric and gripping thriller, marking the advent of an impressive new writer.
