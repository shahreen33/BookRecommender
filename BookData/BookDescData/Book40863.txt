Grace Harper is in hiding. When her father died six months before, she never imagined her unexpected inheritance would threaten her life. What better place to disappear than on a cattle ranch, doing the work she spent the last nine years helping her father with? And surely she’ll be safe hidden in Texas, thousands of miles from her trouble. Monty Dominguez has spent much of his life working on the Double Rocking B Ranch in Seguin, Texas. He’s worked his way from a 12-year-old orphan stable boy, to ranch foreman and trusted friend of the family. There’s not much he wouldn’t do to protect the people and land he loves, even if it means giving up his own dreams. When the danger trailing Grace discovers her hideout, there’s only one way to save the people—especially the man—she’s come to love. Can she find the courage for the ultimate sacrifice to protect those she’s put at risk? Just as Monty’s dreams might finally be within reach, will one misstep cost him everything?
