From the essay "Feel Me" by Roxane Gay:Niche dating sites are interesting. You can go to JDate or Christian Mingle or Black People Meet or any number of dating websites. If you have certain criteria, you can find people who look like you or share your faith or enjoy having sex in furry costumes. No one is alone in their interests.

You can hope that in love online, a lingua franca will make all things possible.From the essay "An American Sex Tourist in Thailand" by Alex Jung:After I booked a plane ticket to Bangkok, the first thing I did was type "gay Thailand" into the Google search bar.Frequencies is a biannual journal of artful essays, sharply illustrated by artist John Gagliano.Volume 2 features Roxane Gay writing on issues of belonging in middle class black America, Alex Jung on the gay tourist sex trade in Thailand, and Kate Zambreno on the brief career but lasting impact of actress and director Barbara Loden.
