“When you’re with me, you’re not vulnerable. When you’re with me, you are safe. When you’re with me, you will never be alone. And as for your heart, Sera Lafferty…I’ll make it beat so fast you’ll never feel it ache.”  Sera Lafferty isn’t insane. She’s always made the smart decisions. She has a career. A loving sister. The carefully mapped out, peaceful life in Seattle that she’s craved since childhood. So why, then, does she suddenly find herself on a scavenger hunt, traveling across the country with a stranger? And not just any stranger. A maddeningly sexy hitman, who’s been paid to end her life.  His past is shrouded in secrets, and his eyes are filled with ghosts. Sera knows she should head back to Seattle, to sever all ties with her handsome man in black. But leaving him might not just hurt Sera in the end. It might end up getting her killed.  Fix Marcosa damn well knows better. He’s been focused on his goals ever since the fateful day he swore to avenge his friend’s brutal attack. Booze. Drugs. Violence. Sex. Nothing has distracted him from his mission. But Sera is more potent than alcohol, more addicting than any opiate. She makes the fury in his blood sing. And her body? Her body is utter perfection, and he just can’t keep his hands off it. Or his mouth for that matter.  Fix is determined.  Screw the money. Screw the consequences, and screw anybody stupid enough to stand in his way.  He isn’t going to end Sera Lafferty’s life.  He’s damn well going to save it.
