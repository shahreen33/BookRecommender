An award-winning cartoonist teams up with an award-winning psychologist to introduce readers to the complex—and often comedic—world of psychology.Psychology is the study of human behavior. It is a serious and worthy endeavor that has given us scientific knowledge of the ways our minds make sense of the world.

This is the field, after all, that brought us drooling dogs, snacking rats, and “Freudian slips.” With detailed observations on perception, stress, emotions, cognition, and more, Psychology: The Comic Book Introduction offers students and curious readers an entertaining guide to the ways our brains help us navigate incredibly complicated environments, yet often fool us in fascinating ways.
