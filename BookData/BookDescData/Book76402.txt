I am strong, athletic, and son to a man I always wanted to be.  I had made plans, thought I was on that path, and then a bullet stopped not just my father’s heart, but mine too.   I’ve been living a life I’m not meant to.  I want more. I want to escape.  And I found someone who’s given me a love I never thought possible.   My name is Brock Pearson.  I am a free spirit who found happiness in an unexpected place. People assume I’ll be another heir to our empire, but my heart belongs elsewhere.  ****  First came the Four Fathers. Now it's time for the Four Sons.
