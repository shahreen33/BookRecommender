They say opposites attract. I never believed that until I met Abby.I was an Ivy League student, the eldest son of an affluent family, living a life of luxury and rubbing elbows with D.C.’s elite. Sounds great, right? Too bad prestige comes with a price. When the expectations became too much, I decided to escape to the hills of West Virginia with my best friend for a summer of fun, some R &amp; R and a little white water rafting. I wanted to lose myself in the outdoors, but instead found Abby. A petite waitress and all around spitfire, she knocked me off my game, making me want more than the casual, no strings attached relationships I was used to.To me, she’s not just another summer fling. She’s something that could last.
