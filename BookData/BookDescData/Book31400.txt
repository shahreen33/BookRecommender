Felix and Lane are struggling with just how boring a “normal” life is, so when they get a chance to jump into action, they do so without a second thought—especially since they’re offered a lot of money. The request is simple: find a way to retrieve a watch from police custody. But things are never as easy as they seem. Suddenly, they’re caught in the middle of a family feud that could turn deadly. But no matter what, through kidnappings, car chases, and cooking mishaps, Felix knows that as long as Lane is by his side, they will find a way to set things right.  Deception in Darkness is 100k words of snark, stripping gone horribly wrong, and true love. Oh, and Felix steals another animal. Of course he does.
