A note from Audrey: Some series can be read out of order - this isn’t one of them. Start with Alpha and welcome to Ghost Mountain!  Lissa chose to stay, to stand with the tattered remnants of her pack as they try to make themselves whole again. She somehow didn’t expect it to try her patience quite so much.  Which means it might be time for a meek bookkeeper to take matters into her own hands.  Before her wolf does.  “Unique and joyous fantasy as no one else writes it.” ~ Amazon reviewer
