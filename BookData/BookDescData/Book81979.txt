A sniper wreaks havoc on the Fourth of July in Charlotte, shooting into a crowd gathered for a concert in a park. At the same time and only yards away, a second shooter kills a retired, decorated military officer. The FBI is sure the shootings are a joint venture, carefully planned out. However, Homicide Detective Chris Lagoni is determined to prove his own theory: that the attacks are unrelated. Before he can, he must gain the cooperation of his suspect, Megan Moore, to lead him to the second shooter. Lagoni wants to believe she has no knowledge of the crime, but her actions and her words say very different things. Will she finally help him or sabotage the case and his career? It's a risk he must take, especially since she has captured his heart. The police and FBI are in a race against time to find the shooters and prevent a bigger attack that could claim even more victims.
