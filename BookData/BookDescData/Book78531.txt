His name is Howler for a reason. A self-confident man of forty-three, he controls everything and everyone around him. Women trip over themselves to get the first smile from his lips. A founder/owner of an investigative service that helps people in trouble, he finds himself in the heart of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. The owner of the very successful Painted Horse Ranch is being vandalized with fires, broken fences, graffiti covered signs, and attempted horse theft. When Howler’s boots hit the gravel road in front of the owner’s house, he knows he’ll lose his heart. Sadie is slightly older, a curvy, beautiful Choctaw who is as big a control freak as him. Will she play, or will she fight until she runs him off?
