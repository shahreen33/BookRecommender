Rick's been raising little Gracie for the past five years. She even calls him Daddy, but recently things have started to change, and that name has started to have a whole different feel to it. Ty's lived with Rick since he lost his parents in a car accident. Then Gracie came into their lives and the world seemed to light up, but the brotherly feelings he once had are now long forgotten as little Gracie has turned into a woman. Gracie doesn't know what to do with her feelings for Rick and Ty: the two men who once felt like a father and brother to her. They've been her whole world since her mom skipped town, leaving her all alone in a trailer park. But something has to change. She wants them both, and she'll have them one way or another.
