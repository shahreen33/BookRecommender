We are told that God will punish the wicked. That sinful men will reap what they sow. We are told to scourge our souls with prayer and pain to become clean once again.Well, here I am. Wicked and sinful. Desperate to become clean…even though it feels so good to be dirty.But even I never expected what came next. Even I never expected my punishment to come so soon.***Midnight Mass is a novella and a sequel to Priest. It’s intended for mature audiences only.***
