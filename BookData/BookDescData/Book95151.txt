Keeping Beth by my side is turning out to be far harder than I planned. After all, I couldn’t escape her when we were traveling with Leander and Taylor. She dogged my steps, flitted through my dreams, and took up all my waking thoughts. Now? She’s disappeared like smoke through my fingers. But I will always find her. Nothing can keep me from the one my soul is tethered to, not even this pit of a city, Cranthum. The slavers control everything, and they’re on the verge of the biggest market of the year. The Bazaar. With Beth at my side—along with a few more surprising allies—we will light a spark that will change Cranthum, and the summer realm, forever. But freedom always comes at a cost, and the price is often paid in blood.
