Sasha is so excited for her school's Winter Variety Show! She and her best friends, twins Karly and Kevin, have been working on a song and dance routine for it, with super cute candy cane costumes. Sasha is sure they'll be the best. And she's even more confident that her secret plan -- to tell Kevin about her crush on him -- will go off without a hitch.  But Sasha is starting to realize that she's over-committed herself, between rehearsing for the show, regular dance class, after-school clubs and committees, and ever-increasing amounts of homework. When nothing ends up going as planned, can Sasha still step up and make the most of her moment in the spotlight?
