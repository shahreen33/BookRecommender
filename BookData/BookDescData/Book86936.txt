Alternate cover edition of ASIN B079VMZRJLFetching a cat out of a tree should’ve been a quick, easy fifty bucks in Kanika’s pocket. Instead, following one stray thought, the devil pays her a visit and leaves her with a debt to repay.   Owing the devil a favor is bad enough, but her life is turned upside down when it’s time to pay the piper. First, she doesn’t want the world’s sexiest firefighting, kitten-rescuing Scot as an unwilling companion. Since that wasn’t bad enough, she doesn’t know who wants him dead or why, but there’s no way in hell she’s going to let someone mar his perfection.  Add in the fact the devil wants an heir, and there’s only one thing she knows for certain: she’s in for one hell of a job.
