Alternate Cover edition of ASIN:B00CRS88IOJune 14, 1940. Naval Intelligence operative Commander Ian Fleming, a.k.a. ‘17F,’ is parachuted into occupied France with two million pounds in gold. His mission: to negotiate the purchase of France’s Navy from the renegade Admiral Darlan. Fleming is assisted by the French Resistance -- Colonel Remy, Eddie Watteau, Rene Melik and the beautiful Denise Astier. Plans go awry almost immediately and he is forced to improvise when German Army Group B, led by the sadistic General Bock, makes a run for Admiral Darlan’s ships. Hitler needs France's battle-cruisers and destroyers to mount ‘Operation Sealion,’ his planned invasion of Great Britain. Ian Fleming has four days to get to Darlan before the French fleet is annihilated by the Royal Navy. With General Bock on his heels, and a traitor close to home, 17F finds himself in a race with the biggest stakes imaginable. Before he wrote the James Bond books, Ian Fleming was an officer in the United Kingdom’s Naval Intelligence Department. ‘The Fleming Files’ chronicles his adventures at the NID during World War 2.‘Operation Armada’ is the first in a series of ‘The Ian Fleming Files’ stories.
