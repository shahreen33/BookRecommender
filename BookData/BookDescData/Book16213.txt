Ainsley Daniels wasn't the first girl to crawl out of my bed, she's just the first one I was dying to drag back in.As lead singer of the most notorious rock band in the world, people kiss the ground I walk on. I could have anyone I want. Any time. Any place.But I want her. And I'm going to have her.It's been over a year since I first laid eyes on her; one long year this storm has been brewing. A twist of fate finally hands me the chance I've been waiting for. I'm about to remind Ainsley just who Kade Black is, and this time ... I won't let her walk away.
