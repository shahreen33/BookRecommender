The third volume in the 'Corfu Trilogy' continues the accounts of the young Gerald Durrell during the years that he and his family lived in Corfu before the Second World War. While the animals of Corfu are young Gerald's focus, it is the antics of his family and their array of friends and acquaintances that are the centrepiece of the humorous account.
