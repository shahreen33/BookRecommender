I killed the boy...Jig loves football and his dog, hates school, misses his granda and knows to lie low when his ma's blitzed on the vodka and tablets.He's just an ordinary boy on the mean streets alongside Dublin's Grand Canal. Streets that are ruled by Ghost and his crew. And now Ghost- inked, vicious, unprincipled- has a job for Jig.A job that no one can afford to go wrong- not the gangs, the police, the locals, and least of all not Jig.
