What is it that transforms a page full of words into an experience that moves us and leaves us changed?Livia Blackburne explores this cognitive process, from its objective beginnings on the page to the reader’s personal investment in the story.The essay, which combines scientific expertise and a flair for storytelling, weaves together current results from cognitive psychology with examples from the classic fairytale Little Red Riding Hood. From wolves to functional magnetic resonance imaging, the essay draws the reader through the text and ultimately beyond it. Because “the experience of reading a story does not end with the last page.”That’s the point at which the real development begins.
