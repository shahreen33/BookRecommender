It's one of those clear, cool nights that drops in the middle of summer like a gift from on high. If it weren't for the rent, Wallace wouldn't have a care in the world. Then he sees Esther, about to throw it all away--and throw herself off a cliff. Wallace jumps in after her, saves her life, and falls in love, but before he can find out what she was running from, she's gone again, kidnapped. But Wallace isn't the kind to lose his head. He's calm. Like a monk. Like an executioner. And he'll find them.Originally published as SIN CITY: HELL AND BACK #1-9.
