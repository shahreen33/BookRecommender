EVEN THE DEAD WANT REVENGE! Cliburn Plantation is a ruin. Cursed by a voodoo priestess because of the cruelty of Ezekiel Cliburn, it’s home to the ghosts of Haitian mourners, slaves, river pirates, and tragedy. When Jitty, the resident ghost of Dahlia House and Sarah Booth Delaney’s nemesis and friend, asks for help, Sarah Booth takes on the nether world in this creepy Halloween tale.  Jitty’s husband, who was killed in the Civil War, has disappeared from the Great Beyond. He’s on a mission of revenge that will get him banished from the heavenly world, unless Sarah Booth can stop him.  On All Hallow’s Eve, when the veil between living and dead is thinnest, Sarah Booth travels to the old plantation to halt a showdown between Coker and the last living heir of the Cliburn family.  When Coker and Thom Cliburn face off on the dusty road that fronts the slave quarters of the old plantation, can Sarah Booth save Jitty’s man? Can she survive an encounter no living person should ever see?
