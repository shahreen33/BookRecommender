"The Warrior Within" is the most comprehensive volume of these teachings, meant to help you apply Lee's philosophies to your own life. This unique guide reveals such life-affirming secrets as:Seeing the totality of life and putting things into perspectiveUnderstanding the concept of Yin and YangDefeating adversity by adapting to circumstancesTapping into inner spiritual forces to help shape the futureWith a foreword by Linda Lee Cadwell and photographs and other memorabilia from Bruce Lee's short but celebrated life, "The Warrior Within" is an engrossing and easy-to-understand guide to the little-explored world of Bruce Lee.
