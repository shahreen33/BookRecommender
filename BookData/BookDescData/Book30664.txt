In this poetry collection, Brian L. Porter will take you into the center of the action. One minute you'll find yourself in the cockpit of a bomber, limping home from a raid over enemy territory, and the next in a dogfight during the Battle of Britain.  Author and screenwriter Brian L. Porter served with the RAF during the Cold War. Many of the works in this collection are based on the personal experiences of those who took part in the conflicts they depict; men and women who were pleased to relate those experiences to the author. You will experience the poignancy of his words, the simple message of Remembrance, the moving dignity of Polska, and the graphic horror of the concentration camps, as related in Holocaust.  "I am writing on behalf of all members of 617 squadron to thank you for your written tribute to "The Dambusters." It is a wonderful piece, which for me captures the spirit and courage of the young men who played a part on that fateful raid." Flight Lieutenant Richard Saunders, 617 Squadron RAF, speaking of "Apres Moi le Deluge."
