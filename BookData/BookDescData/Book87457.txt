Becoming a teenager always involves challenges. But Neema seems to have more than her fair share. Her brother, Peter, whose only desire is to become a warrior, is where Neema longs to be - secondary school. Their father's plans for her own future are in keeping with Maasai tradition. Her mother's mysterious illness, the reaction of her father's other wives and Aunt Sifa's strange message cause Neema to wonder whether the family has indeed been cursed by the vengeful Red God. In standing against Maasai tradition, she risks the wrath of her father and community. But with determination and the kindly Black God on her side, can Neema find a way to continue her education and break the Red God's curse? Red God Black God is contemporary real-life drama, with a target audience of upper Middle Grade. However it's generating a lot of interest among adults too. The novel explores family relationships and the transition into early teens through the eyes of a young Maasai girl, Neema, whose tribe is undergoing a parallel transition - attempting to uphold traditional values against the encroachment of modern-day advancement. The warring red and black gods of Neema's favourite legend represent her own individual struggle to make sense of what's going on around her and gain a much-desired education.
