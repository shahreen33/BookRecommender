A witch outrunning her past. Five smoldering-hot guardians. And the dark secret that could destroy them all…   Blackmoon Bay is a city of monsters. Surviving here means never leaving home without a sharp stake. It means keeping secrets, even from friends. And unless I want the Hunters finding me again, it means my witchcraft stays on lockdown—permanently.  First time I fumble? Three witches get murdered for my mistake—including my best friend. Now I’m hunting a killer, and the magic I’ve snooze-buttoned for years is quickly making up for lost time.  And attracting dangerous allies...  Asher, the bad-boy incubus. Darius, the all-too-tempting vampire. Emilio, the wolf shifter with a big heart and a treacherous past. Ronan, the only demon I trust with my soul. And Death himself, drawn to my magic for reasons I don’t understand.  Together they’ve sworn to protect me from the evil out there, but even with a killer on the loose, it’s not the evil out there that scares me.  A shadow lurks inside me, black and deadly as a bomb.  And I’m pretty sure my magical mishap just lit the fuse.  I’m Gray Desario. Witch. Survivor. Occasional bringer of chaos. And tonight? The darkness is coming…  SHADOW KISSED is the first book in The Witch’s Rebels, a steamy reverse harem paranormal romance and urban fantasy series featuring five smoldering-hot guys and the kickass witch they’d kill to protect. If you like sexy forbidden romance, dark magic, and heart-pounding supernatural suspense, Sarah Piper’s witchy new series will leave you spellbound.
