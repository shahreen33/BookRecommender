The Art of Comprehension [creates] an invisible thread that stretches across varied professional contexts to connect art, literacy, and all content areas.—From the forward by Dr. Mary Howard   In The Art of Comprehension, Trevor A. Bryan introduces his signature method for enhancing students’ understanding and thinking about all texts—both written and visual. By using what he calls “access lenses” (such as faces, body language, sound/silence) you can prompt all your students to became active explorers and meaning-makers. Organically and spontaneously, your classroom will become more student-centered. Discover inventive ways to prompt students to notice, think about, and synthesize visuals—using the same observation and comprehension skills they can bring to reading and writing.Learn about ways to unravel layers of meaning in picture books, chapter books, artwork, poetry, and informational text.Explore the book’s eclectic collection of art and illustration, by acclaimed illustrator Peter H. Reynolds, 19th century masters, and more. Bryan’s approach allows all students to engage meaningfully with texts and join the classroom conversation. With this comes the greatest reward of all: confidence and independence for all kinds of learners.
