Pippi and Burt are tired of sharing their crowded nest with eight noisy little siblings, so off they fly to see the big, wide world and find a new home. But when they encounter all sorts of big, scary, hungry creatures, Pippi and Burt realize their crowded old nest is the best home of all. Here is an ideal story for anyone who appreciates the riotous joys (and challenges) of a large, rowdy family. Itâ€™s a funny and warm tribute to both the thrill of adventure and the love of home."Dicmas' expressive, paint-splotched birds have an adventurous spirit all their own [...] the page-turn reveals are their own reward. - Kirkus
