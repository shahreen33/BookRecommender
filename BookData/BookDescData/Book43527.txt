Tracing the growth of atomic science from 1895 and the discovery of X-Ray to the present, this book presents a stimulating and lucid statement of modern atomic physics. Written by an outstanding nuclear physicist, the book goes far to show how from that point on theory and experience worked hand in hand to explore the inner architecture of the atom. Hahn and Strassman, Fermi are discussed in terms of their contributions, the atom and hydrogen bomb, the cyclotron, the use of atomic energy, the versatility of the neutron all become accessible to the understanding of the layman as Ralph Lapp conducts his illuminating tour of the fundamental precepts of a science which has touched on the life of every individual alive in the second half of this century.
