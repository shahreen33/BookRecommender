Thomas Seabrook, the penniless Duke of Wentworth, walks into White's for night cap. He leaves no longer in need of coin. In fact, he has become a wealthy man and owner of Hamilton Whaling Industries of New Bedford, Massachusetts and guardian of a seventeen-year-old girl. Thomas travels to Boston intent on bringing his ward back and marrying her off to the first eligible gentleman who requests her hand. Except the first gentleman to ask for her, is his own brother, Sebastian. Thomas refuses, because bloody hell, he wants her for himself. Emma Hamilton is not happy with her new situation. Her papa brought her up to be independent and assertive. How dare this stranger, this moody noble, dictate what she can do and not do? When she finds herself thrown into a London Season, being introduced from one gentleman to another, looking for a husband, she realizes only the duke will do. How can she break through the duke's hard exterior and find the loving, caring gentleman she knows he hides from everyone.
