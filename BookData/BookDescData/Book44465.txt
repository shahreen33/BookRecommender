He's intelligent, muscular, and oh-so-sexy. He's also my stepbrother. Ian got off on tormenting me for years, using my silly crush to humiliate me over and over. However, things have changed since he joined the Army. I've grown up, filled out, and come into my own. Even though he was leaving in a month, I soon realized that I would do anything, take any risk, to keep him in my life. Especially if I could give him the one thing he had always wanted... A baby.
