Dead is Dead, but Not Always is the first solo collection from Canadian author Eddie Generous. The mountain winds Howl and blood flows to appease, tradition runs deep and transforms the skin for the sake of togetherness, buried beneath the soil is a book to bridge the eternal dark with the light of life, God's way is with a hiss but Satan's way is with a kiss, in the Arctic only the bears can hear your screams, when it's your time go the lake will tell you, and being a kid ain't easy when the natural and supernatural collide to peel the layers from your back. From dread to thriller to cosmic, the seven novelettes collected here meld into one bone-jarringly bleak outing, bound to rattle cores and test readers' nerves.
