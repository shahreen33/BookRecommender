A Steampunk Reverse Harem Lucretia longs for adventure, but she knows she can never leave her family’s farm. Because Zara, her vampire mother, cannot help with the fields during the day, it’s up to her to help her other mother. Her human mother. Yes, things are a bit complicated when it comes to her family.  And things are only about to grow more complicated.  One day, Lucretia receives a letter saying Zara has died in Rapture, but something doesn’t sit right. Someone has to be lying, for a vampire would never be caught by any human hands. Even the giant, steam-powered goliaths the city police use to patrol the streets couldn’t harm a vampire. So Lucretia does the only thing she can—she travels to Rapture to investigate. She expects to get to the bottom of it, not discover a conspiracy that might shake the very foundation of Rapture itself.  Rapture will never be the same—and neither will Lucretia, after meeting the handsome chief of police and a broken hybrid that goes against all laws of nature.  Vampires, werewolves, wraiths, and royals. Lucretia will go against them all to find her mother. Nothing will stop her from finding the truth. Rapture will never be the same…   Rapture is the first in a slow-burn reverse harem fantasy, where the heroine will ultimately not have to choose between her love interests.
