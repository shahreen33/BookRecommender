Mistletoe Baby Pregnant…and widowed. It wasn't quite how Nora Parker had planned to be ringing in the holidays this year. Though she was excited to meet her new baby, the last thing she'd expected was the return of Dr. Eli St. John—the man who'd broken her heart years ago. Now he was back, filling in at his father's practice. He definitely wouldn't be staying in town. And she definitely shouldn't be looking forward to seeing him again! Eli had left his small town for bigger adventures, assuming Nora would always be waiting. Now she was his best friend's widow, expecting a baby Eli wished was theirs. With the holidays approaching and his time in town dwindling, did he dare make one last effort to claim the Christmas gift he should have accepted years ago?
