Join Christopher and Lucy, Leo the Attack-Mouse-for-Hire, Sugar the Monkey, and a throng of talking bats—as they battle pirates on the high seas. When 13-year-old Christopher runs away from an orphanage, he is kidnapped by undercover pirates who force him to pretend he is a relative who cannot speak, as they sign on to a merchant ship they are plotting to plunder. Trapped in silence, Christopher discovers he can talk with a highly skilled mouse who will teach him Five Life Lessons. The Captain’s 12-year-old daughter Lucy discovers the truth about Christopher and befriends him. But can they stop the pirates? This thrilling tale piles on the fun, hidden treasure, swashbuckling swordfights, terrifying storms and island paradise adventures that make pirate sagas so enjoyable. What sets Arrgh! apart is its hero’s heartwarming wish for family, and how he comes to find the family he will treasure forever.
