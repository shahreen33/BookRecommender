My oldest enemy is back from the dead.  My father.  Backed by an army of witches and mercenaries, he’s determined to steal my magic and make me his slave again—and to subject my sister to the same fate.  To save us, I’ll need both my packs. The Northern wolves I loved first, the ones who saved me. The dangerous but alluring men of the Atlantic pack who have won my heart since. Their alphas are childhood friends turned sworn enemies. But I have no time for men’s drama.  They called me the shifter princess.  They’ll learn I’m the queen.  Coven's Revenge is the explosive final chapter in the Their Shifter Princess trilogy. Escape today into a world of reverse harem romance, adventure, and fate.
