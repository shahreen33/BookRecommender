The Empire burns.  The halls of power lie in ruins. The emperor's children, the sadistic Porcia and the cunning Seneca, battle for the throne.  Around them, their world crumbles. In a southern savanna province, a young queen rises up against the Empire. In northern misty forests, barbarian tribes gather for war. In Zohar, the eastern desert, the hero Epher Sela joins a rebellion against the vicious Empire. Meanwhile, past deserts and mountains at the edge of the world, an ancient evil awakens, threatening to undo all that humanity has built.  Legionaries, rebels, and priests clash, vying to rule crumbling kingdoms. Yet when victors emerge from the inferno, will they find only thrones of ash?
