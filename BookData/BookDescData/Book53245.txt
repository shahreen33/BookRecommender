Miles, a powerful mage, thinks life is right where he wants it. With a werewolf, a witch, and a demon in his house, what could go wrong? When fifteen people die at the same time in different locations, things start to look a bit bleak. The police are looking for someone to help, someone worthy of helping, but instead they get stuck with Miles and his demon Havoc, whose weakness is any woman that looks his way. They have been together for hundreds of years and, when things start to go wrong, they may be the only two that can save humanity. Which is really sad because they’re definitely not cut out to save humanity. When an attack leaves Miles’s life in Havoc’s hands the two start to question if there’s something more between them other than three hundred years of bickering. Along with a forest spirit, a perverted minotaur, and the two human detectives (that wish they’d have asked for help from anyone else), Miles and Havoc try to find the answer to their happy ending. No, not that happy ending you pervert. Okay maybe there’s that kind of happy ending too.
