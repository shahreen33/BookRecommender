To escape the broiling New York summer Maggie Ryan, her actor husband, Nick, and daughter, Sarah, head for historic Civil War country-- Mosby, Virginia. But Mosby's simmering Southern heat hides as many sinister secrets as there are citizens.For one Mosbyite, reporter Dale Colby, is about to publish a hot expos√© about prominent-- and not-so-prominent-- townsfolk. He's in his air-conditioned den. The door is bolted, the windows locked. Nobody can get in-- or out. But there lies Dale, in a pool of blood, deader than the story he'd intended to write.The list of villagers with motives is as long as the Mosby phone book. But only outsider Maggie can figure out who did it-- once she realizes how it was done.
