It is spring, 1996 in a small university town on the east coast of Scotland. Harold Spencer, MD, PhD is in the middle of a bold experiment to cure genetic disease. Opponents say he is going too far and too fast; yet he is driven to end the heartbreak of parents and the early end to so many lives. The breakthrough he has sought is within reach. He and his wife Shelly are also beginning what they call the gala fortnight, celebrating their birthdays and wedding anniversary. Yet destruction lurks, within the town and within his own lab. Invivo is a love story. And a story of evil, revenge, and remorse where only the ultimate sacrifice can help keep a promise.
