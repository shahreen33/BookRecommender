There is beauty in the teacup like dresses requiring crinoline or beaded purses too small to carry anything but anger. --from "Inheritance" A window into the complex and disordered lives of middle age, Marita Dachsel's third poetry collection draws from her own history and explores parenthood, love, and the grief of losing those both close and distant. In the tradition of Karen Solie and Suzanne Buffam--and a touch of the Canadian Gothic--Dachsel unfolds her poetic skills in a variety of brief and expansive forms. With a voice that is both authentic and controlled, her poems offer a type of release despite their painful twists and topics. Readers working through their own personal losses and daily stresses will be grateful for and find a kinship in Dachsel's grief-fuelled and vulnerable poetics.
