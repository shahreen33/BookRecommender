I thought I had the next steps in my journey plotted out.

Crap on a camel, I could not have been more wrong. My world is turned upside down when my crew somehow gains two people who would as soon kill me, as see me succeed. Even with this new twist, I must get to the crossroads before the golden moon rises if we have any chance of dethroning the Emperor and bringing my brother back from the dead.Along the way I find myself in treacherous waters facing new dangers, new enemies and a choice that no one should ever have to make.
