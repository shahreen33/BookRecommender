Book Two of The Ancients Series  Jessica St. Marks has come to grips with being the stuff of legends. She is destined to be the leader of her kind, the werewolves.  While she dreams of uniting the two breeds of werewolves, the Ancients and the Lesser, she must first put a stop to the tyrannical rule of the current werewolf king, Antoine Deâ€™Lune.  Jessica must come into her full power in order to take her rightful place as the white wolf ruler. She cannot do that without first accepting a mate.  A choice must be made between Evan, the wolf whose claim she has already accepted once; and his brother, Mikael, whom she was forced to get to know. One will help her embrace her destiny, while the other is fated to destroy her.
