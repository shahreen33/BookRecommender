Subject: Navy SEAL Petty Officer  Brody Lane Current Status: On leave Obstacle: The one girl who was off-limits... Where Navy SEAL "Bad Ass" Brody Lane goes, trouble follows. Being run out of his hometown years ago for misbehaving with Genna Reilly—the sheriff's daughter—was one thing. Now Brody is about to step into real danger. Not the suggestive letters he's been exchanging with Genna, but the kind of trouble that can send a soldier home injured and broken inside... Genna's entire life has been orchestrated by her family. The  right job. The right friends. Enough! Brody's return offers the promise of lust-filled pleasures. Of flesh teased and tasted. She's not expecting to find a soldier with distant eyes who has secluded himself from the world. But this good girl knows exactly how to bring a bad boy back to life.... Uniformly Hot!  The Few. The Proud. The Sexy as Hell.
