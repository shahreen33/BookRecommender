When the remains of a disfigured body turns up in the backwoods of Virginia, FBI agent Jack Stanwick is once again summoned. This was now the third victim recovered with unusual physical characteristics, and with most of the brotherhood on another high-profile case, he needed some outside help...and knew who to enlist. Jack knocked on the front door of the Davenport Detective Agency where three ex-cops, Bren Williams, Derek O'Rourke and Russ Munroe are employed by former police chief, Raymond Davenport. Once hired, the detectives focus their attention on the militia group, M.A.G.O.C. (Men Against Government Overtaking Control), and find that several members along with the aid of a high-ranking official in the White House, are involved in a governmental conspiracy. Digging further, the detectives come upon Prescott Chemicals, where an elixir that was discovered in the Amazon Rainforest by the Mayapo natives years before, is now being transformed into a formula with irreversible consequences. While investigating the chemical plant, they accidentally come into contact with the new solution and experience a change to their bodies and minds; causing some amusing yet permanent issues. As the detectives gain control over themselves, their strategy emerges. With the assistance of a beautiful newspaper journalist, Simone Wellington, and a bitter French physicist, Lydia Reome, they discover the perpetrators and uncover a plot of betrayal, and a secret that affects one detective; altering his life
