A collection of Virginia Woolf's correspondence from age six to the eve of her marriage twenty-four years later. "Engagingly fresh and spontaneous as young Virginia's letters are...the excitement in this collection arises from [her] growing awareness of herself as a writer" (Chicago Sun-Times). Introduction by Nigel Nicolson; Index; photographs.
