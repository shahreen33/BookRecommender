My name is Oliver Arsen, but my mates call me Ollie.  I live hard and love harder, and it’s love that usually gets me in the most trouble.  According to the greater population, I’m the ultimate jerk.  My affection tends to be short-lived—a quality I’ve been assured multiple times by the fairer sex isn’t becoming—and the leaving part of loving and leaving has always come natural.  At least, it used to.  Until her.  Luciana Wright.  She’s an American bombshell and my sister’s best friend—a woman so wrong for me, it’s written in the waves.  And she’s the reason we’re all here. The reason I have to go back to explain how it all went wrong.  To the day the jerk started falling.
