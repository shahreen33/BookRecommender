A graveyard of spaceships, abandoned by the mysterious Fleet thousands of years earlier. Boss calls it “The Boneyard.” She needs the ships inside to expand her work for Lost Souls Corporation. Yash Zarlengo thinks the Boneyard will help her discover if the Fleet still exists.  Boss and Yash, while exploring the Boneyard, discover a small ship with a powerful and dangerous problem: The ship’s active anacapa drive.  To escape the Boneyard, Boss must deal with the drive. Which means she’ll have to dive the ship on limited time and under extremely dangerous conditions. And she can’t go alone.  A heart-stopping adventure that continues the thrill ride of Kristine Kathryn Rusch’s award-winning Diving series.  “[The Runabout] is so good, it will make you want to read the other stories.” —SFRevu  “Engrossing. Detailed. Imaginative. I had never heard of the author’s Diving series before reading this. I should have. It is good. Really good.” —Tangent Online  “Amazing character construction, building a plot that riveted me almost from the moment it began. I will now absolutely have to read the preceding titles and I cannot wait to see what will come as a result of The Runabout.” —Tangent Online  “Kristine Kathryn Rusch is best known for her Retrieval Artist series, so maybe you’ve missed her Diving Universe series. If so, it’s high time to remedy that oversight.” —Don Sakers, Analog
