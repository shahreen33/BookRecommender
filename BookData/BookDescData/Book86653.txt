It was such a hot summer. The sky was deep blue and the sun never faltered.All along Brambly Hedge, the mice did their best to keep cool. Poppy Eyebright sought refuge in the mossy shadows of the mill wheel; Dusty Dogwood took to walking by the banks of the cooling stream. Dusty and Poppy spent more and more time together, so no one was at all surprised when they announced their engagement.They decided on a very unusual setting for the wedding ceremony, but even they didn't realize just how unusual it would prove to be!
