Chronically Positive is a collection of the most popular blog posts and essays written by well-known chronic illness and health advocacy blogger and author, Ashley Boynes-Shuck, a.k.a. Arthritis Ashley. As a companion book to her well-received humorous health memoir Sick Idiot, Chronically Positive dives into the deeper and more serious issues that come along with a lifetime of poor health -- and it's not always a laughing matter. By balancing grace and hope with a healthy dose of realism, this truthful, raw, and honest glimpse into the daily realities of sickness will leave you feeling touched and inspired ... and quite possibly in awe of what it takes to live a Chronically Positive life.

You need humor, education, and hope." - MOGUL review of Sick Idiot "If you are looking for a book to significantly improve the quality of your life, your health, and your vitality, I highly recommend you read this book and be in touch with Ashley so your life can be the best life possible." - Joshua Rosenthal, MScEd, Founder/Director, Institute for Integrative Nutrition To learn more visit abshuck.com, arthritisashley.com, or follow Ashley Boynes-Shuck on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
