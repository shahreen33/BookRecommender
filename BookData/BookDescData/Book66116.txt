  Redemption ain’t all it’s cracked up to be.
The minute foul-mouthed Irishman Adam McLoughlin sees Dionne Pryce, he knows that he’s a goner. The ex-glamour model has curves for days and an attitude to match, and her ridiculous stilettos do funny things to his insides. He makes it his mission to have her.But Dionne isn’t interested in being had. She’s spent her whole life running from love, and now she’s busy cleaning up the messes left in her wake. In fact, she has a mission of her own: Operation Atonement. And even the fiercely sexy Adam can’t distract her.
  …Or can he?
