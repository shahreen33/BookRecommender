Mackenzie Brooks is everything I've ever wanted. Three years ago, she walked out of my life. No explanation. Just gone. With the biggest fight of my career only weeks away, she walked back in. I'll do anything to protect her. Destroy anyone who tries to hurt her. When it comes to Mac, there isn't a line I won't cross. I've loved her my entire life, and now that's she's back I won't let her go. She refuses to speak about the past, or the secrets I know she's hiding. I know she's planning on running again. But when you love someone, you stay and fight. Even if you're fighting blind.
