Ruby has been away at university but now she's back she wants to find a job an dsettle down. With Christmas around the corner, she takes on a stall at the local market, and sets about making it the best Christmas market stall ever. There'll be bunting and mistletoe and maybe even a bit of mulled wine. But with the new out-of-town superstore just opened, the market is under threat. So together with the other stallholders, Ruby devises a plan to make sure that locals make the Christmas market their first port of call for all their Christmas present needs. But it's hard to concentrate when she keeps bumping into her ex, Steve - and especialy when she realises that her feelings for him are still there. Join Heidi Swain for some Christmas sparkle - and see who might be under the misteltoe this year...
