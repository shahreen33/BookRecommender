Let's get into the station wagon, roll those windows down,Let's sing out loud and wave to cows as we drive out of town.Let's park the car beneath the trees and trade our shoes for boots,Let's set the timer, all say "Cheese!" then head into the woods.In this cute book about a family's camping trip, the simple, rhyming text is enhanced by comical illustrations that bring wit and energy to every page. Packaged in a smaller size for little hands and easy to pack up, this book would be a perfect read-aloud during the car ride, along with a great way to recap a trip at the end. The illustrations inside the front cover serve as a reminder of things to pack, and the story inspires activities to plan. There is even a space in the back to paste a picture of the reader's own family trip. This little book serves as a loving tribute to family togetherness.
