Dancing Flames. Cold Steel. Flowing Blood.  My name is Everly Banks, and I seem to collect problems like most people collect dust bunnies. With an army of enemies at the gate, I must gather one of my own.  With the hunters on my side, and maybe even in my bed, I begin to have hope that I will make it through the coming war with my mind and heart intact.  Some people seek to use me while others play the long game. But not all of my enemies are what they seem. A betrayal blindsides me and lives hang in the balance as my magics cry out for me to destroy it all.  I will dance among the blazing petals and cover myself in the ashes of their destruction. The line in the earth is being drawn, and it wonâ€™t be my blood that flows freely. Choose your side wisely. *********** Blazing Petals is a continuation of The Anomaly Series.
