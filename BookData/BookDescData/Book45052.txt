Welcome to Jenny Oliver’s brand new Cherry Pie Island series!Home, Sweet Home….?There’s nowhere more deliciously welcoming...When Annie White steps back onto Cherry Pie Island, it’s safe to say her newly inherited Dandelion Café has seen better days! And while her childhood home on the Thames-side island idyll is exactly the same retreat from the urban bustle of London she remembers, Annie’s not convinced that Owner of The Dandelion Cafe is a title she’ll be keeping for long. Not that she can bear the idea of letting her dedicated, if endearingly disorganized staff lose their jobs. Plus café life does also have the added bonus of working a stone’s throw away from millionaire Matt and his disarmingly charming smile!One (shoestring budget) café makeover, a few delightful additions to the somewhat retro menu and a lot of cherry pie tastings later, The Dandelion Café is ready for its grand reopening! But once she’s brought the dilapidated old café back to life, Annie finds herself wishing her stay on the island was just a bit longer. She always intended to go back to the big city… but could island living finally have lured her back home for good?The Cherry Pie Island series:The Grand Reopening of Dandelion Café – Book 1The Vintage Ice Cream Van Road Trip – Book 2The Great Allotment Challenge – Book 3One Summer Night at the Ritz – Book 4
