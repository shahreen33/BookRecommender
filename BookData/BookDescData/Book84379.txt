Things were not going to plan for Miss Hannah Wooller. There was the small matter of a blackmailer to contend with, her father increasing her dowry so he could marry her off, and of course there was Alexander Hetherington. Titled and handsome, he had society at his feet, and she had recklessly coerced him into playing the part of her fake beau. Things had rapidly gone downhill from there, and she was soon in over her head, trapped in a web of deceit. When someone was murdered before her eyes, she was forced to flee London to keep Alex safe, but Hannah soon realized that in doing so she has left behind the only man she will ever love.
