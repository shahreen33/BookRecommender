Faber Stories, a landmark series of individual volumes, presents masters of the short story form at work in a range of genres and styles.When Ray turns up to visit his old university friends Charlie and Emily, he's given a special task: to be so much his useless self that he makes Charlie look good by comparison.But Ray has his own buried feelings to contend with. Decades earlier, he and Emily would listen to jazz when they were alone, and now, as Sarah Vaughan sings through the speakers, he struggles to control everything the sound brings with it.In Kazuo Ishiguro's hands, a snapshot of domestic realism becomes a miniature masterpiece of memory and forgetting.Bringing together past, present and future in our ninetieth year, Faber Stories is a celebratory compendium of collectable work.
