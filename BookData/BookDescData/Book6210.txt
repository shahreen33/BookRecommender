**THIS BOOK HAS BEEN RE-RELEASED. REVIEWS BELOW MAY NOT APPLY TO THIS NEW AUTHOR'S EDITION**Getting involved with an angel, especially a half-Fallen one, might not have been Edenâ€™s best idea. Still, she never thought a summer fling with Az would end up costing her mortality. Now, there's no way of telling what will happen when Eden's fingertips graze human skin. The power that builds inside her, Touch, strips away morals and logic. Some people only feel a high; others are overcome by their darkest thoughts. Worse, word's gotten around that her Touch can kill her own kind, a skill Luke and the Fallen are desperate to harness. The last thing Eden needs is the rumor to spread. Especially since it's true.With the Fallen closing in, and loyalties in doubt, Eden must rely on the guy who broke her heart to keep it beating. Working with the Upstairs, Az is determined to defeat Luke and win back more than just Eden's loyalty. But Eden will be damned, literally, before she lets him off the hook that easily.
