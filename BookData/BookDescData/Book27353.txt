There had been a plan. It wasn't a good one, and it was rough around the edges, but it was a plan. Then things went off the rails and into places where no one was comfortable. Violent places. Unspeakable places. Places stained with blood and other things. A nesting doll of crimes and sordid deeds. Darlene and Sheila were up to no good, but the mess they find themselves in makes their original plans seem like a Sunday school picnic. And it started the way you'd expect a bad day to begin: A robbery.A death. A bucket full of teeth. Welcome to Steelwater, PA. We're glad to have you.
