At twenty-two, Tony Brasunas had never left the United States, taught a class on anything, or spoken a word of Chinese. The journey that changed him forever, that broke open his heart and awakened his mind, began in a high school classroom in hot, coastal Guangzhou, China, and culminated on the plateaus of Tibet.A journey into the heart of a changing China and through the soul of a young American, Double Happiness is both travel writing at its very finest and a groundbreaking story of spiritual awakening in the era of globalization. This is a tale for armchair travelers, English teachers, China buffs, adventure backpackers, young people in their twenties and thirties seeking a place in this shrinking world, and readers of all ages curious about a young man's coming of age in a foreign land.
