This is bad. Very bad. He's rubbing off on me. Resident bad boy Ethan Colton is turning me into an irresponsible bad girl.----- Rule #2 â€“ When I tell you to come here, you come here. It's still an order, still practically growling at me, commanding me to obey him, but it's more, too. It's fun and flirty, a little playful. I can see why girls fall for him, can see why his devious smirk melts their resistance, because it's doing the same to me. ----- Ethan is a cocky, arrogant jerk. He's always been that way. Why do girls trip over their own feet just to be with him? I don't know! I'll never understand it. Don't they realize he's just going to ditch them after a couple of weeks? Yes, he can be nice when he wants to be. It's true that he's ridiculously attractive, too. It's not like I want to stare at him when he walks around shirtless, but it's hard not to notice someone like him. He's got that bad boy smile that makes you want to... Did I mention he's my stepbrother? Ick. What? You think I'm falling for him? Nope! It's impossible.
