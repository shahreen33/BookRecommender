  A charming British hero, the woman who tempts him, and a hands-off arrangement that's oh-so-hard to maintain.
 My bags are packed and I'm ready to go. All I have to do is board a plane, and I'll be on my way to fulfilling a promise I made long ago. Bonus points -- my last week in Paris looks to be even better when I meet a gorgeous, clever American woman and make plans to take her back to my flat that night.But before we can get together for what would surely be a fantastic final fling, my boss hits me with a double whammy. My previous client didn't pay, so there's no trip, and the new client I now desperately need is none other than the tempting American I'm about to take home. Have I mentioned this timing bloody sucks? ***I'll admit it -- I have a big weakness for a hot British accent. As in, they make me swoon, sigh, and want to toss my panties. Good thing I can avoid that kind of temptation in Paris. So it's just my luck that the man who's the key to success in my new job is the man whose voice makes me melt. Oh, and we have to spend all our days together for work.Thanks a lot, fate. To top it off, I quickly learn he's witty, kind and has a heart and mind I'm falling for fast.All I have to do is resist him every single freaking day. That's so easy. Not.But then I learn that's nothing compared to the real hurdle we face.
  What could go wrong with falling in love in Paris? Nearly everything, it seems...
