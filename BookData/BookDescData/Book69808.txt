Unique craft cocktails, Scandinavian-inspired food, and the magic of the northern climate is abound in Northern Hospitality, a unique combination cookbook, cocktail guide, and northern culture primer. In Portland, Maine, Andrew and Briana Volk welcome people into their restaurant like it's an extension of their home. It's here that they create new tastes like In the Pines (gin, Cynar, and stone pine liqueur) and the Norseman (a Scandinavian take on the old-fashioned, with aquavit), while also spending time perfecting the classics behind the bar, from the Pimm's Cup to hot buttered rum. After the drinks, Northern Hospitality moves on to food inspired by both Portland and Scandinavia. The bar snacks are addictive; green chile popcorn, cured venison, and house-made pretzels, are just the beginning -- smorgasbords feature smoked fish, cheese, and house-made cider pickles. Swedish meatballs with spaetzle and nutmeg cream are sure to warm you up. Or go further from the known with the nori hashbrowns and trout roe. Features on ice fishing, shucking oysters, how to build a bonfire, and après-ski provide a sense of place and an experience as unique as the club itself. Celebrate the seasons the way those in the north do: with warmth, fun, and a sense of wonder.
