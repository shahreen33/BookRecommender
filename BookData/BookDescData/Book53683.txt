This isn’t the life I want. Trapped in one random hotel room after another by a screaming crowd of fans and paparazzi. No friends or family nearby. Nothing that really makes me happy, except my music. Music is my only love, the only thing that makes my heart beat fast and my blood run hot, until her. Kinley Matthews, the owner of the Foxhaven Resort, is nothing like the women I’m accustomed to dating, but she’s everything I need.  And she hates the sight of me.  Everything I’ve done has been for family. That’s what I tell myself when the memory of her laugh seeps into my day. I didn’t have a choice. That’s my excuse when her devastated expression haunts my nights. The truth is, every second of pain and heartache I suffer, I deserve it. She loved me, and I destroyed her.  *This is the conclusion of Kinley and Holt's story. It's a full length novel with no cliffhanger.
