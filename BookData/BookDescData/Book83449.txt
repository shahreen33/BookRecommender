The "Discovery" of America... Long before Ferdinand and Isabella financed Columbus' voyage across the sea, and tens of thousands of years before greedy Europe fought over the immense potential and wealth of a seemingly untouched continent, millions of indigenous people lived in diverse tribes and regions, with languages, customs, and vibrant cultures all their own. The towering edifice of American exceptionalism is built on a foundation of genocide, of native people killed by disease and war, forced from their homelands. Cries at Sundown immerses you in five interwoven tales across time and place, with a shining centerpiece telling the story of one woman who refuses to conveniently step aside for the conquerors. Epic, poetic, richly researched and deeply felt, Cries at Sundown asks each of us to examine the price of Western civilization, and calls for us to witness the injustices that have defined the growth of our country.
