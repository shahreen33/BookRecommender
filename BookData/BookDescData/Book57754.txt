In this freewheeling collection of short stories and vignettes, the famed Frenchcartoonist examines not only the music, but the nature of the jazz sub-culture.The grumpy festival goer, the curmudgeonly collector, and many other fan“types” are the targets of his unerring gimlet eye. Drawn in a range of styles asimprovisational as Coltrane and Mingus — everything from loose lineworkto tight pen and ink to gestural pencils — Blutch captures the excitement oflive performance, the lovelorn, and the Great Jazz Detective, who is out butnot down.
