Excerpt from If the Germans Conquered England, and Other EssaysThe peace of the world, indeed, is possible only as a result of some such reconciliation of the nationalist and internationalist ideals of the human race. Practically all the essays in this book have appeared in the New Statesman, which must not, however, be regarded as necessarily acquiescing in the Opinions I have expressed. The sketch of T. M. Kettle appeared in the Daily News, and that of sheehy-skeffington in the Ploughshare.
