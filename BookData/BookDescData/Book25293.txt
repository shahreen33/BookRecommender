Learn to work like the professionals with the first ever official guide to Affinity Designer, the award-winning design software. Published by the makers of Affinity Designer, it contains more than 400 full colour pages of instructions, guides and insider tips to help anyone make the most of the software's speed and power. As well as learning valuable vector and raster design techniques, readers can follow step-by-step guides to re-create nine projects, commissioned especially for the book from leading illustrators and designers. Tear-out 'cheat sheets' display the keyboard shortcuts designed for use in the different Personas, or modes, within the app. Guest illustrators include Paolo Limoncelli, a UX/UI designer and illustrator from Italy. His contribution, titled The Whittler, tells the story of a robot that lost his leg and tries to fix it using a branch from a tree he found in the forest. Others are The Panther, a lesson in flat vector character design by Ben the Illustrator; Reflected Skyline by Romain Trystram, which demonstrates the use of dramatic light and reflections; Kevin House's isometric illustrations in Wine Cellar; and The Fisherman, a 3D illustration by Jonathan Ball, aka pokedstudio. The Affinity Designer Workbook also includes four design projects for readers to follow, teaching brand and logo design, designing for print, UI and apps. They are contributed by Tom Koszyk-founder and creative lead at Hologram Design in Warsaw-and Affinity's own Creative Director Neil Ladkin.
