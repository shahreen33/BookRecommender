My name is Chase Cooper, and this is my fourth diary as a 6th grade ninja. A few weeks have breezed by since my last entry, but things don't stay quiet at my school for long. The science fair is coming up, and everyone's been working crazy hard to get their projects finished on time. But at the beginning of the week, projects started disappearing only to be found later completely destroyed. Did I mention the anonymous invitation I got that sent me on a messed up treasure hunt in search of the missing projects? Yeah, that happened too. Now the fate of the science fair rests in my hands as I try to stay one step ahead of the culprit in the most bizarre week of my life.Diary of a 6th Grade Ninja 4: A Game of Chase is a funny thriller that's entertaining for children ages 9-12, middle school students, and adults.
