Estranged from their father since their mother died when they were small children, they've learned to rely only on each other and not depend on anyone else.When their father hires a pair of bodyguards, Rick and Simon, to watch their every move, they think it's just a bid on his part to keep them under his thumb, and Ken and Bay do their best to get rid of their babysitters. Rick and Simon aren't thrilled with the assignment, either. Their break-up went badly, and they have one last job to do before they can get rid of the company they run together.Then an all too real explosion rocks the mansion, and their bodyguards split the twins up, running in a different direction to keep them safe. Will Ken and Bay survive the threat that hangs over them? Will they survive being apart for the first time in their lives? And will Simon and Rick learn to deal with the twins, and with each other, before the threat is over?
