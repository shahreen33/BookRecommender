Rancher and single father Tripp Montgomery is a master at French braiding and princess tea parties. He's also the most eligible bachelor in Cheyenne, Wyoming. So when he stumbles upon a flashy, sexy city girl, he knows two things: 1) she's a walking disaster, and 2) he needs to stay far, far away. But she needs him more than he wants to admitâ€¦Charlotte Gram knows what it's like not to be wanted. She's in Cheyenne for the summer to help her grandmother heal after surgery, but the farmhouse "chores" are proving much harder than she thought. If her day couldn't get any worse, the sexiest man she's ever seen strolls up to save the day......and he definitely doesn't seem happy about it.
