LATE CHECKOUT   DCI Kenny Murrain sees, hears and feels things that others do not. It’s a gift but also a curse.  When he wakes to the phantom sound of screaming he knows a murder has been committed but not where or why.  Then a woman’s body is found in a Stockport hotel room. It’s a murder that seems both frenzied and carefully planned, the scene expertly cleansed of any evidence.  Over the following days, more bodies are discovered, first in an upmarket spa on the Pennine moors, then in a run-down budget hotel on the outskirts of Manchester. The same frenzied attacks, the same meticulous planning. The same killer.  The victims all have links to one man, a police colleague with a dark past. But Murrain discovers a more unexpected connection—with Marie Donovan, a former undercover officer now part of Murrain’s own team.  As the killer closes in on a fourth victim, Murrain knows that time is running out. But the outcome will be more unexpected and more terrifying than even he can imagine…
