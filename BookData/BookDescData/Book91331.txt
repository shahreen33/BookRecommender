Our fae courts are at war, yet we're still fated.My fated mate is the Seelie Fae king. He’s powerful, dangerous, and sexy as hell. Except, I don’t want a fated mate. Especially since he thinks I'm a lying snake. Turns out I’m Unseelie, and our courts are at war.When my new Unseelie magic goes haywire and I nearly destroy my city, I can’t fix it alone. The only person with strong enough magic is the king. Which means I have to beg my mate for help. I’d rather chew off my own leg, but that won’t save Magic’s Bend.As we work to save my city from falling into the center of the earth, the danger is greater than we’d realized. To find answers, we must risk a visit to the homeland that rejected me—the Unseelie Court. There, I must master my magic, or all is lost. In a place fraught with death and danger, we have only each other. And I don’t know if that will be enough.Heir of the Fae is the thriling continuation of the hit new release Trial by Fae.
