The ongoing story that is Bethany Anne and her team! Can you say 'Die Terrorist, Die?'I took time to sleep last night. For anyone who hasn't read the first 6 books in this series, you won't understand what that means. For the rest of you, you know how hard that was.I love, love ,love this series! I don't want it to end! Bethany Anne just keeps getting better every book. And her group of people gets larger and larger and more improved all the time.I love how devoted they are to her and her cause.If you haven't read the first 6 books, you are missing out on agreat series. It's sci fi and paranormal at its best.**Please note, as mentioned in a review, there is flagrantly foul language in these novels. The main character does not have a problem with cussing, just uninspired cussing.
