Katherine Ormerod, journalist and social media mogul, is here to burst the Instagram bubble and discuss the real effects of social media 'perfection'. The internet has set destructive standards of flawlessness and comparison. We're working so hard to live up to these new benchmarks that we're burning ourselves out, and we're working so hard to maintain them that we're self-perpetuating an unobtainable reality. Until girls and women alike see the social media fantasies for what they are - constructed realities - and stop comparing their lifestyles, bodies, partners, even families to those seen on their feeds and screens, they will never be able to realize their potential in the workplace, in the political system or in their quest for happiness.In How Social Media is Ruining Your Life, Katherine explodes our social-media-addled ideas about body image, money, relationships, motherhood, careers, politics and more, and gives readers the tools they need to control their own online lives, rather than being controlled by them. An important book for any woman who has ever looked at her Instagram feed and thought, 'Who are these women, and how the hell do they do it?'
