It's a marriage of convenience neither wants to end . . . Garret James doesn’t need a woman tying him down. Not when the number of buckle bunny notches on his belt and his position in the pro bull riding standings are both on the rise. But just when he learns he’s close to blowing out his bad shoulder, Silver Jordan roars into his life straddling a Harley with her long, leather-clad legs and offering him the health insurance coverage he needs for his operation. Hell, he might not mind being tied to one woman, if that woman was Silver. There’s two problems however—one, she’s his friend Aaron’s sister and two, this union they’d promised would be temporary and only on paper ends up in the bedroom, making their marriage feel all too real. Flanked was originally released by Samhain Publishing under the same title. This is a reissue, reedited and recovered but without any substantial additions or changes to the story.
