Hattie Morris is a young girl with silly dreams and a fantasy she's been holding onto since she was sixteen years old.  "Dirty" Johnny Williams is a hard man who rides as a Notorious Devil, known for being filthy between the sheets, yet always wishing for the unattainable more.  One night, one kiss sets fate in motion, and neither Hattie, nor Johnny, can deny that their lives have been forever changed. Time and distance stand between them, but a chance encounter shatters their ability to resist each other any longer.  It's not long before Hattie realizes that fantasies are named thus for a reason, while Johnny learns that the innocence of a sweet girl is no match against his hardened heart.  Yet, inexperienced as she may be, Hattie knows one thing for sure. If she doesn't take a chance with this rough and rugged man, she'll never know if dreams really can come true.  *Recommended for readers 18+ due to Language, Sexual Content, and Violence.
