He bought me, but not to touch or taste. He bought me to save me, and to atone for past sins.Handsome and mysterious, he swoops in to offer me a new life, but this is no knight in shining armor. He’s cold, hardened by his past. But there’s an inferno underneath the ice, I can feel the heat each time he looks at me—each time he gives in to the desire between us.No matter how much I push to unleash the fire in his eyes, he shoves back harder each time. He’s merciless with his cruel words, telling me how naïve I am, how little I know of the world.But I’m stronger than he thinks.When we face down our demons from the past, I’ll prove which one of us was in need of saving, and which one of us is the savior.
