Single-DadFirefighterSince my divorce five years ago, these are the two labels I've identified with. Now, I'm ready for more. Ready to give dating a shot, even with an eight-year-old daughter and twenty-four hour shifts needing my attention.When Sydney has a snow-day and we have an epic malfunction in the kitchen, we decide to head to the breakfast joint we've frequented for years. Except today something is different. Our normal waitress, Emma, isn't all baggy clothes and ducking her head to keep me from seeing her face. Today? Today I feel like I see her for the first time, and damned if our gazes don't ignite a heat I've only felt while on the job.
