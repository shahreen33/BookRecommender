Mpreg Romance Brock Pilot always wanted to be a school psychologist, and he worked hard to make that happen. His first assignment is at his old high school and reality isn’t quite living up to fantasy. But he’s passionate about his career and even though the alpha/omega society he lives in expects him to settle down and have a bunch of babies, he isn’t interested.  Trevor Campbell pulls Brock over one afternoon and immediately recognizes Brock as the kindhearted boy who’d shown him around on his first day of school years ago. He’d always had a tiny crush on Brock, but they didn’t run in the same crowd, so they never really got close. But he’s always remembered how warm Brock was to him.  When the two run into each other yet again at a club, their mutual attraction sparks. Neither man is interested in anything serious, but they both enjoy each other’s company. They decide a friends with benefits type of relationship is just about perfect. Everything is hot, and fun and drama free.  Until Brock gets pregnant.  The Cop and His Omega is a 42, 000 word Mpreg Romance with lots of hot scenes and a HEA guaranteed.
