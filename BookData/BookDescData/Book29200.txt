Collects Extraordinary X-Men #6-12.Extraordinary adventures demand Extraordinary X-Men, and no frontier is too wild for this crew! While one team of X-Men stages a daring rescue mission in Weirdworld, the members of another delve deep into their own teammate's psyche! Weird is nothing new for hardened mutants like Old Man Logan, Colossus, Iceman and Magik — but are Storm and Jean Grey prepared for what lies in the mind of Nightcrawler? Then, to save the present, the X-Men race into a perilous future ruled by an old — and we mean old — enemy. They're mutantkind's last hope, but can they outrun the immortal Apocalypse and his new Horsemen? Before you answer that, you should know: One of those Horsemen is a Venom-powered Wolverine! A battle for the ages is about to begin — but who will survive the Apocalypse Wars?
