Paranormal Dating Agency Book 8 - STANDALONE  BBW Paranormal Shape Shifter Romance  Plus-size Rebecca’s on a jaunt to another world. She had hopes of finding herself a nice, sweet shifter like her sister, but somehow she ended up attracted to the big, fiery dragon. A dragon who isn’t looking for love. If only he didn’t have eyes that made her want to take her panties off and a body that sent her hormones into a coma, life would be a lot easier.  Vikter Dragos is dying. His dragon couldn’t find a mate and he’s at the end of his time. He’s fighting the attraction for a sassy, curvy human, but it’s near impossible to stay away from her. If only she’d been his mate, life would be so much easier. He’s losing control of his dragon and his emotions. With Becca around, his life just got more complicated.  Becca’s in constant confusion over Vikter’s hot and cold attitude. One moment he’s kissing her like the world’s going to end and the next he’s warning her off getting attached. Figuring out how to scale this dragon might take a lot more patience than she’s got. When competition arises and Vikter sees another wants Becca, he’ll face his feelings or risk losing her forever.  Reader Note: Hang on to your panties, folks! This book contains smokin' hot sex (the fire-breathing kind), adult language (we like some freaky dirty talk), violence and verbal smack downs. If this is not the kind of stuff you like to read, skip this book. However, if you like dirrrrrty (with all those Rs) sex with an anti-social dragon on one curvy sarcastic girl, then this is right up your alley. Enjoy!
