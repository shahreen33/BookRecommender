Henry VII once warned his son, the future King of England, not to trust Thomas More; years later that same son made More his confidante and advisor. But the allegiance is dangerously one-sided. A family man, lawyer and writer, More's ambitions are humble, whilst Henry's are endless. As More's career at court rises so too does his religious fervour, much to the concern of his eldest daughter, Meg. Torn between her heretic husband and the secrets her father has confided in her, it is only a matter of time before her More will make the ultimate sacrifice for his faith.
