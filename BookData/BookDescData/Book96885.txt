Welcome to the Billionaire Bachelors series, where the sexiest men in the city are about to meet their match… Playboy CEO, Cal McAdams, lives life in the fast lane: hot women, hotter deals, and… a fake fiancee? I signed on to help reform his reckless image and win custody of his god-children, but I wasn’t expecting to come face-to-face (and mouth-to-mouth) with my wild Vegas hook-up from three years ago.  AKA, 6”3 of tanned muscle, sharp suits, and ‘undress me’ eyes. AAKA, the best thigh-clenching, bed-shaking sex of my life. AAAKA, the man who couldn’t be more off-limits if he had a uranium belt wrapped around his, um, assets.  I’ve never been one to break the rules, but Cal has me wanting to rip them up - and roll around naked on the scrap paper. But with just three weeks to turn this bachelor into a DILF, can we keep our crazy chemistry from derailing his plans? Or will gold-digging relatives, rambunctious pre-teens, and a little thing called love leave us both crashed out of the race?  Find out in the new sexy, hilarious romantic comedy from Lila Monroe!
