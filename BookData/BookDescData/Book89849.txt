The Plan begins with Rachel as a young child having a very special relationship with Jesus. Her new friend comforts her and encourages her but they lose contact in time as the world steers her down a different path. Horrors upon horrors happen until she is face to face once again with her Savior. At the age of thirty-four, she learns to rely and depend on her childhood friend once again. As her life and lifestyle dramatically changes the Lord introduces her to the love of her life. Experiences causes her to have compassion when young romances go wrong, this brings her to a situation at church where she sees many teenage girls enthralled over a fictional movie character. The movie, a love story between a mortal and a vampire, is not Rachel's usual kind of entertainment. With an open mind, she watches the movie knowing that she is being lead there for a purpose. No wonder this movie has the young girls' fascination: the male lead was fashioned after Jesus. This immediately propels her to want to tell her own story. Should she reveal her disgusting past and risk losing the respect she has with the congregation by sharing everything to keep these young girls from going through the same horrors without the Lord?
