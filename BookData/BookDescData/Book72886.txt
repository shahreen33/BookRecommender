Based on an ancient and beloved Zen fable, this children’s story is about a wise boy who helps a girl who isn’t very nice to him. Although his friend becomes upset about the situation, the wise boy simply lets it go and continues playing. The story captures Zen concepts, such as being in the present moment, doing something nice without expecting anything in return, letting go of unpleasant experiences, and not lingering on negative thoughts. The book’s beautiful illustrations juxtapose modern graphics with traditional backgrounds to transpose the old into the new, thus creating an accessible context for deeply meaningful concepts.
