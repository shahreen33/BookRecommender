Take a chance on a new life and maybe you’ll find your happy ever after. Because true love is always worth the risk…  Handsome prince, beautiful house, fabulous job? Polly has none of these. All she has to her name is a string of failed relationships and she’s up to her ears in debt. She sees herself as a hopeless case and would do anything to change her luck.  Simon is approaching the big 50. He’s off his game at work, his kids don’t seem to notice he exists and his wife seems to think he’s made of money. As for sex …what’s that?  So when the opportunity comes for both of them to swap their lives for a life of luxury, they jump at the chance. For Simon a life of helicopters, fast cars and hot babes beckons. For Polly, it’s all diamonds, spa days and celebrity parties. What more could they want?  Trouble is, the grass isn’t always greener on the other side. Is life in the fast lane more than either of them can cope with?  A witty, heart warming read, perfect for fans of Fiona Gibson and Carole Matthews.   Praise for Carol Wyer:
