 Ariana has been kidnapped.   Ariana hoped never to know the horrors of living in captivity again. But she wakes to find herself a prisoner once more, and no one can save her this time. Her captors have bound her beasties inside her, her mates don’t know where she is, and a betrayal shatters her last hope.  Soon she learns the terrible truth. Her captors plan to use her blood to exterminate vampires. Trapped in a science experiment from hell, Ariana has no escape.  But there are two things her captors didn’t count on. Ariana’s blood does more than turn vampires human. And no one knows just what Ariana is truly capable of—not even Ariana herself.  This is a reverse harem paranormal romance that features one kick-butt woman and her four shifter mates. It contains violence, medium burn romance, sexually explicit content, magic, vampires, and a lot of action. For ages 18+.
