Let Me Fall is the latest New Adult Romance in Lily Foster’s Let Me series  What was your Senior Superlative? Most likely to succeed, Most likely to win an Olympic gold, Most likely to snag a billionaire? Me? If the administration at Westerly High would have allowed the student body free rein, full creative control, I would have been voted: Most likely to turn tricks for a living, Most likely to screw you over, or… Most likely to—hopefully—die a slow and painful death. In the weeks leading up to graduation, I was the single-most hated member of my senior class. I was the girl who had driven the school’s golden boy to his demise. I was the girl who’d done something sordid and shameful. Exposed in a cruel and very public way, I was the girl who got what she deserved. I’m Carolyn. This is my story, and believe it or not, there’s a happy ending—even for someone like me.  Early Critical Acclaim for Let Me Fall 
  Publisher's Weekly, The BookLife Prize in Fiction Review:
 Smart and attractive Carolyn Harris and academically-challenged football star Jeremy Rivers find their lives intertwined in a wealthy Connecticut town in this gripping tale that effectively straddles the line between young adult and romance. Both the sweetness of young love and the dark underside of high school cliques are effectively depicted by a well-developed cast of characters shadowed by tragedy but reaching for independence and happiness. While the conventional ending is never in doubt, readers will find themselves deeply engaged by Carolyn and Jeremy and the twists and turns of this genuinely engrossing story.
