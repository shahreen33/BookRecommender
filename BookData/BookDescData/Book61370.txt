2031 A.D.Just a week before Christmas, all hell breaks loose. A crime wave tears through Cryo City like a typhoon, with a sudden explosion of poisoned eggnog on the supermarket shelves and a swarm of an immortal psychopath's sentient, multiplying limbs riding the wave. Damian Warkowski is caught in the middle of this royal mess as he's tasked with finding the man he believes to be responsible for all this chaos--an immortal bank robber whose agenda seems to extend a lot further than running a few bank jobs to fill his pockets.Something big is going down, and no one knows what, but they do know that it ain't gonna be pretty.He's got till Christmas Day to bring it all to a stop; otherwise, the city might not survive to see the New Year.
