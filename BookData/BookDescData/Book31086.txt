Live by his rules or die by them… In the wake of the zombie apocalypse, twenty-year-old Lee Walker is desperately trying to keep the last of her family alive. Salvation seems to come in the form of Dominic Rosario, a sexy army sergeant. Despite his questionable motives and brutal tactics, Lee can’t deny the scorching attraction burning between them. When a dangerous mission goes south, Lee must face her growing feelings for Dominic and a terrifying new creature that will hunt them to the grave.  This 23K+ word novella is the first episode in the Heaven in Hell series and ends on a cliffhanger. Please note that this is a slow burn series (the content gets steamier as the episodes go on) and you can read the first four episodes individually or all together in the boxset.
