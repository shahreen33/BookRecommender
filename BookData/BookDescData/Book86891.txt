It is the 22nd century. Humanity has been given faster than light travel via space warping engines – but that has not given us unity. The United States, Imperial Russia, China, Brazil and the European Union each battle in deep space for colonies while Earth remains locked in a cold war. In this new era, the most powerful weapons is not nuclear bombs or battleships: It is Devil Troops. Augmented men and women with implanted micro-sized FTL engines controlled by integrated AIs. Via the manipulation of FTL fields, Devil Troopers display telekinesis, flight, and superhuman toughness.  DeShane Gallagher is one of the USA’s newest Devil Troops. Paired with a snarky and flirtatious AI named Loki, she is thrust into a lethal race to uncover a conspiracy spanning multiple solar systems which may plunge the whole human race into a war that no one can win.  Devil May Care is 60,000 words of sexy sci-fi thriller, packed with action, romance, aliens, cool spaceships, and snark.
