My secret is out.You know that saying, to hell in a hand basket? That’s where my life is headed. Three days ago, the Vampire Court learned about my forbidden FireSoul magic. It’s basically a death sentence. Except they’ve made me a deal. I have to pass a series of trials, designed to test my magic and my loyalty. If I survive, I become an ally of the Court, which would be awesome.Problem is, the trials are as deadly as a hungry hellhound and I can’t trust my partner, the sexy hybrid-vampire Ares. Worse, there’s a new magic inside me that’s eating me alive. It won’t stop until I learn to control it, but that’s a tall order given everything else that’s on my plate. Between the trials and a recent theft at my shop, Ancient Magic, I’m up to my ears in magical problems.Trial by Magic is a fast-paced fantasy mystery with a kick-butt heroine, a tough hero, and magic that will blow your socks off.
