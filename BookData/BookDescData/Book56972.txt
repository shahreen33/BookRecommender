This engaging and unprecedented work captures the compelling story of John F. Kennedy's role in advancing the United States' space program, set against the Cold War with the Soviet Union. The stunning collection of history and photographs crafted by authors John Bisney and J. L. Pickering illustrates Kennedy's close association with the race to space during his legendary time in office. In addition to the exhaustive research and rare photographs, the authors have also included excerpts from Kennedy's speeches, news conferences, and once-secret White House recordings to provide the reader with more context through the president's own words. While Kennedy did not live to see the fruition of many of the endeavors he supported, his legacy lives on in many ways--many of which are captured in this important work.
