It’s days before Christmas and the Craig family are out for their final shopping trip. When the kids pile into an electric kiddie train, the family continues to shop and await their return. “Things are not what they seem,” the uncle warns them. As time goes by, the kids don’t return. Now the uncle is missing. And no one’s heard of the electric kiddie train prowling the sidewalks and streets of the trendy lifestyle center in the brutal cold. The night will only get darker and colder and more terrifying for the Craig family as the desperate search for the missing family members begin.
