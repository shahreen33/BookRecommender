After a few choice words, he lets her go with not one ticket, but three.  Next time she should check the attitude at the door and realize that he’s a cop, and just doing his job.  -Come get some.-  Fast forward a week, and he’s still unable to think about anything else but her and her bad attitude—oh, and those sexy lips, angry eyes, and her promise to make his life hell.  Knowing he should stay away, he takes a step back and tries not to think about anything that has to do with those long legs, and that mouth that could be used for much better things than spewing venom.  At an interview, she rattles off a random number to use as a reference for a job that she desperately needs, and that number just happens to be Johnny’s.

Vowing to make her life hell, he decides to have a little fun.  -Never get enough.-  What he doesn’t expect is to fall for her.  The more Johnny learns about June, the deeper he digs his hole. Soon, he doesn’t know which way is up, and he’s just fine with that.  Then he learns that not everyone bothers to dig past her prickly demeanor and get to the woman that lives deeper.  When one too many citizens of Hostel, Texas tries to back her against the wall, he’s had enough.  After all, you don’t mess with what’s his.
