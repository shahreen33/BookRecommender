I broke her heart ten years ago and left town.She hates me, and rightly so. It doesn’t matter that the rest of the country loves me, that I’m a starting quarterback with a multimillion-dollar contract. Because when I look in the mirror, all I see is a failure who was too young—and too afraid—to fight for what I wanted.But I’m not that guy anymore, and all I need is one shot to convince her.***He has no idea what happened after he left. And now I’m supposed to work alongside him like we don’t have this huge, messy history?But I’m older now, wiser, and I won’t let anything stand in my way of doing a good job for this league. Not even one overpaid, arrogant player who thinks we’re going to kiss and make up.News flash, buddy: I am over you.
