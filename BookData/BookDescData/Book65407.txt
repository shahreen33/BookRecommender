Ironworker Wayne Colson has come to the real estate office where his wife, Carmen, works at the worst possible time: while Ojibway Indian hit man Armand Degas and loose cannon Richie Nix are there to shake down Carmen's boss. Unable to help himself, Wayne steps into harm's way . . . and sends the two malefactors out the door bleeding. Now the shooter-for-hire and his ex-con partner are after the Colsons and there's little the state police and local law enforcement can do about it. The best the feds can offer is the Witness Security Program. So it's coming down to just Wayne and Carmen--and ultimately to Carmen herself--to deal with two rough-trade misfits with murder on their minds.
