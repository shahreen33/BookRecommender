Barret Turgard is in a desperate battle to keep his broken panther steady. All he needs to coast through life, and stick with his routine—work, eat, sleep, and protect his crew. Anything extra could send his inner animal into a tailspin he can’t escape. And when a female flight shifter trespasses in Red Havoc territory, she threatens to do just that. Eden is feisty and beautiful, but she sees too much, and Barret is finding it harder and harder to hide his darkness from her and his crew. His control over his animal is slipping with every secret she pulls from him. She doesn’t know it yet…but she’s messing with a monster.  Eden Brown is in the Appalachian Mountains to help a friend, but the reclusive panther shifters there don’t allow trespassers. Barret is dangerous, and it’s clear he’s hunting her, so why isn’t she afraid of him? She isn’t made for a mate, but the closer she gets to him, she more she thinks he could be the one who changes her destiny. That is…until he finds out who she really is. Barret thinks he’s the monster, but Eden knows the truth. It’s her inner flight shifter that could bring chaos to the mountains, and war to the Red Havoc Crew.
