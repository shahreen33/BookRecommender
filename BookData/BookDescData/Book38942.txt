Simon Kirby-Jones Mysteries #4  
  From the New York Times bestselling author of the Cat in the Stacks Mystery Series, a traditional British village cozy mystery series…with a twist!
  “A delight from start to finish. Everything you could wish for in a British cozy. Simon Kirby-Jones is a charming and intriguing sleuth who puts the village of Snupperton Mumsley squarely on the mystery map.” —Dorothy Cannell  “A delightful English village whodunit filled with some of the most eccentric characters you’ll ever run across in a mystery novel.” —The Denver Post   Lady Prunella Blitherington, the grande dame mother of Simon Kirby-Jones’s handsome trusty assistant, Giles, has just sold one of her meadows to a London businessman who plans to turn the land into a lucrative tourist attraction. But first he has to figure out how to oust a club zealously dedicated to medieval reenactments.  Since Henry Baker, the original “king” of the group is vehemently opposed to the idea of a tourist attraction, he is expelled for a more amenable leader, restaurant owner Luke d’Amboise. But when Henry is found poisoned by a fig pastry (recipe included!), Simon discovers a bitter rivalry within the medieval players…could it be enough to kill a king?!?  Simon already has his hands full discovering who is at the bottom of this coup d’etat—when Tristan Lovelace, Simon’s very charming former boyfriend visits Snupperton Mumsley. Will Simon succumb to Tristan’s charisma or will he finally soften towards Giles Blitherington, his always loyal personal assistant?
