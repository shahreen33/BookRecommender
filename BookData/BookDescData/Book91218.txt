Five Cuevas @fivetravelsThree guesses to where I'm going next. Starts with an M. Ends with a U. Has a lechon named after it. #travelTwenty-something travel blogger Five thinks she has hit the jackpot when she gets invited to glittering Macau for an all-expense-paid bloggers tour. Think majestic old churches, sparkling casinos, exhilarating bungee jumps, and the world's most unforgettable egg tarts. The trip is practically perfect, except for one little glitch. She gets assigned to be travel buddies with Jesse, the world's most infuriating photo blogger, and it's definitely war at first sight. Will Five let Jesse turn her dream vacation into a total nightmare? Or will falling in love be on the itinerary?
