“What do you do when you write down all your secrets? No…that’s not enough. What do you do when you write down all your secrets and the one person who should never read them does? I’ll tell you what you do.You hope.” RENRen didn’t know the meaning of love until he took Della for his own.To begin with he hated her, but as the months bled into years, he learned the opposite of hate, dedicating his life to giving her everything.Every sacrifice, every gift, he gave wholeheartedly.But then love turned to lust and ruined everything.DELLAI was stupid to write my secrets down, but I’d been stupid before so it was nothing new.I couldn’t blame him, hate him, fix him.I tried to move on without him.But no matter what I did, I couldn’t seem to delete the secrets I’d written.Until something happened.Until he came back and read my stupid secrets.And nothing was the same after that.
