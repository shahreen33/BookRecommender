In the Blue, the world’s last city, all is not well.Julia is stuck within its walls. She serves the nobility from a distance until she meets Lucas, a boy who believes in fairytales that Julia’s world can’t accommodate.

As he searches for a lost queen, he finds an enemy rising that he thought long dead. An enemy that the humans have forgotten how to fight.One way or another, the walls of the Blue are coming down. The only question is what side you’ll be on when they do.
