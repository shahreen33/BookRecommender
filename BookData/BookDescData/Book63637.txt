Eric and Leslie urge transformation—from doubting God's power to expecting His supernatural interventionfrom distance from God to connection with Himfrom the sense of falling short to the strength of victoryfrom "bless this food" prayers to world-changing intercessionfrom feeling defeated to setting people freeReaders whose concept of prayer has fallen into disrepair will newly desire to pray and bring God's purposes to bear on earth. Wrestling Prayer will light a soul-fire that can burn bright and hot for years to come.
