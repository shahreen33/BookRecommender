Hockey season may be over, but in New York Times bestselling author Sawyer Bennett’s new novel, a Carolina Cold Fury heartbreaker is heating things up off the ice and eager to score with the girl next door.No one skates like Reed Olson. In the off-season, no one plays like him either. After back-to-back championships, Reed craves a different kind of action. Good thing there’s no shortage of women ready for a summer fling with a sports star. Reed has a specific type—blond, busty, not too bright—and a little black book full of options. But when his bed starts rocking, it’s his unexpectedly sexy neighbor who comes knocking. And the brainy beauty is impossible to ignore.Josie Ives desperately needs something her celebrity neighbor obviously doesn’t: sleep. His headboard banging against the wall is keeping her up at night—not to mention inspiring some very naughty dreams. Reed is everything she imagined: a little too good-looking, with a body that puts Greek gods to shame. But he’s also funny and charming—a tempting combination. Josie’s the opposite of his type, yet the chemistry between them is undeniable. Their friendship certainly has its benefits, and it’s heating up to be so much more.
