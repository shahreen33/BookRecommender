We’ve all heard the story of the Four Horsemen. Harbingers of the apocalypse. Destruction given form. Four of the sexiest—wait no—forget that. You get my point. So imagine my surprise when I find out everything I’ve ever been told, is a lie.But we’re getting ahead of ourselves here. Let’s start from the beginning.My name is Ruby Morningstar. I run a tattoo parlor in Portland with my bestfriend, have a pet raccoon, a crazy ex that stalks me, not to mention this one little thing… I’m a demon. Half-succubus, to be exact. For the last twenty-three years of my life, that’s the story I believed, but on the day a handsome stranger bails me out of jail my world is turned upside down, and suddenly I don’t know who I am anymore.Because the Four Horsemen aren’t the bringers of the apocalypse.I am.Talk about never catching a break.
