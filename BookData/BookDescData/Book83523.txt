This book begins the saga of a man whose world will come to know him as Nagaro – “Nameless Man.” He is not quite eighteen when he flees from something “better not remembered,” and his memories are hidden from him, leaving him to try to find a way to live in the world as he relearns its ways. But disturbing dreams soon prompt him to try to unlock his memory and discover what was done to him. He learns he was a foundling, raised in obscurity by a noble lady until his idyllic life was shattered by powerful men bent on controlling him for reasons he can only guess at. But by the time the veil is fully lifted from his mind, he has been captured by sea raiders and chained to the oar of a war galley. There he must find a way to regain his freedom while keeping his past a secret, for his ordeal has left him scarred. He knows that the powerful men who hurt him must think him dead – and he intends to keep it that way.
