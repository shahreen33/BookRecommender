Just-graduated David has been brightening up his gray Surrey, England days with the porn collection hidden in his parents' shed, but when he finds that their American foreign exchange student, Dawn, has discovered his magazines, things really begin to heat up. David’s parents insist that he look for a job, but Dawn has the week off and is determined to work on her tan. Distracted David finds himself increasingly tempted by their seductive, older foreign exchange student, who makes it very clear what she wants. In spite of the Study Abroad program’s policy that no “relations” are allowed between a student and anyone in their host family—not to mention David’s mother’s insistence that they treat each other as “brother and sister,”—Dawn’s teasing ways slowly break down the barrier between them until they both give in to their lust. But what are they going to do about the feelings that have developed between them in the meantime?Warnings: This title contains erotic situations, graphic language, anal sex, and makes mention of pornography, hammers, interesting uses for rubber bands, dungarees, bikinis, and lots of Britishisms you may or may not have to look up.Note to readers: This story appeared in another, now rather infamous book of mine titled Naughty Bits. Yank, previously titled Foreign Exchange, is a slightly less naughty, but no less sexy re-telling of those events--updated and redressed for your reading pleasure.
