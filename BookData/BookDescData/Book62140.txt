Marla Mason has faced a lot of tough adversaries in her years as chief sorcerer of Felport, but in this short story her city is menaced by a monster from the past: the legendary Beast of Felport, a creature that slaughtered the city's original settlers hundreds of years before, has returned. But the Beast isn't the only refugee from the past -- the city's first chief sorcerer, the ruthless Everett Malkin, has traveled through time as well. He's none too pleased with how Marla's running things... and Marla has never been too good at taking criticism.
