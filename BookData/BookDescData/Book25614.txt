The master of everything has found his match. Jared Westin knows his reputation and likes it. He gets the job done. No emotion. No baggage. That's why his elite ops company, The Titan Group, is better than the best. They complete projects classified as mission impossible.And then, in walks a woman as tough as she is sexy. His counterpart in every way, should he choose to admit it.She's not willing to let her heart fall. Ousted undercover ATF agent Lilly Chase only answers to "Sugar". Jared is the only man who can see past her leather-and-lipstick demeanor, and that revelation is terrifying. She was fired for helping Titan on a questionable arrest she should've ignored, then partnered with Jared's rival on an assignment in Afghanistan.Distance and danger do nothing to change her feelings. When she's left on the side of a mountain to die, an unexpected ally comes forward, and might open her heart.The stakes couldn't be higher. Saving Sugar isn't a normal rescue operation. It pits Titan against its rival, Jared against his nemesis. Chasing Sugar's heart isn't a simple task, either. She fights him, fights them, always ready to run. When she becomes a pawn in a game of collateral damage, Jared must risk his life to save her - the woman whose bravado and surprising sweetness has given him the one thing he never had.
