This small volume—containing the Kitáb-i-‘Ahd of Bahá’u’lláh, the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh by Shoghi Effendi—has been put together for the purpose of aiding those who wish to deepen their understanding of the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh. It is hoped that those participating in the study of Book 8 of the Ruhi Institute sequence, The Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh, may find this book to be a helpful resource.
