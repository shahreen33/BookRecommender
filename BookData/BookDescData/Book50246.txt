Charlotte Bloom is a city girl.She likes stilettos, sidewalks, and the Starbucks on every corner. It doesn't matter that her heels hurt or the sidewalks cracked or no one at the coffee store remembers her name. The horns of taxi drivers serenade her as she walks to work and fast-paced action fills her days which is why she needs her boss to come home from the farm. There are contracts to be signed. Money to be made. Hands to be greased and â€” oh my god, is that a cow?Colton Blackwood is a country man.He wants slow walks, slow kisses, and slow love-making, but more than anything he wants that with Charlotte. It doesn't matter that she's scared of the farm animals or that she's suspicious that the store clerk knows her name. He knows that love's the same whether you're wearing a suit in the boardroom or a pair of cowboy boots on the ranch. The trick is convincing Charlotte but, it'll happen because Colton won't accept anything but her by his side.
