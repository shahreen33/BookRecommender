Failing grades. Misleading wind vampires. And a fortune in forgotten gold.  Traveling to the most remote region of China certainly wasnâ€™t what Ben Vecchio had in mind for his summer vacation, but when Tenzin suggested a quick trip, he could hardly turn down a chance to keep her out of trouble and practice the Mandarin he still struggled with in class.  Of course, Tenzin might not have been clear about everything travel entailed.  Driving a truck full of rotting vegetables and twenty million in gold from Kashgar to Shanghai was only the start. If Ben can keep the treasure away from grasping immortals, the reward will be more than worth the effort. But when has travel with a five-thousand-year-old wind vampire ever been simple?  SHADOWS AND GOLD is a prequel novella in the Elemental Legacy series.
