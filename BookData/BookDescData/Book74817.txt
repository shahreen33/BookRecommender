But there are people waiting for Dolly on the outside ­- tough ex-prisoners who know about the diamonds, and they all want a cut.      Also waiting for Dolly is DS Mike Withey. He holds her personally responsible for the death of his sister in the diamond raid ten years earlier. And he wants her back inside.  Dolly Rawlins has other plans. But can she realise the dream that kept her going all those years in prison and avoid those who are after her?
