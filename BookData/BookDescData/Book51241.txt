Dear Author,I am so in love with this man, but I’m afraid to say anything because I’m pretty sure he only wants to play and I don’t want to scare him off. He thinks I’m too young to commit to someone, but I’m not. He takes such good care of me, but he doesn’t realize I can take care of him, too. He needs to take control during sex, and I love it when he does. He knows exactly how to get me going, and I don’t want to lose that.Photo Description: In an austere white bedroom, two men are locked in a passionate embrace. The dark haired man, on the bottom, has one arm draped over the hips of the blond man, on top. His other hand tightly grasps his lover’s neck. At the same time, he places a tender kiss on his lover’s neck. His lover, instead of fighting to free himself, grips his shoulder, encouraging him to tighten his grip.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "Love’s Landscapes" event.
