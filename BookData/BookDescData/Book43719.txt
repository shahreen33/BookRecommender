Billions will die. Governments will fall. A New World Order will rise. The Illuminati, the Deep State, Agenda 21 - to most people they're nothing more than conspiracy theories, but Frank Marshall knows it's all real. And the former Navy SEAL knows what's coming next.  The murder of three billion people. They call it the Angola virus, a lethal pathogen born not in the squalor of an African prison but in the germ-free laboratories controlled by The Committee, a powerful group of global elites who have shaped world events for decades. Now they've decided to reboot humanity and Angola will make it all possible. Unless Frank can stop them. From the mean streets of Harlem to the burning deserts of Iraq, from a run-down estate in south London to the barren peaks of the Swiss Alps, Frank will have to travel fast, use every military skill he possesses, if he is to stay one step ahead of the hunter teams and save the world from decimation.Because speed is everything. And the clock is already ticking.What readers are saying:★★★★★ ‘A gem of a conspiracy thriller.'★★★★★ ‘A well written, tense thriller.
