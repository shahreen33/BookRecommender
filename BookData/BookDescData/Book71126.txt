Discover a brand new race of Alpha males ready to find their mates in a dangerous warrior planet. Sassy women traveling with Gerri Wilder are in for the journey of a lifetime and a mate that will love them through the galaxy. Are you ready?  Grab the next Galaxan romance between a sexy warrior and his fiery mate.  Attention is something Riley Parks usually shies away from, but when she finds herself on a shifter planet in a distant galaxy, attention is exactly what she's getting. Especially from one smokin' hot hunk of a man. Jag. The man sends her body into heat and her mind to a scramble whenever he's near, but she's not having it. No way. A little taste might not hurt, though, right?  Royal prince, warrior, and womanizer, Jag Kasaval has his sights set on Riley. She turns his world upside down and his inner lion is clawing to claim her. Not used to rejection, he's willing to do anything to get his mate. What he didn't expect was a feisty hellcat waiting to be unleashed beneath her quiet exterior.  Riley and Jag are thrown together to help plan a royal wedding and coronation. She refuses to admit Jag is exactly the man she wants, even if matchmaker Gerri Wilder says it's in the cards. In the midst of palace intrigue, Riley's swept up in scandal and danger that drags her beyond the Galaxa she's come to know. With her life in the balance, Jag will have to find her before it's too late or lose her forever.
