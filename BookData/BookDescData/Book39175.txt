More than 200 all-new, never-before-published recipes for dishes that are "familiar but fresh, approachable but exciting." (Yotam Ottolenghi)Each recipe in New York Times columnist Melissa Clark's Dinner is meant to be dinner--one fantastic dish that is so satisfying and flavor-forward it can stand alone--or be paired with a simple salad or fresh bread on the side. This is what Melissa Clark means by changing the game.Organized by main ingredient--chicken, meat, fish and seafood, eggs, pasta and noodles, tofu, vegetable dinners, grains, pizza, soups, and salads that mean it--Dinner covers an astonishing breadth of recipes. There is something for every mood, season, and the amount of time you have: sheet pan chicken laced with spicy harissa, burgers amped with chorizo, curried lentils with poached eggs, to name just a few dishes in this indispensable collection. Here, too, are easy flourishes that make dinner exceptional: stir charred lemon into pasta, toss creamy Caesar-like dressing on a grain bowl. ***Praise for Melissa Clark's Dinner "The recipes in Melissa Clark's Dinner are everything I want for my dinner.
