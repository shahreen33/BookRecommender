Dr. Jan Pol is not your typical veterinarian. Born and raised the in Netherlands on a dairy farm, he is the star of Nat Geo Wild s hit show "The Incredible Dr. Pol" and has been treating animals in rural Michigan since the 1970s. Dr. Pol s more than 20,000 patients have ranged from white mice to 2600-pound horses and everything in between.  From the time he was twelve years old and helped deliver a litter of piglets on his family s farm to the incredible moments captured on his hit TV show, Dr. Pol has amassed a wealth of stories of what it s like caring for this menagerie of animals. He has established himself as an empathetic yet no-nonsense vet who isn t afraid to make the difficult decisions in order to do what s best for his patients--and their hard-working owners.  Reminiscent of the classic books of James Herriot, "Never Turn Your Back on an Angus Cow" is a charming, fascinating, and funny memoir that will delight animal lovers everywhere."
