From the ideas of early 19th-century socialists to the thoughts of Marx, Engels, Lenin &amp; Trotsky, Edmund Wilson traces the development of the political &amp; intellectual movements that culminated in the Russian Revolution. TO THE FINLAND STATION is a work of history on a grand scale, at once sweeping, detailed, closely reasoned &amp; passionately argued, that succeeds in painting an unforgettable picture--alive with conspirators, philosophers, utopians &amp; nihilists--of the making of the modern world. 'The 1st thing that strikes us about To the Finland Station is the vastness of its scope...It is easily, equally at home in the philosopher's study, in the prisoner's cell, on the steppes, in the streets, melancholy in great country houses, choking in fetid industrial slums...It can remind us that our history is alive &amp; open &amp; rich with excitement &amp; promise'--NY Times Book Review
