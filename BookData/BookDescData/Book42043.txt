"Seeing the great darkness within the Elvenking's heart, the High God cursed his descendants with a thirst for blood..."Nocturne, one of those descendants, doesn't fit in with the other Druen of Nardur. One winter night he saves a human slave, killing his neighbor in the process. Forced to leave behind the village of his birth, he begins a world-spanning journey in pursuit of a home. His search will take him from the icy wastes to the great cities of the world and beyond, perhaps even into the realms of humanity."The main character, Nocturne, is engaging and well-drawn... Cooper has created an intriguing and vivid fantasy world with a lot of plausible detail about its geography, weather, local economy, diverse species and relationships... [This book] is one of those Candide-type stories about the wanderer in search of himself and is quite compelling."--Inanna Arthen, author of the "Mortal Touch"
