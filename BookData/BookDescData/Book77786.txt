  Too fondly have I loved these stars;all these galaxies we once called ours.
The cosmic love between two goddesses is tempestuous at best. One is the goddess of a galaxy - a celestial creator, the other is the personification of a black hole, a divine destroyer. They fight and the create and they destroy and then they do it all over again.Their relationship is explored in sonnets and villanelles, the arc of their love tracked in meter and verse. The poems touch on queer love, betrayal, trust, acceptance, and forgiveness cast against a backdrop of stardust and celestial detritus.
