An alternate cover for this ASIN can be found here.Here be an oracle. Despair all ye who seek her. Magic will have its cake and eat it too.  Okay, well. So I was mixing metaphors. I was new to the gig.  But as far as I could tell, there were three kinds of people. Those who wanted confirmation that they’d chosen the correct path. Those who wanted to deny there was any sort of destiny at all. And those who wanted to tear it all down.  So why was it always the third type that showed up at the door to my 1975 Brave Winnebago, dragging me into their power struggles and using my past against me — when I didn’t even know what that past was?  Could I thwart the destiny that had been envisioned for me before I was born? Could I carve out a future filled with love and light with my chosen mate?  I certainly knew what I was capable of doing to survive. Beyond the past, through the present, and well into the future … I’d see us. -------------------- This paranormal romance/urban fantasy is the third book in the Oracle Series by author Meghan Ciana Doidge.
