Ballet isn't just about tutus. It's hard work! It's kicking left when everyone is kicking right. Worrying if you'll fit into your costume. Getting on stage and realizing you forgot to use the bathroom! Aching backs and sore feet. Dizziness and stage fright. But there is also that magic feeling when the curtains part and the show begins . . .  In short, funny poems, Isadora takes an honest, irreverent look at the mishaps and the triumphs in the world of ballet-all captured in gorgeous pen and ink drawings that are sure to make any dancer smile
