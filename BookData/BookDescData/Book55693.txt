Logan is out of options.  His mother's new husband is awful, he can't find a paying job, and he's run out of couches to surf on. Desperate, he ends up in the unlikely position of standing on his ex-stepfather's porch holding all his worldly belongings in two cardboard boxes.  Craig is sure taking Logan in is a terrible idea.  It's been six years since he's seen his ex-wife's kid, and Craig hasn't forgotten the trouble the boy caused him. But it's cold out and Logan is clearly at the end of his rope. Craig decides in a fit of charity to help Logan get back on his feet. All he has to do is obey the rules.  Rules are meant to be broken.  Take one desperate Millennial and one bored Gen Xer. Add in an old grudge, guilt, unwelcome feelings, an inconvenient interest in Daddy kink, a need for discipline and regular meals, and punishment for rule-breaking. Shake well. Expect explosive results.  Rule Forty-Seven is a stand-alone 11k short with a May/December romance, sexy-fun times, snark, and a HEA.
