As summer comes to an end in her Jersey Shore town, Lucy Berberian continues to manage her family's Mediterranean restaurant. The Kebab Kitchen also has a food tent at this year's beach festival. But now a local businessman is under the boardwalk--dead by the sea . . .  With a sand castle contest and live music, Ocean Crest bids a bittersweet farewell to tourist season. Summer will return next year . . . but Archie Kincaid won't. The full-of-himself store owner has been fatally shot, soon after a screaming match with Lucy's best friend. Katie's far from the only suspect, though, since Archie had some bitter rivals--as well as some relationships no one knew about. It's up to Lucy to look into some seedy characters and solve the case before the wrong person gets skewered . . .Recipes included! "Clever and charming . . . A culinary delight that will have readers salivating over the food and hungry for literary answers." --RT Book Reviews,  4 Stars, on Hummus and Homicide
