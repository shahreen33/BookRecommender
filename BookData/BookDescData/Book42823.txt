A blinding snowstorm--and a homicidal maniac--traps a small party of friends in an isolated estate. The plot later takes on a claustrophobic feeling that leads into an unexpected end. Out of this deceptively simple set-up, Agatha Christie fashioned one of her most ingenious puzzlers that later became a successful play. "This classic title novella showcases the inimitable Christie at her inventive best, proving her reputation as "the champion deceiver of our time." (The New York Times)
