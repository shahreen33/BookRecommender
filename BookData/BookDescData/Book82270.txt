One day, the Thing falls from the sky and four strangers stumble across it. Together they decide to take care of it, but before long a media circus builds up around the creature they are protecting and the debate about the Thing spreads far around the world. What is the Thing? Who does it belong to? What does it do? And is it any use for anything at all? A story about kindness, unexpected friendships and a gentle commentary on the search for meaning in modern life.
