With this new supplement for Frostgrave, players lead their warbands into the vast network of catacombs, sewers, and dungeons that run beneath the Frozen City. It was in these dark confines that ancient wizards experimented on living creatures, creating strange hybrids and deadly monsters, many of which still roam the forgotten passageways. Along with a host of new scenarios, treasures, spells, and creatures, the book also contains rules for running games of Frostgrave set in dungeons, including traps and secret passages. With the wonderful and rare magical treasures to be discovered, will players risk taking their warbands down into the Breeding Pits?
