Welcome to Hollydale, a magical town where things aren’t always as they appear.  The Hollydale Omegas is a sweet, feel good series about finding love in a small town… with a little supernatural help. This is a non-shifter, contemporary mpreg series. From elves and ghosts, to cupid and leprechauns—this series stole your heart.  You fell in love with this crazy town starting with Rafe and Milo’s story in Pumpkin Spiced Omega and over thirteen books. Now it’s time to revisit our favorite town and see how they’re doing today. This is NOT a full length book! This is 11k of brand-new bonus material that was written for the bundled version. I’ve made these extra scenes available in this edition for the readers who already own the complete series but also want to add the new epilogues to their collection.  Warning: there will be red balls appearing in odd locations, Tom freaking out about turning forty, and two of our favorite supernatural hotties having a dance-off.  This is not a new book in the series, but it is new material! This is a compilation of the four epilogues that were included in the second bundled version of the series. These bonus stories show what happened in the years after the original stories ended.  These are bonus shorts for the Hollydale series, and should only be read after finishing the entire series. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a bunch of snort-laughs and a good helping of cuteness. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke?
