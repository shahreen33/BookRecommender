The King of the Monsters rises again, and for the first time in comics, he's bringing lots of other beloved Toho monsters with him in one destructive saga! When Godzilla appears off the coast of Japan, the Japanese government must respond quickly to contain the disaster... but before long, other monsters start appearing all over the world. Can humanity survive this mysterious onslaught of giant beasts? Writers Eric Powell (The Goon) and Tracy Marsh bring the mayhem a-plenty, and artist Phil Hester (Green Arrow, Swamp Thing) brings the massive monsters to life!
