Imagine a place where you can traipse beside massive ice age lakes and across some of the oldest known rocks on the planet, where you can hike through green boreal forests during the day and stare at the northern lights dancing against a velvet black sky at night, where you can watch moose graze in ponds and bald eagles soar overhead while gray wolves howl in the distance. The place is real: It's called Voyageurs National Park. But with the national park's incredible size of 370 square miles, how can you ensure that you see its main sights when vacationing or driving through? That's what Best Sights to See at Voyageurs National Park answers. In this volume, we've listed the top 10 most popular sights and detail the top day hiking trails to best experience them. Also included are nearby trails in Minnesota's Superior National Forest and the Boundary Waters Canoe Wilderness Area. This book includes TWO BONUS SECTIONS: "Day Hiking Primer" AND "National Parks Primer." Let's start planning your trip!
