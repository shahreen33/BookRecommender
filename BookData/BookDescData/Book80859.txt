When my parents split up they didn't know what to do with me . . .My family always lived at Mulberry Cottage. Mum, Dad, me - and Radish, my Sylvanian rabbit. But now Mum lives with Bill the Baboon and his three kids. Dad lives with Carrie and her twins. And where do I live? I live out of a suitcase. One week with Mum's new family, one week with Dad's.It's as easy as A B C. That's what everyone says. But all I want is to go home - back to Mulberry Cottage...
