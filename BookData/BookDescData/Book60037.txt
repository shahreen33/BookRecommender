Paws is tired. He just wants to rest. And to dream about the days when he used to chase rabbits. He still walks with Edward to the park twice a day, but only because Edward needs the fresh air. Until one day, Paws decides he doesn't want to go for another walk. He just wants to lie in Edward's bed. Paws has walked and walked. His paws are heavy. Paws doesn't have to walk anymore. Paws doesn't have to do anything anymore. And Paws falls asleep one last time, leaving Edward to dream of the days when Paws used to chase rabbits.
