Quoted from the Amazon.com webpage for this book: "Flash fiction is an excellent way for writers to tighten prose, learn the elements of story without getting lost in a novel-length manuscript and explore different genres without a big time commitment. This book provides fifty-two story prompts simple enough for the beginning writer to start with, yet complex enough for the more advanced writer to expand on. Originally designed as a year long challenge to write one story per week, the prompts are versatile enough to serve as daily or occasional exercises as well, and easily expandable into longer forms of prose. Also included are hints for getting started, and tips on how to quickly cut and shape a draft into something polished and artistic."
