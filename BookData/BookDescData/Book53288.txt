They didn’t come from the same world …  Born rich to a family of mafia royalty, Lucia Marcello was already destined to succeed. She wanted for absolutely nothing, until she met him.  Born poor to parents who never cared, Renzo Zulla was already destined to fail. He has struggled for absolutely everything, but she’ll prove to be his biggest fight yet.  She’s high society from the upscale suburbs. He’s a drug dealer from New York’s slums.  They just weren’t meant to be … until they were.  What would it take to change a life—an entire perspective? All the things you thought you knew and wanted?  For them, it took thirty-six days. And the privilege of meeting each other.  They shouldn’t be. They don’t fit. Love doesn’t care.  Note: Privilege is book one in a three-book trilogy following the same couple.
