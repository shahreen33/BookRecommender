I'm making strides in the world of dirt late model racing. With back-to-back championships under my belt, I'm determined to win a third and be the youngest driver in history to do so. I'm going to make it happen. My career is my focus. That is until the ultimate distraction in the form of a redheaded bombshell drops into my life.I know nothing about racing, but when my boss comes to me with a special assignment, I take it. Now, here I am traveling from city to city engrossed in this new world. I would never have dreamed that this project would lead me to new friendships and ultimately finding love.We made a deal, our time together would expire, and we would part ways. The only problem with that is, I'm not so sure that's what I want anymore. She's pushing at my walls, and I'm trusting her, letting them fall.It's a shame we put an end date on our time together. I knew I would fall for him, but I never dreamed that those feelings would run this deep. The plan was to walk away, that's what we agreed to, it's just going to be harder than I thought. I need a new plan one that helps me move on without him.
