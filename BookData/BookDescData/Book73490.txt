“The truth of the gospel of Jesus,” Heikkinen writes, “is that I am nothing more than a wretch and so much more than a saint.” Have you ever wondered if God could really save you? Have you ever thought grace might not be enough? In Wretched Saints, Heikkinen reveals the rough and beautiful side of grace so clearly that readers face up to the scars of sin—and have a renewed, startling realization that God’s incredible gospel is true.  Wretched Saints shows how grace is the ridiculously unwarranted posture of God that transforms sinners into saints, gives freedom to lavish grace on others, and stubbornly shapes us all to look like Jesus.
