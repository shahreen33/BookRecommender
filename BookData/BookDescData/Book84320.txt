Miss Evie Cole isnâ€™t one to take a threatening letter too seriously. To her, the much greater danger lies in losing her heart to the retired assassin sent to protect her.  Praise for MCALISTAIR'S FORTUNE:  "The writing is wonderful, really witty, lots of humor and just a really fun lighthearted romance. I loved both of the leads-- I thought them both refreshingly lovely characters." -- Goodreads  "If you love period romance, then every one of Alissa Johnson's books are for you. This complete series is charming, clever, well-written, entertaining, and has that all-important happily ever after." -- Goodreads  Praise for the Haverstons Series:  "A courageous, hilarious heroine, laugh-out-loud humor, and a true hero who will steal your heart." -- Jennifer Ashley  "Johnson returns. . .to delight readers once again with gentle wit, graceful writing, and a sensible and spirited heroine." -- Publishers Weekly Starred review
