Just before the year 1000 AD a young Viking named Thorvald the Far-farer turned his back on the pagan gods of his father to preach the Christian gospel. But his Icelandic countrymen mocked him as a homosexual, stoned him and finally outlawed him. Abandoning his homeland, Thorvald embarked on an epic journey to the golden heart of all medieval world maps - Jerusalem. A 1000 years later, in the year 2000, Victoria Clark embarked on the same journey to discover to what extent the dramatic changes and conflicts sweeping Western Europe a 1000 years ago still resonate today. The Far-Farers is both the story of this 21st century journey and a history of 11th century western Christendom.
