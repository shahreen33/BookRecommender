MEN MAKE MISTAKES. GOD WILL FORGIVE THEM. WILL THEIR WOMEN? Charles McIntyre built the lawless, godless mining town of Defiance practically with his bare hands … and without any remorse for the lives he destroyed along the way. Then a glimpse of true love, both earthly and heavenly, changed him. The question is, how much? Naomi Miller is a beautiful, decent woman. She says she loves McIntyre, that God does, too, and the past is behind them now. But McIntyre struggles to believe he’s worth saving … worth loving. Unfortunately, the temptations in Defiance only reinforce his doubts.  Billy Page abandoned Hannah Frink when he discovered she was going to have his baby … and now he can’t live with himself. Or without her. Determined to prove his love, he leaves his family and fortune behind and journeys to Defiance. Will Hannah take Billy back or give him what he deserves for the betrayal?  On a mountain high in the Rockies, looking down the barrel of a gun, both men will come to some stunning conclusions.  ~~ The sequel to the highly acclaimed, best-selling western romance A Lady in Defiance! ~~
