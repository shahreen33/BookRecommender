The life -- or is that death? -- of Kei Kurono has been completely unpredictable ever since he was transported into an inescapable condo and thrown into a high-stakes game of hunting aliens. Turns out inhabiting a carbon copy of his body after the original was splattered all over a subway only increases the adolescent problems of identity, insecurity, and horniness. Add in the constant danger of facing pissed-off aliens; the awkwardness of being reunited with a childhood friend who cries a lot; and the involuntarily chaste relationship he shares with the prettiest and best-endowed woman he's ever known; and Kei's stress level isn't dropping any time soon.Comes shrink-wrapped and carries an 18+ content advisory.
