This story is a prequel to the Trillium Creek series.  Finn is focused on continuing the success of his family's bakery. Eventually, he'll settle down with an alpha and start a family, but for now, he's content to satisfy his needs with casual hook-ups. Then a gorgeous stranger walks into the bakery, and Finn's whole world shifts.  Levi's father was a wolf shifter, but he was raised by his human mother and—like most hybrids—has never shown any wolf characteristics. That all changes when he enters Lupine Bakery and every instinct tells him the omega behind the counter is his.  Both Finn and Levi try to ignore what their hearts and bodies are telling them, but an unexpected pregnancy may force them to face what fate has in store.  Trillium Creek Book 1: Love at Long Last is coming soon.
