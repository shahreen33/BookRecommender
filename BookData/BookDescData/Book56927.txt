The New Human Rocket Returns! Sam Alexander is a kid bound by the gravity of a small town--and a father whose ridiculous drunken fairy tales about a "Nova Corps" were just another heavy burden. But lucky for Sam, gravity soon won't even matter--and those troubles will be a billion miles away. It's a boy, a helmet and an intergalactic legacy! As Sam trains with the Guardians of the Galaxy's Gamora and Rocket Racoon, the helmet leads Nova into intergalactic conflict that will affect the entire Marvel Unvierse! Mysteries are revealed in this breathtaking new series by the best-selling, award-winning team of Jeph Loeb and Ed McGuinness.Collecting: Nova 1-5, material from Point One
