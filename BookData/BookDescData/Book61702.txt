  This bad boy hockey player is about to meet his match...
  
Falling down is an accident.Staying down is a choice.Going down is a career-changer … that’s the one I did.How was I supposed to know that the NHL’s toughest enforcer, the Red Wings’ laundry room, and one security video would be my downfall? -----I’ve spent more time in the penalty box than any other player in the NHL, but this time I really screwed up.How was I supposed to know that one night and one choice would be worse than all of my transgressions on the ice? Now, I’ve lost my team, my sponsors, and my publicist.For most people, it’s bend or break. For me, it’s melt or harden. My decision became obvious when I walked into my new PR firm, and she was sitting behind the desk.
