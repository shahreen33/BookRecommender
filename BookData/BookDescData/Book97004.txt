Deathstroke may be one of the most hardened anti-heroes in the DC Universe, but there's no cutting corners when it comes to contract killing, especially when your family is on the hit list! Confronted by his own troubled past and challenged to reinvent himself before he loses everything and everyone in his life, Slade Wilson, a.k.a. Deathstroke, finds himself and those he values most in the crosshairs--stalked by an unseen enemy.Collecting: Deathstroke 1-5, Rebirth
