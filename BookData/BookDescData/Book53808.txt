  She Said
 is a wonderful celebration of the wit and wisdom of women through the ages.In it you’ll find writers, artists, politicians, actors, musicians, fashionistas, from Sappho to Beyoncé and Dorothy Parker to Carrie Fisher, all of whom have two things in common: brilliant minds and barbed wits that sting with their precision.Featuring women from as far back as 700 BC and right up to the modern day, the quotations and classic one-liners found here will inspire and delight, whether they are cheeky retorts from the outspoken, barbed reflections from the thoughtful or righteous indignation from the slighted.In the words of Elizabeth von Arnim (1866–1941), 'A woman's tongue is a deadly weapon and the most difficult thing in the world to keep in order.'
