The happily ever after Angel never expected was interrupted in a way he never could have imagined.  It’s been years since the death of the only Alpha he’s ever loved, and while he takes solace in his family, his heart has never quite healed the way it should have.  To make matters worse, the Futurus Initiative is intent on using Mitchell’s good name to promote its agenda to raise the dead via its most audacious science project yet. Once someone is gone, they don’t come back. Angel knows this better than anyone. He also knows the danger of hope.  When a mistake of epic proportions leads a man with Mitchell’s memories to his door, Angel is forced to put his personal feelings aside in order to help the wayward Alpha come to terms with his strange existence. No one could ever replace Mitchell, including the man who was created for that very purpose, but Angel’s heart begins to respond to Clay in ways that just shouldn’t be possible. He’s left to wonder whether he’s falling for Futurus’ latest scheme, or if fate simply isn’t done with their love story.  This is the final installment in The Mountain Shifters series and is not meant to be read as a standalone. Audiences 18+ only. An MPREG Shifter Romance.
