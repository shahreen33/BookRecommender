Nicole goes horseback riding, not knowing that the events of the day would forever change her life. After she falls off her horse and hits her head she wakes up to unfamiliar surroundings only to find she has traveled back in time to the year 1812. She swung into the saddle, took a deep breath and then mustered the strength to ask him a question that she had been putting off. "What year is it?" She exhaled slowly, preparing herself for his response knowing that when she woke up this morning it was 1997. Flaming Arrow started to ride off, and then turned his horse to face her. "It is 1812"
