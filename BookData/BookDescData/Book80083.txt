Women of Wasps and War is a grim, gripping tale of power and politics, and the heart-breaking struggle between love and honour.  Agata, the Duchess of Ambrovna, was never meant to take the throne.  In a land where men rule, her sole purpose was to smile and curtsey.  However, when war left her land leaderless, the Fatherhood religion begrudgingly allowed a first; a woman to rule.   Now the war is over the men have returned more arrogant and cruel than ever, and the Duchess is shoved back into a life of needlework and silence.  But with her new thirst for justice, Agata is reluctant to allow her country to return to its old ways.  Without her position of power, Agata and her circle of women look to the taboo wisdom of the Wasp Women for answers. But this ancient knowledge comes with consequences, and with death and treachery on the horizon, Agata must decide whether it is worth the risk.
