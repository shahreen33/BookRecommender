Imagine a world where death is merely an inconvenience. A new body awaits and we resume living, fully aware of the past, but at a price -- eternal life as slaves to masters who forbid individuality. For rebels who refuse to conform, the final solution is perpetual amnesia, removing all knowledge of past lives. One victim of the memory-wipe struggles to decipher his dreams and regain his sense of identity, only to learn of the hero he should be and what it means to occupy a body -- the sexual urges, escapism through intoxication, and the sense of self for a body, entirely different for a soul. This exploration of memory, dreams and the subconscious is also an action adventure as the hero faces dire challenges, joined by an oddball crew of fellow rebels whose allegiance is questionable. Awakening begins the Dead Forever trilogy, followed by Apotheosis and Resonance.
