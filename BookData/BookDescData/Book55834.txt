When Ivy goes to Las Vegas with her parents she never expects to wake up married to Deacon, one of her dad's best friends and her teenage crush. Especially considering the last time she saw him she'd kissed him and he totally blew her off. She thought he wasn't interested, but the ring on her finger says otherwiseâ€¦now if she could only remember actually getting married.   Deacon has spent the last few years biding his time, giving Ivy a chance to grow up before he claimed her as his. One night was all it took to get his ring on her finger, and he'll be damned if he lets anyone keep them apart now. Something easier said than done when Ivy's parents find out he made their darling daughter his wife.  Author's note- This novella is part of the Last Resort Motel series, but is a stand alone.
