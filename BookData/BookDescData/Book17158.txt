One of the true and unanticipated highlights on a dull and tepid comic book scene in the late 1970's, the Steve Englehart/Marshall Rogers/Terry Austin run in Detective Comics is one of the most memorable eras of the Dark Knight's adventures. Now available in a single volume, Batman: Strange Apparitions featuring an introduction by Englehart and a new cover by Marshall Rogers and Terry Austin. Reprinting Detective Comics #469-476, #478, and #479 (which also includes work by writer Len Wein and artist Walter Simonson), these stories chroniclize Batman's struggles with a corrupt city government headed by "Boss" Rupert Thorne along with battling classic villians such as Hugo Strange, the Penguin, Deadshot, Clayface, Dr Phosphorus, and the Joker. This classic run was the blueprint for the first Tim Burton Batman movie and Batman: The Animated Series.Originally published in single magazine form as DETECTIVE COMICS #469-479.
