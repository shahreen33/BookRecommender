Starting over isn’t something anyone wants to do in their forties, unfortunately, that is where I find myself. I wanted to believe that love lasts a lifetime, I wanted to believe that no matter how bad things got there was always love to hold us together. I was as it turns out, wrong. My marriage became a statistic, but at least I got the house. It is probably the only thing keeping me sane. Heartbroken and alone with the help of my friends I hope to be able to find happiness again. The dating world is not what it used to be, would I find happiness, more sorrow or learn to live without love. My biggest fear isn’t that I won’t find love again, it is that I will find love again; the kind of love that can last a lifetime. My fear is that I will be too afraid to follow my heart. For now, all I can do is keep trying and remind myself that when I find it I need to.Seize the Love.
