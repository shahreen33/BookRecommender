Over 100 pages of movie ideas TOO AWESOME for Hollywood. ...because they’re jokes. In this book you’ll find comics, prose, scripts, and even reviews of the best movies that we’d never seriously want see to get made. Unless you’ve got big studio money to throw around. We’re overflowing with artistic integrity but we’ve also got mortgages. We accept wire transfers, most major credit cards, and personal checks.
