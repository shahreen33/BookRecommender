Klondaeg is the self-declared world’s greatest monster hunter. Armed with a bickering battle-axe with a split personality, he rampages through the countryside in a tireless quest to avenge his parents and slay every monster that crosses his path, is visible from his path, or even leers in the general direction of his path. Join Klondaeg on five madcap adventures, full of werewolf garden gnomes, geriatric heroes, steam-powered spaceships, conveniently timed flashbacks, and battles with cave rats and demons alike. If you have a monster problem, Klondaeg’s your Dwarf.
