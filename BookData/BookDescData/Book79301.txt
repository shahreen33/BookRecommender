Patrick Lindsay’s Finding Beauty is a spiritual wake-up call. When humanity loses its way, when negative forces stir up hatred and ugliness, beauty will be our guide. Beauty will lift us up and set us on the right path again. Beauty provides a pathway to illustrate complex ideas, to reshape thoughts, to reimagine problems and to find solutions. It encourages calmness and reflection and lifts our spirits. It allows us to look on the bright side, to look at life and our future with optimism and hope. Each page of Patrick Lindsay’s Finding Beauty reminds us that we have the power to take control of our lives, to gather mindful moments, to listen to our heart’s whispers and to bestow kindness freely. Rediscover the joy of seeing beauty, and you will grasp the profound meaning of our existence. And that really will save the world.
