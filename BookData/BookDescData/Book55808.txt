Whenever I’m within ten feet of Eve Cupid, all I can do is grunt and try to hide my erection. It’s not just the effect she has on my body. It’s the effect she’s having on my heart…and my soul.  It’s her smile. It’s the way her fingers dance on the piano keys. When she sings, the sound of her voice makes things happen in my chest I didn’t know were possible.  It’s Christmas, and all I can think of is how to get her under my tree. As luck would have it, she needs a Christmas tree and my family happens to own a Christmas tree farm.  When my holiday wish finally comes true, it’s gone as quickly as it came, because neither of us knows how to repair the sins of the past.  Author’s Note: Enjoy this holiday wonder with a grunty alpha, a kind-hearted girl trying to rebuild her life, and a whole lot of yummy sexy times under the twinkling Christmas lights. Always safe, no cheating, a little angst, and for sure a happily ever after for all.
