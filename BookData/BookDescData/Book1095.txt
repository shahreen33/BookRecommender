Alternate cover edition.This story is told mostly from the perspective of Peter, a magically talented young slave boy. Peter is of typical Contractian appearance, so has blue eyes, short blonde hair and pale skin. He is generally very mature for a twelve year old, often displaying wisdom far beyond his years, but in some ways and situations he is still just an innocent child. For now... Is his wisdom though just because of the incredibly hard life he has lived through, or is there another reason waiting to be revealed? Peter starts this story in the Arena of Contractia where he must fight as a gladiator, but he will soon attend one of Contractia's great academies of magic. This is a school where poor grades mean execution! Contractia is a land ruled by the immortal and almighty queen, who has ruled for thousands of years. It is a land where most men are slaves and children are considered the property of their mothers. But change is coming. What does the future hold for Peter and the ancient land of Contractia? This is a series which will see war waged between all manner of races, including humans, elves, dwarves, angels, demons and even the gods themselves. Will you join Peter on his adventures as he faces all manner of dangerous monsters and animals? Whether it is man eating bugs, fire breathing bats or devious goblins, innocent lives will be lost if they are not dealt with. That's before Peter even gets involved in the war! Please note that this series is unsuitable for young children mostly due to violent content and occasional (non explicit) references to matters of a romantic nature. There are also very rare generally innocent, but compromising situations.
