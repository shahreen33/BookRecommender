I was a Courtesan.It was in an art gallery where I first met the man who would steal me away.Ours was not a healthy relationship.People would claim to be a Courtesan makes me weak.I would tell them that to be Aiden's Courtesan, you must be strong.That is what it means to live my life.That is what it means to submit fully.That is what it means to be a Courtesan.Aiden believed I wasn't strong enough to overpower him.He believed I wasn't smart enough to play his game.It's finally my turn to take control.It's my change to prove to Aiden that all his beliefs are......WRONG.
