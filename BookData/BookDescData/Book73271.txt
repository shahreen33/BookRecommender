Jeanne Mayo, with over 20 years in youth ministry, shares powerful illustrations and scriptural teaching to teens on poignant topics including sex before marriage, homosexuality, dating, falling in love, and friendship. Each reading starts with a startling quote followed by minute segments that peak into teen's conversations and secret rendezvous. Jeanne's conversational but direct style keeps readers on their toes and paints detailed word pictures that teens will not forget easily. Not only will they learn powerful scriptural truths, but they will enjoy reading every single entry and be ready to share with their friends. Uncensored will inspire teens to look at their day to day situations in a new light and be ready when life throws them a difficult choice. This material is also ideal for small group Bible studies and youth groups! Uncensored deals with the hot topics of sex and dating for Christian teens but with cultured taste. Other books in this genre', including The Dirt on Sex by Justin Lookadoo or Technical Virgin: How Far is Too Far by Haley Dimarco, may push the buttons on evangelical beliefs and expose teen to thoughts Christian parents may be uncomfortable with. Uncensored deals with the same issues but stays true to the evangelical belief system and handles the topics regarding sex in a way parents can feel good about.
