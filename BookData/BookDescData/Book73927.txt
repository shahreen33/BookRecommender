A revolutionary and controversial work, this book is a classic of political theory and a key source of democratic ideals. Rousseau's concepts of "the general will" as a way for individuals' self-interest to unite for a common good, and the individual's submission to government by contract, stand at the heart of democracy. A must-read book for all who care about the foundations of liberty. Newly designed and typeset in a modern 5.5-by-8.5-inch format by Waking Lion Press.
