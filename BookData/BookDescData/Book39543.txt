It’s really hard to save a guy’s life when he keeps running from you... You might be asking yourself why I’m waving an inflatable penis in the air and screaming at the top of my lungs.

It was a thankless job until the moment that my panties dropped and his delicious smirk found his way in between my thighs. Hello, toe-curling ecstasy. Goodbye, professional boundaries. And suddenly, there’s a new danger to avoid: the falling of my heart.
