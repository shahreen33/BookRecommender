Stephen King's first novel, Carrie, was published in 1974. America was flooded with television images from the Vietnam war and the protests against it. Hearts in Atlantis is composed of five interconnected narratives, set in the years 1960-1999. Each story is rooted in the sixties. Each is haunted by the Vietnam War. Full of danger, suspense, and heart, this book will take some to a place they've never been, and others to a place they've never completely left.
