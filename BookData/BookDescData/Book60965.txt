She should never have stayed.  I should never have kept her.  Bad guys like me? We crave violence, danger, and someone warm in our beds.   Someone like her? She is beautiful and surprisingly strong.   But saving her was a mistake for the both of us. It would have been easier if I'd let my MC kill her when they were getting revenge on her uncle.   Now it's too late.   I don't want sympathy or forgiveness.   I just want her.   Blow Out, a motorcycle romance set in the Steel Veins Motorcycle Club, is filled with heat, nail-biting violence, and heart-racing adventure. Blow Out has been reedited, packaged, and is complete with NEW material.
