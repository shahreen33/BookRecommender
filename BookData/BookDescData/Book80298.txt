  Welcome to the Nightworld Academy, attended by vampires, shifters, and witches. A place filled with harmony and mutual respect between the supernatural races. Sometimes. 
  

  
    I'm told my curse is a gift. A valuable one that could cost me my life.
  
  
My lifelong visions of the future are weird, but my new academy is weirder. All lessons take place in the evening, and the majority of students are on an advanced program where they take extra classes late into the night.My parents enrolled me here after I was expelled from school for one misdemeanour too many. I expected to meet other troubled teens, but the pupils here are predictable for an English boarding school. There's Ash, the rugby team captain and the academy’s most popular guy. Then there’s Andrei, the moody guy with a bad attitude who takes pleasure in annoying me. And Jamie who’s studious and friendly but intense.I thought I had the academy figured out: the mean girl, the quirky friend, the nerd, the emo, and the jock. But on the evening I swear allegiance to my new school house things spin out of control. I realise I’m dealing with more.Much more.
  One of us will die, and I know who.
