From the James Tripee Award Winning author, Fumi Yoshinaga, comes a casual romance between two 40-year-old men and the many meals they share together.Gilbert invites himself over for a hot-pot made with common-folk ingredients, and Shiro wonders if things will be weird with Kohinata. Kenji tries to put off entering his 50’s for as long as possible, until Shiro reframes the idea of birthday celebrations, just as an old college classmate of Shiro’s passes away. Changes are afoot at both Kenji’s salon and Shiro’s law firm… but the one constant is that there is always good food and great company to be enjoyed.
