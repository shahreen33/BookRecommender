Pat McGrath's historical fiction "And The Darkness Fell," tells the nearly forgotten story of Hypatia of Alexandria, the last of the great pagan intellectuals/teachers in the last years of the Roman Empire. Basing her novel in factual dates, events and characters, McGrath uses fiction to give her heroine a real life, a love affair with the historic Roman Prefect, Orestes, and an enemy in the real life, Cyril, the Bishop of Alexandria. Retired now, but politically active for many years, McGrath felt called to remind the world of this great woman, a force to be reckoned with in her own time. It is said that 'with her death, the dark ages began.'
