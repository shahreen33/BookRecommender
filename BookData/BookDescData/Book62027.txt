To have chosen so unlikely a title as AHA! for an almost epic poem about mysticism must require a strangely constituted mix. And this, of course, is supremely applicable to Aleister Crowley, an English poet born in Leamington in the year 1875.As a result of many years of concentrated study of comparative religions, mythology, mysticism of every variety and magical practices picked up in remote parts of the world, his mind had developed into a highly intricate mnemonic apparatus. One word or phrase would immediately serve as a trigger to set into operation a long chain of associations trailing obscurely into a lifelong collection of fascinating ideas. For the most part they would stagger any newcomer to his innumerable writings.
