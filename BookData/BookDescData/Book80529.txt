In this fascinating account of the best-attested cases of haunting - Hampton Court, the demon drummer of Bedworth, the Wesley ghost, Glamis, Borley Rectory and many others - Britain's foremost ghost-hunter has brought to light a wealth of valuable new evidence. Using the results of his many years of research and personal investigation into ghosts and hauntings, and providing detailed plans and original photographs, Peter Underwood puts forward some exciting and startling theories which will radically change our ideas about these hauntings.Many hauntings can be explained without resorting to the supernatural or the paranormal. The author shows indisputable evidence of 'colouring' in the story of the seventeenth-century drummer of Bedworth, for instance, while the famous visions of Versailles are probed carefully in the light of a startling recent discovery which may be the key to the mystery. Other strange happenings may be attributed to psychosomatic disorders or disturbed personalities, as in the classic Amherst case in Nova Scotia, with its frightening wall-writing threats and curious body-swelling, or the poltergeist-like disturbances at Epworth Parsonage.But there are also some cases of haunting which transcend all known laws, with evidence that tragic and violent happenings, such as those at Hampton Court and Glamis, can leave behind 'something' that is perceived through one of the five senses by certain people days, years, even centuries later. In the best true ghost stories, fact is indeed stranger than fiction.Illustrated with 17 lines drawings and 16 pages of plates
