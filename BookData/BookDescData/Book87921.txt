She has been living with it for far too long, and it is all because of her father.  Reese “Joker” Whitman has put his old life behind him. He is now just Joker, part of The Soldiers of Wrath, an outlaw MC that rules his town.

Amy might be considered family, but she isn’t blood, and he wants her more than he’s ever wanted anyone in his life. However, he has to tread lightly, because she’s been hurt, and she may never be able to give herself fully to him.  When she finally sees Joker for who he is, it isn’t fear or pain that consumes her; it is hope and desire. But can she give herself to the biker when she sees herself as too damaged be loved?
