They meet after visiting a message board on-line. One is a trendy East Coaster, the other a down-to-earth Midwesterner. And while they are seemingly very different, there are many more ways in which they are alike, and they bond fiercely while sharing their most heartfelt thoughts about their health, children, careers, and marriages. This touching story of two strangers becoming soul-mates feels like a few hours spent with a best friend over coffee -- warm, comforting, and wonderfully satisfying.
