When Jack offers to take him to a tailor, Channon thinks he knows what Jack wants. But Jack's perversions run deeper than Channon had expected, and all he can be sure of is that pleasing Jack is what he wants, and he'll do anything to keep this whatever-it-is they have alive. Meanwhile, Jack has some new things he wants Channon to enjoy, and does his best to ensure that Channon will come back, begging for more.
