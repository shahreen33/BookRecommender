After months of slogging through murky meltwaters of the Rockies, and even murkier small-town politics, Colorado cop David Wolf is enjoying a well-deserved camping trip with his son. But after an eerie encounter on the trail, Wolf suspects their father-son outing has taken a turn for the worse. Unfortunately, he's dead right. When news of Wolf and his son's disturbing episode travels through the valleys, local FBI agents want "in" on Wolf's investigation, hoping to halt murder and corruption originating 7,000 miles away in Afghanistan. Wolf ignores the FBI's order to stand down, even if the case involves a matter of national security. Not when his son's safety is at stake. In this stomach-dropping third installment of the David Wolf series, Wolf partners with a beautiful FBI agent —whether she likes it or not—to bust an inter-continental conspiracy threatening anyone who has the bad luck to stumble on it.
