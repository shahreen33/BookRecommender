Scarlett Fisher turns 15 on the day that a fast-moving, deadly plague begins ravaging Los Angeles. Before long, Scarlett finds herself alone, seemingly the only person in LA who's immune, and for all she knows, she's the last person left alive in the world. Eventually, she does come into contact with others, but she also finds out that just because someone is immune to the plague, it doesn't mean they're going to be nice to her. The book is finished except for final proofreading, which I'm working on now while my cover artist moves toward finishing his part of the project. It runs about 79,000 words.
