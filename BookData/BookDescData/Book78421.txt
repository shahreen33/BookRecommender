Bailey  Being the single mom of a beautiful five-year-old was hard. I’d struggled since the day I gave birth to my daughter when I was eighteen. So when we got the opportunity of a lifetime—to start over somewhere new—it was a no-brainer. We had to go. What I never expected was to find him.  With one look, our whole world changed. Travis became everything to us. For once, we were carefree and happy. We had everything we’d always dreamed of.  Then things started happening...  Travis  Bailey came out of nowhere and changed my life completely. I’d never known what living was until her eyes connected with mine and my world imploded. My days now revolved around her and the beautiful little girl I loved as my own.  Bailey and her daughter were now my family, and I vowed to protect them at all costs.  What I never expected was for someone to want to hurt Bailey.  If he ever tries to breathe the same air as Bailey and Gabby again—that’ll be the last thing he’ll ever try to do. By the time it’s over, he’ll consider Hell a welcome treat.
