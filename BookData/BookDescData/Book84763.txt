Horses aren't cheap, and competing event horses is a tough way to make a living. Jules Thornton is settled at Briar Hill Farm with fellow trainer Pete Morrison, eyes focused on a successful future in eventing, but money is tight and opportunities are dwindling.  When a potential sponsor offers Pete a stellar deal, Jules is ready for her big break -- but it's not what she was hoping for. She'll have to make hard choices if she wants a future in eventing -- and with Pete.  There are fireworks on the horizon as Jules heads south to Florida's vacation-land to meet her new trainer, Grace Carter. The star of "Show Barn Blues" is back to put Jules through her paces and bring her attitude down a notch or two. Can Jules stick out a summer of dressage lessons and high-dollar clients?
