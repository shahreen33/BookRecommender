Once the line is crossed, every penalty is major.Dalek "Taz" Tazandlakova is the epitome of a hockey player—tall, broad, and powerful. As a forward for the Lafayette Ice Water Moccasins, he's also the physical embodiment of domination and intimidation. He's everything Liam Jolivet isn't.Liam possesses an inner strength and confidence Taz has never mastered. On the surface, Liam appears to be a perfect match for Taz. The problem is, Liam is dating Taz’s roommate. It’s not the only problem, either. Taz is a “playa” and has commitment issues—along with a pain-in-the-ass coach who's threatening to ruin his career, and a second roommate who wants to dictate his social life for his own personal gain. Nevertheless, Taz wants Liam, and Liam appears to want to reciprocate. Do they dare cross the line?
