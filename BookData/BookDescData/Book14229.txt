One passion could unite them.One enemy could destroy them.Rain, the proud and haunted Fey King, risked everything to follow his heart and his destiny to Ellysetta—his truemate, his love, the woodcarver's daughter who possessed miraculous gifts she did not understand. He defied the nobles of Celieria to claim her, battled demons and Elden mages to wed her. And now he must protect her—and his imperiled kingdom—with magic, steel, and scorching flame. For his soul-kin, the magical tairen, are dying, and only the Fey King's bride can save them . . . if Rain can help his beloved embrace the magic within her and forge the unbreakable bond of passion and power necessary to save her soul.
