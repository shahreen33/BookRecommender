In England, his brother John, desperate for the crown, plots with the King of France to make sure Richard never leaves his prison alive. But the Queen has already begun to meet the ransom demands. It is only a matter of time before the Emperor turns over his royal prisoner....And then one of the ransom payments vanishes in the fastness of Wales, itself wracked by rebellion and intrigue. Into this maelstrom, Eleanor sends her trusted man, Justin de Quincy. Murder soon follows.
