Best friends Lee Mitchell and Roman Carmichael have been inseparable since childhood, and at fifteen, realize they mean so much more to each other. But not everyone in their small, upstate New York town is happy about their fledgling romance, and during a spring canoe trip, Roman goes missing during a supposed accident Lee can’t remember. Heartbroken by the loss, Lee spends the next ten years rooted in place, building a life around the river that took his heart away, and obstinately searching for any sign of his lost love.    During a winter snowstorm, Lee sees a stranger on the side of the road in board shorts and a t-shirt, and he risks bringing the man home. But beneath the shaggy hair and beard is Roman. His Roman. Ten years older, but alive and well, and in Lee’s house. Roman’s reappearance, however, has a time limit, and as Lee works to recover all the memories he lost, one thing becomes frighteningly clear: as scary as the supernatural might be, sometimes human beings are the most horrifying villains of all.
