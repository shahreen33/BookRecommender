Everything you need to know about self-care; what it is, why it’s important, why it’s such a struggle and how to integrate it into day-to-day life.There’s a damaging misconception in society that putting ourselves first is an act of selfishness. But self-care is not just a millennial buzzword. Without the restorative power of self-care, how will we ever escape the vicious circle where we’re sick and fed-up of feeling sick and fed-up? Self-care is a tool, accessible to us all, which helps us to take responsibility for our own happiness – our physical, emotional, psychological and social needs. Jayne Hardy, founder and CEO of The Blurt Foundation, argues that it is the best preventative measure available to us to combat overwhelmedness, stress and ill health, in our hectic, modern world.The Self-Care Project is for those who have been feeling off-kilter for a while but have not been able to put the finger on the ‘why’. It is a no-nonsense, practical journey to help you do just that. It’ll walk you through the case for self-care (why it’s so darn important), why it isn’t selfish at all, help you explore what self-care means for you, what your obstacles might be and provide advice on how to chisel out daily space for self-care in a practical, achievable and realistic way.
