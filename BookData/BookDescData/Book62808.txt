"My life is in the Wolf's hands."He is the Wolf. I am his Red. The game has begun and he wants me dead. But who is the Wolf? And why has he chosen me?He whistles a tune that's haunting. He glares at me through eyes that are vacant. I feel his heart beating, yet I know he has no soul. He moves like the wind...I can't hear his footsteps. I want this to end. He's playing with my mind. He branded me with ink. He wants to destroy me."I, Reid, take thee, Morgan, to be my wife. To have and to hold, for better, for worse, in sickness and in health, till death do us part..."I have a reason to keep running. There's no time to blink. Don't look back. Don't make a sound. I know he's behind me
