Biloxi, Mississippi, 1955. When a friend of seventeen-year-old June Juanico invited her along to a concert by a popular young singer, she hesitated, but finally went. The singer, of course, was Elvis Presley, and when his eye caught June's, they both got all shook up. So began the most significant of his early relationships - a summer idyll of romance and playful fun that was to be a last stop of innocence on the path to self-destruction. In this clear-eyed, loving, and tender memoir, June gives us Elvis on the verge of mega-stardom, still a country kid with polite manners, a voice that melted hearts, and more sex appeal than anyone could handle. June describes her closeness to Elvis's mother, Gladys, who had hoped June and Elvis would marry, and her rivalry with Colonel Parker, Elvis's handler, who believed marriage would end his protege's career. And then there were the thousands of screaming fans, doing anything they could to get a piece of the King. In the end the self-possessed June knew that however much Elvis loved her, he was on a track no one could stop and would never be in control of his life; she made up her mind to move on and not look back. Not until now. Featuring twenty-three previously unpublished photographs of Elvis and an introduction by Elvis biographer Peter Guralnick, this fresh and completely disarming memoir gives us an American icon as few would know him, in a time and place bathed in the light of remembered love.
