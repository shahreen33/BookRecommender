Pull up your satire shorts, grab a bottle of your favourite sauce and take a plunge into the nihilistic world of G.C. McKay. You'll feel your fingers get grubbier with each flick of the page inside an anthology of deviant, yet at times touching and poignant short stories and novelettes.Opening things up with 'Something Borrowed, Something Blue', a depressed, self-confessed drunk and sex-addicted late-teen discovers the joys of free cocaine and the sexual prowess of a married woman old enough to be his mother. Self-destruction never felt so good. A sin-a-rama that would make even Oedipus blush.Self-destruction isn't supposed to feel this good, is it?A few drinks down the road we take a turn into 'A Lesson Worth Unlearning', where a father and son bond over their mutual appreciation for teachers, pornography and the best places to masturbate during a mysterious trip out of town. But where on earth is Daddy taking his son? In 'Mother Nature Sends Her Love' and 'SQUIRM', a group of amoral, reckless teens run amok and fuck shit up just because they can inside a series of distasteful pranks and crude group games, inspired by the sexual frustration they're all governed by, yet totally unaware of. The perfect toilet reads.And closing the collection off with a descent into the more horrific we come to 'The Last Laugh', where a sleep-deprived stand-up comedian attempts to shake off the aftermath of a destructive relationship... only to be immediately confronted by it again as he makes his long-awaited return to the stage. Cue tension, questionable narration and whole barrel of laughs, but at whose expense?In between there's runaway dogs, sexy inanimate objects and barely legal prostitution. What more could you ask for?Darkly humorous, satirical and unusually heart-rendering, these dank and disturbing short stories will soon become what you'll expect from an author who cannot seem to stop himself trailing down the path marked debauched.
