Doctors tell Liam not to expect a recovery, but he believes that love can accomplish what medical science cannot.

But then he discovers evidence of his wife’s secret past: a hidden first marriage to movie star Julian True.   Desperate to bring Mikaela back at any cost, Liam knows that he must turn to Julian for help.
