A new MMORPG takes the School of Necessary Magic by storm. Everyone is addicted.  Except Raine. Between school, social life, and chasing her dream, she doesn’t have time for distractions.  She’s not getting enough sleep. No one is, and it’s taking its toll on both the student body and the teachers.  When some of her classmates suddenly become comatose, Raine suspects there’s more at play with the hot new trend.  It’s time to hop in game, complete a quest, and defeat the boss before it’s GAME OVER.  Join Raine and her friends as they battle monsters and complete puzzles to save their classmates.  OATH OF THE WITCH continues the epic adventures of the School of Necessary Magic series. Get your copy today!
