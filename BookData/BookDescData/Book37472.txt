Taking National Poetry Month’s poem-a-day challenge one step further, for her fourth collection, Trista Mateer has not only compiled a chapbook of her 2016 ‘30 for 30’ poems, but she has also chosen to include nearly everything else written in the month of April. This comes in the form of handwritten notes and poetry fragments, iPhone note poetry, tweets, Craigslist ads, and more. This mix of poetry and prose spans a single month and covers topics such as heartbreak, gender, sexuality, and forgiveness.
