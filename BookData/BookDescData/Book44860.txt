EDGE  I’ve decided there’s no virtue in patience. It’s f*cking torture. And that goes for DM Christmas songs too.  MATHIAS  Good girl. Be afraid of me. It will make my job easier. Until she's caught between a desk and a Hell's bastard.   ROSE  I am a shell to be f*cked with. But I am a survivor. I have my own Sasha Fierce. Just give me a reason.   CEZAR  You haven’t seen my bad side yet. It will leave you speechless.   WHISPER  Opportunity may knock only once, but temptation leans on the doorbell.  Survival has become a waiting game, choreographed by a schedule to keep me complacent. Mathias and Rose are my constants. My frenemies. What happens when Cezar turns the tables?  Just remember to breathe.   Contains adult situations which may offend and graphic violence, but it is one hell of a fictional ride. Strap yourself in. For mature aged readers 18 +.
