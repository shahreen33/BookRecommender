Like the universe itself, the world of relationships can be mysterious, terrifying, beautiful, and ever-expansive. Within the cocoon of a marriage, the bond between two people can become predatory, often selfish. Emotions become conniving, thoughts turn deadly. And if that swirling organism of love and anguish blurs into the dark realm of the supernatural, anything can happen…“Philip Fracassi’s Mother manages to pay homage to classic turn of the 20th Century horror stories while simultaneously fitting right in with the modern weird/occult tale. A promising debut!” – Paul Tremblay, author of A Head Full of Ghosts“Mother occupies a modern Gothic niche, yet unfolds in a disorienting and timeless fashion. A touch of giallo and a whole dose of nastiness.” – Laird Barron, author of X's For Eyes and The Beautiful Thing That Awaits Us All“If Mr. Fracassi writes another nine of these, I’m in the queue for his first collection!” – Adam Nevill, author of Lost Girl “In his novelette Mother, Fracassi leads you into a living room that seems so familiar, so normal, so lovely. On closer inspection, the expensive curtains are rotting, the doilies are moth eaten, and there is a strange, dark stain on the carpet… Mother is a story of domestic collapse at the fringe of the known world that recalls the thematic brutality of Nathan Ballingrud and Karl Edward Wagner. This one will sneak up on you.” – T.E. Grau, author of The Nameless Dark
