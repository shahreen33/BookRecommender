  Execute hard burn.
  Every good smuggler in the 2990s keeps an emergency flight plan in their back pocket. They call it a Drunkard's Walk, a seemingly random flight path that turns their ship into a pinball when everything goes to hell.  Captain Andy Sykes is about to run: from Mars, Ceres, the Jovian Combine, Saturn's moon Kalyke, Titania, and ultimately Proteus, an icy moon of Neptune.  He's been implanted with a sentient AI named Lyssa, only now waking to her massive power. Every other Human-AI hybrid has ended in insanity or death.  Lyssa's creator, Heartbridge Corporation, knows she's on the run, knows Andy Sykes is guiding her path, knows he has everything to lose. They will stop at nothing to regain Lyssa and the powerful weapon she controls.  Behind Lyssa's Run is a conspiracy spanning all of Sol. Sentient AI are waking to the truth about their lives. Corporations are moving to maintain control over both humanity and AI.  Battle lines are being drawn in the first skirmishes of the Aeon 14 Sentience Wars that will burn Sol for three hundred years. Andy and Lyssa will need to work together so Heartbridge can't destroy them both.
