What would you sacrifice to save your family’s legacy?  Meet Hunter Wilder, a man that is terrified of happily ever after.  Hunter is used to dominating, taking control of situations and bending them to his will. He may live in a New York castle, but he’s no prince. Cursed by loss, Hunter is a closed book with an emptiness that he can’t escape.  Until he meets her.  Gabriella Darien may be gorgeous and driven, but her Cinderella story is more than it appears. The death of her father left her with a wicked stepmother intent on sabotaging the business her parents worked so hard to create.  One enchanted night of all-consuming and absolute pleasure brings two broken souls together. With a new version of their future finally in sight, a promise kept might cost them everything.  Will this Cinderella find her prince, or will they watch their happily ever after disappear at the stroke of midnight?  ABSOLUTE PLEASURE is a modern, sinfully seductive take on Cinderella. It is a stand-alone, second-chance fairy-tale romance. No cheating. No cliffhangers.
