"There are magical places that exist in this world, Jessica, places the Master Architect created to balance good and evil. The time will come when you will leave this house and enter into another life that awaits you. A life you deserve with a greater purpose. You don't know how special you really are." For years, Jessica has fought for her father's life by agreeing to every little whim her twisted mother's mind could conjured. Close to her twentieth birthday, her scheming mother forces an engagement. If Jess refuses, she'll shut off the machines keeping her father alive. Having no choice, she agrees, but hours later finds her father already dead. She knows then she has to escape her prison, or she'll end up just like her father.
