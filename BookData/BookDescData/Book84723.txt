Emily has won at her first show in Ireland. She has proved that she can compete and win in any country on any horse and she feels like she is sitting on top of the world. She has forgotten all about the drama back home, which was the reason she left in the first place.  But Ireland hasn’t been all drama free. There is a girl who could pass as Jess’s twin, if she didn’t already have one, an Irish girl who holds a claim to Patrick, a claim that Emily doesn’t even want. She is not there to fall in love. At least not with the two-legged variety anyway. Instead a horse has stolen her heart, one who unfortunately Siobhan’s father holds a half share in.  And now that the show is over, everyone is gearing up for the big drag hunt, a huge local deal. Emily will ride Victor and tackle some of the toughest terrain she has ever encountered. She may have dabbled in cross country but hunting in Ireland is an entirely different ball game, one where people fall off and horses gallop wild. To prove she is not a timid American rider, Emily will give Victor the ride of his life in hopes of somehow winning the heart of Patrick’s mother, who owns the other share in the horse and just maybe, convince her to send the horse back home with Emily to Florida.
