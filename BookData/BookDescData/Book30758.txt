The planet Jupiter has 79 known moons. 79 moons... that’s complete chaos within an atmosphere. But I have moons too. Moons that cause so much more than chaos. My moons each have a different name. Sadness, anger, grief, addiction, and each one is in a constant orbit around me. You see, my moons didn’t show up until I was 18. Before them, I was happy. I had great friends, a loving father and a boy with the most perfect green eyes who loved me. I couldn’t have asked for anything more, but then tragedy struck and my life started to spiral. I was thrown into a new world of drugs, sex, and alcohol, not caring about anyone who tried to save me. I took on a new persona, I abandoned everyone who loved me, I pushed until I couldn’t push anymore. My name is Jupiter. Let me tell you about my moons.WARNING: Reader discretion is advised.
