Train for strength in body and soul! Catholic psychologist and veteran bodybuilder Kevin Vost shows that God's command to "be perfect" applies not only to our moral life, but also to our bodies. Dr. Vost explains the basic principles of strength and endurance training and then helps you assemble an effective, personalized workout program that can be performed in as little as twenty minutes per week, leaving you plenty of time (and energy) to be an active Christian parent, spouse, and disciple.
