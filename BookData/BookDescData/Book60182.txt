A long weekend in the Poconos is cut short when FBI agents Sherlock and Savich are helicoptered back to Washington, D.C., to lead the investigation into the brutal murder of a Supreme Court Justice.Savich allows Callie Markham, an investigative reporter for The Washington Post, to partner with local Metro Police liaison Ben Raven since she's got the inside track â€“ she's the stepdaughter of the murdered Justice. Is the murder a terrorist act? Or is it something more personal? Within twenty-four hours there's another murder with the same M.O.Savich and Sherlock are up against it this time, following leads that seem impossible to connect to the madness. But are they?
