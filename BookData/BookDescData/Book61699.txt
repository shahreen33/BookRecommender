Her love could set me free from the shadows... Seeing CoCo Becket for the first time, made my heart start beating again. It changed everything.Before her I had no purpose, no reason to live. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever met, I couldn't help but fantasize about kissing her plump lips or having those sky blue eyes staring back at mine, seeing beyond what I truly was. Broken and ashamed. My desire for her ran deep, deeper than I expected it too. She was a Goddess and I was simply caught up in her glow, I couldn't say no. Not to her kindness, and not to my need to be near her. CoCo was the good in life where I was the bad. She became the sun to my never ending darkness. When a mysterious situation brings us together, I discover that I'll do anything to keep her safe. Even if it means risking my own life, to save hers. Because before her, love was just a word I'd heard in passingâ€¦and now I'll destroy anyone that tries to take her, or that love away from me.
