But all is not entirely lost: the Council’s seer, The Confessor, is dead, killed by her twin’s sacrifice.

As the country moves closer to all-out civil war, Cass will learn that to change the future she will need to uncover the past. But nothing can prepare her for what she discovers: a deeply buried secret that raises the stakes higher than ever before.
