A CULT. A WARPED LEADER. THE PROMISE IS TOO MUCH…  DI Tracy Collier is about to find out that some people are as damaged as she is. With someone going around killing, she struggles to find the link, the one clue that will break the case wide open and send her straight to the evil person who has led her on a merry dance.  Crossword clues left at the scenes are confusing. Are they a smoke screen? Then the real reason behind them becomes clear, and Tracy is faced with one of the most hideous criminal masterminds she has ever dealt with to date.  ‘The Lamp’ has formed a cult and is getting ‘the tribe’ to do the dirty work for them with a promise that is so ludicrous it should be laughable. But the tribe believe it—or do they? Regardless, for their own twisted reasons, they agree to the murder plan, but only one of the players in this wicked scenario will actually see all the light.
