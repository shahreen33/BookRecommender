While Jessica endured the torment of bullying and the painful isolation of depression, she used self-harm as a form of control in her very out-of-control world. But that wasn’t her only form of release. Her journal was another form of escape, the one place she could always be herself.  While reading Jessica’s poetry you can follow her journey down the path of pain, sadness, love, loss, THERAPY, and, ultimately, healing.  *This is a book of poetry, not a novel, and includes THERAPY Extras. Readers of the novel THERAPY are sure to love this companion. *BONUS MATERIAL INCLUDES: A collection of favorite THERAPY quotes and an excerpt from THERAPY Ever After, the continuation of Jessica's story that will release later in 2014.
