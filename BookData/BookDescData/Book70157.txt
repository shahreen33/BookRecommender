From the dust jacket: "October 28, 1988 was War Day. It lasted 36 minutes. Seven million Americans died in the immediate blast. Millions more died from radiation, famine and disease over the next five years." The story is told from the perspective of two survivors who cross the continent to see what the new America is really like five years after War Day.
