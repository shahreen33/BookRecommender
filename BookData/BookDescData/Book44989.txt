A whip-smart, heart-wrenching debut YA novel about first love, first loss, and filmmaking that will delight fans of Jandy Nelson and Jennifer Niven  In the movie version of Amelia s life, the roles have always been clear. Her older brother, Toby: definitely the Star. As popular with the stoners as he is with the cheerleaders, Toby is someone you d pay ten bucks to watch sweep Battle of the Bands and build a beach party in the bathroom. As for Amelia? She s Toby Anderson s Younger Sister. She s perfectly happy to watch Toby s hijinks from the sidelines, when she s not engrossed in one of her elaborately themed Netflix movie marathons.  But recently Toby s been acting in a very non-movie-version way. He s stopped hanging out with his horde of friends and started obsessively journaling and disappearing for days at a time. Amelia doesn t know what s happened to her awesome older brother, or who this strange actor is that s taken his place. And there s someone else pulling at her attention: a smart, cute new boyfriend who wants to know the real Amelia not Toby s Sidekick. Amelia feels adrift without her star, but to best help Toby and herself it might be time to cast a new role: Amelia Anderson, leading lady."
