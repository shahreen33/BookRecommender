Imagine a place where five waterfalls spill over billion-year-old rock, all within a mile of one another, where both incredible vistas of the world’s largest freshwater lake and paths past an array of sweet-scented wildflowers await, where you can traipse through historic handcrafted stone buildings or alongside a creek meandering about an evergreen forest. The place is real: It’s called Gooseberry Falls State Park, which many consider the crown jewel of Minnesota’s multitude of natural gems.  With this book, you can: • Plan a day of fun family-friendly activities • Learn the best places to see the park's waterfalls • Discover the Lake Superior shoreline • Find directions, picnic areas, parking lots and more!
