She’s the only sister in a family of alpha males. Loved, treasured, and sheltered by her brothers, Kat McClain is working to heal the pain of a failed marriage to a man she loved from her teenage years and move on with her life, but she’s a woman, she has needs, and she is understandably lonely.  Tommy Kirby has protected her brother since he was barely a man and has been a silent staple in the McClain family for just as long. He loves his job and his life, is loyal to his employer, but more than anything, he wants a family of his own.  Perhaps these two are exactly what the other desires.  *** This is a novella that takes place during the same time as Let Me Show You, book 3 of the McClain Brothers series. ***  Contains mature content.
