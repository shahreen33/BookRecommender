Georgina Townsend has never behaved like a "proper" lady. Her family accuses her of being impulsive, sometimes to the point of recklessness. And they must be right. Because when a band of Highland outlaws steals Georgina's late mother's music box, instead of letting the proper authorities take care of the matter, she disguises herself as a Highland lass and joins the group of outlaws to find the stolen item. She certainly doesn't plan on falling for their charming leader…Malcolm Stewart has never met a more bold and captivating woman than the mysterious lass who suddenly shows up to join his small band of outlaws. But while she fits in easily, she's more distracting than he expected. When he returned from the war to find his life destroyed, Mal decided to get revenge on the Highland landlords, whom he blames for the death of his family. Falling in love isn't part of that plan—especially not with the sister of one of the very landlords he's sworn to fight against.Each book in the Townsends series is STANDALONE:* Enchanting the Earl* The Rogue's Conquest* A Scot's Surrender* Claiming the Highlander's Heart
