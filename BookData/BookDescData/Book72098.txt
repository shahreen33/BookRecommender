While there is hardly anything that delivers like a good scary story told during the pitch of night, they don't quite compare to the stories that go straight for the jugular. What do I mean? I mean tales that deliver a powerful message, a daunting reminder by effectively reflect aspects of culture without needing to exaggerate a thing. I mean stories that showcase the struggle that the young in a war torn city go through. I mean, stories of demented little psychopaths raising Hell on school grounds, stories that seem to real to be fiction, but so extreme you wish it was. This volume of Deadman's Tome Campfire Tales includes a handful of powerful, emotionally charged, demented stories. As mentioned before, dear reader, please do not read these stories in the dark.
