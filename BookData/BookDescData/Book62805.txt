Rapture, The Immortal Chronicles #4The Final InstallmentI never wanted to lie to her, but I knew I couldn’t keep her safe if she knew. I hurt her, more than I ever wanted to and I have to live with that each day that I’m away from her. But one day she’ll know, that every day spent away from her was hell. Watching her move on. Watching her change. But it will all be worth it once she’s safe.Even if she doesn’t know it, she is my Rapture.
