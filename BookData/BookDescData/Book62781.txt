“There’s no better wolf than a dead one.”This is the end. The sound of cars makes my heart beat faster. The sight of a bitumen road gives me hope. The faces of my family waiting for me are all I can see as I battle to survive.I can’t look back. I can’t cry out.Fight, Morgan.He is the Wolf, and I’m the thirteenth woman he has called his Red. This is his last chance to scratch my name from the list of bitches who’ve wronged him.Will he claim my life?“I’m coming for you, Red. It’s time to die. – The Wolf
