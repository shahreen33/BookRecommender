  Speeding toward ecstasy with two insanely hot alpha guys and one strong woman who is struggling to keep it all together...
  CORA MILLS  For Cora Mills, keeping her family out of trouble is a full-time job. Her family is a mess and she's always been the one to bail them out. She longs for an escape. Two gorgeous men from her past offer just that.  Her high school boyfriend Jet is now the president of a motorcycle club which has been known to dabble in criminal activity. Her old friend Leo is the town sheriff. The two men are as different as night and day, but both of them make Cora burn with desire. If she can’t choose one...  JET KERR  A crime spree has the county on edge. Authorities think the local M.C. is behind it, and Jet must prove not only his own innocence, but that of his brothers in the club. But his craving for Cora is a distraction. His complicated friendship with Sheriff Leo is a problem, too. His heart races for them both. They can’t outrun desire.  LEO STONEY  Leo is certain Jet and Cora know more about the crimes than they let on, but his lust for them can’t get in the way of doing his job. Is he in bed with the enemy? If he doesn’t restore law and order, everything he stands for will be put at risk, but love threatens to conquer all.
