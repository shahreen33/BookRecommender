Nora Vaughn is living on the streets and trying to keep under the radar. Luck is on her side one day when the hot stranger she’s been watching drops his keycard and she’s able to get into a safe place. What she doesn’t expect is for him to find her naked in the shower and demanding she repay what she’s stolen.  Smith Prescott is a well-known judge who has worked his entire life to build a reputation. But one look at the young woman in front of him and he’s willing to throw it all away to have her. She’s forcing his hand and his iron will to do the things he’s sworn against. But what’s the point of having all this power if he can’t use it to have her?  Warning: This is quick and dirty and dripping with filth. If you love our books Coach, Mechanic, Thief, and Kingpin, then this one will give you all the feels you’re after. Enjoy some quality time in the judge’s chambers.
