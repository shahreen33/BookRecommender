A career ending injury forced Creed Lachlan out of the Navy SEALs. Now he works as a freelance contractor for a highly classified sub-set of Homeland Security, the Bone Frog Division. His country calls when it needs his elite skills. His current mission is to identify the production site for emerging “dirty” bombs. If that dictate wasn't enough, his team must locate the missing CIA agents who’d previously tracked the weapons, and that team's last known location was Cuba. His contact in Cuba wasn't the sixty-year-old man he'd been told to expect, but a sultry beauty hellbent on driving him insane.  Mariella Diaz’s uncle sat atop the largest black-market organization in Cuba. Outmaneuvering the corrupt communist regime to provide the people of her country with necessities was second nature. Even so, keeping the sexy American and his team out of danger would require extra diligence. In a game of cat and mouse played out in a deadly arena, Mariella faces a risk more perilous than capture, torture, and imprisonment. She risked losing her heart to Creed Lachlan.  Creed wanted Mariella. He wanted to ease the pain that peeked through her bravado, to love and protect the woman who defied and antagonized him at every turn. Creed’s only concern, could she love a SEAL, forever?
