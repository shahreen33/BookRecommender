Carl Hiaasen serves up his unique brand of swamp justice in the New York Times bestseller Skink—No Surrender.   A National Book Award Longlist Selection  When your cousin goes missing under suspicious circumstances, who do you call? There’s only one man for the job: a half-crazed, half-feral, one-eyed ex-governor named Skink. Skink joins 14-year-old Richard on a breakneck chase across Florida, undaunted by lightning storms, poisonous snakes, flying bullets, and giant gators. There are a million places cousin Malley could be, a million unpleasant fates that might have befallen her, but one thing is certain: in the Florida swamp, justice is best served wild.SUNSHINE STATE AWARD FINALIST!From the Hardcover edition.
