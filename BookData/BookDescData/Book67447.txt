Just when you think you have your life under control, life shows up to kick you right where it hurts. After dealing with the spirit who wanted to possess me, I thought things would settle down in Sleepy Hollow. Bones and Crane are trying to get along, and I’m dating both of them. I’m happy, even with Wash as my stoic, ridiculously handsome bodyguard. Yes, I’d named the Headless Horseman Washington. Sue me. But, it turns out, the spirits aren’t done with me yet, and I’m about to find out that an old soul wants me, and Wash. With my feelings for Wash only growing, and my relationships with Bones and Crane solid, the last thing I want to do is let an old witch ruin the life I’m trying to build. My name is Kat Aleson, and I’m about to show that old witch how twenty-first century bitches handle things. The Blessed Undead is the second part of a RH/why choose duology, drawing inspiration from the Legend of Sleepy Hollow.
