Want to get more out of your workout and spend less time in the gym? Many guys devote so many hours to lifting weight yet end up with so little to show for it. In many cases the problem is simple: they aren't doing exercises based on the movements their bodies were designed to do. Six basic movements - the squat, deadlift, lunge, push, pull and twist - use all of the body's major muscles. And, more important, they use those muscles in co-ordinated action, the way they were designed to work. The New Rules of Lifting, now in paperback and with more than one hundred photographs, gives you more than a year's worth of workouts based on these six basic movements. Whether you're a beginner, an experienced lifter looking for new challenges, or anything in between, you can mix and match the workouts to help you get bigger, stronger and leaner. In addition, the comprehensive nutritional information provided makes The New Rules of Lifting a complete guide to reaching all your goals. If you aren't using The New Rules of Lifting, you aren't getting the best possible results.
