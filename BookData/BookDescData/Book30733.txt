  B006LAOIWY
Inside an old German U-Boat rusting on the bottom of the Baltic lie millions in gold bars, stolen art, and a secret that could tear NATO apart. In this WW II spy versus spy action adventure thriller, the only one who knows the truth is Mike Randall, a battle-scarred American aviator who survived the bitter winter of 1945 in the battered old port city of Konigsberg. After his B-17 crashed in East Prussia, rather than internment in a German POW camp or being executed as a spy, Randall and one crew mate find a worse fate, being thrown into in a Nazi forced labor battalion clearing rubble in the frozen hell of the north Baltic shore. Also trapped in Konigsberg is Kapitan Eric Bruckner and one of Germany’s last surviving U-Boats. Bruckner has been ordered east to meet with SS Major Heinz Kruger, Martin Bormann’s sinister hatchet man, for a top secret mission. When a British bomber sends the U-573 to the bottom of the Baltic, it carries a secret that only Mike Randall knows. Seven years later, in this cold war military political thriller, when he does speak up, Randall puts a target on his own forehead, one which the Russians, the West Germans, the U-boat’s former Nazi owners, the US government, and even the Israeli Mossad quickly take aim at. In this KGB CIA spy thriller, some want the gold, some want Randall dead, and some want proof that there is a high-ranking spy inside NATO itself. What Randall wants is much simpler in this historic military political thriller novel. Caught between the Kremlin, spies, killers, and a new, deadly, 4th Reich, he wants his revenge and to satisfy some old debts with a steel-jacketed bullet. If you enjoy good action adventure thriller novels, put this new fast-moving, conspiracy mystery in your Cart. It is from the author of Burke’s Gamble, Burke’s War, The Undertaker, Winner Lose All, Thursday at Noon, and Aim True, My Brothers, with over 500 Kindle 5-Star Reviews. Enjoy!
