An extremely imaginative and profound series, THE MAXX tells the tale of a fractured woman whose repressed emotions and memories prevent her from living a normal life and the hulking purple super-hero who tries to save her. A master of denial, Julie Winters created a magical dream world where she unknowingly escapes to when reality is too much. But when the two planes of existences momentarily connected, her supernatural spirit protector merged with a homeless man and the Maxx was created. Now existing in both worlds but suffering from amnesia whenever he crosses over, the Maxx tries to battle his apparent fits of insanity as he protects Julie in both realities from the murderous sorcerer Mr. Gone and the Isz, his magical minions.
