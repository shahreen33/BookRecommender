"Promise." I lie. I could never do that to her again. I’m stronger this time.  New school. New year. It’s all too familiar for military brat, Sara Parker. After her dad gets deployed, the darkness in her mind is set free, wreaking havoc on every aspect of her life. Stuck in the bottom of a pit with no one to turn to, Sara’s world comes crashing down as everyone around her discovers her secrets, one scar at a time.
