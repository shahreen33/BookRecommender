A new era of DC Super Hero Girls begins in DC Super Hero Girls: At Metropolis High!Batgirl, Wonder Woman, Supergirl, Green Lantern, Bumblebee, and Zatanna are continually late to class because of their crime-fighting, and Principal Chapin is tired of hearing their excuses. These girls need to show more school spirit...or else they'll be suspended!Principal Chapin's demand that they each find an after-school club and stick with it for a whole week seems easy, until the girls get kicked out of the clubs they choose. Instead, they must think outside the box and step out of their comfort zones. As if having secret identities and balancing school with super-heroics didn't offer enough challenges!Amy Wolfram (Teen Titans, Teen Titans Go!) and Yancey Labat (DC Super Hero Girls) show off a new vision of the DC Super Hero Girls!
