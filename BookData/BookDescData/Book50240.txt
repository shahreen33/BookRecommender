When my feet hit the dirt at the Big Sky Dude Ranch, I have a pretty good idea what to expect. What happens next nearly shook me out of my brand-new cowboy boots. See, I’m here to write a travel article, but in one instant my interest in saddles, horses, and the Montana sky evaporate. All I see are blue eyes, chiseled cheekbones, and a black cowboy hat.What I find out, is the quiet cowboy who owns this land is the measure of alpha. Quiet. Controlled. He’s older but has a body carved from fresh air and decades of hard work.I do what I can to maintain my professionalism. After all, for two days he’s barely looked my way. And yet, he’s ruined every pair of panties I brought. One slip and everything changes. Garrett West shows me what’s underneath that calm cowboy exterior. And, let me tell you, it’s big.Except, we are from different worlds. Different decades. And some differences may be impossible to overcome.Author’s Note: Saddle up for a ride that will leave you weak in the knees. This May-December pair do their best to maintain some distance, but once they are forced to touch, the sky opens and worlds collide in the hottest sort of way. Always safe, no cheating, and love at the speed of light.
