The men living out here in the forest are all gorgeous. Muscled, bearded, always shirtless... But they're also kind of strange. For one thing, they're not fazed at all when a pack of bears shows up.  Once I understand why the bears don't scare them, they won't let me go home. It's not so bad, though. Even if one of the werebears wants me dead, another thinks I might be his mate!  Where Bear Dance is a 140-page paranormal romance novella. Due to some sexual content between a gruff, sexy werebear and a virgin, fertile BBW, it is intended for mature audiences only.  This novella stands alone, but is also the first in a trilogy.
