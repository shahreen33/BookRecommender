The day that Amanda Waller has long dreaded has finally come to pass: the Justice League has discovered the existence of Task Force X! America’s paragons of truth &amp; justice won’t take well to a government-sponsored team of black ops super-villains (with bombs implanted in their heads), but before the Justice League can shut down the Suicide Squad, a bigger problem looms: another deadly strike team is lurking in the shadows, one that could expose dark secrets throughout the DC Universe, with ties to the hidden truths of DC Universe: Rebirth. Longtime enemies such as Batman &amp; Deadshot, the Flash &amp; Boomerang, &amp; Wonder Woman &amp; Harley Quinn will have to put aside their differences when an evil threat once thought lost to the DC Universe makes their return.Collecting: Justice League vs. Suicide Squad 1-6, Justice League 12-13, Suicide Squad 8-10
