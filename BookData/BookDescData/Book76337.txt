From USA Today Bestselling author K Webster comes an angst-filled, friends-to-enemies-to-lovers MM romance!  I’m in love with my best friend. Lie. I’m in love with my enemy. Truth.  But they’re the same. They. Are. The. Same. Lines in my world are blurry between fantasy and reality. Truth and lies. Love and hate.  Copeland Justice is my enemy. My once best friend. The sadist in my heart plucking and pulling at every thread of who I am until I’m unraveled at his feet. His mouth says he hates me. His eyes burn with animosity for me. His heart beats for someone else.  But Copeland Justice is the best liar of us all.
