Georgia Ames is a tough-as-nails park ranger hired to protect the mountains where three crews of registered bear shifters call home. The only problem is she’s terrified of bears after a year in Alaska going head-to-head with the notoriously aggressive Kodiak grizzlies. She swore up and down she’d never work around brown bears again, yet here she is, pledging to protect the crews at all costs. When she meets a dark-eyed, growly stranger with a tendency to talk to himself, she wants to know more about what makes him tick. But the more she gets to know Jason of the Gray Backs, the more danger her life is in.  Jason Trager is just trying to get from one day to the next without his inner bear going mad. Haunted by his past, he toes the line between clarity and insanity. But when he meets Georgia, a curvy human who puts all his ghosts to rest, he becomes desperate to keep her around just to feel normal for a little while. Sure, she’s a beautiful distraction, but the more he gets to know her, the more he wishes he could be more than a fling to her. A woman like Georgia deserves more than a half-mad shifter and a crew of battling Gray Backs. And even if she could survive his people, her very existence in his territory paints a target on her back.  Now, they’ll both have to decide if being together is worth risking her life.
