I kissed her, then I left her. My best friend’s sister. The only girl I ever loved.And that kiss? Gave new meaning to the words, “pinball machine.”But the army called. No matter what, I am a man of honor. I’ll always do my duty. Even at great personal cost.Now, four years later, I’m back. A little older. A little wiser. And unfortunately, the bearer of horrifically tragic news.There’s no one else to do it. I’ll go to the ends of the earth to find her. But I don’t know what will happen after I hand her that letter.
