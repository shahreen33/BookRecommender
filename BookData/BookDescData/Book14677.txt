Silus knew that as soon as power changed hands, as it was foretold, he would be considered a criminal. The new emperor decreed that all persons over eighteen must have a permanent mate as monogamy was the backbone of society. Silus didn't believe in monogamy and love was just some social construct created by poets. He would fight until they caught him and dragged him before his judge. Judgment day for Silus, came sooner than he thought. And the news was grave. Silus was considered a threat to all good couples everywhere and sentenced to death. His judge, Crash, the emperor's son had a problem. He was going to be eighteen and was still unmarried. When Silus was brought before him, Crash was suddenly possessed by lust. Mesmerized by this bad boy's beauty, he saw a quick and pleasurable solution to his problem. He would give Silus an ultimatum, marry me or die.
