I’m a freak, a misfit, an odd end.Abandoned and unloved.But my happiness is so close I can taste it.Until he shows up.Gorgeous, expensive, and all man.Sad brown eyes and a brilliant smile.And he wants me to go with him.His intentions are hidden.His motives are unclear.Yet, I leave with him because there’s no happiness here.What he promises feels too good to be true…A castle. A fortune. And horses too.It’s too easy.Nothing in my life has ever been easy.What’s the catch?There’s always a catch.
