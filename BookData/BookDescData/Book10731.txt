She’s a martyr.A myth.A ghost.A legend.She’s my soulmate and my captive, my conscience and my wrath. I love her too much to let her die; I fear her too much to wake her from her slumber.She’s mine.And now she’s gone.He’s unnatural.Undying.Unethical.Unstoppable.He’s the keeper of lies and lost souls. Mine slipped through his clutches.I am his wife, his queen, the love of his very long life.And soon, I will be his executioner.
