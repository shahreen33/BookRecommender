Ashley:When you’re married, there are the things you can live with… and the things you can’t.My abusive husband, Harry? He made those distinctions very clear to me.Constant beatings, a forced a miscarriage, and then roping me in with my father’s notorious biker gang, The Reapers.Lucky enough, I got out of my marriage in one piece. For the time being, that is. Though it’s only a matter of time before he picks up on my trail.Thank God for Blackjack.He swears he’ll kill my no-good husband the second he steps foot in town. That’s sweet and all, sure, but there’s more to him; something about his stare that I can’t get out of my mind. A part of me is desperate to believe I deserve to be loved, deserve someone like Blackjack in my life. Yet, the bruises from my past tell me to never trust another man again.But Blackjack isn’t like any other man, is he?Blackjack:I never expected that I’d have anything or anyone to lose when I enlisted in the army. Then the blonde wild-child of the Montana’s Reapers motorcycle club, Ashley Monroe, showed up and proved that I had a lot more to lose than I thought.It shouldn’t have been a surprise that by the time I came back home after all these years that she’d up-and-left town and gotten married. Life, after all, continues to move right on along even when you’re not there to watch it go. All the same, I have a two-year-old son to think about now.And then there’s Ashley. She shows up, beaten and broken from her marriage, and instantly changes everything. I’ve never wanted to kill a man so badly my entire life. Just one look at her and I’m drowning with a desire to take her in my arms and tell her she’ll always be safe with me.But is there enough strength left in both of us for this second shot at life?
