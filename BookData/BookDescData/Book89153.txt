  Ancient, eternal, magikal, and in love with a woman immune to his charms. The combination can bring even the strongest druid sorcerer to his knees. Coyle O'Caha, a seven-hundred-year-old, immortal druid sorcerer, has one claim to fame - his experience mentoring fledgling witches. Three years ago, he found his soulmate, Deri Sullivan. With Deri haunting his dreams, he can no longer wait to claim her. He's tired of waiting for her to fall for his charms and see that he's the man for her. Of course, that's easier said than done since Deri is immune to both his charm and magik. 
  Deri Sullivan's boss is a real piece of work. Not only is Coyle a millionaire with a body to die for and an attitude to match, but he also has a Scottish lilt which makes her knees weak. He's a certified ladies' man. A man she should avoid at all costs. A man she can't seem to quit dreaming about. A man with whom she wishes she could share her secret. Sometimes love happens at its own pace, other times, a supernatural nudge is needed.
