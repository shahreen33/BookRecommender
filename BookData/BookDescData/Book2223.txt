Three days a week I work your everyday nine-to-five. The paperwork is never-ending. The pay is mediocre, and the office drama is simply intolerable. But the other four days a week, I am my own boss.  My name is Jennifer Sunshine and I am a Vegas Call Girl. My clients range from frat boys on spring break to multimillionaire business men with stuffy wives and less than ideal equipment.  I don’t have a daddy-complex or some kind of sob story. I don’t need the money, but it certainly is nice. The only thing I crave is the exhilarating feeling I get from being in control of something. Anything.  My life is uncomplicated, simple even. That was until he bulldozed his way into my life, and everything changed. Overnight he makes me realize how much I truly need him.
