There's a big surprise for the Shelter Pet Squad: A group of sato puppies has arrived! Satos are homeless dogs -- of various breeds -- from Puerto Rico. The kids will help them settle in until they are ready for adoption. Suzannah plays with a pup named Paloma until the little dog falls asleep in her lap. It's puppy love! That's why it's hard, the next week, when a line of people forms at the shelter to adopt the satos. Suzannah should be happy that Paloma will soon have a new home. The only problem is... she's not ready to let the dog go. Is there any way for Paloma to get adopted without breaking Suzannah's heart? Animal lovers will adore this third book in the irresistible Shelter Pet Squad series by Newbery Honor author Cynthia Lord.
