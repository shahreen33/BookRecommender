Librarian Note: There is a newer edition of this book in Kindle format. She’s supposed to be untouchable. But I’ve had a taste of the forbidden fruit, and now I just want more...  She’s the girl from my freshman lecture - my perfect, straight-A pupil and the one I shouldn’t even be looking at much less having these kind of thoughts about. No woman has ever made me feel this way, like I’m going out of my mind with raw need for her. I know the rules, and I know she’s half my age, but I don’t give a f*ck.  Because I’m going claim her. I’m gonna be her first, and I’m going to breed her until everyone knows she’s MINE.
