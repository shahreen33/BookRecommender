An enemy from Todd`s past... When Todd Wilkins and his girlfriend, Elizabeth Wakefield, land jobs as counselors at Secca Lake Day Camp, the summer is off to a great start-until Todd runs into a counselor named Kevin Holmes. Everyone else thinks Kevin is terrific-including Elizabeth. But Todd knows Kevin's secret: Kevin was in jail, and Todd helped put him there! Todd suspects that Kevin wants revenge, even though Kevin acts as if he's turned over a new leaf. When Kevin's around, Todd becomes edgy, defensive, and rude. Soon even Elizabeth is siding with Kevin. But when a crime wave hits Sweet Valley, Todd knows he was right all along. Can Todd expose Kevin's criminal scheme before Kevin gets his revenge...and hurts Elizabeth in the process?
