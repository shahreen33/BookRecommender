I expected a life of music.I expected to raise my son.It took one look to make everything change.I never expected happiness.I never expected to find her.I never expected to feel desire.I never expected I’d be a family man.I never expected to be loved.I never expected to fall in love.They say you should expect the unexpected, I didn’t realize my unexpected would be the forever kind.
