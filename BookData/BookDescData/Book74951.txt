When 26 year old Amy Reed’s promotion sends her down to London to meet a prospective new client, she gets a lot more than she bargains for. The hot American she meets in the hotel bar, is more than willing to show her exactly what she has been missing for the past few years, but will she give into temptation...  “Thank you for seeing me to my room,” I whisper, as he leans in, putting his mouth to my ear, and I can feel his hot breath. “There are so many things I would really like to do to you... just say the word.” My whole body is quivering with just the thought of what he is offering. “I may be a little drunk, but I am not a one night stand type of girl.”  F**k! My brain says no, but my body says ‘Go Girl.’ The sensible me takes charge, although it may have something to do with the Bridget Jones Knickers, and the larger ladies serviceable bra I’m wearing, that have seen better days, lurking under my clothing. A sure thing to put an end to any passion fest. The question is, will she be able to refuse him a second time?  Isaac Rice’s exterior appearance is all business, but under the suit is a whole different kind of American Guy. When Isaac wants something, he will do whatever it takes to get it. Her touch made my body react instantly and I struggled to control my twitching c**k. When I walked her to her room, I just couldn’t keep my hands off her. I want her.  *** This novel contains mature sexual content , bad language and a few giggles.
