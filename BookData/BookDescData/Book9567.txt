The double murder of a young man and woman with a message in blood at both scenes reawakens the memory of an identical case fifteen years earlier. Detective Superintendent Eddie Kilminster, a junior detective on the earlier case, now leads the current investigation. He enlists the help of Sean Moses, an ex colleague from the first case, and now an investigative profiler operating outside of the force. Eddie and Sean find themselves on a journey and a race against time before the killer strikes again. Will Eddies mind be opened to the forces of nature that lie beneath the killings, and will Sean discover a new path in his life before events push him beyond the edge of his own sanity.
