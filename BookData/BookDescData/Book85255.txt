All Elysia wants is a normal life. A life free of magic and her family’s expectations. The last thing she wants is to be a practicing necromancer.  That changes when Elysia meets a dead man. His presence so close to her home can’t be a coincidence. Throw in his polite demeanor and good looks, and she knows another necromancer is messing with her. So she does what any of her kind would do: she soul binds the dead man and makes him her own.  But the solution isn’t that simple. James, her newly acquired dead man, is no necromancer’s pawn. He’s a grim: a near mythical being of incredible power and a prize in the necromancer world. Yet Elysia sees the man beneath the power. James is as much a slave to his magic as she is to hers.  Determined to free him, Elysia must seek help from her family. Can she convince them that he’s not a prize to be claimed? Or will she have to rejoin the necromancer world, sacrificing her own freedom to save him?  (The Necromancer's Betrayal is a 43,000-word novella.)
