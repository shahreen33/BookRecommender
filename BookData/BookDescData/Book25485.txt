The island of Kaua`i is remote jungle, golden beaches and ancient culture--but transients are disappearing in paradise, and only Detective Lei Texeira notices. Fleeing a failed engagement, Detective Lei Texeira transfers to the island of Kaua`i, where she uncovers a pattern of disappearances that may be related to a bizarre cult--or is it just one madman at work? In Lei's world, everyone is guilty until proven innocent. In Blood Orchids Lei battled her personal demons and won--but now they've come roaring back with reinforcements, including charming real estate magnate Alika Wolcott and former fianc√© Michael Stevens. In the midst of the biggest case sleepy Kaua`i has ever seen, Lei must also discover who she loves. "Lei Texeira is both tough detective and a vulnerable woman in a winning Hawaii crime series created by novelist Toby Neal." --David Bishop, mystery author
