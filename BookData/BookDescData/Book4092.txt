A STOLEN VIAL Eternigen is the miracle drug that allows humans to travel in deep space. Seventeen-year-old space captain Tabitha "Dix" Dixon has the only vial of Eternigen in existence. A RELENTLESS ENEMY Eira Ninge always gets what she wants. She wants the Eternigen, and she'll do anything-and kill anyone-to get it. A DEADLY CURSE Since Dix stole the vial, everyone she loves seems fated to die. When young resistance messenger Jordan Berrett steals her heart, she has to decide if it's worth risking his life to let him get close. When Dix is involved, even falling in love can turn deadly. A CHANCE FOR FREEDOM If Dix can get her hands on more Eternigen, she and her crew can escape the solar system, leaving her dark past behind. But getting the Eternigen won't be easy, and the bodies keep piling up. In the end, the cost of freedom may be too high.
