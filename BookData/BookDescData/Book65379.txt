Mississippi trial lawyers, husband &amp; wife, sue a chemical company for causing death and destruction in a small county. Knowing that the trial will end up before the Mi Supreme Court, the billionaire owner of the chemical conglomerate skillfully buys off the election of one of the SC justices so that the huge award to the suing widow will be overturned and he won't have to pay out to any of the other residents or clean up the toxic dump he created in the county. An intricate and entertaining story of the "Erin Brockovich" type but more complex, more trial and legal time, and not such a great ending. Overall, a good read.
