"Marston's wit and vivid evocation of Elizabethan London's sights and smells provide a delightfully ribald backdrop for this clever series." -Publishers Weekly .,."all the swashbuckling thrills and romantic swagger of the blood-and-thunder tragedies that are meat and drink to Westfield's Men." -New York Times Book Review The fiery star, Laurence Firethorn, is hot for a lady, wife of the Lord Mayor elect. A tryst at London's Nine Giants inn is arranged. Meanwhile, the lugubrious landlord of the actors' home base is laid even lower by a plot to take over ownership of the inn. A young apprentice actor is subjected to a horrible assault. And a waterman pulls a mangled corpse from the Thames. The drama comes to a climax at the annual Lord Mayor's show as his barge moves grandly down the river.... "As rich in background color, language, and vivid characters as it is in plot structure, Marston has another winner here." -Kirkus Reviews Originally published in 1991, it is the fourth in series following Poisoned Pen Press' republications of The Queen's Head, The Merry Devils, and The Trip to Jerusalem.
