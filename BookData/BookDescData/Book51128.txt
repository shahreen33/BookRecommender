ERIC MITCHELL'S STORYI'm the bastard child, son to the mistress, my father's backup heir to the Mitchell empire. He sent me to Harvard. I left and became a Navy SEAL, but I'm back now, and I finished school on my own dime. I'm now the right hand man to Grayson Bennett, the billionaire who runs the Bennett Empire. I'm now a few months from being a billionaire myself. I don't need my father's company or his love. My "brother" can have it. I will never go back there. I will never be the mistake my father made, the way he was the mistake my mother made.And then she walks in the door, the princess I'd once wanted more than I'd wanted my father's love. She wants me to come back. She says my father needs to be saved. I don't want to save my father but I do want her. Deeply. Passionately. More than I want anything else.But she's The Princess and I'm The Bastard. We don't fit. We don't belong together and yet she says he needs me, that she needs me. We're like sugar and spice, we don't mix, but I really crave a taste. Just one. What harm can just one taste do?Don't miss the full FILTHY TRILOGY:THE BASTARDTHE PRINCESS (January)The Empire (March***The Bastard was originally titled Dirty Rich Bastard. Long story short, as I was nearing the end of The Princess, I realized I can't possibly end Eric and Harper's story with this book. It would be unfair to my readers to be shortchanged on their ending. So I made the decision to make their story three books instead of two. I hope you'll understand and be excited for the remaining two books in their story. These three books can be read independently of the Dirty Rich series.
