-Tink- From the moment I befriended him, I set a conspiracy in motion. A revolution. Kill Peter Pan. And I was their ultimate weapon. I was also none the wiser, falling hopelessly and irrevocably in love with him as the years went by. Just as they hoped I would. But their plan comes to a screeching halt when Peter vanishes into thin air, something I’ll learn has nothing to do with Rosewood at all. You see, Peter never truly loved me...because he loved a wench instead. He lied to me, he used me, he left me, and he broke me. Forever altering me in ways that incite revenge when Hook sweeps in with revelations and the ultimate truth. Peter may have turned his back on me, but in the end, he and his precious little Wendy will choke on every last tear I once shed. And I’ll have Hook to thank for that.  -Hook- It’s no secret I always despised Peter Pan. A common threat amongst the factions, I should’ve killed him when I had the chance, long before he sank his claws deep into Tinksley’s heart. But his death at my hands wasn’t what the plan called for, despite how I felt for her. I’d always been drawn to the girl, innocently enough at first…until that vile abomination marked her with his stamp, unleashing a sense of propriety I had no rights to. Didn’t matter—he had her...and I wanted her. Then like magic, he disappeared. I thought my time had come, but the road to owning Tinksley’s heart comes with a price. A price so dark and depraved it strips her of her purity and awakens the beast within. All because of the truth. Sometimes, there is honor in revenge, and it will be my utmost pleasure to watch as Peter Pan finally meets his maker. His maker who will soon be my Queen.
