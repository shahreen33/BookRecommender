A historical Steampunk adventure, this story introduces Tavara Tinker and her band of friends that are wrapped up in an alternative Victorian era world. By day, a proper Victorian Lady. By night, deep in the heart of industrial London, she maintains a research laboratory and a steam-powered factory where she creates the clothes and weapons for a new generation of adventurer. Join Tavara as she visits Paris to collect rare cloth for a client, and finds out she's not the only one that has interest in it.
