Everything you know about vampires is wrong…After a grisly murder casts a pall over The Vampyre, an Off-Broadway play in which Esther plays a vampire victim, she and her friend Max confront a dizzying array of suspects among the vamparazzi—the rival factions of vampire groupies and anti-vampire obsessives who surround the theatre every night. Meanwhile, Esther’s almost would-be boyfriend, Detective Connor Lopez, fears that she may be the killer’s next target!Esther’s quest to thwart Evil and ensure a decent run for her play ultimately brings her into conflict with real vampires, vamparazzi, and an ancient cult of vampire hunters with whom her friend Max has a checkered past. Her adventure takes her into the forgotten tunnels and vaults beneath New York City, where Esther learns that having your neck gnawed upon by a bloodthirsty prince of the night isn’t nearly as much fun as she makes it look onstage.
