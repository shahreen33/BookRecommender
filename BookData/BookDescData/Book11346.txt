There was a fine line between love and hate, we walked it together.   Unforgiving.  Relentless.  I'm to be feared.  When your family is as much a friend as an enemy, there is no one to trust.  I am Javier Almanza. Cartel kingpin.  No one can touch me. No one can hurt me ...   Except her.   Mari Belle Dominguez.  He was raised as family. My brother’s best friend, my first kiss, and my first betrayal. He planned to make me his Cartel Bitch. The joke was on him; I’d never break nor would I bend. I would fight until the end for myself. My will was stronger than his want.   He would soon see.   This is book one in the Almanza Crime Family Duet and a full-length standalone romance. This is a dark, edge of your seat romantic suspense novel featuring an antihero, so there is a level of violence inside that may not be suitable for some readers. This is not meant to be an actual depiction of life inside a Cartel but rather a work of fiction meant to entertain.
