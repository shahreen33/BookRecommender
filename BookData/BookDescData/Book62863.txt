An alternate title/cover for this ASIN can be found here.From the moment Kai Stanton laid eyes on Daiya, he knew something was special about her. But a haze surrounds them, and like a dark cloud, it shadows their relationship. What if his feelings aren't his own? Can he trust himself? Can he trust the girl he’s almost certain he’s falling in love with? With Kai’s father back and insistent on inserting himself into his life, everything starts to spin out of control. He doesn't know what—or who—to believe anymore. Daiya Cattiva knew awakening would be difficult, but she had no idea she would find herself at the center of an ancient prophecy that could change everything. She knows her destiny is entwined with Kai’s, but how can she be sure what he feels is real and not just the allure of the demon inside her? Either way, Kai’s life hangs in the balance, and Daiya must make a choice: save Kai over the greater good, or be with Kai and risk her demon consuming him. It only takes one touch ... the next could be their last.
