Young Curtis Carson doesn't mean to rip off the Chicanos in his backyard crap games. He just rolls the dice better. But the Chicanos don't see it that way, and when one of their brothers is brutally slaughtered in a barroom shootout because of Curtis' dealings with heroin pusher Fat George, the Mexicans cry revenge on Curtis, leaving his brother with a wrecked body that will forever prevent him from being the basketball star he'd always dreamed of being. Curtis swears vengeance, and the streets run red with black-Chicano warfare!"He lived by the code of the streets and his books vividly recreated the street jungle and its predators." -New Jersey Voice
