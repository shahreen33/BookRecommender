Ah, the great outdoors. Tents, sleeping bags, nature walks, campfires . . . and maybe a few spells thrown in for good measure! In this entry in the series, Salem takes her first camping trip with the Squirrel Girls, but neither Whammy nor Salem is cut out for roughing it. Salem believes a bit of magic will smooth the way . . . but as usual, it creates more problems than it solves. Salem and Whammy are an irresistible duo in a book perfect for the youngest independent readers.
