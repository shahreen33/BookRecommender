A #1 Romance/Suspense bestseller on Amazon!   From USA Today Bestselling Author Nora Flite: If you hated your life—wanted to prove to the world that you could change—how would you do it?  I had a plan. I also had no family, no friends, and definitely no jerk of an ex-boyfriend who thought I was boring. I was tired of being me. In Vegas, I could be anything.  And then I saw him. His hungry smile wanted a taste of the new me. Only a boring person would have said no.  It was reckless to follow a stranger to his bed. Dangerous to take the drink he handed me. I thought the worst regret I'd have would be a hangover, a walk of shame through the hotel.  Except I didn't wake up in the hotel. Or in Vegas.  I doubt my face will end up in the news. “Woman missing,” the headline would say. “A stupid person who thought she could be someone else.”  I'm not someone else. I was only playing pretend.  Too bad he was playing for keeps.  --Author's Note-- This is a dark romance novel, it contains themes of violence and mature situations that could make readers uncomfortable.
