Pamela Murray Wintersâ€™ poems walk the meandering line between memory and imagination. In her debut collection, The Unbeckonable Bird, one will find questions, elegies, love songs, dream songs, and songs about songs. Around various corners: an Anglophile in America and an American in Australia, a music journalist and a television extra, pranksters, fangirls, middle-aged women, the recorded voices of the dead, and numerous seekers of the small things that hint of large mysteries. Winding through them all is music, bidden or unbidden, the pulse of life.
