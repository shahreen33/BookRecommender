No longer content in the shadows of his older brothers, and on a quest to find his destiny, Bryce Fraser's chosen path is fraught with danger, passion, and decisions. Can his unspoken love for spirited, beguiling Fallon be triumphant in a time of war and uncertainty, or will they both fall prey to the devious plans of a traitorous laird from a rival clan?**This is book 2 of a series, but it is also a stand alone title.  The books in this series can be read in any order. The stories revolve around the first Scottish war of independence, three brothers who take up the cause, and the women who change their lives forever. Each brother very different from the other, yet  strong family bonds that can never be broken.
