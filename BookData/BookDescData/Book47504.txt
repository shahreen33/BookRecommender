Trevor Lincoln is the legendary tight end for Boston University’s football team. As the youngest son of a former NFL player, he lives a life of privilege with an endless stream of girls vying for his attention. He always gets his way.  Until I come along.

Can I shut down his game, or will he tackle my heart?  *can be read as a standalone*
