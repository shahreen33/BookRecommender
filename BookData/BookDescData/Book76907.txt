After a wedding day prank involving a strong laxative, that ends the already severed relationship between the twins, Parker decides to grow up and act twenty-six. Step One: Move out of her parents' house. Step Two: Find a job. Opportunity strikes when she meets her new neighbor, Gus Westman.

Driven to be the best assistant ever, Parker vows to stay focused, walk the dog, go to the dry cleaners, and not kiss Gus-again. Step Three: Don't judge.
