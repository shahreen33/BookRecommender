THIS IS AN INVITATION TO DROWNING.These are the stories of things out of water—of sea bed deserts choked with ghosts; of the lonely, roving children of the fen. Here your garden grows belowground. You will be born into a cradle of your own bones, shadows will burst from your eyes, and your mouth will fill with thorns. Storms will twist inside you, and the ghosts of your past will follow you and chart your future.Here, things are out of place—ectopic and unviable—and you will mourn the unborn, those underwater things out of water.
