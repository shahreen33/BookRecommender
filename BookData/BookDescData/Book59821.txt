In her latest work, she tackles the very real possibility of portals between worlds -- and even other dimensions.Shadow wolves, sentient mists, and UFOs...oh my!Linda S. Godfrey -- author of Real Wolfmen, American Monsters, and other books reporting on creatures such as Bigfoot, gigantic birds, and strange energy forms -- began to seek answers to the question of where these creatures are actually from.
