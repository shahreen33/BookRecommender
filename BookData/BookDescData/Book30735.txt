In this, her first full-length collection of romance poetry, Ellenelizabeth Cernek takes the reader on a journey to interior and exterior landscapes. Exploring the terrain of love against the backdrop of places as far apart as Hunter Mountain, NY, and Alexandria, Egypt, Ellenelizabeth uses poetry as both roadmap and script. Each poem is transporting, each page takes us further away. For the romantic that resides in every beating poetic heart.
