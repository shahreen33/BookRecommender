Not easy subjects -- love, loss, sexual abuse, date rape, grief -- but real ones, told in pieces (thus the title). Broken Pieces is a work of non-fiction. Poetry, prose, and essays to let you into one woman's life -- a searingly raw examination of topics most people avoid. Already a #1 best seller on Amazon (eBooks) on Women's Poetry and Abuse, this book is recommended for mature audiences only.
