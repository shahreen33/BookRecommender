'It all went wrong with football, the thing I loved most of all and from there my life slowly fell apart' George BestGeorge Best needs little introduction. A legend in his own lifetime, he is undoubtedly the greatest footballer the UK has ever produced. Blessed with an extraordinary gift he brought a beauty and grace to the game never before seen. But Best was unable to cope with the success and fame his genius brought fabled story is littered with tales of women and sex and, of course, the drink. Much has been written about Best, but very little substantiated by the man himself. Until now. At last George Best is ready to open his heart and engage us in the one of the most exhilarating life stories for years. In his own words George will recount the halcyon days at Manchester United, the big games and European Cup win of '68. And then there's the heartbreaking truth about the death of his mother and his struggles with alcohol that have forced him to face up to a life without drink for good. For the first time Blessed will reveal the man behind the up-for-a-laugh, boozy, womanizing stereotype that has dogged George Best for years. George speaks openly and honestly about the mistakes he has made over the years and is incredibly candid both about his triumphs, but also about the regrets he has and his hopes for his future.
