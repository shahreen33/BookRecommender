Where I Find Myself is the first major single book retrospective of one of America's leading photographers. It is organized in inverse chronological order and spans the photographer's whole career to date: from Joel Meyerowitz's most recent picture all the way back to the first photograph he ever took. The book covers all of Joel Meyerowitz's great projects: his work inspired by the artist Morandi, his work on trees, his exclusive coverage of Ground Zero, his trips in the footsteps of Robert Frank across the US, his experiments comparing color and black and white pictures, and of course his iconic street photography work. Joel Meyerovitz is incredibly eloquent and candid about how photography works or doesn't, and this should be an inspiration to anyone interested in photography.The view from here 2017-2012 --Elemental 2010-2001 --Cities 2008-1976 --Portraits 2017-1980 --The world upside down 1990-1976 --Letting go of the catch 1976-1968 --American in the time of Vietnam 1972-1968 --On the road 1967-1964 --The colour question 1968-1963 --Out into the street 1964-1962 --Coda.
