The New Moral Order. A ferocious military dicatorship. A new, extreme detainment system in which the Tanks are the terrible instrument for a radical purge of society.Giovanni Corte, a young man full of hopes, gets the long sought role of Keeper of Tank 9, where he will spend a whole year. And so he starts walking a new path - inexorable, clastrofobic, unreal - on the darkest corners of the human soul, towards the pitch-black heart of the horrors living both inside and outside us.
