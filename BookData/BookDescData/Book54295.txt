Christmas sucks!Or at least that’s what Sheridan Lewis believes. With plans to hide away for the rest of the season, she’s dismayed to be sent on a trip so close to Christmas with her boss and arch nemesis, Brady McGuire. Not only does she have to suffer through the season, but work closely with a man who thinks he’s hot stuff because he’s the CEO’s grandson. So what if he has dreamy eyes, broad shoulders and a physique any Olympian would be jealous of, nothing good could possibly come out of their trip together. Insufferable brat!There’s nothing more that Brady McGuire wants to do than take Sheridan Lewis over his knee and give her the spanking she sorely deserves. She’s loud, obnoxious, and has a Napoleon complex. It’s bad enough dealing with her on a daily basis, but being through together for a two week trip where they’ll have to work closely together. No way. The last thing he wants is his holidays to be ruined by this little Scrooge. So what if her very scent drives him mad and she has a body made for sinning. She’s still a pain in the ass. Thrown together during the holidays, these two headstrong idiots may just find their common ground in each other and turn their hell into a holiday after all.
