What is it that makes dictators fear cartoonists? The answer is that they can't stand to be ridiculed. And they don't help their cause much by so obviously enjoying the trappings of power, appearing in public with a retinue of bodyguards, a fleet of limousines and rows of medals across their chests topped off with over-sized sunglasses. Cartoonists may not be able to topple tyrants or change the course of history, but they can lessen the climate of fear and bring courage to the victims of state bullying with their subversive drawings. Laughter is the last thing dictators want to hear, especially when they are the subject of it.
