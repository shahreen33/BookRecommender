A spectacularly rich novel spanning fifty years in the history of a nation, a family, and a love affair. Set in the noble Mexican city of Puebla, this is the beautifully romantic story of Emilia Sauri, a charmed young woman in love with two men--one, a quixotic activist who heeds the call of the revolution, the other, a stable and devoted doctor who helps Emilia realize her own gift for healing.t
