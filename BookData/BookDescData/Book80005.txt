  SHE IS HIS WITNESS.

  Born from the fertile imagination of bestselling author Michael Anderle

  Can you get your PhD in the ZOO?
Salinger Jacobs treats others as he is treated. Screw him over, and he might hold stuff back. You have his back? He will have yours.
  When a fellow scientist is screwed over by her company, she seeks out his fledgling Mercenary company to see if they can use another smart mind.

  Since he obviously didn't want her body.
With opportunities coming at him and his partner Madigan faster than they can handle, another mind might be just what Heavy Metal needs.
  But will it come with too many complications?

  In the ZOO you always expect the unexpected, will this be true for relationships? Can he trust his partner with his secret?

  Salinger Jacobs is working to build his company as fast as possible, will he make a few mistakes he can't think his way out of?.

  Sometimes, it isn't what you know from reading books that helps you succeed.
NOTE:  There may or may not be gratuitous sex in this book. Or it might actually play into a later book with funny talk about men's vs. women's abilities and capabilities. There is ABSOLUTELY cursing in this book. LOTS of upset cursing, cursing out of anger, fear, and other emotional issues related to carnivorous alien flora or fauna eating humans who don’t say ‘darn.’ LOTS of gratuitous cursing just because the author finds it funny, too. There is death and sadness...and more death. In fact, it’s a blender of blood out in the ZOO. Man vs. Alien nature seems to justify ugly results. Plus, people have emotional hangups. Expect to smile, laugh, cry, and perhaps have a spate of jealousy or two. Further, there might be explicit sex, thank you sex, and you're welcome sex. Finally, there is no Coke in the ZOO.  That is probably the worst and most offensive trait in these stories. This is Michael Todd, and I approve of the shenanigans pulled in ZOO stories.​----
  Join Salinger Jacobs as he learns about the ZOO, how to stay alive and the opportunities that being a part of the ZOO has brought him.

  The future is looking interesting and humorous, except for the death part.
