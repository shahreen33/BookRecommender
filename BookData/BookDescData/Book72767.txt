Mpreg Romance. Tyler Sly was born unable to conceive, and when you’re an omega, that’s a problem. When his brother convinces him to join him on a tour of the wine country, Tyler grudgingly agrees. But when he gets there, his brother is a no-show, and he discovers it's actually a singles tour.  Ronan Blade is just freshly divorced from his wife of two years, and he’s trying to get back into the dating scene. When he meets Tyler, something clicks inside for him. He’s drawn to the quiet omega and begins to spend all his time with Tyler. Tyler is equally drawn to Ronan, and soon the two men are inseparable. Once the tour ends, the men decide to keep in contact. By now, Ronan is realizing his feelings toward Tyler are not simply those of a friend.  When Ronan comes clean to Tyler about his true feelings, the two men give in to their physical need. But Tyler doesn’t trust that an alpha like Ronan would want an omega like him.  It’s no wonder then, that when Ronan’s ex-wife shows up, her appearance sends Tyler into a tail spin of fear and doubt.
