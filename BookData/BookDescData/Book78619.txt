Alex and her partner, Nick, piece together a convoluted puzzle. But how many pieces are missing?  Threats hit from all directions, including the legal kind. Just what Alex needs.  The deaths, brutal and violent beyond belief, show a pattern. And then another pattern. Is this the work of a copycat killer? If only it were that easy to figure out.  The video hits. It rocks Alex's core -- her future forever altered. She pushes forward…only because the dead have no voice.  And just when Alex can take no more, her world is shattered like never before. It just can't be. But it is, and she's all alone.  Nothing will stop her from ending this obsession. No matter who gets in her way, there will be one final death.

Why? Because, ultimately, they all connect -- Alex, Ivy, Ozzie. How? That's part of the mystery that I'm slowly unveiling throughout the Redemption Thriller Series.   Through each sub-series, characters from different books appear in the other novels. If it adds suspense, intrigue, or even a good laugh, I've included a cross-over character -- it's a lot more fun that way. Plus -- and here's the real kicker -- the final six novels will bring all of the major characters together -- Alex, Ivy, Ozzie. It will be explosive and gut-wrenching…in a way that will leave you breathless.
