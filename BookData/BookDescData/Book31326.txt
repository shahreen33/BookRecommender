True love is the only magic Sean has ever wished for…  After being rescued from a vicious gang of thieving swans by fellow swan shifter Kellan, Sean is starting over in the magical town of Vale Valley. Despite being so young, he aches to find his Alpha so he can begin his forever after. And once he’s spent lots of time with Kellan and Vic’s adorable hatchling, he also dreams of having an egg of his very own.  Avi is Vale Valley’s recently hired fire chief and an eagle shifter. He can’t keep his eyes off the blond cutie who’s a server at the Vale Valley Inn restaurant, but he’s so busy with his job. In addition, he’s much older than the delectable Sean. Avi decides he should probably just behave and keep his wings to himself.  Sometimes all a fated mate needs is a swift kick in the ass. When Sean repeatedly fails to convince Avi they were meant to be, he enlists the help of his new friends. Too bad there’s an old enemy skulking around who can’t wait to ruin everything…  Note: A Swan’s Love Song is the fourth book in Season 3 of the Vale Valley series. Each installment of the series can be enjoyed without reading the others. However, reading A Swan for Christmas and A Hatching for Valentine’s from Seasons 1 &amp; 2 would add to the enjoyment of this book. This mpreg, age gap romance novella features a swan and eagle who are fated mates and struggling to figure out this whole love thing. So grab a tall, cool glass of lemonade, put your feet up and enjoy a sweet dose of smexy mpreg.  A Summer Romance.
