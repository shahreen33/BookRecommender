All Molly Forrester wants is to find that one big story that can redirect her journalism career away from the sex/relationship advice column she writes for Zeitgeist magazine ("wedged somewhere between Marie Claire and Cosmo") and back to the serious news business. But she didn't expect to trip over it, especially when "it" turned out to be the bloody body of one of her coworkers, and she certainly didn't expect to ruin her brand new Jimmy Choos over it. Never mind, though--she knows that solving the murder of one of the magazine world's most notorious lady's men will solve all her problems, including assauging her guilt for blowing a month's salary on a pair of shoes ruined in one night. All Molly needs is a little help from her girlfriends, and perhaps a few detecting lessons from that cute homicide detective.... Or is he cozying up because he thinks she's a killer?Sheryl Anderson delivers this totally charming, wildly clever, and puzzling debut about murder - and sex - in the Big Apple. What her characters find, is that, compared to negotiating Manhattan's singles scene, solving one eensy teensy stabbing shouldn't be that big a deal, right?
