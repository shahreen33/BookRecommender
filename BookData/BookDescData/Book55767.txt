Stand-alone Valentine Bay romance, complete with HEA--and plenty of heat and heart along the way!  Troy Valentine gave up everything when his parents died, leaving his career as a pro baseball player to come home to Valentine Bay and raise his little sister, Mila. Itâ€™d been so long since he put himself first or thought about what he wanted, it was hard to even remember what that felt like.  Broadway star Alison Bartholomew needed a break from her high-pressure theater career and all the scrutiny and judgement that went with it. When she meets Troy on the first morning of her Valentine Bay getaway, she starts to wonder: could a short sabbatical turn into something more lasting?  Troy and Alison can't help but be drawn to each other, but is the force binding them together stronger than the one pulling them in different directions?  18+
