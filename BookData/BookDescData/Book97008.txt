A part of DC Universe: Rebirth! Hal Jordan is about to go from the head of the Green Lantern Corps to an army of one. Jordan's long, illustrious--and tumultuous--tenure with the Corps takes several hairpin turns. At lightspeed. Toward a black hole. In a blender!For starters, the Green Lantern Corps has disappeared, and now Sinestro's own Corps enforces his uniquely brutal brand of law and order in the universe. As a result, Jordan has no ring to sling, or Sector 2814 (a.k.a. Earth) to protect. (So more of the usual for Hal!) Green Lantern veteran Robert Venditti teams up with Rafa Sandoval and Ethan Van Sciver to pilot Hal Jordan &amp; the Green Lantern Corps, Vol. 1: Sinestro's Law!Collecting: Hal Jordan &amp; the Green Lantern Corps 1-7, Rebirth
