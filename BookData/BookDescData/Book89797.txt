Today I am 18.I have decided to give myself a birthday gift - JUSTICE My enemies are rich,powerful and dangerous. If I want to be alive, I'll have to kill them before they kill me. I do not care if I die in the process. At least I will die knowing that I am not a victim anymore. I am a survivor.I am going to open a real world,scarier than fiction. Will you walk with me ? Because if it can happen to me, it can happen to you too...
