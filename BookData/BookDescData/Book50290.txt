Blackballed from my job. Moved back to my hometown with my tail between my legs and family issues crushing my back.Slinging drinks in a dive bar. Yes, the past year has been hell. So when a man who’s temptation wrapped in golden skin and sin offers me one night of no-holds barred, dirty sex, I’m all in. I deserve it. But now those few unforgettable hours have me facing blackmail from my own father: He'll pay for my mom's medical bills, but only if I never again touch the man who has quickly become my obsession. Because the man? My obsession? He’s my stepbrother.
