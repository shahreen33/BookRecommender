The first of a brand new series by the author of 'The Daughters of Allamont Hall'.  Lord Reginald Marford needs a wealthy heiress to support his indulgent lifestyle. Spirited Miss Robinia Chamberlain looks perfect, but when he sets out to court her, he finds that his title and family connections aren’t nearly enough to entice the lady, and he has to become a little bit creative to attract her attention.  Robinia’s recently inherited large fortune brings her many suitors. But she’s not interested in any of them, and especially not Reggie, no matter how persistent he is. He may be a perfect gentleman but he isn’t nearly dashing enough for her. She wants a marriage with real passion, and she’s determined to have her way. But sometimes having your own way is fraught with unexpected difficulties, especially when dealing with a dashing, passionate young man who is anything but a perfect gentleman.  A traditional Regency romance, drawing room rather than bedroom.  Book 1 of the 5-book Sons of the Marquess series, each a complete story with a HEA, but read all of them to find out all the secrets of the Marford family!
