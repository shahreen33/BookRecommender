Change your perception of meditation! This accessible, breezy guide introduces the concept of active meditation—moving meditations in which mind, body, and spirit become totally immersed in a single activity. Author and martial artist Chris Berlow takes readers through the many possible ways to meditate throughout even the busiest day, whether it’s during a session of high-powered exercise or while performing simple tasks like cooking and cleaning. In our fast-paced, technologically driven time, this alternative and nontraditional practice can help foster personal self-awareness, a peaceful mind, and internal happiness.
