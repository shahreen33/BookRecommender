Dragon Ball introduces a young monkey-tailed boy named Goku (a wry update of the classic Chinese "Monkey King" legend), whose quiet life changes when he meets a girl named Bulma who is on a quest to collect seven "Dragon Balls." If she gathers them all, an incredibly powerful dragon will appear and grant her one wish. But the precious orbs are scattered all over the world, and Bulma could use the help of a certain super-strong boy... Earth faces its deadliest threat ever! Cell is a biologically engineered abomination constructed from the universeâ€™s most powerful beings, including Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo and even Freeza! To increase his power and achieve his perfect form, Cell must absorb powerful warriors and steal their energy. Now Cell is about to issue a terrible ultimatum to Earth: produce one warrior who can stand up to Cell one-on-one or he will destroy every living thing on Earth!
