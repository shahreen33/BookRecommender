  A B&amp;B owner takes on a posh hotel developer in this enemies-to-lovers story with plenty of South Florida heat.
 The grudge match is set to get nasty. Wesley and Nathan are willing to pull out all the stops to achieve their dreams. They just never expected the heat between them to carry over to the bedroom. After one reckless night burning up the sheets, Wes and Nathan can’t stay away from each other.  But is there any hope of them having their happily ever after when it means someone has to give up his dream?
   All For Wesley is a standalone enemies-to-lovers MM romance with sneaking, spying, family troubles, helpful movie stars, one poorly timed hurricane, and all the feels.
