FOX HUNTER is the latest in Zoë Sharp’s highly acclaimed Charlotte ‘Charlie’ Fox crime thriller series.  ‘The dead man had not gone quietly … There was a time when I would have given everything I owned to be the one responsible for that.’  Charlie Fox will never forget the men who put a brutal end to her military career, but she vowed a long time ago she would not go looking for them.  Now she doesn’t have a choice.  Her boss and former lover, Sean Meyer, is missing in Iraq where one of those men was working as a private security contractor. When the man’s butchered body is discovered, Charlie fears that Sean may be pursuing a twisted vendetta on her behalf.  Sean’s partner in their exclusive New York close-protection agency needs this dealt with—fast and quiet—before everything they’ve worked for is in ruins. He sends Charlie to the Middle East with very specific instructions:  Find Sean Meyer and stop him. By whatever means necessary.  At one time Charlie thought she knew Sean better than she knew herself, but it seems he’s turned into a violent stranger. As the trail grows more bloody, Charlie realises that unless she can get to Sean first, the hunter may soon become the hunted.  Praise for FOX HUNTER and Charlie Fox  ‘If I were a woman I’d be Zoë Sharp, and if Jack Reacher were a woman, he’d be Zoë’s main character, Charlie Fox.’ Lee Child  ‘Gritty, hard-hitting, all-around outstanding crime fiction.’ Booklist (starred review)  ‘Nonstop action and an intricate plot weave together to create another thrill ride for fans of Sharp's heroine.’ Kirkus  ‘Ill-tempered, aggressive and borderline psychotic, Fox is also compassionate, introspective and highly principled: arguably one of the most enigmatic—and coolest—heroines in contemporary genre fiction.’ Paul Goat Allen, Chicago Tribune
