Elena is too young for me, not to mention she's my boss's daughter and my babysitter.That's beyond complicated. And I'm not even looking for a relationship â€” but I can't deny the attraction that sizzles between us.I need to ignore it. A single dad, all I want is to take care of my little girl, do my job, and enjoy my friends. Anything more is asking for complications I can't afford. Asking to be hurt again.Trouble is, I want her, too. And when out flirty sparks turn to flames, I give in to temptation. Our secret fling is scorching hot, better than I'd ever imagined.But secrets get out, and I could lose my job and my reputation. And I am starting to realize she's the one thing I'm not willing to lose.
