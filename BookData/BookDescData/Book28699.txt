"Oh my god. Who is that?"I get asked this question a lot."Oh him?" I reply. "That's just Ian."Just Ian is the biggest understatement of the century.Just the Mona Lisa. Just the Taj Mahal. Just Ian, with his boring ol' washboard abs and dime-a-dozen dimpled smile.Just Ian is... just my best friend.We're extremely close, stuck so deep inside a Jim-and-Pam-style friendzone everyone at works assumes we're a couple - that is until one day, word spreads through the teacher's lounge that he's single. Fair game. Suddenly, it's open season on Ian.He should be reveling in all the newfound attention, but to our mutual surprise, the only attention he seems to want is mine.He's turning our formerly innocent nightly chats into x-rated phone calls. Our playful banter sports a new, dangerous edge.I want to assume he's playing a prank on me, just pushing my buttons like always - but when Ian lifts me onto the desk in my classroom and slides his hands up my skirt, he doesn't leave a lot of room for confusion.I'm a little scared of things going south, of losing my best friend because I can't keep my hands to myself. So, I'm just going to back away and not return this earth-shattering kiss - oh who am I kidding?!Goodbye Ian, ol' buddy, ol' pal!Helloooo mister not so nice guy.
