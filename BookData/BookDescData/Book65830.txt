All it takes is a little Christmas spirit for love to appear.Lady Cassiopeia Ashcroft never really liked her brother’s friend from Eton, but when her grandmother told her that Lord Gregory was coming home with Rion for Christmas, she decided that she would make the best of it – as long as he stayed out of her way. But the moment he stepped out of the carriage, she knew that this time, things would be different. Not only had Gregory matured and become rather infuriatingly handsome since she’d last seen him, but he also made her feel things that she never thought possible. And that was dangerous.Lord Gregory Dawson never really considered Cassie to be anything other than Rion’s annoying older sister, but time had changed the girl he knew into a rather enchanting woman – so long as she kept her razor-sharp tongue inside that lovely head. He could think of many other uses for it, but he knew she was firmly off limits. The trouble was that he couldn’t seem to keep his hands to himself. As a lively, Christmas house party begins to commence they finally start to succumb to the attraction between them. But when sudden tragedy breaks them apart, is their love strong enough to withstand the storm?*An alternate sweet version was originally featured in Nine Ladies Dancing 2018.*
