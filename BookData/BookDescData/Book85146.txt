When a handsome stranger arrives trying to solve a fifteen-year-old mystery, even the most over-protected heroine knows how to let down her hair.  Zelle Carpenter loves her parents. She really, really does. It’s just that they’re soooooo obsessed with keeping her safe that she feels like she’s been locked in a tower half the time. There’s no chance to go out and have fun, without resorting to a little trickery with her best friend, and there’s no chance to meet boys. The only boys she knows are the always-on-their-best-behavior cowboys at Church, and who wants to practice kissing with them?  Duke Dmitri Volkov is stuck in this backwater American town for one reason only; to solve the fifteen-year-old mystery about a lost princess that his father shared on his death-bed. But he’s not going to pass up the opportunity to kiss a pretty girl, especially if that pretty girl has the most beguiling green eyes and taste for adventure. Despite his best efforts, he’s quickly falling for this quaint town and its welcoming citizens.  The only thing left is to solve his father’s mystery, so that he can start his Happily Ever After. But Dmitri doesn’t realize that finding the lost princess from his past will strip away any chance of future happiness in Everland.  [Note: This story is the sequel to THE STEPMOTHER.
