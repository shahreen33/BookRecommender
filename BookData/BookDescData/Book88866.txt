What's the first rule of reinventing yourself as a cool girl at a new school? Steer clear of your old crush.  A new school means a fresh start. So long Ronnie Smith, invisible tomboy, and hello Veronica, popular new hottie. This is my chance to finally be seen....and kissed. Yeah, that's right. I've never been kissed. But I mean to change all that now that I'm starting over with a new look and attitude. The only problem? I'm not the only one from my old school who's transferred to Briarwood High. Drew Remi is here, too, and he's still the same wildly popular baseball star. He's also the only person who can ruin my new life. But he can only rat me out if he recognizes me...So, why am I so upset when he doesn't have a clue who I really am?
