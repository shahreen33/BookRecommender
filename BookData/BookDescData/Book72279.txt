Something strange is happening in the small town of Pleasant Plains, New Jersey. People are getting sick. Peculiar noises can be heard from inside their homes. Some of them are acting weird, speaking in unknown languages. Then there are the butterflies. And the green pulsating light coming through the cracks in the walls. Oh, and the hunger. Yes, the people of Pleasant Plains are starving and nothing seems to satisfy their primary desire. Except for the children. The kids have proven to be quite filling... The Thin Veil is a 35,000 word novella in the vein of Stephen King and B science-fiction movies of the 1950's.
