Over the past few decades, celebrity culture’s grip on our society has tightened. For Timothy Caulfield, a health science expert, this culture has a measurable influence on individual health-care decisions. But this is not a book about celebrity culture. Nor does it mock those who enjoy it (Caulfield in fact loves celebrity culture). Instead he identifies and debunks the messages and promises that flow from the celebrity realm, whether they’re about health, diet, beauty, or what is supposed to make us happy.As he did so convincingly in The Cure for Everything, Caulfield separates sense from nonsense and provides usable, evidence-informed advice about what actually works and what is a complete waste of money and time.In typical Caulfield manner, it isn't enough to just interview experts and read all the current studies (which he does). Caulfield employs a more hands-on approach: He tries celebrity-recommended beauty routines and diets. He signs on with a modelling agency and goes to a competition in New York. He follows celebrity Twitter feeds, peruses gossip blogs, and forces himself to read every issue—cover to cover—of People magazine, for an entire year, in his quest to understand the relationship between celebrity culture and our individual health choices.Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong about Everything? That’s the question Caulfield sets out to answer in this fun, factual book that offers real-life advice.
