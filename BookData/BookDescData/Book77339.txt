If the perfect world existed, Ava and Sebastian would be in it, in love. But in this world, they are both closely watched by their demons. Their baggage is not light: Ava has hers carefully folded in vacuum bags to occupy as little room as possible; Sebastian wears his like a lead armor that makes him slouch sometimes. They like each other, but how are their demons going to get along? Ava spent half her life being a twin. Ever since her sister died, she has tried to live for the both of them and rarely allows herself to feel the pain that is still very much present. Although Sebastian is a few years older, his medical residency got postponed because of his own tragedy. Now all he does is take life one day at a time, never wondering if there might be something more for him out there. Until Ava comes along and shows him how, against all logic, the pain can make them whole again.
