The Roxanne's Ghost Saga is set against the backdrop of modern day South Africa. It is a complex ghost story of identical twin sisters’ love for the same man. There will ultimately be three books in the series.And the theme? Nothing is what it seems. Here, we move into the realms of the mists of time that could either reveal or conceal. Book 1, Goodbye, My Love, sets the scene. It introduces country vet, Ben, his four-year-old autistic daughter and the would-be nanny, Jessica James. Jess’ interview with Ben for the nanny position takes place on Friday the 13th. An attraction between the two is immediate, which by all accounts isn't entirely normal.  Ben's three oddball sisters-in-law descend on him for the anniversary of his wife Roxanne's death. They try to convince Ben that Roxanne isn't dead, more than likely to put an end to whatever might develop between Ben and Jessica. But Ben knows that no one could ever have survived what led to Roxanne’s death.His daughter is supposed to be autistic, but only sometimes does she display the symptoms that led to her diagnosis. As Ben has often said: Autism is not a disease, it's a condition. Symptoms can't be turned on and off at will. So…what is it with the child?Ben's wife's twin sister, Millicent, brings a psychic with her to Ben's home in order to help them find Roxanne. Only, Daemon wears dresses and a half-moon shaped earring. Who would take him seriously? Of course, his wife’s twin isn't happy to find Jess already in Ben's house—trouble is imminent. But only as far as Ethel, Ben's ancient housekeeper, will allow her to. What does the housekeeper know that will keep Millicent's ruffled feathers under control?More importantly…Where is Roxanne?Goodbye, My Love will be available on 29 May 2017.
