This third edition of Fish Nutrition is a comprehensive treatise on nutrient requirements and metabolism in major species of fish used in aquaculture or scientific experiments. It covers nutrients required and used in cold water, warm water, fresh water, and marine species for growth and reproduction. It also highlights basic physiology and biochemistry of the nutrients and applications of these principles to scientific and practical diet formulations and to manufacturing techniques for major species used worldwide in aquaculture. *Nutrient requirements for dietary formulations for fish farming*Digestive physiology*Comparative nutritional requirements of different species*Fish as unique animals for certain metabolic pathways
