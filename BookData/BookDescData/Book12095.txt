INSTANT ATTRACTION IS A POWERFUL THING.Six months of dancing around each otherled to one explosive nightand two weeks without a word.Only then did I learn the truth:The man I’d wanted since he walked into Sailor’s Grave Tattoo Parlorwas actually an undercover cop.And the worst part is,I don’t even know his real name.BUT WHAT IF ATTRACTION ISN’T ENOUGH?For over eight months I held back.Except for that one night when I couldn’t fight it anymore.I’d wanted her from the beginning,but I should have kept waiting until my secrets weren’t between us.Now, I have the ultimate challenge before me:convince the inked goddess of a receptionistto at least let me keep her safe,even if she won’t give me another chance.
