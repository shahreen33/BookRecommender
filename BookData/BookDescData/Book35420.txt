In his arms is the drowned corpse of a little child.Hours later the dead girl stirs, takes a breath and returns to life.Is it a miracle?Is it magic?Or can it be explained by science?Replete with folklore, suspense and romance, as well as with the urgent scientific curiosity of the Darwinian age, Once Upon a River is as richly atmospheric as Setterfield’s bestseller The Thirteenth Tale.
