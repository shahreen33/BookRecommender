Little Mouse decides to make a painting. But when she shows the painting to her friends, they all have their own ideas about what's in the picture-and no one will listen to what Little Mouse has to say about it! Diane Wolkstein's many-layered story celebrates the surprises of friendship and the joy of creativity-and Little Mouse's circle of friends is brought irresistibly to life in Maryjane Begins' exquisite, jewel-like illustrations. First published in 1992 to great praise and attention, this beloved story is now available in paperback for the first time.
