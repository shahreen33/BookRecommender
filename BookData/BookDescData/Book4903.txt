In the tradition of It's a Wonderful Life and moralistic tales like A Christmas Carol, the stories in HARK shine a light on a different side of this yuletide holiday.HARK’s six literary holiday tales are not for young children; they are for those contemplating more than simple sugarplum sweetness.Within Hark—A Christmas Collection, a retired police officer faces another Christmas Eve while bitter recollections haunt his every turn, a lonely woman plans to seduce Santa Claus one Christmas Eve, a widow grows anxious as she searches for a present she misplaced and intended to send to her ungrateful sister, a woman can’t keep the images of her past—these ghosts—from haunting the life she chooses to live, a young gentleman and his partner join a Christmas party in Sun Valley, Idaho and are taught a lesson most un-holidaylike, and, finally, a couple portrays Mr. & Mrs. Claus in their small island town holiday festivities and face a grim diagnosis together.Set in colorful locations around the United States, from Anacortes, Washington, to Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Sun Valley, Idaho, each tale focuses on people who struggle to make good choices, learn lessons, and maybe even find peace during the holiday season.A bonus short story, Poseidon Eyes, from Sandcastle and Other Stories, is included.
