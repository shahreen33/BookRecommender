The sexual abuse scandal has gripped the Catholic Church for the past thirty years, and continues to wreak havoc even today.  It's been a diabolical masterpiece, one that has compromised the work of the Church in every way and has left countless lives in ruin.  Many Catholics are understandably asking, â€œWhy should I stay? Why not abandon this sinking ship before it drags me or my children under?"  In this stirring manifesto, Bishop Robert Barron, founder of Word on Fire Catholic Ministries and Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, explains why this is not the time to leave, but the time to stay and fight.  Reading the current crisis through the lenses of Scripture and Church history, Bishop Barron shows that we have faced such egregious scandals before; that the spiritual treasures of the Church were preserved by holy men and women who recommitted themselves to fighting evil; and that there is a clear path forward for us today.  For Catholics questioning their faith, searching desperately for encouragement and hope, this book will offer reasons to stay and fight for the Body of Christ.
