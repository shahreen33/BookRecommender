Jes Harper loves her life. Being the production assistant for one of the most sought after producers in the music industry, Brett Winters, she gets to spend her time doing what she loves – listening to music. Working with the musicians is fun, too, but after being burned by them twice before in love, she’s sworn them off for anything more than friends. But, Brett’s best friend is back in town and perfect in every way, and he could change her mind…if she’d just let him.  Mitch Lansing has lived the musician life – the drugs, the women, the partying – but he’s over that now. At 40, you tend to want to settle down, even if you’re a musician. He’s happy to be back home with his best friend, Brett, and recording his own music. One look at Brett’s assistant and he knows he’s found the perfect woman for him…if he can just convince her of that.  When coming on strong doesn't work, Mitch decides to take it slow and vows to not give up. Day by day, piece by piece, he chips away at the wall around Jes’s heart. Can he prove to her that not all musicians are the same? Or will a ghost from his past ruin everything for them both? The other musicians from her past broke her heart...Mitch could shatter it completely.
