I was never supposed to fall in love with my stepbrother. I never intended to. It just sort of happened.----- Rule #4 â€“ You can change your mind, too, Ethan.We can't. We're done. This girl lives in the same house as me. Her bedroom is just down the hall. It barely takes twenty seconds to go from her room to mine, and yet it's an impossible distance now. She might as well be on the sun. Ashley knew what was coming. I knew, too. Why can't I stop thinking about her, then? ----- Ethan is a cocky, arrogant jerk. He's always been that way. Why do girls trip over their own feet just to be with him? I don't know! I'll never understand it. Don't they realize he's just going to ditch them after a couple of weeks? Yes, he can be nice when he wants to be. It's true that he's ridiculously attractive, too. It's not like I want to stare at him when he walks around shirtless, but it's hard not to notice someone like him. He's got that bad boy smile that makes you want to... Did I mention he's my stepbrother? Ick. What? You think I'm falling for him? Nope! It's impossible.
