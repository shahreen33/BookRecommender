Working with the FBI to capture human traffickers, Master Raoul scores an invitation to a slave auction. To his surprise, one slave is the kidnapped friend of a Shadowlands submissive. Although Kim's body is scarred, her spirit is unbroken, and he can't leave her behind. Ruining the FBI's plans, he buys her. Kimberly's freedom has come at a devastating price: the other women are still imprisoned. Desperate to help the Feds locate the traffickers, she agrees to pose as Master Raoul's slave. Although wearing a collar again is terrifying, Kim starts to heal and then to blossom under the powerful Dominant's care. "Submission." It's what she's been drawn to--and fled from--her entire life. She has escaped the slavers who captured her body. Escaping the Master who has captured her heart will be far more difficult.
