FINALIST: National Indie Excellence Awards 2019 Playful. Compelling. Deeply layered. What You Don’t See raises the stakes in friendship against the bittersweet backdrop of motherhood and the endlessly entertaining activities of well-heeled women’s groups. The story follows Livi, a spirited, outspoken PR executive, pivoting at thirty to full-time wife and mom. That goes better than imagined, until she gets entangled in a relationship with another mom. What You Don’t See—set in an affluent Southern California neighborhood and a local hangout bar on the Mississippi Gulf Coast—is anything but ordinary. There’s a talking, know-it-all cat; a large, menacing cockroach; and a host of colorful characters, stirring it up as Livi wrestles with timeless questions of truth, friendship, and free will.
