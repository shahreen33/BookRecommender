350 A.D. Ireland Twelve-year-old Robyn must decide her future at the coming of age ceremony, but choosing the right path is a challenge. Most girls in Robyn's village will choose traditional roles of healing, midwifery or farming. Others will choose to be warriors or go into Brehon law. None of these choices appeal to Robyn. Instead, she yearns for the red-hot crucibles full of molten bronze and the roaring fire of her father's foundry. But her future brother-in-law, Gilhey, her most ardent challenger at the foundry, has other plans. Will Robyn find the courage to stand up to Gilhey and become the bronze caster she longs to be?
