I always get what I want. Every time.  But not with her.  The beautiful woman my father forced on me through our billion-dollar firm has curves that make me ache.  Never in my short life did I imagine falling for her. Office romances are forbidden in my company.  But she’s a rule breaker. I guess I am too, but no one knows that side of me.  This single mother with brilliant business sense has a side hustle and still kicks ass at my firm daily.  There’s no way in hell she’s giving in. No matter what I try.  Not even when Valentine’s rolls around. And I pull out all the stops.  Her denial has me needing her like I’ve never needed anyone else.  Where this girl is concerned, I’m not asking for a friend.  I’m asking for me. For today. Tomorrow. Forever.A Single Mom BBW Romance
