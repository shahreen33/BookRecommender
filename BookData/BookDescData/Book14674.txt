Now if only the two of them can survive long enough to enjoy it.Nathan Grant doesn’t know the first thing about shifters other than he is one and should avoid all others. He’s followed that advice all of his life. Raised by humans, Nathan is more than a little uncomfortable with the idea of being around any other shifters. One spontaneous day spent running as his wolf in Lincoln National Forest forces Nathan to reconsider what little he thought he knew, and to risk his life for one very unforgettable man.Surviving isn’t easy, and Marcus is all too aware he’s only a shell of the man he used to be.
