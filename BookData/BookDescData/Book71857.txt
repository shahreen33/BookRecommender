Before the Beauty, the world was blissfully unaware...but far from innocent. Collecting issues #7-11 of the critically acclaimed series from writer/artist Jeremy Haun (Constantine, Batwoman) and co-writer Jason A. Hurley, the second volume of The Beauty introduces new characters who encounter the disease before the full truth of what it meant to contract it was known. Bringing the intriguing new cast to life are guest artists Mike Huddleston, Brett Weldele and Stephen Green, with colors by Eisner-nominated John Rauch.
