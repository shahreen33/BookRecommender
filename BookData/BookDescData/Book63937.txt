An unfiltered view of life as a big-time college and NFL player, this autobiography follows Keith Dorney, an All-American at Penn State and an All-Pro with the Detroit Lions and his views of football at the highest levels. Written without the aid of a ghostwriter, Black and Honolulu Blue articulately and candidly explores life in the trenches of college and professional football. Like Jerry Kramer and Tim Green before him—but from the unique perspective of football's most grueling position—Dorney has produced a groundbreaking work that will change the way you think about life in the NFL.
