Hallie Clarke has been through the rumor mill so many times that she barely feels the sting of the lies anymore. With her impenetrable walls steady and in place, she leaves her infamous high school days behind and sets off for University of Michigan, with only her beat up, old guitar for company. Determined not to repeat past mistakes, Hallie vows to live her life differently and free from the rumors that can destroy a person so easily. Or so she thinks. It isn’t long before she attracts the attention of her too hot to handle neighbor, Nate Harris. She tries to fight her intense attraction to him, but with his sweet words and chiseled abs, her walls of ice begin to crumble around her. Hallie soon finds herself opening up to Nate, letting him in to her world of music, and sharing secrets she swore she’d take to the grave. The hot new romance causes more than a few heads to turn on campus, and old rumors begin to surface, threatening to pull them apart. Their connection is strong, but will it be enough to hold them together when the rumors take a dangerous turn? Or will Hallie be left to fight it all alone?
