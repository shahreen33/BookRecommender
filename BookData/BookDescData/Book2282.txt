You can't keep a good man down . . . even when he's dead!Nominated for the Orange Prize for Fiction, this is a light-hearted story of friendship defying the barrier of time to share life's upheavals great and small.When an American mother and ex-journalist is overwhelmed by her new Swiss home, a visitor pops out of nowhere offering to relieve her son's asthma, her husband's distracted absence and her problems grappling with village life. Is he the village crackpot or - as he claims - the Greatest Mind of the Eighteenth Century? This talkative intruder, a skinny egotist in kneebreeches and a powdered wig, is the last straw. Though she begs him to disappear, he unpacks his moldy trunk and a lifetime of stories instead. Slowly "V." becomes her stalwart best friend as they laugh, bicker and he teaches her the best lesson of all: how to live life to its fullest."In the tradition of the best self-help novels, Voltaire teaches her how to live a happy and full life," writes Nicholas Cronk in "The Cambridge Guide to Voltaire."
