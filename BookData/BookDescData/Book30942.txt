Alaska State Trooper Alex Jensen is faced with solving the mystery of what became of pilot Norm Lewis, whose plane disappeared six months ago in the vast white wilderness. When Norm's battered plane is found, empty except for the decomposed, bullet-riddled body of an unidentified female, his wife, Rochelle, is shocked and puzzled. Norm is nowhere to be found, and Rochelle, herself a pilot, demands to be included in the search. When the body in the plane turns out to be that of a federal agent who was investigating big-game poachers, the FBI steps in. But it's Alex and Rochelle who go after the killers and put their lives on the line to discover what's behind Norm's disappearance."Twice as vivid as Michener's natural ALASKA, at about a thousandth the length."
