The end of X-Force?The secret mutant hit squad X-Force has fallen to its lowest point. Its members have sacrificed much, and two have left the team. It's a terrible time for a new, deadlier-than-ever Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to strike at X-Force's heart. This is a Brotherhood like none before. Each member, each attack, has been designed specifically to hurt X-Force in the worst way possible...by a mastermind who knows all of X-Force's weaknesses. Collecting: Uncanny X-Force 25-29
