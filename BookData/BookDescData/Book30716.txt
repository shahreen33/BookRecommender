What happens when an Irish girl from the North Country meets a Jewish guy from the Bronx? He has poured half a box of detergent into a washing machine at their NYC apartment Laundry Room. When she walks in to do her wash, the floor is covered with bubbles. She tells him, "You've put way too much soap in." And their conversation continues for 47 years. Love is sprinkled with small incidents, petty fights, heartache, loss and regret. Poet Mary Allen Sochet reaches into her own story to take us through the times before and after her husband's death.After fifty years with someone, can you possibly start all over again? Does loss overshadow all that came before? "Time Out" shows us that even the most plain ordinary moments can hold as much importance as the milestones. Loss does not mark the end of the story.
