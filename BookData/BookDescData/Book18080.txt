Sadie Smith was absolutely certain of three things: (1) ghosts were indisputably real; (2) she and her three friends were some of the best (though not the most successful) ghost hunters in Oregon; (3) her teammate Jefferson Parrish was always the scariest thing in the room. In a face-off between supernatural beings and Jefferson's Tim Burton-esque vibe there really was no contest. But ghosts—unsurprisingly—can’t help pay the rent. So when Sadie and her friends are offered an undisclosed sum of money from an anonymous client to find a link between four historical haunted locations, it’s an easy sell. During their cross-country investigation, Sadie finds herself forgetting about Jefferson’s macabre tendencies and falling for his sweetness, even if his idea of a love letter reads more like a note from a serial killer. And she can’t stop thinking about his annoyingly irresistible deep green eyes. As Sadie’s feelings get more tangled up with Jefferson, their group puts together the final pieces of a 100 year old mystery—one that will change Sadie’s life forever. Parrish is a Supernatural, Urban Fantasy, Paranormal Romance Mystery story.Praise for Parrish "Parrish is un-put-downable. I could not stop reading it. Great quirky mystery with just the right amount of romance. I can't wait for the next one in the series!" Lisa R. Harris author of The Unlikely Gift of Treasure Blume. "Parrish is the perfect blend of mystery, romance, and wit. Camp pulls you in with a-dork-able characters, spooky settings, and laugh-out-loud dialogue.
