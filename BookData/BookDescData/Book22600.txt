Gazing into the Eternal is a collection of a number of Belsebuub's key talks that provide an introduction to spiritual knowledge. It takes a clear and easy-to-understand look at some of the most profound questions we face, such as what happens when we die, is it possible to have the divine within, what are the causes of suffering, and how can spiritual realities be personally explored.Through reflections, as well as Q&A sections, Belsebuub delivers a powerful message about the potential each of us has to discover the deeper purpose of existence.From near-death experiences, to out-of-body experiences, the egos and subconscious, to finding peace within, this book gives a concise and exacting overview of the exploration of the human psyche and multidimensional reality, why the world is the way it is, why we dream, and how we can understand death while still alive.FINALIST BEST BOOK AWARDS 2009 IN SPIRITUALITY FEATURED ON THE COVER OF PUBLISHERS WEEKLY 5 STAR REVIEW IN FOREWORD MAGAZINEAbout the authorBelsebuub is the author of a number of books on spirituality, out-of-body experiences, dreams, self-discovery, and esoteric knowledge.
