Isaac Hawk’s life wasn’t going as planned. He was living in a crummy apartment with a future career that left him feeling empty inside and a love life that had him feeling even emptier. On a whim, he decides to drop out of the police academy so that he can at least try and fix one aspect of his crumbling future. The only problem with his rash decision? A negative balance in his bank account and no way to pay for rent.  Diego Cruz seemed to have things set. He was on his way to Rome so he could bring home an Olympic gold medal in gymnastics. His mind and body were honed in and focused on that one goal. He was going to make all the sacrifices in his life mean something by competing and coming out on top. He was determined to find a reason to move past the deep regret of leaving Isaac the way he had all those years ago.  When Isaac reluctantly accepts a job working as security for the American gymnastics team, he knew his path would cross with Diego’s. What he wasn’t expecting was the flood of emotions that would overpower the both of them after their chance encounter. Things are made more complicated by the obsessive behavior on display from Diego’s ex-boyfriend.  Isaac and Diego will each have to face their past and realize that sometimes you have to hold on to those second chances with an eagle grip. ________________________________ EAGLE GRIP is a hot and steamy, gay romance novel with no cliffhangers.
