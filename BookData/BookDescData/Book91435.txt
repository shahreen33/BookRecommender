Ivy Morgan is a woman on the edge … and it’s becoming more and more apparent that she is – in fact – a witch. With each new ability that sprouts up, Ivy is becoming more and more worried about what’s to come. Things only become more and more convoluted when Ivy and her fiancé Jack Harker trip (almost literally) over a missing person’s case while out hiking. When a mysterious purse shows up at a ramshackle home from an era past, they follow a young woman’s trail to her mother’s house … and find a dead body. Janice Green was a nice woman with a grown daughter who survived the embarrassment of her husband leaving her for her best friend years before. Janice’s death leaves more questions than answers, and the race is on to find her missing daughter. Ivy has her hands full when visions start popping into her head and she keeps catching sight of a woman who has no business hanging around Shadow Lake. Even though she’s afraid of what’s happening, Ivy is determined to get a handle on things … even if only because a young woman’s life hangs in the balance. Shadow Lake is a small town and some of the residents have big secrets. It’s a race against time to find a dead woman’s daughter and Ivy and Jack are going to have to work together if they plan to find the answers they so desperately need. Magic and might are about to mix, and the outcome is bound to be explosive.
