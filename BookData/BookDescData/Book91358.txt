Raven grew up tribal, and she's never forgotten it. She was sent by the grandmothers to serve those who have no tribe. To walk with the darkness. To use her Shaman Talent to balance those who walk in the light.  Which has never felt more important - because this time, the darkness comes for her friends. And for a certain golden-eyed teenager and the mother who isn't supposed to love her.  Raven has been waiting for this assignment. Expecting it. But even she wasn't expecting this.  Meet the Fixers of KarmaCorp. Their job is to work on behalf of greater good in the galaxy. Their challenge is to figure out what that means.  Shaman's Curse is the fifth book of the Fixers, an offbeat science fiction series in which nothing explodes, nobody is at war, and life gets pretty interesting anyhow. The series starts with Destinyâ€™s Song, and reading them in order is a very good idea. :)
