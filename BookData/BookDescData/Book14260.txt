Fastian was the First Minister of Estruchi. He had no living relatives or dependents, except for Meryl, the son of his house keeper, who lived in his house and served as his ward. To the outside world, his life was uncluttered and devoted to serving King Arpad of Estruchi.  King Arpad was determined to free his kingdom from servitude to neighboring Bahadi, and he charged Fastian with the task of obtaining the Light sword that he intended to use to press his claims for freedom. Fastian and his ward travelled to Bahadi to steal the Light sword, but in the course of carrying out the King’s orders, Meryl’s life was threatened. In a bid to save his ward’s life, Fastian revealed that Meryl was not a servant’s son, and that he was the custodian of an ancient legacy.
