He doesn't think a surprise pregnancy should push their relationship to move faster, but... he wouldn't mind having his man there full-time. Especially now that he's so far along and will soon have a baby to care for.A fun anniversary outing turns into a kinky show in a leather club that has to be seen to be believed. Be prepared for a side-splitting laughter and a steamy 'scene' with one completely trussed-up alpha who's at his omega's mercy.A Free Read through Insta-Freebee from August 28th to September 4th together with other authors -&gt;https://claims.instafreebie.com/gg/FC...
