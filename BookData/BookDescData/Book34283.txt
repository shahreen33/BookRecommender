AMAZON BESTSELLER "It's crazy to fall in love so fast." Vee was too sensible to believe in love at first sight. Attractive guys and great personalities were not mutually exclusive...until she met Yangbin. Maybe it was his dimples, or his broad shoulders, or maybe it was his self-confidence. Whatever it was, Yangbin stood out to Vee like no one ever had. She tried to brush him off. Forget about their one meeting and pretend she wouldn't care if she never saw him again, but when he showed up working at the hotel where Vee was spending Christmas vacation, she couldn't help but think fate had played a part. She still didn't want to believe in love, but life had other plans.
