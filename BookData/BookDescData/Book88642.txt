In the process of renovating her Queen Anne style Victorian home, author Anna Hughes decides to convert part of the attic into a quiet place to write. After seeing a stained glass window on the outside of the house that doesn’t show in the attic, it’s only natural she’d insist on knocking down a wall. Once the wall is down she discovers a room complete with furniture, a trunk full of treasures, and shadows hovering over it.
