Death is optional.  Communicating with spirits may be normal for some people, but forcing a spirit back into a body is downright creepy. Hair-raising abilities aside, bringing her boyfriend back to life doesn’t come close to crowning Jules Winklevoss the most dramatic in her family, which is prone to headline-grabbing feuds and life-or-death spectacles.

Jules and an unusual crew will need to band together if they have a shot at saving the school.
