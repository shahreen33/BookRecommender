Four stories integral to Aquaman's past! Superman guest-stars as Triton unleashes his fury against the Sea King; Aquaman must aid a young Princess Diana when she is 'chosen' by Triton; Arthur Curry takes Mera to her first encounter with air breathers; and when Aquaman's first son is born, the god Poseidon shows Aquaman who's really King of the Seas!
