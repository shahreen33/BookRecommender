I've had many love affairs in my time. As a goddess of love, it's not my way to stay chaste. There was Hephaestus, my husband. A dear man, one who may even have loved me, but not an incredibly exciting sort. There was Ares, the affair of mine the world speaks of the most. A bold, strapping man. Certainly interesting, but I doubt he ever loved anything but himself. There were the mortals, endless and fleeting, but gloriously bright in the moments of life they had. The nymphs, ever so deferential and sweet. And then there was her. Does it surprise you that one of my lovers was a woman? I am the goddess of all love, not just some. Sappho wrote of me because she had been with me. But this is not the story of Aphrodite and Sappho. This is the story of the Goddess of Love and the Goddess of the Hunt.
