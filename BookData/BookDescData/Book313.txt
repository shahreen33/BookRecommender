There's the old adage: 'Two heads are better than one'. But when it comes to lovers - it doesn't really work so well. Actually, it’s kind of creepy. Especially when the two heads belong to twin brothers. That’s one of the many dilemma’s Jillian Stone is facing in her non-existent love life. As if Jillian Stone's life didn’t just become complicated enough, considering that she’s also psychic, her seductively mysterious professor starts relentlessly and inappropriately courting her too. Raised on a deserted island for twelve years after a plane crash. Jillian Stone, AKA ‘Red’ is reunited with her twins, Alexander and Oliver Jacobs, who lived with her on the island all those years. Now twenty-two years old, these childhood friends may not stay ‘just friends’ when Red realizes these twins have returned to her life in all their gorgeous and protective alpha-male glory. Jillian, a law student, an introvert, and a closeted psychic, is torn between the sexy-bad boy Alexander, and Oliver, the loyal and dedicated confidante. And just in case there weren’t enough men in her life, Paul Black, her professor, comes along and begins relentlessly and inappropriately pursuing her. Meanwhile, her psychic visions begin to get more frequent as visions of a red-haired man begin haunting her daily. Someone closer than she knows is looking for her—and not for good reasons.  One woman, three men. Whatever happens - someone's going to lose.
