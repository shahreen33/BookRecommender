After her brother's life of crime is brought to a sudden end, twenty-two-year-old Kara Jennings fears she may be the next target of the men who killed him. It comes as a shock, however, when she is taken captive by a mysterious man who promises to keep her safe but quickly demonstrates that he will not hesitate to punish her in any way he sees fit if she disobeys him.Devin Stringer is certain there is something important that Kara is refusing to share with him--something related to her brother's death--and he is fully prepared to be as firm as necessary to get her to tell him the truth, even if that means stripping her bare, spanking her soundly, and keeping her caged like a pet.Despite her shame at being made to kneel naked at her captor's feet, eat from his hand, and surrender her body to him completely, Devin's dominance leaves Kara helplessly aroused and yearning for him to master her even more thoroughly. When he brings her to the edge of an intense climax only to leave her desperate and wanting, her need for him to claim her properly compels Kara to confess the secret her brother shared with her before his death. But will that information help Devin protect his beautiful pet or will it ultimately put her in greater danger?Publisher's Note: Protecting His Pet is a stand-alone book which is the first entry in the Owned and Protected series.
