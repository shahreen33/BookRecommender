The much-awaited third installment in Riad Sattouf's graphic memoir--which has been translated into fifteen languages and become an international phenomenonThe Arab of the Future is the widely acclaimed, internationally bestselling graphic memoir that tells the story of Riad Sattouf's peripatetic childhood in the Middle East. In the first volume, which covers the years 1978-1984, his family moves between rural France, Libya, and Syria, where they eventually settle in his father's native village of Ter Maaleh, near Homs. The second volume recounts young Riad's first year attending school in Syria (1984-1985), where he dedicates himself to becoming a true Syrian in the country of Hafez al-Assad. In this third volume, (1985-1987), Riad's mother, fed up with the grinding reality of daily life in the village, decides she cannot take it any longer. When she resolves to move back France, young Riad sees his father torn between his wife's aspirations and the weight of family traditions.
