Now a Top Twenty Amazon Bestseller.  From USA Today Bestseller Ava Harrison, comes a sexy new STANDALONE romance.  I was done with love. When I opened my heart, it was for the men I couldn't have. The unattainable ones. The ones who would hurt me. A vicious cycle I couldn’t seem to stop. But I had a new resolve. Focus on my career. Stay single. And then I met him. Jace Montgomery. A wounded widower with two young kids. He was exactly everything I was avoiding. So I did my best to stay away. But then he kissed me. And I fell. Hard. Hard for a man who would never be mine… A man who was broken beyond repair. A man who would break me.
