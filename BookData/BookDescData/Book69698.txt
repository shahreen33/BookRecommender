Seasons of Betrayal, Book 2Blood always leaves the brightest stains where the snow falls.  Fresh out of lockup, Kazimir Markovic is focused on two things only—having Violet Gallucci back at his side, and putting his father in the ground. With his plans already in motion the very second he’s free, Kaz goes after what’s most important. Violet first. Vasily second.   The Russians are out for blood.    The Italians want their blood back.   It’s only a matter of time before someone comes for Kaz and Violet—hiding was never in their plans. And they’ve been waiting for this …  The game they’re playing is dangerous.  Someone always has to lose.  From authors London Miller (Den of Mercenaries) and Bethany-Kris (The Chicago War) comes the second installment in the Seasons of Betrayal series that has readers calling it “A modern day Romeo and Juliet.”
