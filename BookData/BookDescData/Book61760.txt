Ten years. Ten endless years I've waited to destroy the man who tore my family apart. But I never thought I'd get the chance... until his daughter walked into my tattoo parlour, looked me in the eye â€” and had no damned clue who I was.I never planned on falling for Cassandra Deighton. She's silk scarves and manicures. I'm scars and rage. Yet I can't resist when she begs for more, my ice queen who burns with enough heat to sear the soul.I need to end this. Before she finds out who I am. Before she gets hurt.But I'm not the only one with secrets. We both have our scars, and if the truth comes out, we could lose everything...
