Michael Storrings, the illustrator and creator of widely collected city-themed Christmas tree ornaments, brings to life only-in-New-York events that mark the four seasons, as well as the subtle changes in textures and colors, that each different season brings to favorite spots in the city. Storrings's delightful watercolors capture the energy and excitement of unique New York City events, including the Easter Parade, the Macy's Fourth of July Fireworks, the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade, and New Year's Eve in Times Square. He also turns his attention to beloved and well-visited spots such as Central Park, the High Line, Museum Mile, and the beach at Coney Island, presenting these and other landmarks as they change with the seasons. And, each gorgeous illustration is accompanied by a richly entertaining description of the place or the event. An elegant and delightful keepsake, New York in Four Seasons is sure to please fans of Michael Storrings and makes a perfect gift for anyone who's fallen in love with New York City.
