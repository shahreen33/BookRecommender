Seven queer fantasy shorts set in the tropical Jewish world of the Mangoverse novels. "Your Name is Love" An energetic royal guard takes her artist wife on a scavenger hunt around the city so she can stop having artist's block about the lesbian graphic novel she's supposed to make for the queen. "No Whining" Trans woman Chef Yael dithers over whether to switch wine sellers, at the urging of her husband Aaron, when her regular vendor is incompetent but the delivery girl is a trusted ally. "Every Us" A prince with anxiety is comforted in the arms of his partner when he wakes up from a nightmare. "Take Time to Stop and Eat the Roses" A trans teenager and his girlfriend go on a midnight quest for flowers for her sister's wedding. "The Generous Princess" A royal family with two moms and two dads puts their own special twist on celebrating Purim. And now, bundled with Tales from Outer Lands, two contrasting stories of heroic Jewish womanhood: "Rivka in Port Saltspray" Trapped in a seedy port town because an innkeeper is holding her shapeshifting dragon-horse hostage until she can pay all the charges he invented, nomadic warrior Rivka finally has a chance at some decent money when a wealthy but weak man hires her to rescue his fiancee. But she has to think on her feet when she learns there may be more at stake. "Aviva and the Aliens" On the night before the royal Passover seder, Aviva has to outsmart the aliens who abducted her to cook for them because they had grown sick of their spaceship's food replicators. Will she get home before Queen Shulamit wakes up and panics from her absence?"
