Venice is timeless. Venice is changing. Venice inspires and seduces and stimulates. We call ourselves Venetophiles, and we're addicted to this beautiful and ancient city in the middle of a lagoon. Editor Kathleen Gonzalez has collected memories, adventures, and dreams here in this new collection of stories from 32 contributors: novelists, bloggers, musicians, photographers, chefs, tour guides, historians, and more. You can read about childhood memories when Monica arrived in Venice on the back of a Vespa or Marco escaped an angry vendor by hiding in a church. Join Laura as she views traditional glassblowers or Katia who visits a boat full of books. Roger imagines interviewing Attila the Hun, while Cecelia tells of being caught in a torrential summer storm. You can see Venice as it awakens by walking with Philip on his way to work or be introduced to past Venetians by Judith. Iris sneaks us into a hidden garden her grandmother tends, and Greg reveals his gondola rowing episode that ended up in a dip in the canal. A spritz is a quintessential Venetian drink: Bitter but sparkling, you're left wondering why you want another and another. They're addictive, just like this watery city. Why is the first one free? Why, to get you addicted, of course! Venice tempts us in dozens of ways, revealed in these many chapters. Journey with us to Venice for free!
