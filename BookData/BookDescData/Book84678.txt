From featured “next-generation thought leader” on Oprah Winfrey’s Super Soul 100 and #1 New York Times bestselling author Gabrielle Bernstein comes a clear, proactive, step-by-step program to rid yourself of the tendency to judge yourself and others, and find your way back to true healing and oneness.Judgment—both being judged and judging others—is the core of our discomfort. While it’s powerful, judgment isn’t complicated. It’s simply the separation from oneness. The moment we see ourselves as separate we detour into a false belief system that is out of alignment with our true nature. That separation, often a reflection of our own insecurities projected onto others, keeps us feeling alienated and alone. The Judgment Detox is an interactive process that calls on spiritual principles from the text A Course in Miracles, Kundalini yoga, meditation, EFT, and metaphysical teachings, allowing us to release the beliefs that hold us back from living a better life. Gabby has demystified these principles to make them easy to apply and commit to. The six steps include: -Witness your judgment without judgment -Honor the wound -Put love on the alter -See for the first time -Cut the cords -Bring your shadows to light This step-by-step process offers a path to true healing, oneness, and a deeper connection to the universe and those around us.
