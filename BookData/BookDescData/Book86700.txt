Rabbit Black - a freelancer who makes a living solving other people's problems - unexpectedly finds himself murdered but not dead. This unusual state is likely thanks to two facts: 1. magic, like heat, rises and 2. the necromancer in the unit below is terrible at wards.Tied to said necromancer by the same magic that's keeping him alive(ish,) Rabbit has no choice but to drag Ira Smith around with him as he solves his final problem: who killed Rabbit Black?
