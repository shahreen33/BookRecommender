SEDUCED BY PAINAt night I’m June, the perfect picture of dominance, delving out seduction only some can handle. I drown out my clients pleads, and push down my own craving for the hot, searing blow of the cane. I loathe this part of who I am, of who I must be, but there’s no escaping it. I know I need her, but I can’t help wanting June dead.By day, I’m Alex Ryan, the good, successful Southern woman everyone thinks I should be. I’ve compartmentalized my life to make it bearable, and to get what I want most: revenge. I can have a future June dead, as soon as I confront the man that terrorized my past.SAVED BY SINCade Brannon is the local gun for hire, part of the seedy underworld of Dallas, but he may also be my savior. I want his help and he wants me. It’s a deal with the devil I’ll take, but Cade refuses to play by my rules. He’s forcing his way into every one of those compartments that I want to lock away. Now the parts of my life I’ve fought so hard to keep separate are bleeding together, and it’s tearing me apart.I just want to go back to being Alex. But at what cost am I willing to kill June?
