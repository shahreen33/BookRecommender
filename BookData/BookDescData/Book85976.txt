My O is missing. Two sex therapists are going to help me find it.Two hours after Dennis proposes, I find my fiancé with his d*ck buried in Tiffany Slater’s hoohah, and he has the nerve to suggest it’s my fault.Because I’m frigid.Sure, I’ve never had an orgasm with him, or with anyone for that matter, but relationships are about more than good sex. (Not that the sex was ever good. Adequate is more like it. Okay, who am I kidding? Dennis couldn’t find his way down there with a flashlight and a map.)Now I’m determined to find my missing O with the help of two of the hottest men I’ve ever set eyes on. Sex therapists Benjamin Long and Landon West. If these two men can’t make me come, then no one can.I shouldn’t have slept with them. I shouldn’t have succumbed to their sexy smiles. I shouldn’t have listened when their firm voices promised me all the pleasure I could handle.I can’t get enough of them. But when a bitter rival finds out about our forbidden threesome, everything will come crashing down.
