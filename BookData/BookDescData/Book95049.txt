Decoding Persistent Depression is the first book in a series which investigates long-term depression. This text is based on and expands previous work and explores a condition known by its various aliases: dysthymia, persistent depressive disorder, neurotic depression, dysthymic depression, and chronic depression. With playful, encouraging dialogue and examples, it comfortably exists between popular psychology and graduate-level books. While not a step-by-step self-help manual, the presented information can assist in developing understanding for symptomatic persons, as well as educators, friends, family, and healthcare providers.Clues along the way will help you eliminate distracting, contradictory, misleading, and countertherapeutic concepts. As you gather illuminating evidence, you’ll be better able to comprehend and resolve an intriguing – and seemingly impenetrable – mystery, with all the usual suspects (and perhaps a few surprises): How can depression arise and why might it persist?
