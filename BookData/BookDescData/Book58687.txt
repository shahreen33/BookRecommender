I lost my virginity at age thirteen. I know what you're thinking, and the answer is no. I wasn't raped or molested. Nothing horrible happened to me. I don't have a daddy complex, or a shit life that I need to be rescued from. I just happen to like boys...a lot. I like them all. Tall, short, skinny, buff, light hair, or dark, I don't discriminate.I realized early on that one man wasn't enough for me. It's a simple mathematical fact. Why have one man when you can have two? Any more than two gets complicated. Hell, half the time even two gets complicated. But itâ€™s worth it. Sometimes every woman has to make an exception though, two crappy losers or one smoking hot man. The night I laid eyes on Hunter Coy, I made my choice. At least until he introduced me to Mason Wynn.
