An entertaining and moving tribute to big brothers by the author/illustrator of Meet Me at the Moon and Following Papa's Song.Continuing her picture book stories about family relationships, Gianna Marino introduces Little Giraffe, who adores her big brother. Set in a stunning African landscape, the story begins with a game of hide-and-seek as Little Giraffe looks for her big brother, who's just out of her sight, but always safely nearby. As she asks the many animals she encounters on her search if they've seen him, it's evident how much she admires him. He's taller and faster and braver than her, she tells them. But as the search continues, the other animals insist that Little Giraffe is tall, and fast, and brave, too . . . and best of all, she has a wonderful older brother who looks out for her!
