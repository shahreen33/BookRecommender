Ever since Antonio began working as a dancer at Frank’s club, he’s been trying to get Frank’s attention. To others, Frank might not be the ultimate catch, but to Antonio, he’s the man of his dreams. The problem is, Frank has already turned Antonio down out of fear for Antonio’s safety following an abduction and near-death experience. But Antonio is not ready to give up. He is determined to win him over on Valentine’s Day, no matter what he has to do. Even if it requires some unusual help from his friends, Felix and Lane. Nothing is too far for Antonio, not even a botched kidnapping.  Dancing in Darkness is a 20k-word novella featuring true love, abductions gone wrong, and a family that may be a bit too extreme.  This novella takes place after the events of In Darkness 3.
