We were friends, then we were nothing.  Loved. Protected. Cherished. There was a time when Ranieri Andretti made me feel those things. That was before his family came after mine.  He was supposed to forget me. We went our separate ways. It should have stayed like that. But now he’s back, and he’s my new boss.  I want to hate him. He’s my ex-best friend. My tormentor. The head of the Andretti family. But no matter how hard I try, I can’t stay away.
