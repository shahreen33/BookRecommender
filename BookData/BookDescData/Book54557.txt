Excellent book with a new kind of plot and well written dialogues that make the action very fluid. I highly recommend this book!★★★★★ ReviewFrom the very start, this book pulled me in and kept my attention. It really makes you think and wonder what happens when we die. I appreciated the full descriptions of Noah, the professors, demons and other characters in this story. I could visualize what was happening while reading. It is certainly a different way to look at death and souls. Well written and one of the more interesting books I've read yet. ★★★★★ Review
