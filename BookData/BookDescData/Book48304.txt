Luca Bianco is a jerk. There I said it.He thinks he’s so suave and sexy, walking around in his paramedic uniform stretched out by all his hard muscles and saving lives every day. I swear he thinks every woman in the world would kill for a chance to be with him.Men like Luca are good for one thing only—a one-night stand—not commitment. I don’t care if my friend did pay good money at a charity bachelor auction for me to go on a date with him, I refuse to do it.That is until Luca offers me a deal I can’t refuse, and I agree to be his pretend fiancé.The heat that’s simmered between us for a decade ignites and I’m not sure even Luca will be able to kickstart my heart after I call code blue.What’s that saying? Love is blind?Not true. I can see this head-on collision coming a mile away.
