A fatal night... College co-ed Arielle Lloyd is on vacation with her immortal love, Sebastian Gaulle, when they receive word of a dreadful accident. Her dear friend Gabrielle hovers near death. But it's much worse for her beloved friends, Eva and Ian. In spite of Eva's magical abilities, their lives are cut tragically short, leaving Troy the lone survivor. An immortal choice... Troy Vasser's only love is Gabrielle, but on the night of the accident, his deepest concern is for their dying friends. When the life force within Ian and Eva flickered dangerously low, Troy was forced to make a hard choice. He could either let them die, or take away their humanity and make them live as immortals. He did the only thing he could: he gave them immortality. Now it is up to Arielle to break the news to Eva before the transformation is complete. A quest for vengeance... Danger continues to stalk Arielle's life. Unbeknownst to her, her new professor is an immortal, and he is furious when he discovers that Arielle is wearing an amulet that should only be owned by immortals. Sebastian's nemesis, Annabel, is still pursuing her quest to destroy Arielle. But what Annabel doesn't realize is that Arielle's circle of friends has drastically changed. There are two newly minted immortals that adore her and have vowed to protect her.
