   Fortune favors the wicked. 
 That’s certainly the case here at Everafter Academy. From the outside, everything is picture-perfect. But behind those walls are sinister secrets, and I’m here to expose every last one of them.  Too bad I’m the biggest secret of all.  So hiding my Darkblood identity should be my main concern.  It's not.  Students from our rival school, Nevermore Academy, have come to celebrate the Festival of Light. Accompanying them is my covenmaster, Cassim, who’s here to remind me of the sins I committed.  Of the deaths I'm to blame for.  Once I find the wolves responsible for killing my loved ones, I will accept my punishment. I will even spend eternity at my Dark Lord's side. A deal’s a deal after all. But first I need to survive this stupid festival without hexing anyone. I also need to solve the mystery regarding my ancestor Esmerelda, find a hidden princess, and totally not fall head over heels for my headmaster's utter depravity.  With new adventures, rivals, and secrets at every turn, my time at this academy is proving to be one heaven of a challenge.  And it’s only my second week.  Everafter Academy is a Dark Reverse Harem Bully Romance. Each fairytale creature has been modernized and thrown into a world of magic, depravity, and allure, and Ravyn will never choose which path—or man—she truly wants. Why choose when she can have them all?
