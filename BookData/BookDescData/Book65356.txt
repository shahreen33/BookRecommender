Yet what un-folds for Lark in the coming days is a dark and twisting mystery into the sinister circumstances of that awful day so long ago. Lark's desperate search for the truth reveals secrets that are about to put her life in great peril. "I was so interested in what happens with Lark I couldn't put it down. It's an awe-some book-a fun read. Intrigue, humor, emotion-what more do you need?" Carol Costello, Anchor, CNN Daybreak "Fast Track is a page-turning thriller that you simply won't be able to put down from start to finish. The suspense is palpable, the characters unforgettable and spectacu-lar, the plot ingenious and masterfully crafted." Barbara Casey, Author, The Coach's Wife "I've known John DeDakis as a dedicated and skilled journalist since 1975 when I was a White House reporter for United Press International. Now, as a journalism pro-fessor, I appreciate all the more John's commitment to bringing to life ethical journalism and mentoring relationships. He knows about the roller-coaster of life's experiences and he demonstrates that in Fast Track. IT'S A MUST READ." Wesley G. Pippert, Director, Washington Program University of Missouri School of Journalism "I love the story. John DeDakis' debut novel, Fast Track is such a well-woven tale, it will leave you wanting to stay up all night until you finish. The plot and scenes are rich in detail; and the characters intensely-memorable. This story will stick with you and you will want to read it again just to be sure you caught every nuance of this fine writer's wordsmithing."Lisa Adams, Author, Bound Justice
