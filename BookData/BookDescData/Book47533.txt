Max Horton They call me an outcast like it's a bad thing.An asshole byproduct of a shitty upbringing. I don't care about anything except myself and my little sister. I will always protect what’s mine.With one year left on my hockey contract I'm keeping my head down and my eyes on the goal.A collision, with her, changes my entire existence.Allison Grant Never fall in love with a sports star. That's what my stepfather always said. He told me athletes are complicated and moody—that the higher their paycheck, the lower their morals.As public relations for the New York Stingers I know exactly what he means, but I can’t seem to say no to a friendship with one beautiful, damaged man.What started out as hate turned into something else. We tried to stay away, to keep our distance, but the pull was too strong.Something forbidden turned into something so irresistible.
