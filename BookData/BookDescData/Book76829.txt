If you think you know me, you're dead wrong. Yes, I'm driven and calculating and my colleagues see me as a cold, workaholic who has stopped at nothing to create the top fashion magazine in Southern California. But working my ass off isn't the only reason I got there. And those little indiscretions used to be content hiding in the back of the closet. Then Guy Walker enters my office. Sexy, sweet, and super popular, the new tech guy is taking our office by storm. Sure, I notice him. But I won't risk him derailing every strategy I have in place. If he gets too close, he might discover my secrets, and that could ruin my career and turn my life upside down.This hilarious chick lit book will pull you into its world and leave you loving its fun, witty characters.Other books by Lia FairchildBestseller, Circle in the SandBestseller, In Search of LucyVigilAnnieA Hint of MurderSpecial DeliveryHome for ChristmasHigh Maintenance (Nighttides Anthology)
