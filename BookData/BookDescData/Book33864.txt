My name is Kiev Novalic. I am a vampire, and a murderer.Having betrayed the trust of my own kind and that of the enemies I sold myself to, I have three days left to live. I stare at the girl in the cell opposite mine. Mona, she calls herself. A witch born without magic.She might be my key to freedom, but I should know to stay away. I should know: some scars are etched too deep to heal.
