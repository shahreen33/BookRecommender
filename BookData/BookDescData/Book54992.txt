1869, Sutherland, Scotland For years the people of this remote community have been abused and mistreated. At the beginning of the century the Countess of Sutherland cleared fifteen thousand people off the land to make way for her own estate. They were moved to the towns of Brora and Helmsdale, shoved down the mines, and put to work in the quarries and the lime kilns. But just as they were getting settled, the people of Brora once more had everything taken away from them. In 1828 the mines were closed, and the population left destitute. But now, a local gold rush has attracted the Pan-European Mining Company of Lundt and McCleery’s back to the area, and Solveig McCleery is determined to get the Brora mines reopened, and give the population back everything they were robbed of forty years ago. But when work starts on reopening the Brora mines, a body of a prospector is found tied up in a sack. And inscriptions are found on stones near the corpse. And before the meaning of these strange marks can be deciphered, another body is found. Are these attacks connected to the re-opening of the Brora mine? Will Solveig’s plan bring peace and prosperity to the people of Sutherland? Or has she started something much more sinister…? ‘Deadly Prospects’ is a well-researched and satisfying mystery story that explores the rich history and heritage of the Scottish Highlands.
