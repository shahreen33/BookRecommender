Thirteen-year-old Anne Frank, with her parents and sister and four other people, went into hiding in the sealed-off back rooms of an Amsterdam office building in 1942, when the Nazi invaders intensified their persecution of Jews.For two years they remained safe. In August 1944 they were betrayed, Anne died in the ghastly concentration camp at Belsen. All the others perished too, except her father. Anne's astonishingly intimate diary was found by accident. With a touch of genius it records the strains of her unusual life, the problems of her unfolding womanhood, her falling in love, her unswerving faith in her religion. And it reveals the shining nobility of her spirit.Now known and loved the world over through State, Screen and TV adaptations or in translation, this touchingly human document remains timeless in its appeal--back cover
