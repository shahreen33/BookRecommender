War is violent, aggressive, destructive. The same could be said about my mind in the aftermath. Love is affection, tenderness, and warmth. Words that no longer reside within me. She promised to love me forever. I promised her the same. But forever no longer exists, it died alongside any goodness in my soul a long time ago. I’m broken, I’m empty and she’s nothing but a painful reminder of what I’ve lost. She promised to love me forever and she failed.
