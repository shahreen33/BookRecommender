Do you want to be able to listen without thinking the whole time of what you’re going to say next? Do you want to feel less distracted, less busy, and more whole?

We lack space between one task and the next, one thought and the next, one email and the next. Social media, TV, work deadlines, and family stress steal our enjoyment and engagement in the moment.Holy Noticing will teach you how to:become more aware of your thoughts, emotions, and environmentrecognize Christ’s presence in the momentreduce your stress by developing the ability to focus on God and people rather than tasksMany today think mindfulness is dangerous, unchristian, or associated with Eastern religions—and often it is!
