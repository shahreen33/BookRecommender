THE RHAPSODY OF THE ANT WOMAN is a collection of selected poems weaved together into one poem, mainly expounding esoteric teachings. The first-person narrative of the ant woman represents the human soul who awakens from the state of torpor and then takes on a journey of passing beyond the deserts of the self. Many of its parts propound the doctrine that the awakened soul, through experience of overwhelming love alone, can progress along a path, which can ultimately lead to re-absorption into the absolute reality. Other parts, while transforming belief or dream visions into poetry, imply a certain expatriation of mind, engrossment with life and spirit of another than oneself. Yet others are considerably mixed with extraneous matter of the world presenting a panorama of contemporary society. Each chapter of the poem has alongside a corresponding art work drawing in a symbolical framework complementing the poetical imagery.
