Growing up in a small village in Wales with a domineering homophobic father, Oscar has always believed he has to hide his real feelings. He's hidden his heart from everyone, but most of all from his best friend, Jamie--who also happens to be the boy he's in love with. But when a film Oscar makes about love and acceptance is chosen to be in the finals of a national competition, everything he's hidden about himself threatens to be revealed. Now Oscar thinks he must make the choice between the life he knows and the people he loves, and the life he wishes he had. But life holds far more secrets and promises than Oscar expects.
