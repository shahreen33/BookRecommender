Before Luke met Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine, the closest thing Han Solo and Chewbacca came to galactic politics was a few choice maneuvers around imperial blockades. Instead their lives were spent rambling through the Outer Rim, flying fast, and taking quick jobs to get from place to place--with a few close calls along the way. This new series follows Han and Chewie thoughout time in fully illustrated, easy-to-read, lighthearted adventures, created especially with young readers in mind.
