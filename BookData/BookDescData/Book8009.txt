In October Breezes, Devin Abbott almost lost the one person who mattered most-Skye Williams. Following a rape and an abortion she'd never counted on, she'd believed suicide the only answer, yet Devin saved her, leaving them both struggling to make sense of a future that included Skye and Devin separating for college. Sometimes, however, the past refuses to leave.After college, the two return home to face fears time has only deepened. For Devin, that fear comes in the form of living without Skye, the one woman he's always loved. Skye yet feels the tremors of her abortion-tremors which have convinced her she's unlovable. Time and again, she rejects him, leaving them both hurt, but inasmuch as Skye cannot see beyond her choice and Devin cannot shake his fear, neither anticipates how the past will shape them and how much power love yet has.
