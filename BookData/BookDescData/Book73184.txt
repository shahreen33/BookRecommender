Thermostat Cultures is a must-read for anyone leading a group of any kind or for someone who desires to be a compelling participant on a high-performing team. Every human being on the planet is a part of a team of some kind. A team at work. A team at home. A team at school. A team at your church or the community organization that you are passionate about. Or literally, a team that is competing together on some playing field somewhere. Why do some teams with similar talent levels succeed and others simply maintain? Why are some families more connected while others are pulling in opposite directions? Why do some teachers have thriving classrooms and others do not? Why do some companies expand with excitement and others limp along? CULTURE. The best leaders and groups of any kind engage the minds and hearts of their people and proactively shape the culture for HOW they move, together. Thermostat Cultures is about the proactive process the best leaders and teams lead in order to inspire and engage the people around them. What temperature will you set with the people in your life and career?
