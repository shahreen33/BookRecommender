Have you ever set out to have a one night stand with a sexy stranger?No? I’m the only one?Just kidding, I would never. Ever.Not usually.  But then I figured, why not? My entire life I’ve been good and it’s gotten me nowhere.No job. No apartment. No boyfriend.  I’m owed a little fun, aren’t I? A reward for being good.Sure, a new pair of shoes would be more appropriate, but Mr. Sexy Stranger is more appealing. And when he speaks—in that British accent—it’s a done deal.

I haven't taken a poll or anything, but I’m pretty sure it’s a fact.  Except… You know that saying about best-laid plans? Good, because I don’t either, but I assume they go awry.Like my one night stand…
