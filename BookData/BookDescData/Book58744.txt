EVE  What’s the most selfless thing you’ve ever done? What price tag would you put on the ability to save the ones you love?  They say the worst decisions are made by the desperate or the fools.  I was desperate enough to make a foolish decision to save my family. The cost? Me.  They may be a motorcycle club, but in all honesty they’re really an elite unit of criminals who just happen to drive motorcycles. They’re a business. An organization. A fully functioning army…  What I’ve learned? They work in the gray area; life and death is real; and everyone wants everyone dead. Okay, so maybe that’s dramatic… No. No it’s not. It’s legit.  I prepared for the worst, fully anticipating hating my new life. Turns out, I finally found out where I belonged. Oh, and I discovered I’m a little twisted or crazy. Maybe both.  Drex Caine, the man without a conscience, didn’t ruin me the way I thought he would. Instead, he made me feel like I was living instead of just waiting to live. And I can never go back to the way things used to be.  *Graphic Language*Sexual Content *Dual POV Please note: Book 1 does end on a cliffhanger, but book 2 has the conclusion and will be released March 28, 2016.
