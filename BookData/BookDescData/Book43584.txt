This anthology contains a number of fine stories, virtually a given with a volume of Hugo winners. Included are the honored tales from 1980, '81 and '82, among them two each by Gordon R. Dickson and George R. R. Martin, and one each by Barry Longyear, Clifford D. Simak, Poul Anderson, Roger Zelazny and John Varley...Particularly fine are Varley's little shocker "The Pusher, " which considers the dilemma of the astronaut, who ages slowy during space travel, in creating a long-term relationship with an Earth-bound lover; Longyear's "Enemy Mine", which casts an Earthman and an alien into a hostile environment and traces their relationship from antagonism through mutual dependence...."
