 My best friend’s sister was off limits;  until the day she sauntered into my classroom.  She’s looking to perfect her candy making skills.  I’m looking to teach her all the best ways to use chocolate, none of which include how to properly line a candy mold.  She’ll discover what it really means to temper chocolate when I stir her up and light her body on fire.  She’s doesn’t know it, but she was mine the moment she set foot in my kitchen.
