Chocolate, vanilla, existential horror, addiction, musical fantasy...there’s a flavor for everyone’s misery.ICE CREAM MAN is a genre-defying comic book series, featuring disparate “one-shot” tales of sorrow, wonder, and redemption. Each installment features its own cast of strange characters, dealing with their own special sundae of suffering. And on the periphery of all of them, like the twinkly music of his colorful truck, is the Ice Cream Man—a weaver of stories, a purveyor of sweet treats. Friend. Foe. God. Demon. The man who with a snap of his fingers—lickety split!—can change the course of your life forever.Written by W. MAXWELL PRINCE (ONE WEEK IN THE LIBRARY), with art by MARTíN MORAZZO (SNOWFALL, GREAT PACIFIC).Collects issues 1-4.
