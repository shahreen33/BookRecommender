The Troy of myth was a real city. This is its story…Hektor’s life of privilege is forever changed when a man, allegedly possessed by the sun god, inspires revolution among the oppressed townspeople of Wilusa – the historical Troy of myth. For Hektor, son of Bronze Age Wilusa’s despotic ruler, social equality contradicts every principle he has been indoctrinated into believing. But his principles and obsession with duty is alienating him from his young son, Hapi, with whom he has a fractured relationship. When the ‘possessed’ man saves Hapi’s life, Hektor is compelled to question the foundations upon which his father has constructed his life as he rebuilds his relationship with his child through the breaking of a foal. Wilusa collapses into political violence as the commoners rise up, and Hektor must decide whether to defend the people, but lose his identity, or remain loyal to an irrational, dangerous father. Breaking the Foals is a breathless gallop through an ancient world carved out by tradition, stained with blood and immortalised in the lives of heroes and villains.
