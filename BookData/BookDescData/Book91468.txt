Water witch Evian Brooks has plenty of problems — and a margarita-loving toad is the least of them. Her scooter is on the fritz, her radio show has three listeners per week (including her mother) and there’s a beauty pageant in town threatening to kill her with boredom. However, the promise of death becomes all too real when Evian finds herself accidentally off-roading into a crime scene where Marilyn Johnson — famed beauty queen — is dead in the water.  When Marilyn’s death is ruled a homicide, Evian starts asking questions. After all, if she can’t drive ratings for her show, she’ll be next on the chopping block. Meanwhile, the medical examiner is covering up evidence, the beauty contestants are brimming with secrets and a slew of wannabe karaoke stars are lying through their vocal cords.  Evian’s not sure who to trust, but with grudging help from her toad and annoying input from a coven of elders, she’s determined to unmask Eternal Springs’s murderer — before she’s next.  This book can be read as a standalone. It is book 4 in a 4 book series.  For more information on the author, please visit ginalamanna.com.
