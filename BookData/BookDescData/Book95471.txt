Continuing the saga that began in EARTH 2, writer Daniel H. Wilson (EARTH 2: WORLD’S END) and artists Jorge Jimenez (SUPERBOY) and Alisson Borges (LOBO) start civilization from scratch in EARTH 2: SOCIETY VOL. 1: PLANETFALL!  A year has passed since Earth-2 was destroyed by the armies of Apokolips. The survivors of the catastrophic tragedy have now made planetfall on a new world, and, with the help of heroes old and new, built a home. But some threats can survive even Apokolips. New super-villains have arisen to capitalize on the confusion, even as heroes like Batman, Power Girl, Superman, Green Lantern and The Flash struggle to find their place on an unfamiliar world. And unknown to all, Terry Sloan has developed technology with the power to change everything. Some will want to use his Genesis Machine to re-make this planet into an exact copy of the Earth they left behind; others, to build a brand new society, free from the mistakes of the past. Who wins this debate will determine the course of a civilization, but one thing is certain: in the wrong hands, this device has the power to destroy the last hope of a people who thought they’d already lost everything. Collects issues #1-7 and DC SNEAK PEEK: EARTH 2: SOCIETY #1.
