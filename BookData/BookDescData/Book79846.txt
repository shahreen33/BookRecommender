Felipe and Claudette are the only animals left at the pet shelter. Who would ever adopt pets like them?Each adoption day, all of the pets at Mrs. Barrett's adoption shelter are sure to look their best. And each adoption day, all of the pets are adopted, except for two -- Felipe (a grumpy cat) and Claudette (a rambunctious dog). Felipe is always grumbling. He is sure they are not being adopted because of Claudette. Claudette is messy and noisy and always has food on her nose and mud on her fur. They will never find a forever home when Claudette is always making such a bad impression. But then, one of the two friends is adopted and taken to a new home. When they are apart, Felipe is no longer quite so talkative. And Claudette doesn't bark or chew or play in circles. Could Felipe and Claudette actually miss each other? The latest picture book from the bestselling author-illustrator Mark Teague, this funny story teaches kids that sometimes friends are right beside you the whole time -- and home is closer than you think.
