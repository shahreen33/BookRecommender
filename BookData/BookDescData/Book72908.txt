Caleb Samuels.Smug. Irritating. Pain in the … After high school, I was content with the idea of never seeing him again.But as his sister Merilyn’s best friend, it was bound to happen eventually. I just didn’t expect it to be at her wake, where, following a foolish, naive, and completely ridiculous incident, I’m prepared to return to my perfectly routine life and wash my hands of him forever. Again. Unfortunately, Merilyn had other plans.Even though she traveled the world, her final request is for Caleb and me to recreate our senior year bucket list and take her ashes along for one last adventure.All the foolish, naive, and—you guessed it—completely ridiculous memories return in an instant.He tormented me, teased me, kissed me like no one ever had, made me fall for him, and broke me like no one else ever would.Reliving it all might end with a crash worse than the first.Or maybe not. Maybe the fall would never end.*New Adult *Second Chance*Best Friend's Brother
