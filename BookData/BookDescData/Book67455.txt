Hunting monsters is my job. Toying with them is just a bonus. Too bad it always ends with them dead. But when I find four men at my door wanting to kill me for crimes against innocents, my whole world is flipped on its head. Four hot supes? Check. Life taking an interesting turn? Duh. Throw it all in a blender? Why not? Weâ€™re all drawn together in one big whirlwind of a mess. Lies are revealed, truths discovered, and my life will never be the same. This huntress is about to become the hunted, and these four strangers are my new lifeline. Just dandy. Welcome to the Institute of Supernaturals.  ***Please note this is a RH, fast-burn.***
