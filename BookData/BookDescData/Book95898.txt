Do you want to live forever? Ben Ferguson-Cripps is a struggling writer with a surname that gets more comments than his waning blog. In desperation Ben sets aside his literary ambitions to join the newly established and enigmatic Life Assistance Agency. The agency's first case is to trace a missing person with links to the Elizabethan angel-caller Dr John Dee. Pursued by a shadowy organisation - and the ghosts of Ben's past - the trail leads them on a white-knuckle ride through Europe into the historic streets of Prague. As forces meet in a deadly climax, the long-buried secrets of Dr Dee's achievements are finally revealed...and Ben will discover there is always more to life.
