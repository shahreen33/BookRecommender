It has since been republished several times, including in Beyond Lies the Wub in 1988, and in 2003 in Paycheck.The plot centers around a group of toys who plan on taking over the world, but are having trouble with adults, so they mainly focus on children.

However, the boy's current toys, led by a teddy bear and a rabbit, spoil The Lord's plan, and it's revealed that the teddy bear and the Boy's current toys have destroyed several robots like The Lord, who were sent from "The Factory", to take over their child owners.
