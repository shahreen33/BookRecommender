Being a normal angel of the Middle-Earth was never Helena Zaneâ€™s calling and when she meets two completely different men that have the same upbringing, she figures out why. She discovers that she was created by Athena to protect her people. To the normal angels, she is considered a Sacred Angel-- a warrior. An angel that fights to protect and patrol the city of Athens from Hades who snatches away the souls of the mortals just to gain more power. But after training and going through countless battles with creatures from the Underworld, she becomes torn between the two gorgeous lovers that will do anything just to gain her heart. If she gives up on defeating Hades because of her hurting heart, all of mankind may be destroyed. But continuing her love triangle and going through with the battle will only cause her heart to rip and shatter. The safety of the world lies within her hands; the hearts of her lovers dwells in her very palms. And she is the only one that can stop all hell from breaking loose.
