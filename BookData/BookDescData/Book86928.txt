  So I accidentally killed a shifter. On purpose.
With genie powers I shouldn’t be able to use, thanks to my curse-mark.In my defense, the damn grizzly was threatening civilians and might have been a vampire as well. Pittsburgh is safer without him. Only the Fae court doesn’t believe my story, and the shifters are out for blood.Now I’ve lost my job as a romantic investigator, and I’m on death row. My only hope is an oddly outgoing vegetarian vampire lawyer who seems strangely familiar. Too familiar. Almost like we’ve met before, and this whole thing was a set-up to take us both down.Wishing won’t get us out of this mess.But my forbidden wish magic just might.A snarky urban fantasy with humor, heart, some romance with heat (nothing graphic), and gleeful send ups of many romantic fantasy tropes, all wrapped up with an otter-shifter in the bargain.
