Could you kill the man you love to protect your people? Capsize his boat. Lure him into the water. Summon sharks... How long will Sirena let Joe live, now he knows her secret? A story about seduction and sharks, parenthood and penguins, with plenty of beer and boobs to keep it interesting, at some coral islands off the coast of Western Australia, plus a few other places, too. Sexy mermaids surface once more, to sing up chaos on ship and submarine, sea and shore. Trouble, take two. This is Demelza's second contemporary fantasy book in the Ocean's Gift series, with more mermaids and mayhem than ever. You'll never look at mermaids the same way again. A tiny taste of what's in store:For the first time, she looked nervous. "No human has ever seen me change before," she admitted. "It's the first time for me, too," I replied hoarsely.She touched her heels together and gave a flick with her feet. The movement rippled up her body, before she did it again. It looked like her skin was darkening, or was it just the waves washing over her? Another flick, her feet rising out of the water this time, and I saw the blue wasn't just the water. It was like the skin of her legs had grown together, extending over her feet into curved flukes, as blue as the water. It blended seamlessly up her body, though her torso remained pale.She turned on her side, her eyes curious. In the skin along her ribs, I saw dark lines that looked like gills. I couldn't take my eyes off her. She'd never looked less human, but I'd never wanted to touch her more. My mouth hung open and I couldn't seem to close it. "Are you coming in, or not?" She twisted, arched and dived down. I plunged into the water after her. Ocean's Gift series  This is the second book in Demelza Carlton's Ocean's Gift series, which currently includes:
