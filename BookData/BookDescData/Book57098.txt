Alfhild Daemonne has inherited an inn.  And a dead body.  Estranged from her witch mother, and having committed to little in her thirty years, Alf surprises herself when she decides to start a new life.  She heads deep into the English countryside intent on making a success of the once popular inn. However, discovering the murder throws her a curve ball. Especially when she suspects dark magick.  Additionally, a less than warm welcome from several locals, persuades her that a variety of folk – of both the mortal and magickal persuasions – have it in for her.  The dilapidated inn presents a huge challenge for Alf. Uncertain who to trust, she considers calling time on the venture.  Should she pack her bags and head back to London?  Don’t be daft.  Alf’s magickal powers may be as wonky as the inn, but she’s dead set on finding the murderer.  Once a witch always a witch, and this one is fighting back.   A clean and cozy witch mystery.  Take the opportunity to immerse yourself in this fantastic new witch mystery series, from the author of the award winning novel, Crone.  Read The Wonkiest Witch now!
