Only having his good friend, Cassie, and her family for support made the task bearable. Cassie Strong never understood why people picked on Cody. He was sweet, sexy, and had a silly side that he showed only to her. When tragedy strikes her family, it’s Cody who is by her side and their friendship blossoms into something more. But when Cody’s lifelong enemy threatens the one thing that could make him break his promise, will he risk losing Cassie or will he be strong enough to hold on to his father’s last wish?NOTE: This is the first of 3 parts of the Strong &amp; Wilde novel and is written as a serial with cliffhangers. The full novel is now available for readers who prefer the complete novel format or you can continue reading the book in serial format.
