This New Ocean is a masterful major history of the space age, beautifully written, with exciting ideas and concepts, told by a man who has spent most of his adult life studying the field. The book explores a world that, until the middle of this century, he was only able to look at from a great distance.Burrows's several research trips to Russia have yielded a great deal of new information about the Soviet space programs, and he is the first to document the internecine warfare between the designers and their bureaus -- and the destructive polices that this system imposed, which finally caused the program to collapse. This New Ocean is the first literate, comprehensive, international narrative of the exploration of space.
