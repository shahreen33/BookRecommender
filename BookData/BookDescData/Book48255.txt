He’s the arrogant Manhattan realtor with billboards advertising his six-pack more than his expertise in negotiations.I’m the competing broker who stupidly moved across the hall from his office.From day one, I’ve been his sworn enemy. Okay, so I might have accidentally stolen one of his clients. Well, is it stealing if the client comes to me?Even our vicious banter and loathing gazes can’t hide the chemistry between us. Who can blame me? He has enough charisma to make every hot-blooded woman in the city melt with a single word.Just when I think a mutual respect could be born between us, the biggest developer in the city offers us an opportunity that pits us against each other.Time to forget Carmelo Mancini’s dreamy eyes and tight abs.Game on.
