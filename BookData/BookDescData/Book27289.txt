Building on Wodehouse’s incalculable legacy, JEEVES AND THE KING OF CLUBS reimagines Bertie Wooster as a British spy, and the Junior Ganymede – the club for the gentleman’s gentleman - as a branch of the British Secret Service. Full of intrigue, exploits, comedy and wit, Schott and Wodehouse make for a harmonious, hilarious pair.
