Your bucket list. Quarterly objectives. Strategic plans. Big dreams. Goals. Lots of goals and plans to achieve those goals—no matter what. Except …You're not chasing the goal itself, you're actually chasing the feeling that you hope achieving that goal will give you.Which means we have the procedures of achievement upside down. We go after the stuff we want to have, get, or accomplish, and we hope that we'll be fulfilled when we get there. It's backwards. And it's burning us out.So what if you first got clear on how you actually wanted to feel in your life, and then created some "Goals with Soul"?With The Desire Map, Danielle LaPorte brings you a holistic life-planning tool that will revolutionize the way you go after what you want in life.
