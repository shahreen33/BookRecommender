Las Vegas is the last place I thought I’d end up. I’m in the middle of a world I don’t belong in. A world where people flaunt their wealth and look down on girls like me. I was hoping things would be different here—that maybe I could make friends and not feel so alone for the first time in my life. One touch. One spark. It changes everything. I now have three guys vying for my attention, including my step-cousin who is hotter than the summer sun in the desert. Maybe the world isn’t as black and white as I once thought. Maybe the supernatural does exist. And maybe… maybe I do belong here after all.  Dragon Royalty is book 1 in the Dragon Shifter Academy Series. This is a RH, why choose series.
