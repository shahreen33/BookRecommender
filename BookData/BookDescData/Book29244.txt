Eight criminals face a terrifying fight for survival as they try to make it to Alaska and freedom.  Making it from A to be B is long and the elements are difficult as it is, but significantly multiplied by the cryptids that stand in their way. Giant bugs, mega whales, and huge Sasquatch are all hungry for their flesh.  Survival is the name of the game, but the hostile North American wastelands might not play fair.   “Reminiscent of Stephen King's The Long Walk and The Mist, with a touch of the grittiness of Cormac McCarthy's The Road, Generous’s Radio Run is a chilling, impossible-to-put-down post-apocalyptic tale filled with characters you can't help but root for.”  – J.H. Moncrieff, bestselling author of Monsters in Our Wake and Return to Dyatlov Pass
