Using increasingly sophisticated levels of artificial intelligence (AI) and embodied intelligence (EI), a new generation of robots is being designed to look, act and even think like humans. Hubots, or human-inspired robots, are expanding the boundaries of what robots can do. Here, ten different real-life hubots are described, highlighting each one's appearance, unique skills and purpose --- from fighting fires on the high seas, to acting as setup crew for space colonies, to providing companionship for the elderly. The book also includes an illustrated graph of the uncanny valley, which shows us what distinguishes a friendly robot from a creepy one, and back matter that provides a closer examination of some of the robots' physical components and looks to the future of these fascinating machines.The creators of the popular Zoobots bring to life the groundbreaking robotics technology that's changing the world. Award-winning author Helaine Becker uses short paragraphs and accessible vocabulary to present a book that will appeal to even the most reluctant readers. Hyperrealistic illustrations by Alex Ries enhance the interest level of the material for children, especially those who love all things that are weird, unfamiliar and futuristic. Reference tools include a glossary and an index. This topic spans science, technology, inventions and engineering lessons. It also provides a terrific jumping-off point for classroom discussions about the larger societal issues surrounding these cutting-edge robots.
