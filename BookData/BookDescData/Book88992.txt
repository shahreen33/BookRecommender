  She's back in my life, and I want her in my bed.
When she was in pigtails, I was her brother's best friend.Now she's all grown up, with gorgeous curves to prove it.Her new job is to clean up my image,but the things I want to do to her are filthy.Her brother - now my enemy - would kill me for touching her,so what would he do if I f*ck her?Screw it. I'll touch what I want, consequences be damned... unless one of them is my heart.* Don't Stand So Close is a full length standalone steamy romance novel with no cliffhanger, no cheating and a happily ever after. It features a bad boy athlete and the curvy heroine with whom he falls in love.It can be read on its own but it's more fun to read it with the other two books in this standalone yet related series: Don't Say a Word and Don't Forget About Me, so for a limited time they're included as bonus books. Enjoy!
