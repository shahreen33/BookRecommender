A single night with Meg and I’m willing to do anything to save her from Hades, the man holding her captive, victim to his every whim.A bargain with the devil himself seems a small price to pay in order for Meg to go free… Until I learn that she’s exactly where she wants to be.She’s Queen to Hades’s King.And I’m the fool that walked right into their trap.The same fool who desires them both as much as I hate them. I can’t resist Meg’s touch—or stop from being drawn to Hades’s dark desires. By the time I realize just how deep a game he’s playing, it may be too late…For all of us.
