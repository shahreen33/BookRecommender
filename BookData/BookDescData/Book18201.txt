There are a million reasons why I should stay away from Vincent Cesare.  This was supposed to be temporary. I was supposed to deal for his illegal card games and get some quick cash. That was it. I wasnâ€™t supposed to fall for him.  Little by little, I see the monster grinning at me through the cracks in his pretty suit. He won't tell me what he does, and I'm not sure I want to know. The darkness in his eyes terrifies me. He's seduced me into his web of lies with his charm, and now I'm trapped in his life. He's taken control over me without me even realizing...or resisting.  I'm in way over my head.  He promised that nothing would ever happen to me. The Vittorio family wants me dead and there's only one person I can turn to. But what scares me is what I'll have to do.  I'll need to become his.Author's Note: This is a dark romance novel, it contains themes of violence and mature situations that could make readers uncomfortable.
