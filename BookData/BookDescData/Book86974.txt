I know that dragons aren't real, okay? It's just that:1. I'm trapped in a creepy boarding school.2. Dreaming of burning the teachers alive is pretty weird...3. Oh, and Axel, the sexiest guy I've ever met, just told me I'm a dragon shifter.My entire life, I've been imprisoned in the School for the Different, a mysterious home for mentally-ill orphans. But except for my fire dreams, I've never felt crazy. So when I quit my meds, I discover that I've been lied to for years. Magic is real. So are dragons. And witches. Even gods.That's when things start heating up, literally. My best friend Kian's hands keep glowing. Demi can grow plants overnight. And Jeremy, well, he's just really hungry. And kinda furry. But the clock is ticking: the school's staff are on to us. When Jeremy disappears, I realize we have to escape - and fast.Finally free, I discover the truth. Dragon shifters are dangerous. Most magicals are terrified of us, and as my powers grow, I find out why. I'm losing control. And using my magic might mean losing the only family I've ever known...
