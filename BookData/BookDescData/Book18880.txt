My obsession was born of innocence and good intentions, and it began the day I spotted a handwritten journal lying in the bushes outside a townhouse on Lexington Avenue. It was raining sideways that morning, and my plan was to return it the next day; safe and dry.  Only I kept it.  I kept it, and I read it.  A week later, overwhelmed with curiosity and feeling guilty for harboring secrets that didn’t belong to me, I tried to return it.  Only I wasn’t expecting to meet him.  Unapologetically heartless and enigmatically sexy, he claims he knows nothing about the journal I found outside his place, but the reticent glint in his blue-green gaze tells me otherwise.  There’s something different about him; something damaged yet magical, and I’m drawn to him; pulled into his orbit.  There’s just one problem.  The more I get to know him, the more I’m positive the journal belonged to him...  ...and the more I find myself hoping, selfishly, that I’m wrong.
