Bold, inspiring and powerfully written, Roaring Girls tells the stories of nine women who, despite every effort to suppress them, dared to be extraordinary.‘Given the opportunity, women will prove themselves every time. But first, they need the opportunity.The recent enthusiasm for reclaiming women’s place in history and celebrating their forgotten lives and overlooked achievements mustn’t be a fad – we cannot allow it to be. These women’s stories deserve to be told, talked about, remembered and learned from until they are household names just like the men of history. Women of the twenty-first century owe our predecessors a debt of gratitude, whether their contribution went unrecorded or made a significant change in the world, and it’s up to us to continue their work. To chip away at the glass ceiling. To redefine what powerful women look like. To refuse to be silenced. To keep roaring.’
