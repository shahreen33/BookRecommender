Now that Taiga’s relationship with his dream girl, Yuiko, is in full swing, he’s being gradually initiated into the ways of fujoshi (a very, shall we say, distinct kind of girl geek). Actually, it’s more like he’s being hazed, considering everything from his own name to his friendships with other guys is fair game for Yuiko’s fujoshi filter! Subjected to various emasculating indignities, all in the name of love, Taiga is clearly a guy with the patience of a saint and some serious feelings for his girl. But when a fangirl outing to the bookstore leads to an encounter with a sexy businessman who obviously has an eye on Yuiko, will Taiga be man enough to tell Mr. Perfect to step off?
