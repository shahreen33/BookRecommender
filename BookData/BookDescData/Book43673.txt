You went to bed at home, just like every other night.You woke up in the back of a taxi, over 250 miles away.You have no idea how you got there and no memory of the last ten hours.You have no phone, no money; just a suicide note in your coat pocket, in your own writing.You know you weren’t planning to kill yourself.Your family and friends think you are lying. Someone knows exactly what happened to you. But they’re not telling…Impossible to put down psychological suspense, perfect for fans of Mark Edwards, Louise Jensen and Lisa Hall.
