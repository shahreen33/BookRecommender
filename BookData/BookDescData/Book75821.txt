This is the definitive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the final film in the original Star Wars trilogy. The author of The Making of Star Wars and The Making of the Empire Strikes Back, J. W. Rinzler uses his unprecedented access to the Lucasfilm Archives and its trove of never-before-published photos, design sketches, paintings, production notes, factoids, anecdotes, and script drafts to take the reader from concept art and creature design to on-set photography and ILM's visual effects work. This third behind-the-scenes adventure is as entertaining and enthralling as his previous two books, and the movie itself.
