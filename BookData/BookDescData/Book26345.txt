He wasn’t meant to be on my radar, he was definitely the off-limits guy. My brother’s best friend, my friend’s ex, but most of all he was my boss. Hawk Carnage resembled one thing, and one thing only. Sex. He used it, he knew it, he lived it. Hawk owned the largest lingerie company in the world, and I was his leading lady. In business. But now business and friendship were about to be crossed. The lines blurred, and I was ready to dip my toes in the forbidden water. Because no matter how much I said I could refrain from Hawk Carnage, now was not the time. He was to be my fake fiancé. And I was about to sink into that forbidden water, with Hawk’s hands clutching my sides. Lord help me because I was about to enjoy every moment of it. Even if it was just for fun. Even if it would ruin everything. I was going to dive in head first.
