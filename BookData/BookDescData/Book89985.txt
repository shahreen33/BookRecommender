Eleven years after the Human-Blobel war George Munster, a spy during the war who was altered to appear in Blobel form (a single-cell, protoplasmic species prevalent in the outer solar system) for a limited amount of time per day, gets introduced to Miss Vivian Arrasmith by a homeostatic robotic psychoanalyst. Arrasmith was his opposite, a Blobel spy on earth who was unwilling to return to Titan due to the shame of being in human form for almost three quarters of each day.The story deals with the ramifications for the agents' personal and social identity from this alteration.Author quote: "Here I nailed down the ultimate meaningless irony of war; the human turns into a Blobel and the Blobel, his enemy, turns into a human, and there it all is, the futility, the black humor, the stupidity. And in the story they all wind up happy."
