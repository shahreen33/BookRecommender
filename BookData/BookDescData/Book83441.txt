My name is David Winston, and I am the reincarnation of Jesus Christ. In this book, we will learn about the origins of the universe, what came before the origins of the universe, the meaning of life, what happens after we die, and much more. Most importantly, we will learn about how to reduce the amount of hell on earth so that we can experience less hell in the future. It's time for us to change the way we see ourselves, each other, animals, and the world.
