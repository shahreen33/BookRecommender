Nora Roberts, writing as J.D. Robb, puts futuristic lieutenant Eve Dallas in a supernatural showdown with a most seductive criminal: a vampire in "Eternity in Death."  An ancient coin whisks an American woman and a modern-day earl into the past-and into each other's arms-in a stirring tale from Mary Blayney's "Amy and the Earl's Amazing Adventure."  When a city girl visits a Scottish castle in Ruth Ryan Langan's "Timeless," she is thrust into a timeless romance with a mighty Highland laird.  And Mary Kay McComas gives an unhappy wife a magic-carpet ride into an alternate reality to show her the grass isn't always greener in "On the Fringe."
