An introduction to the powerful healing properties of whey • Explains how whey acts as a powerful detoxifying agent • Reveals the effectiveness of whey against diseases affecting the heart, liver, kidneys, and intestines and in controlling obesity, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure • Shows how this healing agent is now easily and readily available Since antiquity whey has been known as “healing water” by Greek physicians. Hippocrates and Galen both recommended whey to their patients. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, spas across Europe offered the whey cure to aristocrats and commoners alike. Modern scientific research has confirmed the curative capabilities attributed by our ancestors to this dairy product, but because it is highly perishable and must be consumed while very fresh, this cure fell out of favor in our modern urban age. Now, thanks to the availability of whey powder and granules, this highly nutritious and effective healing agent is once more within the reach of everyone. Whey is the watery part of milk that is separated from the curd in the process of making cheese. It is rich in lactose, minerals, and vitamins. Beyond its nutritional value, whey has powerful detoxification properties and its therapeutic action is beneficial for all the major organ centers of the body: heart, liver, kidneys, and intestines. It is especially effective in the treatment of liver ailments such as hepatitis as well as the treatment of skin problems, infections, edema, digestive disorders and gallstones, and the painful joint diseases of arthritis and rheumatism. Whey also has been shown to be a powerful treatment against obesity, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. In addition to its ability to treat these specific illnesses, whey is a proven invigorating supplement that promotes overall good health and vitality.
