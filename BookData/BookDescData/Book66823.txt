I have a certain set of rules I try to live by. Rules that have always served me well. Until now…Rule one: Don’t have sex with someone you work with.Rule two: Don’t have sex with your friend’s ex-boyfriend. Rule three: Don’t have sex with your best friend who also happens to be the same ex-boyfriend of your friend.Rule four: Don’t ever, under any circumstances, fall in love with your best friend. I guess it’s safe to say, I officially broke all four of my rules.Doctor Andrew Albright. Sexy, arrogant, insanely gorgeous, and eternally off-limits. Not only is he still in love with my friend, his ex, but he’s my rock. My perfect best friend.The one person I cannot lose under any circumstances. Especially when my life has a habit of falling apart on a regular basis. But one mercy kiss later, to save me from an awkward situation, and suddenly everything changes. He flirts relentlessly. Corners me in dark hallways. Throws me panty-melting stares that render me helpless. I crossed the uncrossable line. Broke every damn rule. Now our perfect friendship is falling apart. And he’s doing everything he can to keep it that way… THE EDGE OF REASON is a funny, sexy, and emotional best friends to lovers, STANDALONE romance
