An Island that Shouldn't Exist...A Life He Didn't Know...A Destiny That Can't Be EscapedThere was no turning back. We were going to set into motion a revolution that could either save Atlantis or leave it destroyed in the process.Sixteen-year-old Trey Atlas' known life is a lie. While he was raised in Miami, Trey was actually born in Atlantis. Sent off the legendary island as a baby for his own safety, Trey is the only living heir to the Atlantean throne. Whether he likes it or not, Trey has to go back to his birthplace and accept his role as the Ruling Prince and lead the revolution to defeat the Knights of the Abyss. Otherwise, thousands of innocent lives and his true family legacy could be lost forever.
