Winter is white. Winter is cold. Winter is dark. Winter is bright. Winter is so many things, especially to a little one eagerly awaiting sledding, ice-skating, and other joys of the season. "Winter is" brings a child's anticipation of winter to life, with simple, evocative verse and delicate watercolor paintings of winter's wonders. A celebration of the many pleasures of the season, "Winter is" is a classic winter story for bedtime, or anytime a child may be dreaming of snowflakes.
