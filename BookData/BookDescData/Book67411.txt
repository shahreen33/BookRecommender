Nowhere is safe when the gods are wicked.  Since the beginning of times, there has always been two sides: Norms and Idols.  But never have the scales been so unbalanced as they are today.  I’m a Norm, which means, I grew up in fear of the Idols and their godly powers.  And now, I’m going to be surrounded by them, day and night. I’ve been offered a place at the prestigious Gifted Academy, an opportunity very few Norms get.  To survive, I must become invisible. But my hope to get through the academy unscathed goes down the drain when the most powerful boys in school set their eyes on me.  They hate me simply because I’m a Norm. If they knew who I truly am, they’d tear me apart limb by limb. But I’m done cowering away from Idols. It’s time for the Norms to fight back, and it all starts with me.  *Wicked Gods is a mature paranormal high school bully 'why choose' romance.
