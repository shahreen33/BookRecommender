When in June 1968, clad in black leather, a nervous Elvis Presley made his now legendary '68 Comeback Special, Alan Fortas was one of the five friends asked to be on stage with him. Fortas ultimately spent nearly 12 years working for Elvis, having been asked to join his fraternity of bodyguards and close buddies that came to be known as the Memphis Mafia back in 1958. He chronicles the time he spent living, traveling, and playing hard with Elvis during that time, during which he watched Elvis become increasingly disillusioned with the endless stream of movies he was forced to act in, saw him become increasingly reliant on drugs, and witnessed Elvis's colorful sex life.
