Marley Jackson has an axe to grind with the entire male population. After having her heart brutally broken, she’s out to prove to herself, and the world, that a woman only needs one thing from a man—and it isn’t love.  ***CAN BE READ AS A STANDALONE*** Velvet Kisses (3:AM Kisses 6) Romantic Comedy First base never felt so good! From the NEW YORK TIMES and USA TODAY bestselling author, Addison Moore...Cosmopolitan Magazine calls Addison's books...easy, frothy fun! ***3:AM Kisses - The USA Today Bestseller!***  Wyatt James isn’t interested in anything that resembles a commitment. He’s self-made, secure, and happy to entertain a one-night stand any day of the week—enter Marley. Marley quickly dispels the idea that she’s anybody’s one-night stand. What Marley has in store for Wyatt is far more complex and requires a binding contract to back it. Marley and Wyatt aren’t in it for love.  Marley is looking to glean some expertise in the bedroom. Wyatt is looking to find some solace after a string of nameless faces that have rocked his bed. But when feelings change, and that four-letter word takes ahold of both their hearts, they’re left to face the fact they might be in deeper than either of them thought possible.  Marley and Wyatt smolder beneath the sheets. She’s eager to learn—yet, bossy as hell. He’s eager to lay down one hard lesson after the other, yet determined to save her from herself. Sometimes heartbreak is the greatest teacher. Sometimes it leads you into the arms of the one you belonged with right from the start.  Original publication date March 26, 2015
