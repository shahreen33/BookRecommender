Inspired by Arthur Wooten's life, Dizzy is a unique read in that it's a fictional memoir that marries two genres: an exciting backstage show business tale coupled with a frightening medical drama. Angie Styles, a beloved Broadway star, is struck down at the height of her career by a mysterious disease and is forced to reexamine her life and the people in it as she fights to survive.
