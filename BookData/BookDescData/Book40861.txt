Book 2: GATEWAY TO THE WEST Missouri, 1840  Coming to America was supposed to be a new adventure for Hayley Hunter and her husband, a chance for a fresh start in a new country. She never dreamed her journey would land her alone in a strange place with nobody she knew. She joins up with a wagon train in the hopes of meeting up with her brother and his family along the trail.  Malcom Wheeler knows the hardships and heartbreak families face, but there’s usually safety in numbers, so he runs his own wagon train to try and help people determined to head out west. Taking the lady along goes against his better judgement; understanding her plight and being happy about it are two different things.  Can Malcom help Hayley find comfort by restoring a part of her past when he finds her family’s trunk that holds a journal? Is there hope for both of them to find a family of their own?
