Chloe Slater has been in love with Callum Rosewood since the moment she knew what love was. Growing up, he had been her best friend, and the man she secretly was hoping to spend the rest of her life with. So, the night they finally get their groove on-with the help of copious amounts of alcohol-she should be ecstatic. Thrilled, even. Well, she was. At least she was until that little plus sign appeared on that notoriously life-changing stick.Callum Rosewood had it all planned out. Graduate high school, go to college, get into law school, get hired on at one of the best law firms in the state, establish himself as a cutthroat attorney, make Chloe dump whatever shmuck she's dating, marry her, have three kids, and live happily every after. It was the perfect plan. Then one night, while drunk off their asses, they do the deed. But instead of reciting love sonnets, Chloe avoids him for weeks. That is, until she can't avoid him any longer.Now, while Chloe is trying to come to grips with the reality that she's pregnant by her best friend...well, ex-best friend now, Callum's pissed off that Chloe failed to mention she was NOT on birth control. He thinks she trapped him on purpose, making her reevaluate everything she ever felt about him.Word to the wise, my friends, if you're going to have a drunken one-night stand, don't have it with your best friend.
