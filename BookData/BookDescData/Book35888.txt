Faber Stories, a landmark series of individual volumes, presents masters of the short story form at work in a range of genres and styles. Her story was this: she had been an orphan, her mother probably a whore. Brought up by nuns, she had lost her faith, found another, fought for it and been imprisoned. This was inexact but serviceable.On the twelfth day of her hunger strike, Maggy is unable to tell the difference between what is real and what is imagined. That's true of what brought her here too: was she IRA, or did she just take risks for the sake of a friend?Julia O'Faolain paints a portrait of young Irish girls and their unseverable connection, showing solidarity in places politics cannot reach.Bringing together past, present and future in our ninetieth year, Faber Stories is a celebratory compendium of collectable work.
