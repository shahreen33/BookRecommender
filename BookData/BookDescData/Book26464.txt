He's her kind of danger...Small-town-girl Cassidy Jones is a fast-driving, sharp-shooting, man-loving cop with a loud laugh. She's also really good at her job—a fact that is completely irrelevant to the good ol' boys at the station. So when a local mobster is murdered, and the Chief is forced to turn to Cassidy for help, she's excited to get the opportunity to prove herself.Sure, the only reason she's going undercover is because she's one of only two female cops on the force. Still, it beats the hell out of writing parking tickets. There's just one little problem: she's falling hard for Lorenzo, the mobster's dangerously sexy brother—and possible murder suspect. With everyone at the station assuming she'll fail, Cassidy cannot act on her attraction.But when Cassidy's instincts lead her to a shocking suspect, her reputation isn't the only thing at stake.
