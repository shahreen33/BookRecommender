I’ve been betrayed. A hit gone wrong. I'm hurt and hunted. She helps me out of fear--an innocent snatched up in my bid to escape. I can’t let her live because she’s seen my face. No survivors. No witnesses. That’s a code I live by and one I’ve always upheld. Yet when it comes to my petal, she makes me hesitate.I want to taste her and make her mine in the most primitive way. Ravage her. Devour her. Allowing my need for her to take hold.Unsure of who to trust, I feel the enemy closing in. I should set her free, but I can't. I’ll discover who has a price on my head and I'll end them, meeting blood with blood, and bullet with bullet.Would she still want me when she sees me kill? Or will it scare her off for good?
