This is a book for members of the Delay, Don't Deny intermittent fasting community, which is based on the work of Gin Stephens and her original book, Delay, Don't Deny: Living an Intermittent Fasting Lifestyle. If you are ready to dig deeper into the concepts and practices found in the original book, get a pen or pencil and grab your copy of Delay, Don't Deny. As you work your way through the chapters, you will find chapter-specific questions to reflect upon, which will deepen your understanding of the concepts and help you apply the strategies into your own life. This book is designed to be used either individually or within a Delay, Don't Deny support group. Note: this "Digging Deeper" book has been created to be used alongside the original Delay, Don't Deny book.
