The Office is the 17th title in the award winning Dev Haskell series. Private Investigator Dev Haskell rolls up his sleeves and decides to help a neighbor lady rid her neighborhood of a drug problem. Specifically, ridding the neighborhood of one, Ozzie Frick, apparent business associate of crime lord Tubby Gustafson. But all is not as it seems ... Dev spends his evenings until the early morning hours sitting in "The Office", actually a 'porta pottie' positioned on a fake road construction site in front of Ozzie Frick's home. Dev tapes and records drug buys, license plate numbers and cash pick ups between midnight to seven from the safety of "The Office." In his spare time he attempts to build a relationship with gorgeous Sophie, owner of chocolate lab, Lilly. Sophie has her hands full trying to train Morton, Dev's golden retriever along with Dev. Meanwhile, gangster Dennis Dwyer becomes more than involved just to add complications and in the end Dev has a day of reckoning thrust upon him ... thanks to stripper/escort/ner' do well Swindle Lawless. It's classic Dev! The Office Dev Haskell's latest attempt at being nice! Fans of Carl Hiaasen, Tim Dorsey, Tony Dunbar and Laurence Shames love it! "Faricy is America's hottest new writer..." The Dirty Lowdown A cross between Carl Hiaasen and Elmore Leonard with a sprinkling of Robert B. Parker..."
