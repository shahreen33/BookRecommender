An MM Mpreg Romance Team: A.L.P.H.A.:Six battle-hardened alphas with one goal—to save any omega in peril.   David Dempsey, the younger omega brother of Team ALPHA’s crazy twin duo, has gone missing after a camping trip with some human friends. He'd only planned to celebrate his upcoming college graduation—but somehow ended up taken captive by a sketchy group after catching them in a criminal act when he wandered too far away from his group.  Simon "Boomer" Chiarelli is a laid-back alpha with a love for things of an incendiary nature—but nothing has ever been as explosive as the connection he feels when he catches the scent of his mate. But why, of all the shifters on the planet, does his mate have to be related to the twins?  Can Team ALPHA stay united when tension breaks out among their own? Between dodging Zeke’s famous knife and Ezra’s penchant for hitting things—while still trying to connect with his new mate—Boomer’s life is about to blow-up in a whole new way.  This is the third book in our top-selling series, but can definitely be read as a stand-alone novel. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and some violence. No humans were harmed in the writing of this book—unless they kinda deserved it. HEA definitely included, intended for 18+ readers only. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown?
