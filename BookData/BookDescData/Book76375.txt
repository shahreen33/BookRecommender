There's something lurking in all of us.Something we hide and shelter from those we love in order to protect them. A darkness we try to suppress because we're ashamed of who that makes us. Because that's the thing about Shame. It wounds us. It damages us.Or, for the few poor souls out there like me...it defines us.It's there—in the shadows, beneath the surface...just waiting.Until you let it break freeAnd the darkness consumes you. My name is Ricardo DeLuca. There are two things you need to know about me. The first—is that my heart will always bleed for her...Only her. The second— is that I'm the son of the devil himself—the most feared mob boss who ever lived.That is...until me. ***Ricardo's heart might bleed for me but my heart shatters for him. Over and over again. I thought I fought all my demons...I thought the worst was over. I was wrong. Because it's not my demon I'm battling this time...It's his. And it wants to claim something I don't have.His soul. And that's a battle I'm afraid I won't win. "There are two sides to every story...this is how ours ENDS."
