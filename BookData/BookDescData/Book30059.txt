Sgt. Ducky is back in a special holiday edition of "Fowl On The Prowl: A Sgt. Ducky Christmas Story." Even on Christmas, police officers like Sgt. Ducky go to work to help people and to protect their communities. Sgt. Ducky has been assigned to go to the North Pole to help Santa Claus with delivering presents to children all over the world. But throughout the night, Sgt. Ducky teaches young readers that Christmas just isn't about getting presents, but giving to others as well.
