Alien abductions, ghostly visitations, and destructive entities from astral planes these events really be the bizarre outcome of electromagnetic pollution? Field-emitting devices such as power lines litter our environment, possibly affecting our bodies, minds, and sensory abilities. Fully researched and full of fascinating scientific data and first-hand accounts, this terrifying portrait of electromagnetic pollution may change your view about the world around us. It covers health issues, such as asthma and other life-threatening illnesses resulting from, or made worse by, power fields. One story tells of a 13-year-old boy whose fatal leukemia may have resulted from electric fields near his bed. See why the effects of electrical bombardment are particularly pernicious during sleep (when many so-called abductions occur); what effect power surges can have on us; how exposure to multiple types of electrical fields have especially dire consequences; which physical phenomena have been found at "haunted" locations; and what scientific studies reveal about unclassified atmospheric phenomena. Those power lines, electric lights, and meters will never look harmless again...
