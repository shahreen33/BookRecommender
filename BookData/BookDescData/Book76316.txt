One of the most creative minds in comics, Grant Morrison (All-Star Superman, The Invisibles) delivers his most groundbreaking and ambitious project yet: Seven Soldiers!Comprising seven different 4-issue miniseries and two bookend Specials, this colossal 30-part tale of death, betrayal, failure, joy, loss, romance, triumph and redemption is now collected in a 4-volume series of trade paperbacks! Independently, each of these characters are featured in a story arc of their own that redefines their purpose in the DCU. But their stories also interweave with the other Soldiers' tales, forming a grander story of a devastating global threat to mankind - with the ties between them becoming more evident in each new volume. Together these reluctant champions must arise and somehow work together to save the world...without ever meeting one another!Collecting: Seven Soldiers of Victory 0, The Shinning Knight 1-2, The Guardian 1-2, Zatanna 1-2, Klarion, the Witchboy 1
