Sex. Love. Death. Pooping Moose Candy Dispensers. Welcome to the SHOPLANDIA home shopping channel. When Jake Meecham takes a production assistant job, he quickly realizes he has been dropped down a rabbit hole. Everyone visiting the live studio—reality TV stars, beloved country musicians, drunk baseball players and A-Team actors—is striving to cash in on their own version of the American dream. Meanwhile, fledgling show host Renee tries to determine if she has the “sales gene,” and Marketing VP Johnny Wake tracks down a troubled long lost show host. Back in the studio, producers Dottie and Dylan struggle to keep the live show running as a cascade of catastrophes unfolds on every shift. A surprising novel told through stories, Shoplandia peels back the curtain to give a humorous and tragic glimpse into the familial bonds that often form in our working lives."Shoplandia reveals the absurd world of home shopping networks with rollicking humor and gusto." - James Esch, Turk’s Head Review “Compelling and poetic, Shoplandia’s stories have all the insight and complexity of the best novels. Breslin gives us a thoughtful meditation on consumerism and the American Dream.” - Terry Heyman, Greetings From Insanity “Jim Breslin viscerally knows the dynamics of a three-ring circus played out on the rotating stage of a 24/7 shopping network. They’re all there—stars and has-beens, pretty pitch women, sad clowns, roustabouts, network lions and wolves. Both moving and entertaining, Shoplandia mingles the humor and pathos inherent in the big tent of our consumer obsessive culture.” - Virginia Beards, Exit Pursued By a Bear and Others "Drawing from his experiences in TV production, Jim Breslin's Shoplandia immerses the reader into that wild and weird world. This collection sizzles and pops, particularly in "Laugh Track," where Breslin's evocative storytelling about the seamy side of the television industry is so potent that you can almost smell it. - Josh Goller, The Molotov Cocktail
