'I had two things which not many had—an impossible dream that made every tomorrow worth waiting for, and a pain that not everyone was blessed with.'Author Sourabh Mukherjee’s “Nargis - Through My Summers” is a love story that goes beyond a conventional ‘happily ever after’ ending and offers realistic views of the variety of emotions one goes through when love comes calling. A slice of life in the true sense, the story takes us on a soulful journey as we relive loves lost or found or nurtured unprofessed in the deepest recesses of our hearts.Appreciation for Nargis-Through my Summers:‘A story which evokes yearning in our hearts, pushing the hands of time. Sourabh is economic in his choice of words, and allows the reader's imagination to play. His style is that of a master story-teller and the build-up is strong. The end has a twist that rhymes well with the elevated level of this story. This is just the beginning; we want many more from you. Readers: THIS IS A MUST READ.’– Amazon‘This book is a must read for all romantics and "cynics" in equal measure. It’s a beautiful story, written in an extremely simple, subtle and poignant style. The way the story unfolded was beautiful yet unexpected’– Amazon‘A lucid read. I really liked how the author articulated the inner feelings of the protagonist. Also, must appreciate the in-depth description of emotions. I could almost visualize the scenes opening up and enacting in front of my eyes. It also got me nostalgic and took me on a trip down memory lane. The suspense of the story has been well kept under wraps.’– Amazon‘Oh what a treat it was!

The ending was unexpected, but it made so much sense.’- Goodreads‘Just finished reading the story and have to say the ending was astounding! Really impressed.
