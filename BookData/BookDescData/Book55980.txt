It is also the subject of an Alexisonfire song. The protagonist, Professor Arthur Barnhouse, develops the ability to affect physical objects &amp; events thru the force of his mind. He calls his power 'dynamo-psychism'. He makes the mistake of telling the government about his power. When they try to turn him into a weapon, Barnhouse decides that he is the first weapon with a conscience, &amp; goes into hiding. While in this reclusive state the Professor uses his 'dynamo-psychic' powers to destroy large quantities of weapons, &amp; other things used in states of war. He realizes tho, that he will die eventually &amp; decides to pass down his "powers" to an ex-student. The story is told as a report by this ex-student, hence the title.
