They were such brave children to withstand such suffering. Such clever children to escape such terror!For Carrie, Chris and Cathy, the attic was a dark horror that would not leave their minds, even while they built bright, promising new lives. Of course mother had to pretend they didn't exist.And Grandmother was convinced they had the devil in them.But that wasn't their fault. Was it? Cathy knew what to do.She now had the powers she had learned from her beautiful mother. She knew it in the way her brother still yearned for her, in the way her guardian touched her, in the way all men looked at her.She knew it was time to put what she knew to the test. To show her mother and grandmother that the pain and terror of the attic could not be forgotten... Show them.Show themâ€”once and for all.
