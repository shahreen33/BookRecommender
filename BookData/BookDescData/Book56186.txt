While searching the place, they find a simple leather briefcase full of what they think are priceless diamonds. But things are never as they appear... For the briefcase is a bringer of death. This ancient evil, once contained for centuries, is now unleashed. Those who come in contact with it will be granted their greatest desires at the even greater cost of their lives.
