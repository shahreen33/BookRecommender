Gerald Durrell is on his way to South America on a quest to capture specimens that have never been brought back alive before. And it turns into quite an adventure when he encounters timid squirrel monkeys, wailing rats, an overly affectionate bird christened Cuthbert and a bad-tempered anaconda! Bringing back a living collection of animals can be frustrating, exciting and damned hard work, but it's never dull!
