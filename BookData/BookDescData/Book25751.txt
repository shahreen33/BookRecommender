An alternate cover for this ASIN can be found here.In a town where magic festers beneath the surface and monsters stalk the shadows, someone has to fight for the innocent. That someone is me.They call me sorcerer, fixer, finder, but mostly they call me Creed. Been hexed by a witch? Being stalked by a werewolf? Haunted by a crazy ghost? I’m the one you call to get my hands dirty, so you don’t have to.So when I got a call from a grieving parent to find their missing daughter, I was happy to help. Trouble is, what started out as another garden variety missing person case just ended up with me being hexed by an occult serial killer. They made a mistake, though, whoever they are, when they cursed me.They should have killed me instead because they're about to find out that Hell hath no fury like a sorcerer scorned.If you like Jim Butcher, Kevin Hearne, or Shayne Silvers, then you will LOVE the first installment of the Sorcerer's Creed Paranormal Suspense Series.
