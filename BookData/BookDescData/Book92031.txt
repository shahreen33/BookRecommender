Tutankhamun was a boy-king who lived in Egypt over 3,000 years ago. The surprise discovery of his unplundered tomb in 1922 made him an instant celebrity and one of ancient Egypt's most famous rulers. Discovered by archaeologist Howard Carter, Tut's burial site contained furniture, jewelry, sculpture, and other rare and beautiful objects, as well as the mummy itself, adorned with a golden death mask. This carefully researched collection of 30 ready-to-color illustrations depicts many authentic relics from the tomb, as well as images from the life of King Tut. Among these scenes are views of the beautiful Queen Nefertiti, looking in on the royal children; the magnificent temple at Karnak; daily activities at the royal palace; the crowning of Tutankhamun at the age of eight; and his death some ten years later. An excellent source of Egyptian pictorial design, as well as information about ancient Egypt, this volume will delight colorists and anyone fascinated by the magnificent civilization that flourished along the Nile so many centuries ago.
