What begins as the yearly fishing adventure of four old friends into the vast Ontario wilderness becomes a bone-chilling ordeal of terror so intense that one of them vows never to return again. In the company of his best friend, and with beautiful anthropologist Monica Weller, a Russian scientist, a Cree Indian guide named Archie Crow and Archie's daughter, Lorena, both of whom know the eerie truth, millionaire Lucas Tanner returns to the Canadian wilderness to seek the strange and terrifying secret of what lives and roams that dark and tangled forest.
