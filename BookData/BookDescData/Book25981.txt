A. Ironside"Entertaining, well-researched and compelling." Michael Jecks on An Argument of Blood."ï¿½lfgifa...steals every scene and is a character who would fit in any George R. R. Martin novel." Tony Riches author of The Tudor Trilogy (An Argument of Blood)."Intense drama, creative working of the sparse historical record, and a detailed look into what made William and Harold tick... A rousing, page turning tale awaits you..." Paul Bennett, author of Clash of Empires (on 'A Black Matter for the King').J. A. Ironside grew up in rural Dorset in a house full of books. She was exposed to history at an early age and happily never recovered - the presence of so many Roman ruins in the area inspired a lifelong interest in historical warfare. She has taught and studied martial arts and weaponry for 25 years. Her published works include An Argument of Blood and A Black Matter for the King, both co-written with Matthew Willis.
