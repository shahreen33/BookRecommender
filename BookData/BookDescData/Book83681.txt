My lilapetal is dying...and I can’t save her.The woman who brought me back to life may not live long enough to see me truly happy.All the tests, the experiments have failed me...and I have failed her.If I don’t devise a cure to save my alien, I’ll spend the rest of my existence on Mortuus alone.The others believe my mate isn’t strong enough to survive. That she can’t breed and should be put back into cryosleep until she’s healed.But I won’t allow it.I will defy the only family I’ve ever known to save her.Even if it means vanishing into the unknown.She is all that matters and no amount of her protests will keep me from doing what I must to keep her safe.
