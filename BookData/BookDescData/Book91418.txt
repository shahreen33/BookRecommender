Her father may be back in her life but things are hardly smooth sailing for Rowan Gray. He faked his death to get away from a group of people investigating psychic abilities – a group he is convinced is still out to get him – and he’s positive the group want his daughter for the same nefarious reasons. Rowan is simply happy to have him in her life. She gets to spend time with him and her uncle and plot for a future they might never have. All that’s thrown into turmoil when The Bounding Storm, the cruise ship where Rowan works, stumbles across a family that’s been lost at sea for weeks. Only some of them are on the rescue ship her boyfriend Quinn Davenport brings back, though. The rest are missing and lost. What happened to the other family members? That’s the question on everybody’s lips as the media descends. The family at the center of the rescue is rich, essentially American royalty … and the horror of what they went through makes for a terrible tale. The problem is … the story doesn’t hold water. When a hand belonging to one of the deceased washes up on the beach, miles away from where the family went missing, things start to fall apart … and fast. It’s up to Rowan and Quinn to discover the truth while working on their own investigation into a group of people that may well mean to do Rowan harm. It makes for a busy – and dangerous – few days. All they have to do is survive to find the answers they seek. That’s easier said than done.
