Everything happened at once. One minute Kip Russell was walking about in his own backyard, testing out an old space suit and dreaming about going to the Moon—and the next he was out cold and the captive of an insidious space pirate. The whole thing seemed like a very bad dream until he discovered he wasn't the only prisoner on board. Then the reality of the situation became inescapable. He—along with the daughter of a world-renowned scientist and a beautiful creature from an alien planet—had been skyjacked by a monstrous extraterrestrial and they were on their way to the Moon...a journey toward a fate worse than death!
