Adventure traveler James Dorsey takes readers around the world to not only explore ancient trails, but to help immerse readers in the old traditions of lands that seem to be disappearing in the modern world. This book of short stories takes readers on a descriptive journey through parts of Asia, Africa and South America. "James Dorsey is no ordinary travel writer. In this remarkable book, ranging from Southeast Asia to West Africa, he takes us inside tribal cultures that many readers will be surprised to learn still exist. The author's sincere fascination with remote lands and the ancient practices of their inhabitants often makes him as much participant as observer. That a 21st-century man could yet invoke the spirit of a Stanley or a Shackleton makes "Vanishing Tales from Ancient Trails" all the more a must-read." - Dick Russell, author of "Eye of the Whale: Epic Passage from Baja to Siberia."
