A dead man—nameless, all but formless, not quite here but unable to move on—fights his way back to who he was. What happened to him? And what happened to the love of his life? His memories retreat like the tide, tantalizingly close but always receding.This anonymous ghost is harassed in the right direction by a fellow spirit, one of the few who remain—a circus fortune teller tethered to him by a tragic history of her own.A haunting novel of the supernatural, The Hanged Man and the Fortune Teller is a testament to the longing that comes over us in our lonely moments, when we shiver and feel the presence of someone near us in the dark.
