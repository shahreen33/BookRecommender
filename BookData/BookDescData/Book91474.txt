Cori Sloane, witch, werewolf, and local sheriff, has her hands full with a rogue wolf killing people in her town. The last thing she needs is an old flame turning up to hunt for the killer on his own.  As if that's not enough, her vampire roommate suspects somebody is poisoning her clientele and the founder of the town shows up 150 years later demanding changes.  When her parents name her next in line to lead the regional pack, it's the final straw, but it's not like she can just walk away. After all, she's next on the list. In order to save her town, she has to save herself first, while fighting ex-loves, crotchety old vampires, and a demanding mother who just won't quit interfering in her life.  What's a witchy werewolf to do?
