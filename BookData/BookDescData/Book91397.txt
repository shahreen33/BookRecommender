At a glance, life is perfect for Del Bellator. She’s getting the hang of her magic, the shop she runs with her friends is thriving, and she has a hot almost-boyfriend in the form of were-demon Roarke Fallon. But nothing is ever as it seems. Del’s mysterious friend Draka is missing, and she’s in more danger than Del could ever realize. When Del receives a clue about Draka’s location, she sets off to save her. But a simple rescue mission soon turns into a game of cat and mouse that Del doesn’t know how to win. Her enemies are in the shadows, pulling the strings, and it’s all she can do not to fall into their grasp. It will take all of Del’s magic—and all the help she can get from her sisters and Roarke—to save not just her friend’s life, but her own. And the secrets she reveals along the way just might break her. Magic Undying features a kick butt heroine, a powerful hero, and otherworldly adventure.
