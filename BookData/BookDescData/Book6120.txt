Please note: At this time, there is no release date for the final book in the series. They say everyone has either an addiction, obsession, or weakness in this world. Something that can penetrate you down to the core and influence you in a way nothing else can. I have all three. One happens to be her.  Kit Bishop is in my veins. But unfortunately for me, she's the drug I'll never be able to indulge in and the high I can't chase.  Because I'm a liar. A thief. And I've destroyed everything that's ever been mine.    Author note: This book is a spin-off featuring different characters from the Complicated Hearts duet. It is not necessary to read the Complicated Hearts duet in order to read Preston and Kit's story.
