When tattoo artist, Liam O’Rourke, meets a hot new ink model promoting a sexy calendar at an LA tattoo convention, sparks fly.  Liam admires Velvet like every red-blooded man in the convention center. The way she moves, her sexy pinup look and a body to die for; what man wouldn’t want that? She seems so strong and confident. But it’s the look in her eyes when she meets his that has him lightheaded. They hold a vulnerability that defy the sexy pose and call out to him. That look awakens a fierceness in him that has him wanting to protect her. She’s the beauty to his beast, and he can’t forget her. After an incredible night together, she vanishes, leaving him with nothing but questions, only to reappear in the last place he expects to find her. She’s gorgeous and irresistible, but she’s also hiding something from him. Liam must decide if she’s worth the risk if he’s going to save her from her past or lose her forever.  Velvet comes from a family of con artists. She grew up learning all their scams. When she was fourteen, her mother forced her into traveling from town to town, with Velvet playing the leading lady in the longest running con her mother ever pulled. She’s fought to put all that behind her, until she crosses paths with the one man who left an indelible mark on more than her skin. Velvet remembers Liam, but fortunately he doesn’t recognize her, because there’s something he doesn’t know and she can’t risk him ever finding out.
