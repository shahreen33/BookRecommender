alternate cover for 1493708252/9781493708253For 300 years, peace has reigned in the Southern Kingdom.  After forging that peace, the Armor of God disappeared from the world and became legend.  Over the centuries, even the legend faded into obscurity.  As the time approaches when the armor will again be needed, a young Druid begins a quest for a hero who will deliver hope to the Southern Kingdom.  That hero is a 16 year old boy who is years away from having the skills needed, but the Kingdom doesn’t have years to wait.  The fate of the Southern Kingdom rests on the shoulders of an untrained and untested hero who must find the armor and become the righteous warrior the Kingdom needs.  Can he find the armor and figure out how to save his friends, family, kingdom, and, ultimately, himself?
