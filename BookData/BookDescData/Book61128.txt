She’s handed in her resignation—but this wealthy rancher has another position in mind…  In three months, Pilar Lopez will be free: free of the charity she’s always had to take from the Merrill family, free to live where she wants, free to be her own person. The secretarial job Benedict Merrill gave her five years ago has allowed her to support her younger brother and she’s indebted to the wealthy rancher. But soon her brother will be on his own and she’ll leave the tempting Benedict—and her powerful attraction to him—behind forever.  When she hands in her resignation, Benedict reveals plans of his own—ones that involve Pilar in his bed. She can handle a three month affair, no sweat. But when she starts to fall for Benedict, will she be able to handle loving him for always?
