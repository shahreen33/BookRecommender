#1 NEW YORK TIMES BestsellerFifteen years ago, Dashiell “Dash” Bad Horse ran away from a life of poverty and hopelessness on the Prairie Rose Indian Reservation in search of something better. Now he’s come back home armed with nothing but a set of nunchucks, a hell-bent-for-leather attitude and one dark secret, to find nothing much has changed on “The Rez” – short of a glimmering new casino run by a corrupt leader named Red Crow, and a once-proud people overcome by drugs and organized crime. In this volume, Red Crow takes on a new challenger for tribal leadership, Dash pursues his mother’s murderer and Officer Falls Down faces a most unusual captivity.
