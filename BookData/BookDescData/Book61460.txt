Pink. Orange. White. Indigo. In the ruthless and unforgiving world of mercenaries, these are the code names of an elite group of assassins, known collectively as the Black Cross. They leave behind no DNA, no evidence at all—and until they were recruited by the shadowy group, they were the best and deadliest operatives working for the U.S. government.When someone begins targeting retired American servicemen—CIA, navy and marines—Stony Man decides to send Black Cross a new recruit: Mack Bolan. Bolan must infiltrate the cell of skilled assassins, taking the entire organization apart, body by body. And he'll do it the only way he knows how…Executioner style.
