  "Holly and Aiden broke up? Seriously? No way. Not those two."   Dumped. No, not only dumped. Blindsided and dumped. I thought that Aiden McManus was my forever, my soulmate,That was until he told me he was still in love with his ex.I didn't want to believe him. So, I convinced myself that our break-up was because of his upcoming deployment, and not because he didn't love me. Believing that, helped me get through those first months.But after a while, I realized I just might be lying to myself.And it was time to move on...So, I moved on. Or tried to move on, anyway. But that didn’t work out so well for me, either.And it practically got me disowned from my family.After that, I finally started to get my life back together,I had everything back under control……Or so I thought.  Until I found out Aiden was back  And now he’s everywhere I turn,Still pushing me away,telling me he doesn’t want me.But every time he calls me Angel or reaches out to touch my cheek,I know what he's not admitting to himself –He still loves me. And I'm going to prove it to him.
