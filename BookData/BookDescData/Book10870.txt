As Pearl and Jack struggle with inconsolable loss, Ezra and Lily work to keep the Mys community safe in their new home, and plan a deadly retaliation. Their friendship saves them both...but it also draws attention. Whispers. Judgment.

Lily is good at keeping secrets that could get her killed. Is she willing to risk Ezra's life as well?
