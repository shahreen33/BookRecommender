Alternate cover edition for ASIN B00LBGSSVUBooze. Brawls. Betrayal. The summer of 1988 changed everything. My parents separated, I left for college, and Stone Harrison lit my world like Apollo streaking across the sky. My obsession and desire for him overpowered all my sense and drained my sensibility as I fought to maintain control over my own destiny. Four years spent in pursuit of degrees and one certain soldier altered my future forever. Can I be the person I am destined to be with him or does a compromise of my soul spoil the perfect ending?
