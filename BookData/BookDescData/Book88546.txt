Doc Savage is a physician, surgeon, scientist, adventurer, inventor, explorer, researcher, and musician - a renaissance man. A team of scientists (assembled by his father) trained his mind and body to near-superhuman abilities almost from birth, giving him great strength and endurance, a photographic memory, mastery of the martial arts and vast knowledge of the sciences. Dent described the hero as a mix of Sherlock Holmes' deductive abilities, Tarzan's outstanding physical abilities, Craig Kennedy's scientific education, and Abraham Lincoln's goodness. Lester Dent, a serious man of adventure himself, contributed to the legendary Black Mask Magazine some hard boiled/noir crime tales as well. This edition sports a cover by the also legendary Doc Savage cover artist Bob Larkin!
