You can no longer count on old motivational tricks to inspire loyalty among your associates. The rules of leading have changed, and now you must be able to take a diverse team and win with them quickly.Barry Banther knows how to equip you for today’s business world because he knows what lasting leadership is made of. He has identified five qualities that aren’t things leaders have; rather, they are things they give away freely and frequently to everyone they lead in the workplace. By embracing and demonstrating the five qualities expounded in this book, you will become a leader who brings out the best in your associates, whether you’re a new manager or you occupy a C-suite office.  Banther consults with and trains the teams of CEOs of family-owned as well as Fortune 100 companies. He has been the lead consultant on more than 400 leadership development engagements and has written 50-plus leadership training programs that are used by companies worldwide. After a career in broadcasting and, later, teaching and administration at the college level, Banther served three Florida governors as their appointee to oversee private higher education and was elected to an unprecedented three terms as chairman of the Florida State Board of Independent Colleges and Universities.Having learned the hard way—caring about numbers rather than people—Banther can tell you with confidence that when leaders put others first they themselves become more valuable to their team and their company than any authority or job title could ever mandate! That’s also the best way to grow your bottom line: deploy the right people with the right skills at the right time to create loyal and repeat customers!
