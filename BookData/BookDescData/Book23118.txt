IMAGINE...Leaving your house in the middle of the night.Knowing your mother is doing her best, but she's just as scared as you.IMAGINE...Starting a new school, making friends.Seeing how happy it makes your mother.Hearing a voice, calling out to you.IMAGINE...Following the signs, into the woods.Going missing for six days.Remembering nothing about what happened.IMAGINE...Something that will change everything...And having to save everyone you love.* * * * *
