The fellowship of the quest for some really cool heroes and a magic sword and stuff has failed. Desultory, broken, Majilda and the remaining heroes travel back across the ocean, full of doubt and despair. But in such conditions, anger and dark desires are provoked to flaring…Meanwhile, Elainer (who is now probably the Chosen One) and the really good wizard Bryan Deans are searching for a way out of the time prison. But when their attempts to escape into the past prove fruitless, perhaps there is only one door left open to them…As the tensions starts to rise, as conflict bubbles up between the heroes like never before, cracks appear in relationships which had always seemed strong as freshly brewed coffee. Majilda must face these conflicts…but will magic be with her?
