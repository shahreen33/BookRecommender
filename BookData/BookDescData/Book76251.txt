I know what I want, and Matthew Wakefield isn't it." - Cecelia Carter From the first moment they laid eyes on each other, all Cecelia Carter and Matthew Wakefield do is bicker. Fight. Even though he is her roommates brother, Cece just can't stand the sight of him, and Matthew - well. He could never resist a challenge... That can't be a good combination, can it? But sometimes, love happens when you least expect it.
