   The dirty little enemies-to-lovers romp continues... 
How to make a reluctant fiancée happy: * Buy her a huge-ass diamond ring. ✔️* Throw a balls-out engagement party. ✔️* Make the wedding a quickie. ✔️ Every girl dreams of getting married. Right? Not Paris Elizabeth Hollis Fairchild. And especially not to me. She says this party boy is anything but husband material. Cocky. Arrogant. Presumptuous. And even manipulative. Hey, those are all perfectly acceptable traits. When it turns out she doesn't have a choice, the arranged nuptials dear old granny insisted on go off without a hitch. But that doesn't mean we're riding off into the sunset anytime soon. With both of our failing wineries merging and a contract that states only one family business can survive, we're spending a lot of time negotiating. And not the kind I prefer. The truth is it's just a matter of who will come out on top, her or me? I wish I meant that literally. In the meantime, she demands separate bedrooms. I insist we break in our new bed. She says she hates me. I think it's love. She believes our marriage won't last. I know it will. She tells me not to bother popping the champagne. I disagree. In fact, I think it's time to get this party started. ***This is volume 2 in the Party Ever After series. Volume 3 will release December 20th.***
