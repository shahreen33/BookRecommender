The Hero’s Closet is the ultimate DIY guide to creating unique and fantastical homemade costumes   This essential handbook offers detailed, step-by-step instructions that cover the basics of sewing costumes (which often require skills not found in standard sewing guides) to help even the most novice sewists create the costumes of their dreams.
