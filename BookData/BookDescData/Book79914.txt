All Boris wants is a long catnap in his new cardboard box with no trouble whatsoever. But suddenly--STAMP, STAMP, scribble, scribble--the box is taped up and zoomed off to doorsteps all over the earth and beyond Every time Boris drifts off to sleep, someone opens the box and wakes him up. Beady eyes peek inside and loud voices shout, This is NOT what I ordered! I DON'T want this cat! (They want a prickly plant...giant teapot...or remote-controlled space butterfly.) This quirky cat tale proves there's no place like a loving home--especially if that home happens to have a plumpish pillow perfect for snooooooozing!
