Oliver Stone is the most wanted man in America; no, not the maverick filmmaker Oliver Stone but the covert agent whose real name is John Carr. Men in the highest circles of power want him dead, and they want him dead quickly, because he knows too many of their deepest secrets. The members of the secretive Camel Club, on the other hand, not only want him alive; they are willing to risk their own lives to save their leader and friend. All of which sets up David Baldacci's thriller of relentless intensity, a perfect follow-up to his acclaimed Stone Cold.
