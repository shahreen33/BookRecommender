Channon's birthday is supposed to be perfect, but Jack can't control everything, no matter how he wants to. When Channon's father shows up again in his life, Channon has to choose: between the father who has always let him down and the man he trusts to take care of him, no matter what.  But, really, who else could he choose? He knows who he belongs to, and who he wants to be with, always.
