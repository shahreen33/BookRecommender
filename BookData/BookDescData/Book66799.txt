Who can she trust when ever man she's ever dated cheated on her?She’s beautiful, outgoing and funny – everything I’m not.She’s searching for her next story and I want tenure.I can’t risk my career.And she won’t risk her heart.The more we’re together the more I want her.She thinks she’s not enough.But she’s everything to me.All I want is for her to trust in me.
