I’m the good girl from Ashton Hills.Rich. Pampered. Spoiled.Slowly suffocating under my mother’s stifling thumb.He’s the bad boy from Duncan.Poor. Abused. Criminal.Being swallowed by the darkness each passing second.Two lost souls searching for freedom and happiness.We’re lonely—broken—and trapped.Until the universe brings us together.Sometimes love is instantaneous.A supernova collision of emotions.Something that cannot be ignored.As our hearts tangle to the point they’ll never be able to part, the past comes creeping up like an evil villain. The mistakes of our parents become our consequences to face.We’re madly, deeply, foolishly in love.Soul mates who finally found each other.Two people who share the same father.
