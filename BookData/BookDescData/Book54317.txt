  Jake Steele
 novel-turned-blockbuster was being filmed in her little Napa Valley town…until disaster happens, ruining her business and good name.  Patrick Fitzgerald, the high-powered, playboy attorney at Lion Studios now has to charm the pants off the one woman who has been immune to his charms since day one. Never mind that the idea of getting her pants off is something he's been thinking of since the first moment he met her.  Both sides respond in such an outrageously surprising way that the entire nation takes notice….including a threat from Layla’s past.  Will old dangers and new betrayals force Layla and Patrick to stop butting heads long enough to realize what everyone else around them has already figured out?  They were meant to be together.  Warning: Due to adult language (including cursing) and steamy, graphic sexual encounters this is for 18+ only!   Note: Characters from ONE NIGHT have a few Cameos here, so if you're wondering how JAKE and NATALIE—plus one ;) — are doing, pick this one up today!
