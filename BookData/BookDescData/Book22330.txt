Their love never died, but her secrets could break his trust beyond repair. Texas Montgomery Mavericks, Book 1After six years and too much self-recrimination, rancher Mitch Landry is ready to admit he was wrong. He'd loved Olivia Montgomery but commitment wasn't high on his list back then. That was his first mistake. He's just divorced his second, and he's set to do whatever it takes to convince Olivia to give him another try. Through hard work, determination and more than a few tears, Olivia survived the break-up with Mitch. She's rebuilt her life around her business and the son she loves more than life itself. She's not proud of the mistakes she's made--particularly the secrets she's kept--but when life hands you manure, you use it to make something better of yourself...lest you get stuck in it. At a hot, muggy Dallas wedding, they reconnect. Olivia's first instinct is to play it cool, but after one devastating kiss things flare out of control, real fast. Maybe a quick roll in the hay will get him out of her system once and for all. Funny thing about hay though, once it's tangled in your hair, getting it out risks revealing things that were never meant to see the light of day. Warning: Contains hot sex, a vindictive ex-wife, and hot chocolate chip cookies.
