Spoiled Princess is what he used to call me.We were an inferno of hate and passion wound up with a dash of chaos.For four years I watched him mow my lawn.For four years I watched my friends make fun of him.For four years I hated myself for wanting him, but even more for the way I treated him.And then I had him.For one night, we put all labels away and I spent the best night of my life in his arms.Then the next day, with my secret night under lock and key, I looked the other way while my friends shamed him.But now the jokes on me, because the scrawny lawn boy who I secretly loved from afar is now the director of Hollywoods most exclusive summer camp.And I'm on his staff.Now it's his turn to punish me.His turn to make me pay.His turn to take his revenge after years of humiliation.He's no longer a boy you can ridicule.But a college graduate who can have any woman he wants.I want him to look at me the way he did that one night we had together, but right nowthe look in his eyes tells me he's going to enjoy having me under him for two straight months.I don't know where his hatred ends, his passion begins.All I know is he wants revenge.And I'm his lucky target.
