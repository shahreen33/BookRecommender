Always ready for a trip to the farm, John Pukite strapped on his overalls after the landslide success of A Field Guide to Cows and went back to work. The result is a one-of-a-kind field guide to the true entertainer of the farmyard: the pig. Although swine have roamed fields and forests for centuries, this guide is the first to offer easy-to-understand descriptions and illustrations of more than 30 breeds. The field guide also includes a time line of pig history, a list of famous and remarkable pigs, pig quotes, and much, much more. If you are hog-wild about pigs, this book needs to be on your bookshelf today!
