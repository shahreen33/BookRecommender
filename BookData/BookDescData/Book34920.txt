A Little Bit Of Angel LustSammael--call him Sam--was an angel once. An angel of Death. But the dispassionate, watch-from-above thing just wasn't working for him when it meant watching evil torture innocent souls day in and day out. It might have cost him his wings, but these days he gets to apply the direct method on the bad guys. Problem is, what's making his life difficult is a bad girl. . .Seline O'Shaw needs protection, and with the hounds of hell on her tail, she's not going to quibble too hard about where she gets it. Sam's virtue is questionable, but he's smoking hot, massively powerful, and owes her a favor. So what if she's getting a little case of angel lust? There are some damn deadly sins after her hide. . .Praise for Cynthia Eden's novels"Highly sensual and definitely dangerous." --Shannon McKenna on Hotter After Midnight"A wickedly unique voice in paranormal romance!" --Larissa Ione on I'll Be Slaying You"A fast-paced, sexy thrill ride you won't want to miss." --Christine Feehan on Eternal Hunter
