After getting slapped by his girlfriend in front of everyone, high school basketball team captain Jared Kippling needed something to vent off stress. A fat girl in his class happened to be the receiver of his wrath. But it turned out this girl was the daughter of one of his dad's potential business client. Jared's dad offered him a deal—befriend fatty and make a good impression on her father—in exchange for a Mercedes-Benz he had his eyes set on. Befriending a fatty? Walk in the park.A Jurassic Park! What Jared didn't expect was he was going to be caught in an embarrassing moment with her in a locker room, get punched by her childhood friend, get lost in a forest with her and of course, falling in love with her wasn't part of the plan either.
