Fate finally smiled upon me in San Diego, where I scored a serving position at a diner.One night after my shift, I decided to walk to a dive bar near my home to drown my sorrows. That was where I met him: the Master Vampire of the SoCal Clutch. It was either the biggest mistake of my life… or the best decision in the world.Buy Sora’s adventure now to read about a true heroine who comes into her own despite the odds being stacked against her.This series changes POV's.Clutch Mistress SeriesVampire MageAllied MageChosen MageAlpha MageThe SunderingDemon's Rage
