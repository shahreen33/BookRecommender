At Mountford University, Ranik Mason is the king of bad boys. He’s got every cheerleader dying to be in his bed, and the underage booze-circuit under his thumb. He’s a lone wolf who takes what he wants, but never takes anything seriously. At Mountford University, Alice Wells is the queen of nerds - studious, strict, and smart as a whip, she’s never had a boyfriend, let alone gotten drunk or partied. She’s an ice-cold teacher’s pet, determined to stick to rules and regulations if it kills her. Her one weakness is her massive crush on Theo, the mature, gorgeous campus DJ, and she’s determined to transform into the girl he wants.If anyone on campus knows how to seduce, it’s Ranik Mason. Alice approaches him with a contract – teach her how to win Theo, and she’ll do his coursework for a year. Ranik agrees, but as his lessons for Alice heat up, both of them start to realize love isn’t something you can teach. There’s a price. And both Alice and Ranik have to pay.
