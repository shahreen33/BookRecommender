Eight years ago, Fianna Morgan defied royal forest law and her father by entering Dinsmore Wood - and then ran for her life after witnessing a crime. Since that day, she has kept a hopeful eye out for the young man who saved her life, swore her to secrecy, and disappeared into the forest.Now nineteen, Fianna is burned out of her tenant home and forced to serve Lord Graham at Dinsmore Hall - where she recognizes his son, Gareth, as her rescuer from Dinsmore Wood.Yet Gareth claims he has never met Fianna. Confusing her even more, he seems concerned for her safety, but acts rude and distant; nothing like her caring rescuer of eight years ago.Determined to make Gareth acknowledge their past connection, Fianna corners him - and gets far more than she bargained for.
