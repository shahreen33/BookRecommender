Bobby Baxter is master of the gameworlds, an immortal who plays among the gods through the infinite reaches of the multiverse. There is just one problem; his parents think he is aimless and wasting his life away. They may be right, but then again, they may just be very, very wrong...All of the Atopia stories begin at the same moment in time so that you can start by reading any of them, and then read the others in any order you choose to slowly reveal the mystery and terrifying danger that connects them all. Atopia is a near future world without borders that teeters on the brink of post-humanism and eco-Armageddon.
