In The Heroic Boldness of Martin Luther, new from Reformation Trust Publishing, author Steven J. Lawson shows the convictions and practices that fed Luthers pulpit boldness. It all began with his deep commitment to the Word of God, through which he had come to his freeing understanding of justification by faith alone. Luther was outspoken in the pulpit because he was so deeply devoted to Scripture, seeing it as inspired, inerrant, clear, sufficient, and supremely authoritative. For these reasons, he believed that the preaching of the Word was to be at the heart of the churchs worship.
