The seventh volume in the popular Green Lantern series by New York Times best-selling author Robert Venditti!The Green Lantern Corps is lost and nowhere in this universe to be found. And over the past few years, the Green Lantern Corps has made a lot of enemies and been the scapegoat for a lot of bad that the Guardians of the Universe caused. Former Corps leader Hal Jordan takes it upon himself to assume the blame for all of the bad that the Green Lanterns have been accused of, and the universe is not happy. A bold new chapter of the Emerald Warrior's mythology is here in Green Lantern, Volume 7: Renegade.Collecting: Green Lantern 41-47
