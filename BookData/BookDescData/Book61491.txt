When acclaimed writer-artist Frank Miller began his celebrated run on the Marvel title, Daredevil, no one knew what to expect. They certainly didn't realize that a seemingly meek Greek college student by the name of Elektra would become one of the most popular and memorable characters in the post-modern, increasingly adult world of comic books.Telling the story of how the death of her father drove an innocent, naive college student into a deadly trained martial arts assassin, this seminal work stands alone among the great stories to ever be produced in the graphic storytelling medium. Elektra became so popular, in fact, that even after her death, interest in the character was so high that a yearlong, multi-part epic was created entirely for her. Elektra: Assassin was immediately recognized as being like nothing that had come before. The fragmented, complex script by Miller was both dramatically compelling and darkly satirical.
