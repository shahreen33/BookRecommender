It's a love story gone horribly, horribly wrong as the Joker's partner in crime takes the spotlight in this lushly illustrated hardcover volume featuring art by Terry Dodson and Rachel Dodson (WONDER WOMAN). There's never a dull moment as Harley bounces from botched schemes to close encounters with Gotham City's kingpins of crime, all the while making wisecracks and acting in the spirit of inspired lunacy. This volume includes appearances by Batman, Two-Face, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, the Penguin and more.
