No good deed goes unpunished…  For years, my family was in possession of the top half of an ancient sword. Now this dangerous artifact has been stolen and it’s up to me to recover it. With the help of my friends, I must follow the trail of clues to find both halves of the sword before they can be reforged. When my investigation leads me to an Elvis-impersonating vampire, a magic carpet lizard, and a homicidal banshee with no regard for the Fountains of Bellagio, I know I’m in for a rough ride.  My magic is the only thing that stands between absolute power and preservation. Can I prevent history from recurring or are we doomed to repeat it?
