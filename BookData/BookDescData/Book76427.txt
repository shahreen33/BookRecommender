I’m Blake McQueen, daughter of Miles McQueen: businessman, politician, all around upstanding member of the community.I’m told that name means something, but well, I’ve pretty much doused it in petrol, set it on fire, and taken a shit on it for good measure. I like to think of myself as a walking middle finger.My name is now synonymous with all forms of debauchery. I have to read the newspaper most mornings just to see where I was last night and my state of inebriation.Judge me all you like, love me, hate me. I don’t care.Life’s a party and you should never stop dancing.But even the sweetest of highs has it’s low. There is only so high you can go before you fall, and fall I did, right into the arms of the only man that could possibly stop me from crashing and burning. I’ve always been untouchable. I’ve never cared enough to be touchable. Until now.Rebellion never felt so good.
