The first book from 'This Dark Town' mystery thriller trilogy.  Eighteen-year-old Lydia Stone wakes up one morning in the north London gothic mansion she shares with her family, to find that her twin sister Kate has disappeared off the face of the earth.  CCTV footage shows Kate entering a night club in south London on the night she went missing, but there is no evidence that she ever came out of the club, and police are considering the idea that she was sex-trafficked.  In the days and weeks that follow, Lydia takes a closer look at her twin sister's life; her modelling career, penchant for fetish clubs, and interesting array of older friends. It seems like Kate was definitely hiding something.  But she isn't the only one...***** "A disturbing, gripping page-turner, it pulled me in further and further until I realised I was going to read it in one sitting. Thereâ€™s a sense of menace throughout and the narrative is addictive. FIVE STARS  ***** "There's no messing around with this book, it jumps straight into the action and keeps that pace up throughout. I love that it's set in my favourite parts of North London and there are some truly dark edges to the book."
