Lucas Daniels is mine!  That is what vampire Count Konstantin “the Wolf” Volk declares to his Vampire House, and even to his Sire, the ancient, dangerous vampire known only as the Nomad. His Sire wants Lucas dead. His closest advisers want Lucas enslaved. Because Lucas is no ordinary human.  Lucas finds himself eager to start work at Club Dyavol, even though his memories of his time there are hazy. There is one image burned into his memory: a set of brilliant green eyes that turned red. But no matter what awaits him at the elegant club, he is certain it is better than being around his overly attentive stepfather.  But is Lucas running from potential danger to a certain one?
