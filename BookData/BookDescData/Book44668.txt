The Youth and Teen Running Encyclopedia is the first ever complete guide for middle and distance runners ages 6 to 18, their coaches and parents. It shows the proven formula of Mick Grant, which produced National Champions several years in a row from a group of ordinary local kids, near Mick's home in Northeast Massachusetts. The book lays out in detail how youth and teen athletes can achieve successively higher levels, year after year after year, following the proven success of Mick's training program. What differentiates this program and this book from other programs and books is that it is a unique blend of building endurance and improving basic speed throughout the year, so that the athlete is much better next year than they are this year. The program uses a FUN FIRST approach, making sure the athletes enjoy what they are doing and stay healthy, to allow consistent training. It is the first such book to cover every topic imaginable for the youth and teen middle/distance runner, jammed packed with almost 200 pages of vital information. This book is a must read for all youth runners age 6 to 18, and anyone helping youth runners starting on the way to a lifelong enjoyment of running, and a successful running career. While this book is geared to youth runners, it is a valuable resource to all middle and long distance runners and coaches, regardless of age or level, because the same basic principles apply to all middle and long distance events..
