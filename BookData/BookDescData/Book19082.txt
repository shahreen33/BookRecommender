In 1999, my first husband was killed in an accident and I went from being a happily married woman one moment, to a widow with a twelve-year-old daughter the next. As a veteran of the life insurance industry I had always thought that if something were to happen i would be better prepared to cope with the crisis than others would, wrong! In my book WITH THE [STROKE] OF A PEN™, Claim Your Life. I have decided to ‘pay it forward’ and shared not only my story but also that of my second husband who lost his wife to terminal cancer. This book is both motivational and educational. With my experiences, i has compiled an extensive checklist to help individuals have the courageous conversations not only with their loved ones but also with their life insurance advisor, lawyer, accountant and funeral planner. This book is about helping people to prepare before an illness strikes or a crisis happens but also offers wonderful help after someone has died.
