My rebound wasn’t supposed to be the best sex of my life.  He definitely wasn’t supposed to walk into class Monday morning on my first day of college. He wasn’t supposed to be my teacher.  He did things to my body that no man had ever done before. Things I wanted him to do again And again. And again.  But the man I had in my bed two days ago was now off limits.  He was my teacher. I was his student.  I couldn’t have him... I wanted him anyway.  First Semester is a 50,000 word standalone novel and the first in The Campus Tales series.
