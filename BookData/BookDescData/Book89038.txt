They will be coming soon. They come every night.   Snow is falling softly as a young woman takes her last breath.   Fifteen miles away, two women sit silently in a dark kitchen. They don’t speak, because there is nothing left to be said.   Another woman boards a plane to escape the man who is trying to steal her life. But she will have to return, sooner or later.   These strangers have one thing in common. They each made one bad choice - and now they have no choices left. Soon they won’t be strangers, they’ll be family…   When DCI Tom Douglas is called to the cold, lonely scene of a suspicious death, he is baffled. Who is she? Where did she come from? How did she get there?   How many more must die? Who is controlling them, and how can they be stopped?
