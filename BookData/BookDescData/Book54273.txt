Book Two picks up directly where book one leaves off.  When Ransom Lawson met Willamina “Billy” Stanton on a deserted highway outside of Chatham, New Mexico, neither knew they were meeting their eternal soul mate. But is love enough to permanently bind two people from two vastly different lifestyles?  Coming in second to a motorcycle club and the unpredictable dangers that life presents is more than Ransom thinks Billy can handle. She deserves better and he tells her so. After his heart-wrenching rejection, Billy returns west to resume her “old life” to focus on her studies, where she thrives as a theater major at a local university in Northern California.  Ransom’s life is too entrenched in the MC headed by his father and current club Prez, Slade Lawson. Though Ransom is the youngest of Slade’s twin sons, he’s grooming Ransom to one day take over as the leader of the Immortals. But does Ransom want that responsibility especially when the honor is the birthright of his older twin brother Harley, the weak, impressionable son with the darkened soul?  Will Ransom and Billy find their way back to one another with all the obstacles they face, or are the pressures to conform to their family expectations end them for good? Will Harley, Pitch, and Digger see the error in their vile ways? Is Slade ready to put his hound dog tendencies behind him? And if so, is it too late for him and Claudia? Or has an unexpected attraction she has to another sealed their marriage’s fate?  The gangs all back with a couple of newcomers added into the mix.  BOOKS MUST BE READ IN ORDER.
