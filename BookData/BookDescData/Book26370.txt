It’s been nine years since I last saw Dante Santiago. I always had the biggest crush on Dante. That wasn’t easy either. He was always around, being that our families were so close. Dante was always the sweetest, most handsome guy I’ve ever seen. I was hoping to outgrow this childhood crush, but I’ve never stopped thinking about him. I’d hope that when I came home and saw him for the first time, those feelings would be done, or at least diminished, but no such luck. He is even more handsome than I remember. He was a fifteen year old boy when I left. Now he’s a man, and hot as hell!Demi Mitchell is, my best friend, Madoc’s little cousin. Her father is Digger, the President of the motorcycle club we belong to, so I’ve known Demi her whole life, and I’ve always considered her family. I’ve missed her very much since she left for school. Now she stands before me, all grown up…gorgeous. And God help me, the last thing I want to think of her as is family. If Digger even suspected the thoughts I am having about his little girl, he would kill me, along with her brother, Drew, another one of the clubs senior officers. Not to mention her Uncle Frank, the Vice President, and of course Madoc. Hell, my own father wouldn’t be too happy with me, either. But I can’t stop thinking about her.Can Demi and Dante fight the feelings they have for each other? Or will they defy their families and the MC to be together?
