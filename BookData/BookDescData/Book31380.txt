An M/M Non-Shifter Mpreg Romance. A long time ago, I met the alpha of my dreams.   We spent one night together, the most amazing of my life. He left me a note, but fate had other plans. I never knew his name, but he left me with something else—his babe in my stomach.  Now that my child and I have moved to a new town, I’ve found him again.

But he has a son, so he must have a mate. I still love him, that fiery ginger from the rock concert. And I wonder why his son looks a little like me.
