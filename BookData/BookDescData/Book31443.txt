An M/M Non-Shifter Mpreg Romance. Nothing is simple when you’re dating a single father.  I told myself after my alpha passed away that I might not ever find another. I would raise my son Dane the best I knew how and, when, years later, our family and friends were still acting as if I should mourn forever, I decided to move from The Netherlands to start over in the United States. My little guy deserved a bright future where he wasn’t constantly being asked if he missed a dad he didn’t even remember.  I didn’t do it with the intent of finding another alpha. After all, most omegas were lucky to find one to fall in love with, and I’d had mine. But when I saw Link, I knew he was mine. My true mate.  The moment Gustav walked into the room, and I took in his scent, my heart knew he was mine and there would never be another for me. It was perfect. Except his son disliked me on sight. Now I have no idea how to move on with my mate when someone so important to him disapproves. But I’m not going to give up. I’ve found not only my omega, but my family, my future. One I hope we can all share.  The Alpha’s Santa-Kissed Omega is a MM, Mpreg, non-shifter holiday romance with a strong, kind alpha, an intelligent loving omega, an adorable little boy who isn’t sure about his new situation, and a baby on the way.
