These topics have only become more urgent as the national conversation about race is increasingly acrimonious. This fully revised edition is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the dynamics of race in America."An unusually sensitive work about the racial barriers that still divide us in so many areas of life."-Jonathan Kozol
