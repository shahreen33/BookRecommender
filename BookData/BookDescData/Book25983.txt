Witch and independent bounty hunter Rachel Morgan has always managed to stay just ahead of trouble… until now. So she's dating a vampire, lives with another one, and is hiding a deadly ancient artifact that could change Inderland society forever--so what? But now her past has caught up with her. A serial killer stalks the Hollows, claiming victims across society and igniting a vicious Inderland gang war, while the vampire master Piscary is set free, and Rachel's demonic nemesis Algaliarept has discovered a way to move freely in the Hollows and will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. (And the less said about Rachel's love life, the better… much less the world's tackiest bridesmaid dress!).To stop the deadly battle for supremacy that follows, Rachel faces a terrible choice, and a bitter price almost too steep to pay.Packed with sexy supernatural action, adventure, intrigue, Kim Harrison's hardcover debut is poised to take her to an entirely new level.
