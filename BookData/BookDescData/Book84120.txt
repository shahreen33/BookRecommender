This a previously-published edition of ISBN 0141346809 (ISBN13: 9780141346809). Look, I didn't want to be a half-blood. I never asked to be the son of a greek god.I was just a normal kid, going to school, playing basketball, skateboarding. The usual. Until I accidentally vaporized my maths teacher.
