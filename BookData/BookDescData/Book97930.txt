For Xavier Pastrano, music and poetry have played a significant role throughout his life, but the roles they played were always separate. Noticing this divide, he set out to find a creative way to merge the two and create a product that would present a unique experience for readers. In Seeing Sounds, Pastrano attempts to create a chapbook that works as a mixed CD of sorts. The collection features 15 poems and illustrations that were inspired by songs, all carefully curated by Pastrano. To add to the experience, a Spotify playlist of the songs that inspired the poems and art was created, allowing readers to experience the book both aurally and visually and giving them the opportunity to create a personalized reading and listening experience.
