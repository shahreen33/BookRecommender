Manu Juric is a mediocre bounty hunter. But he’s damn good at reading people and creating unexpected explosions — and that can take you a long way in this business.Not far enough, he learns when he tries to take out one of Bulari’s most notorious crime lords: Willem Jaantzen.After the attempt is horribly botched, Jaantzen spares Manu’s life in exchange for joining up with his motley crew for one small heist. There’s a reason Manu avoids teamwork: it’s the worst. And as the increasingly unpredictable job plunges Manu into an ever-tangling web of uneasy dangers and bristly egos, he realizes he’s going to need to find some allies — fast.And the one man he may need to trust the most is the one he’s been contracted to kill.NEGATIVE RETURN is the second book in Jessie Kwak’s Durga System series, a fast-paced series of gangster sci-fi novellas set in a far-future world where humans may have left their home planet to populate the stars, but they haven’t managed to leave behind their vices. And that’s very good for business.
