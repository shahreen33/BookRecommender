***NEW YORK TIMES &amp; USATODAY Bestselling Series***  Love is what makes us. It’s also what breaks us.  If this is true, Rowen just became the proverbial wrecking ball to Jesse’s life.  Upon discovering Rowen is pregnant after taking every precaution to ensure otherwise due to a life-threatening heart condition, Jesse is forced to face too many harsh realities and they send him into a desperate, dark place. To consider the possibility that he might lose his wife and unborn child is too much for Jesse to bear.  The situation is out of his control, so he gloms on to the few things he can control. Like noting Rowen’s every move, or dialing the doctor whenever her face goes a shade pale, or even acknowledging the fact he’d be willing to make a deal with the devil in exchange for his wife’s and child’s lives. There’s nothing he wouldn’t do or give or sacrifice to keep them from harm.  But what happens when the devil takes that deal Jesse struck, and the tables turn? A life for a life. A soul for a soul. A heart for a heart. His life for theirs.   Love is what makes us. It’s also what breaks us.  Love’s made Jesse and Rowen. Love’s about to break them too.
