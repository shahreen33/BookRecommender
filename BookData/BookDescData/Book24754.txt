Montgomery's granddaughter.Every girl dreams of her perfect wedding day...For Anne Shirley, those dreams are about to come true as she marries her one true love, Gilbert Blythe, in the dappled sunshine of the old orchard at Green Gables. Soon the two will be moving to their own little dream house on the misty shores of Four Winds Harbor. And a new home means new neighbors--including the adventurous lighthouse keeper Captain Jim and the tragically beautiful Leslie Moore. In their first years together, Anne and Gil will experience both heartbreak and joy, and, of course, plenty of "scope for the imagination."With Anne's beautiful gift of transforming the everyday into the extraordinary, it's easy to see why she's become a beloved classic of generations of readers around the world and a favorite of everyone from Mark Twain to Duchess Kate.
