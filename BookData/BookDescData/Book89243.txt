I once lived in two different worlds—billionaire businessman by day, fighter by night. When the suit came off, the gloves came on. It’s been five years since I last stepped into the Octagon, since my life spun out of control. I haven’t even so much as gone near a fighting ring. I promised my family I’d never raise my fists again. But when my best mate, Les, lands himself in trouble with a notorious Dublin crime lord, I must break my promises. I have to do the one thing I vowed never to do: fight. I have to fight to save him and everyone in his life . . . including Anna Drake, the innocent and gorgeous woman Les tricked into rooming with him. Anna Drake is off limits. She’s innocent and sweet—everything that I’m not. She’s also interning at my company—a lawsuit waiting to happen.I have to save her, to pull her and Les out of the mess that he’s made. But the more time we spend together, the more I’m falling for her. And the more I fight, the more I crave it. I don’t deserve Anna . . . and yet, without her, I’m not sure if I can save myself.
