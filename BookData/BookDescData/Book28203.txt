A practice game with the strong team Osaka Kiryu. Miyuki and Furuya turn the course of the game their way by striking out the opposing Ace. After that, Sawamura inherits the momentum of that game for his first time pitching in a real game!! Sawamura pitches, feeling strongly that he wants Miyuki, who became his reason to enter Seido, to acknowledge his skill. But he realizes that the new task at hand is to show his definite growth on the mound...!!
