After a betrayal at the hands of his son’s mother, he swore off women, and relationships and was just fine with his life. Until she strolled into his life with her soft smile beguiling eyes. Regina Perkins was the one woman who made him willing to risk it all for one chance to hold her in his arms.  Contemporary Romance / BWWM / HEA
