Fresh off of the heels of the hit Justice League feature film, the next volume of DC's flagship series is here in Justice League Vol. 6: The People vs. The Justice League! When the League is confronted by three concurrent threats, a sleep-deprived Batman makes a crucial error that causes an unthinkable--and potentially unforgivable--tragedy. The team must regain its balance quickly, as an alien infestation threatens the Earth. But nothing can prepare them for an attack closer to home...one that will reveal devastating truths about the League itself! Legendary Eisner Award-nominated writer Christopher Priest (Deathstroke) is joined by artist Pete Woods for a brand-new, must-read Justice League story like you've never seen before! Collects JUSTICE LEAGUE #34-38
