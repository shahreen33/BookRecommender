Subtitled "a play for Gaza" this is British playwright Caryl Churchill's response to the situation in Gaza in January of 2009. Structured as the text of seven statements parents might say to their children either in response to the events or attempting to explain them, they express regret, anger, intelligence, blind hatred, fear, and compassion.
