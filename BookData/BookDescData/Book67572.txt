 
  I’m coming for Underbelly Circus… to burn it to the ground.
 My whole life, I’ve wished for family but found foes instead. All this changed in a matter of days when I met the guys from Haret - my dragon, shifter, mage, fae, merman, and vampire.Each man has his own unique magic, and as a Qilin, I have the power to channel it.
  There’s one huge problem, though.
I got my piece of dragon, but if the Ringmaster finds out, he’ll use Jack to get to us. With Underbelly controlling Jack, we don’t know who trust.
  It’s time to fight the Ringmaster for everything he has.
The guys’ magic is mine for the taking, as long as I can wrap my head around the way Qilin do harems. With these gorgeous guys, that shouldn’t be hard.
  I’m Carlyle Licorne, and I’m here to take back what’s mine.
