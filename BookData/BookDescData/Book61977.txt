With the dramatic growth of interest in the religions and mysticism of the East, more and more people have become fascinated by "mantras," the sacred formulae memorized for meditation in India, China, and Tibet. Their precise meaning and exactly how they work have, understandably, long been surrounded by an aura of secrecy in order to guard against distortion and abuse. In this unique and beautifully illustrated book, John Blofeld, an acknowledged authority on Buddhist yogic contemplation, explains the significance and operation of these sacred "words of power." Meditators chant them sonorously and rhythmically or repeat them inwardly, and often visualize the syllables as emanating rays of gloriously colored light. The efficacy of mantras as an aid to meditation is beyond doubt, but many people believe that the syllables themselves are imbued with marvelous or miraculous powers. Blofeld explores these more controversial aspects with great insight and sensitivity. Much of his knowledge is derived from first-hand experience and from the monks and lamas encountered during a lifetime in the East.
