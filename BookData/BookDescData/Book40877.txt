"He advanced on her, dropping Pete's wrapped packages in the snow. She allowed him to catch her much too easily. He held her close enough to count her eyelashes, close enough that his breath riffled the fine hairs at her temple. He couldn't resist her."   Lacy Williams is a USA Today bestselling author of the acclaimed Wyoming Legacy and Cowboy Fairytales series.  About COUNTERFEIT COWBOY:  He needs a fresh start.  Former con man Jesse Baker is two days out of prison with no prospects and trying to fulfill a promise made to his dying cell mate.

She's stronger than anyone knows.  Erin O'Grady has something to prove. There’s more to her than the spoiled socialite her father sees and she’ll journey West alone for Christmas to prove it. It’s providence that she meets Jesse and his little brother Pete and she's always been good at making friends...  Jesse’s lies keep piling up as the journey continues. Until one powerful truth hits home--he’s falling for Erin. But everything she believes about him is a lie...
