His wolf can sense her, but is he worthy of her?  Forget what anyone tells you: the holidays are hell. Bickering family members, rushed shopping and every woman stressing over setting the perfect holiday spread. Ginger knew this full well as she struggled to keep her cakes and pastries in stock. It was a good problem to have, but lately it seemed like all she had were problems. But just when you think you have life figured out, six feet of the right kind of problem walks in the door. Now there's a problem I'd like to tackle.... Wait, what's going on with his eyes?  Jack is on the hunt. Not for an enemy, and not for the delicious moose he sometimes indulges in back home in Alaska. What's brought him to Gray Creek, ND is his idiot brother. Who travels across the country to get involved in something that doesn't concern him? His brother, Connor, that's who. But before he can grab Connor and drag him back to Alaska, he meets her, and she's something fierce.  Every Monday in 2019 I'll be releasing a brand new novella for you to gobble up! Keep up with the Shifter Babies of America series and enjoy a nice little one-sitting story!
