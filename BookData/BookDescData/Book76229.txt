Jock-jerk. Arrogant hockey player who thinks he’s god’s gift to women. That’s the Tucker Kane I know.Three years ago we hooked-up, and he walked away like it was nothing. Like I meant nothing. Now, he needs my help to pass a class.When I get a message from PuckMe_69 in response to my tutoring post, I have no idea it’s Tucker. He has no clue I’m the girl from his past who still hates his guts. At first, I tell him to go puck himself and walk away. But he’s as persistent as he is sexy. And I need the money.So, we come to an agreement. One that ends with us breaking all the rules… and if I’m not careful, my heart.
