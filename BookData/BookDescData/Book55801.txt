I'm a stick-to-the-rules, planning-it-all-out kind of girl. As a city event planner's assistant, my plan is to check off every box on my to-do list and make sure the Fireman's New Year's ball goes off without a hitch.Everything is in order. Until nothing turns out to be the way it is. Kissing Gabe Blanco, the sexy fireman with chocolatey eyes and a dirty mouth, was not on my to-do list, but now I can't think of anything else I would rather do. There was no way I could have planned on him, but he's tempting enough for me to throw caution to the wind.Temps might be dropping outside, but this OTT whirlwind insta-love will have you slightly hot under the collar.
