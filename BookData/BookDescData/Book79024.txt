Turmoil is never-ending for Lizzie. She has every reason to celebrate after completing the seemingly impossible task the witch has put upon her, but her cunning adversary, Nia, who’s a bit of a psycho, continues to cause her angst. It all comes to a head during a magical evening at the Varkarola Festival leading to an impromptu romantic interlude for Lizzie but also a host of pressing questions…"While plots may possess touches of the supernatural, they are set in a real and familiar world, which renders the incredible somehow plausible." ~Hilary Whitton Paipeti, author of In the Footsteps of Lawrence Durrell and Gerald Durrell in Corfu
