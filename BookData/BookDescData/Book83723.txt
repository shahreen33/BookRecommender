   So I was pretty sure my dead ex-boyfriend’s brother hated me…until he asked me to marry him.  And pretend his brother’s baby—which I’m carrying, BTW—is really his.  So now I’m suddenly the wife of a quirky tech billionaire, and falling in like with him so fast, it’s beginning to feel an awful lot like love. But we both have issues, and there are shadows creeping around the edges of our fledgling relationship. Can two people as different as we are make a pretend relationship real?  Find out if the Freak and the Geek can find their way to a happy ending in this unique standalone interracial romance. Perfect for those who prefer their heroines off-beat and their alphas super geeky. One-click now to discover why real heroes wear glasses!
