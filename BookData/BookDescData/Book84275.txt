To keep the money, he has to keep her as well…Cecily Nottingham has made a huge mistake. The marriage bed was still warm when the earl she thought she loved crawled out of it and announced that he loved someone else. Loves. Someone else.All he saw in Cecily was her dowry. But he’s in for the shock of his life, because in order to keep the money, he has to keep her. With nothing to lose, Cecily sets out to seduce her husband’s cousin, Stephen Nottingham, in an attempt to goad the earl into divorcing her. Little does she realize that Stephen would turn out to be everything her husband was not: Honorable, loyal, trustworthy…Handsome as sin.Stephen only returned to England for one reason—save his cousin’s estate from financial ruin. Instead, he finds himself face to face with his cousins beautiful and scorned wife. Only now that he's home, he isn’t sure what to do first, strangle his cousin, or kiss his wife. His honor is about to be questioned, right along with his self-control. Amid snakes, duels and a good catfight, Cecily realizes the game she’s playing has high stakes indeed.  There are only a few ways for a marriage to end in Regency England and none of them come without a high price. Is she willing to pay it? Is Stephen? A ‘Happily Ever After’ hangs in the balance, because, yes, love can conquer all, but sometimes it needs a little bit of help.
