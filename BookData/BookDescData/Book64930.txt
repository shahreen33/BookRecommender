Finger and thumb prints are turned into an array of animals through the addition of simple illustration and photographs in this innovative 123 book, which has been designed to develop children's counting and number recognition skills. The imaginative, rhythmic text is fun to read and listen to, and the individual ridges on all of the finger and thumb prints are embossed, adding a tactile, interactive element.
