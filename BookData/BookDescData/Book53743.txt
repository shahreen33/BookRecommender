The life goals have stacked up since I started this journey as a sad, lonely little ghost. I’m not sure how things escalated so quickly from trying to be seen and heard, to bearing the weight of the world on my vain little shoulders.As a result, my goals have gotten a little more serious…Goal #14: Learn to take a hit without breaking or suffering some type of death.Goal #15: Decide once and for all if I’m going to save or destroy the world. I’m not sure why people put this sort of responsibility on hell-spawn like me.Goal #16: Practice my evil laugh, because all hell-spawn need a good evil laugh.Goal #17: Find and kill all the unicorns. Mwahahahahaha.Goal #18: Live to enjoy forever with the guys I sacrificed all my memories to save.Goal #19: No matter what, they don’t get to die. Or I really will be THE Apocalypse.We’re the most screwed up collection of antiheroes the world has ever seen, because the only thing that makes me want to save the world is knowing I could lose my boys forever if I don’t. It’s one HELL of a love story, you know?**Sexual Content.**Language Warning.**Dark humor.**Reverse Harem.**Series FINALE. (Read in order: Four Psychos, Three Trials, Two Kingdoms, and One Apocalypse.
