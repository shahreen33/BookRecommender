If you are twelve years old and accidentally locked up in the Smithsonian Institution for the night, well you just have to do something. And Gib did it by striking up a conversation with Owney, the famous canine mascot of the Post Office. Owney tells Gib his life story, embellished with Owney's own estimate of his brilliance and bravery. And what a life story: Owney surf-rides a whale; he meets and charms the emperor of Japan; he outwits Chinese bandits; he saves the Illinois railroad yards from a bomb explosion. Owney really did travel, so not all the tales are quite as tall as they seem.
