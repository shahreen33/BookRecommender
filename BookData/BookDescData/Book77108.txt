Caitlin is getting married on the Vineyard. And the early magic of their long, complicated friendship has faded. But Caitlin has begged Vix to come to her wedding, to be her maid of honor.

And, after all these years, she needs to know why her best friend—her summer sister—still has the power to break her heart...
