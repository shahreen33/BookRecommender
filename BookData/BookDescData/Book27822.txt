A beach vacay with my best bud since college seems like the perfect opportunity to relax, catch some rays, and enjoy a couple of nights on the town. When I find a girl who's eager to mess around with me, I figure I've got it made.Then I meet the intense, hot-as-hell, tattooed Eric Westright, who wrecks my world...in the best possible way.He awakens something within me-something that's always been here, but that's never pulled so powerfully...not until I looked into those solemn blue eyes and felt the red-hot spark of his touch.There's something about this chemistry that's so intoxicating, and the more I get to know him, the harder it becomes for me to resist these impulses that overtake me-that leave me wanting him to show me what it feels like to have a man inside me.I know he's fighting too. It's so wrong, but every kiss, every caress, every stroke feels so right. We shouldn't act on these urges, but we can't help ourselves.First he claims my body, then he claims my heart.And before I know it, I'm in too deep with my best friend's father...
