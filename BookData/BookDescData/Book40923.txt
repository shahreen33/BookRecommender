Can a religious separatist and an opportunistic spy make it in the New World?A brand new series for fans of all things related to history, romance, adventure, faith, and family trees.

The season is far too late for good sailing and storms rage, but reaching land is no better as food is scarce and the people are weak. Will Mary Elizabeth survive to face the spring planting and unknown natives? Will William be branded a traitor and expelled?
