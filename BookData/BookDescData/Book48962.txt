The creator of the popular Tumblr and Instagram "Quarter Life Poetry" tackles the real-life truths of work, money, sex, and many other challenges 20-somethings face in a laugh-out-loud collection of poetry.Samantha Jayne knows that life post-college isn't as glamorous as all undergrads think it's going to be... because she's currently living it. A graphic artist, Sam started creating doodles and funny poems about her life as a 25-year-old. And when she decided to put them on Instagram, the captions were full of other people tagging friends and saying, "This is literally us." At a time where it seems like everyone around you is getting married, making more money than you do, and paying off their student loans, Sam's poetry captures the voice of millennials everywhere who know that being in your 20s can sometimes be the exact opposite of "the best years of your life."
