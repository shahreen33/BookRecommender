Tragedy rarely visits alone; when one hero falls, more usually follow, such is the nature of war. Whilst Cheung travels Brisance and the Black Guild tears itself apart, Correia Burr rides for The Marches with her trusted Pathfinders, in search of an enemy they know nothing about. But when her network of informers yield little, Correia makes a necessary decision to lead her closest companions beyond Altolnâ€™s borders, into Sirreta and the unknown. What they find forces Correia back, and on again, in a race to Wesson, leaving far more than her friends behind. Throughout it all: massing armies, shocking betrayals and devastating, heart-breaking losses, a familiar name continues to be whispered on the lips of many: Dignaaln, emissary.
