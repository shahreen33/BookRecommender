Many people know that Sherlock Holmes was an enigmatic detective who, with his companion Dr. Watson, pursued criminals through Victorian and Edwardian England. What, perhaps, they don't know is that he investigated 60 fully documented cases, including 37 murders; that 46 of those cases began in his offices at 221B Baker Street; that only three of them involved his nemesis Moriarty; and that in his later years Holmes spent his time beekeeping on the Sussex Downs.
