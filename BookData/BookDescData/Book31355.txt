  You can’t plan when you’ll fall in love—sometimes it just kinda sneaks up on you.
  Todd Foxx was only looking to unwind from the stress of running The Sausage Shack when he went out for an evening of fun at The Big O. After he ended the evening by hooking up with a hot new alpha in town, he certainly never thought he’d see him again.  Hugo Keller left his high-profile job as a certified cicerone back east and moved across country to take a brewmaster job in Hollydale’s unique beer garden and sausage restaurant. A single dad, his only plans involved giving his young son a place to put down roots and focusing on his new job—even if it was a major step down from where he began. He certainly never expected to see his smoking hot one night stand again.  Can two men—and one precocious little boy—find a way to make a family? As Hugo and Todd slowly journey from lovers to coworkers to friends and back to lovers, they’ll need to deal with an ex-wife with boundary issues, a surprise pregnancy, and mysterious “mill girls” who like to giggle in the night.  Return to the world of Hollydale with a quirky romance full of all the fluffy feels and sweet heat that you’d expect from a Hollydale story. This is the ninth book of The Hollydale Omegas series but is absolutely able to be read as a standalone. This is a 42k novel and definitely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.
