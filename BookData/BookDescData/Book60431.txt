When I left home at eighteen, I was determined never to look back. My boyfriend Tyler, the only man I’ve ever loved, was supposed to follow me. But eight long years passed, and I never heard from him again.  Now I’m back and have opened my heart once again. Dean is strong and patient, exactly what I need after the death of my mother. But I had no idea that the man I am falling for is my ex’s stepbrother.  My heart is torn between two brothers—an old love and a new. I can’t decide which one I want…  But maybe I don’t have to.  Brothers next door is an MFM menage romance with a happy ever after ending. It also contains Her Billionaire Bosses - A MFM Menage Romance for your continued reading pleasure.
