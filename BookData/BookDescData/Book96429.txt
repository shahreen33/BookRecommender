The Tarian Pride is right in the middle of a historical power-shift. Ronin Alder is taking over as the New Tarian Alpha, but the entire Pride of lion shifters needs to be completely rehabilitated. Back in the Pride after years hating it, his job is to push the monsters here to a new future, one where they will stop warring with every shifter Crew in existence. But when he mans a rescue mission and finds a hurt woman in the woods, he had no choice but to save her…or kidnap her. And when he learns her story, and recognizes just who, and what, she is, his entire future as Alpha of the New Tarians takes a new direction. His life had been laid out before him, but now he wants so much more. He wants Emerald.  Emerald Lawson is a descendant of one of the original Tarians, her bloodline highly coveted by the Old Tarian Alpha, Cassius. He’s put her between a rock and a hard place and turned her entire life upside down. She’s accepted her fate on the throne of the Old Tarians until she stumbles upon a man on a mission in the woods. When she’s kidnapped by the New Tarian Alpha, one day with Ronin changes her life forever. How can she go back to living in a cage after he’s set her free? She’s a submissive lioness who doesn’t belong, but Ronin challenges Emerald to be something she’s never been before—fearless. And as a new uprising begins, she will find herself at the helm of a destiny that could change the entire future of the Tarian Pride.
