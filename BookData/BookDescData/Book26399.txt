When I opened my eyes, I was in a cell, my body covered in bruises.Not a jail.I’d been kidnapped and imprisoned.I wasn’t alone. I shared the cell with Garin Woods, the man I’d loved since I was a kid.The man I couldn’t be with because of the secret. A man who would kill me if he found out what that secret was.Someone wanted to torture me.Torture us.One of us deserved it.It wasn’t Garin.
