Garrett was at his breaking point.  There were only so many times in a week you should have to see someone you were…attracted to…infatuated with…but certainly didn’t have a crush on. Doms didn’t have those. Especially on a customer who probably wasn’t even gay, much less a sub. Business 101—do not flirt with a client.  Wyatt was losing his mind.  Hiding his obsession was getting harder and harder. All he wanted to do was kneel in front of Garrett and call him Master. But the sexy insurance agent never seemed to see him. He only noticed the nervous, awkward insured who came in way too often. When the two men are missing what’s right in front of their faces, it might take family stepping in to point out the obvious. That they were meant for each other.   39k words  Story Contains: M/m sexual content, BDSM elements, spanking, and orgasm denial.
