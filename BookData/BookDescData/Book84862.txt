An ALA Notable Children's Book, Honey, I Love and Other Love Poems includes sixteen poems that tell of love and the simple joys of everyday life, seen through the eyes of a child: playing with a friend, skipping rope, riding on a trainâ€”or keeping Mama company till Daddy gets back.Each of these sixteen "love poems" is spoken straight from the perspective of a child. Riding on a train, listening to music, playing with a friend...each poem elicits a new appreciation of the rich content of everyday life. The poems are accompanied by both portrait and panorama drawings that deepen the insights contained in the words.This beloved book of poetry is a Reading Rainbow Selection and the winner of George C. Stone Center for Children's Books' Recognition of Merit Award.
