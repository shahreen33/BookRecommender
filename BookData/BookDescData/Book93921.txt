A mother and daughter with a shared talent for healing--and for the conjuring of curses--are at the heart of this dazzling first novelConjure Women is a sweeping story that brings the world of the South before and after the Civil War vividly to life. Spanning eras and generations, it tells of the lives of three unforgettable women: Miss May Belle, a wise healing woman; her precocious and observant daughter Rue, who is reluctant to follow in her mother's footsteps as a midwife; and their master's daughter Varina. The secrets and bonds among these women and their community come to a head at the beginning of a war and at the birth of an accursed child, who sets the townspeople alight with fear and a spreading superstition that threatens their newly won, tenuous freedom.Magnificently written, brilliantly researched, richly imagined, Conjure Women moves back and forth in time to tell the haunting story of Rue, Varina, and May Belle, their passions and friendships, and the lengths they will go to save themselves and those they love.Advance praise for Conjure Women"Afia Atakora brings the Civil War South to life so beautifully with Conjure Women,  a heartbreaking joy to read."--Martha Hall Kelly, New York Times bestselling author of Lilac Girls
