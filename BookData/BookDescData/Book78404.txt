From USA Today Bestselling author, the second book in the Laurel Springs Emergency Response Team Series  If you don't love, you can't get hurt...  Nick Kepler  One thing my childhood taught me was never show my emotions. Don’t make memories. Don’t count on other people. Don’t hope for the best.  All that changed when I was adopted by Ryan and Whitney Kepler.  Begrudgingly I let them into my life, along with my new sister and a best friend I would lay down my life for. But giving up my heart and accepting love in return from Kelsea Harrison? It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever tried to do.  And the truth is? I’m not sure if I’m that strong.  Kelsea Harrison  From the very moment I met Nick Kepler I knew he would be the love of my life. Problem is I haven’t been able to convince him of that yet.  When our best friends get married, Nick and I spend a drunken night letting our walls down and losing all our inhibitions. In one moment I’m given everything I ever wanted. Then, in the blink of an eye it’s taken away from me.  The question is, can I be strong for the both of us?  The answer? I have to be.
