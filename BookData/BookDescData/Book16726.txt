Autumn Winters, one of the few survivors of the deadly Crimson Fever, has escaped Los Angeles with the underground resistance and has been given sanctuary with the Hoover Settlement. They’re one of the few holdouts against the powerful and sadistic Reconstruction Front, who plot to overtake every post-plague community within their reach. But when devastating weather sparks an emergency mission to Hoover’s sister city, Autumn is forced to re-team with her estranged true love to fight for their very survival. Autumn in the Dark Meadows is the second novel in The Autumn Series, followed by Autumn in the City of Lights.
