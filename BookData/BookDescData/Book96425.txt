**Don't miss this final installment of T. S. Joyce's bestselling New Tarian Pride series.**  Annamora Fredrickson is turning a new leaf. Four months ago, she saw a picture of herself that made her determined to change her whole life. She’s a shifter on a mission, and nothing can stand in her way…except for perhaps one person. One hot as fire, smooth-talking heir to the Deadlies throne, Orion Burge. It doesn’t matter that he is way out of her league, her little heart has had a crush on him since their time with the Old Tarian Pride. Only she’s not as smooth as she was back then, and she’s messing up every opportunity to talk to him. While she’s falling hard for the quiet monster, Orion has a big destiny that is looming right in front of him, and the more secrets she finds out about him, the more she realizes that destiny does not include her.  Orion is headed right for a storm. He’s killed the last Alpha of the Deadlies Pride, and now it’s his time to take it over. There’s only one tie that has him lingering with the New Tarian Pride though, and that’s one shy, awkward, sometimes-witty, always-charming Annamora. Does she even know all of the secret ways he’s protected her? And he’s not done yet. Now he owes it to her to protect her one last time…from himself.   Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. Intended for mature audiences.
