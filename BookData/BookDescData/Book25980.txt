He was the last great hero of his generation. Velma Martinez—Velveteen—had never intended to be a great hero, but she was out of choices.“Hello, Jolly Roger.”“Hello, bunny-eared girl who’s taken over my ship. Have you come to collect the bounty on my head?”“I’ve come because Dame Fortuna told me how to find you, and we need your help.” Velveteen crossed her arms. “The Super Patriots are corrupt, and I think Marketing is evil, and they have my best friend, and we want her back.”Jolly Roger blinked, several times, before turning to the Princess. “Is she for real?”“She is,” said the Princess, sounding smug. “She would have been happy stayin’ out of the way for her entire life, but The Super Patriots forgot the first rule of rabbits. Don’t follow them into their dens. They’re meaner than they look.”_____Velma hadn’t wanted to be a superhero, had walked away from it all once before. But when love and friendship call Velveteen to fight, she can’t run away, no matter the odds.Award-winning author Seanan McGuire chronicles Velveteen’s ultimate battle in this concluding (for now!) volume of her adventures.
