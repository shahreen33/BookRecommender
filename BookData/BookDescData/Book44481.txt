The vision of Liza Flynn was burned into my mind. My heart pounded. Here it was. Just what I had always been seeking. The big thrill.I was going to find who killed her husband and the prize would be the loveliest woman I had ever seen. A woman whoâ€™d never been touched, really. I could look at her and sense that it was all there, waiting. The hellfire and the thrill and the excitement. It was going to be pure hell for the guy who really woke her up. And I was the guy that was going to do it!
