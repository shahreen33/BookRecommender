Dragons vs Firefighters vs the Phoenix. The scorching fantasy sequel to Smoke Eaters.With ex-firefighter Cole Brannigan in command of the Smoke Eaters, the dragon menace is under control. Thanks to non-lethal Canadian tech, the beasts are tranquilized and locked up, rather than killed. But for Tamerica Williams, this job filled with action and danger, has become tediously routine.When a new threat emerges, a legendary bird of fire - the Phoenix - it's the perfect task for Williams. But killing the Phoenix just brings it back stronger, spreading fire like a plague and whipping dragons into a frenzy. Will it prove to be too much excitement, even for adrenalin-junkie Williams?File Under:  Fantasy [ Smoke Em - Catch and Release - Fire Bird - Arson About ]
