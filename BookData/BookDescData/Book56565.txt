I tried to put him behind bars. Then he put me in a cage.When I set out to show Eddie Vasco he’s not above the law, there was something I didn’t realize.He is above the law.That’s why I’m in a cage, wearing nothing but a tail, with the sting of his belt reminding me how disobedient pets are punished. That’s why he’s going to use me as roughly as he pleases.
