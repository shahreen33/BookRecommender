Samantha Leigh and Steuart James DuBoise reside in a complex world of southern love and crazy dysfunction. They snack on cold buttered biscuits, drink sweet iced-tea, and create stories on the sleeping porch of their grandmother's bay-front home. Life changes abruptly when the family moves more than a thousand miles from the only home they have ever known. Encouraged by their grandmother, and armed with unique talents, Sam and Steuart begin their adventure in this coming-of-age, young adult novel. Who are the Wayward Gifted? The Wayward Gifted - Broken Point was co-authored by Mother/Son writing team, Donna K. Childree and Mike L. Hopper. This is their first novel.
