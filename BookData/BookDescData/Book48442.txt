It's rumoured that Dickens wanted to return to his classic novel Oliver Twist, to bring him back into a later book as an older character, but he never managed this before he died. However, if Oliver had returned, what would he have been like? Would the scars of his childhood affect the man he would become? And what of 'Dodger', sent to a land halfway around the world, his friend, mentor and master dead because of Oliver? Dodge &amp; Twist is that story. The tale of two boys, 12 years later, returning into each other's lives - for both good and bad.This Audible Original production of Dodge &amp; Twist is fully dramatised with an immersive SFX soundscape and is performed by a full cast including Stephen Mangan as Charles Dickens (Green Wing, Episodes, I'm Alan Partridge), Matt Lucas as Fagin (Little Britain, Me, Bridesmaids, Alice in Wonderland), Kara Tointon (Eastenders, Mr Selfridge, The Sound of Music Live) and Michael Socha (Being Human, This is England), and introducing Will Howard and James Joyce as Oliver and Dodger.
