  A M/M BDSM Romance
Grant had found his perfect man…wrapped in silk and lace.  Grant had always loved more feminine men. A sexy guy in lingerie just did it for him. But when you looked more like a bouncer than an insurance agent, the pretty guys ran for the hills. Carter seemed different, though. When he looked at Grant, he saw the real man underneath the tattoos and muscles. Could Grant make him understand that he liked Carter just the way he was, or would Carter’s doubts keep them apart?  Carter had found his perfect man…sweet, sexy, and built like a tank.  Grant didn’t seem to mind Carter’s more feminine look, but was he too good to be true? One bad date after another had left Carter gun-shy. Now he had Mr. Right standing at his doorway. Did he have the courage to be himself and let Grant in, or would his fears keep them apart?
