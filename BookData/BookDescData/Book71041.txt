Warren Williams  In high school, I was bullied. I know, bullies are a dime a dozen and most of the behaviors of young, dumb children can be forgiven and even forgotten. But there is one bully I'll never forget. His name was Asher Douglas and I had the most ridiculous crush on him… until the day he and his friends tricked me into thinking he liked me and then dumped actual feces on my head and filmed the whole thing. It was my biggest humiliation, and not just because of the crap. It was because I'd honestly thought Asher was a good guy up until that point. It's too bad he's now my brother's best friend and business partner… and the man investigating the disappearance of a girl I might have information about.  Asher Douglas  My biggest regret revolves around a gorgeous young man I had a crush on years before and people I thought were my friends. I never got the chance to set the record straight with Warren, because he moved to a new school and wouldn't answer any correspondence from me at all over the years. Not that I could blame him. When a job takes me to Crossville where my partner and best friend has decided to move with his mate, I'm excited for the chance to maybe FINALLY tell Warren what really happened that day in the school parking lot, years before. What I didn't expect was that he would turn out to be my mate… and not interested in my explanation, or me at all.  Warning: Mpreg elements!  Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama.  Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses::
