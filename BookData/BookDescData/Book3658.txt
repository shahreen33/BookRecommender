To say Emi Hennigan’s life over the past two years has had its share of peaks and valleys is an understatement – and her friends and family would agree. With the unanticipated romance with her best friend, and the unforeseen friendship with her brother’s acquaintance, Emi sees a new future unfolding right before her pale green eyes. Her optimism returning, she is gaining more confidence in her emotions, and she welcomes her newfound happiness. Jack Holland is elated that Emi has allowed him into her life. For him, it was love at first sight when they met in college, and after years of keeping his feelings in check at the advice of his best friend, he is finally free to express to Emi exactly how she affects him. Always practical and level-headed, the growing romance inspires Jack to let down his guard. His patience rewarded, everything appears to be falling into place until Emi delivers shocking news to Jack that will force him to reevaluate his priorities. Knowing what he’s always wanted in life, he has to decide what he’s willing to sacrifice to be with the woman he loves – even if he’s not always certain his feelings are returned. In the conclusion to Emi Lost & Found, Jack guides Emi through a year of self-discovery, and teaches her that faith in true love – and in soul mates – can yield happiness from even the darkest of places.
