Cornelia and her parents move in to a new house. Bored, she is sent to play "outside." She discovers a hidden treehouse and a boy her own age. "Do you really live here all alone?" she asks. "No I live here with my inventions. Come and take a look . . ." Inside Cornelia is introduced to a magical machine. A jungle machine! Nora Brech's gothic illustrations are packed with imaginative details and perspectives. Through an extreme wide-angle lens, she draws the reader in to a powerfully detailed, filmic world.
