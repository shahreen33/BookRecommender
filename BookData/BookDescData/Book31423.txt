Choosing to work for myself so that I can be an active part of his life—a no brainer. After four years, though, my friends may be right. It’s time to at least date if my crush on the dad, the off-limits man wearing the wedding band, at my son’s preschool is any indication.  Bailey ~ Life hasn’t gone exactly as planned with my fiancé dying before we ever had a chance to get married. My days are filled with client requests and spreadsheets, but I’ll never take for granted how fortunate I am to work from home and be here for my daughter. Pursuing the dream to have a child, even if alone, is more fulfilling than I’d ever dreamed possible. Our little life seemed like enough until recently when I witnessed my high school sweetheart, Vaughn, falling in love and finally getting his happily ever after. Maybe he’s right, maybe it’s time to take off the ring and date again.  When two men take the plunge and sign up with Valentine’s Inc., is it possible they can find a love match on the first try? And if they do, can insta-love withstand the pressure of real life when two automatically means four?
