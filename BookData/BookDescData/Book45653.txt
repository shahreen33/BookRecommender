Tohru Honda's cheerful optimism acts as a balm to many in the Sohma family, who are no strangers to darker emotions. With Tohru in the mix, the household passes its days in relative harmony, even having Kisa over for a "sleepover" and some good old fun.

Will Tohru's soothing presence have any effect at all?!
