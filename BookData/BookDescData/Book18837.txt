A love adventure with a truly original sci-fi/metaphysical twist. Sedona is a Northern Arizona town visited as much for its legends of mysterious energy vortexes, UFO sightings and other paranormal activity as it is for the majestic red rock formations that stand sentry over its landscape. Gregor Buckingham, however, is coming because Sedona has been calling to him. A young metaphysician scarred from a childhood fire, Gregor will soon discover a lost ancient power, his first requited love and a mortal enemy he must fight to save them both.
