The daily mail at Sky High Pies is always the same: bills, bills and more bills. But one wintry afternoon, it includes a mysterious envelope containing a leather billfold, a hotel room key card and a photograph of two young girls. As Kate Reed contemplates the strange parcel, she receives a phone call that explains the unusual delivery and ignites the search for a would-be killer.  After contacting the local police, Kate begins an informal investigation to satisfy her own curiosity. The decision quickly leads to a series of developments that deepen the mystery and pull Kate deeper into the case. Along the way, the probe involves a shadowy corporation, the true crime account of a candy baron’s brutal death, a gold panther ring from Cartier, a housepainter named Stretch, a bullet-riddled windshield and a notorious blog called Cold-Blooded Colorado.  Sweet, Sweet Murder, Book 13 in the Sky High Pies Cozy Mystery series, includes a tasty trio of Nana Reed’s Sky High recipes!
