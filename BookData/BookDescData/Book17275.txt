In only a few months, comic book artist and local novelty, Dellia Sanchez, had been nicknamed a blood sucking “chupacabra” by her hoodie loving classmate. Of course, she had punched him in the face, and tackled him at the principal’s office. Her objective was to keep everyone at a distance, and up until now, she had done a good job. Her dream for the future entailed a lonely life in Antarctica, with a life-sized replica of her superhero Mr. Jalapeno to keep her company. A slow death and excruciating death would follow it, and then she would eventually become victim of a Penguin buffet. This is until she meets the golden-haired football player of her dreams, because every YA heroine needs her stereotypical, misunderstood athlete. So, join our hero on her quest to love…or should I say, join our anti-hero as she runs away from her first true love. Follow the most unlikable, young woman you’ll ever have the displeasure of reading about, and pray that at the end, her total hatred for the whole world won’t have soured your soul. Maybe through her journey of self-discovery, you’ll find that your cold heart has started to beat again.
