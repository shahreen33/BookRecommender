The classic supernatural thriller by an author who helped define the genre.First published in 1959 under the title The Haunting of Hill House, Shirley Jackson's beloved novel has been hailed as a perfect work of unnerving terror. It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of the psychic phenomena called "haunting"; Theodora, his lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powers--and soon it will choose one of them to make its own."Makes your blood chill and your scalp prickle. . . . Shirley Jackson is the master of the haunted tale."--The New York Times Book Review
