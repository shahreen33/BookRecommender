'Kitty Peck is a heroine amongst heroines.' MIRANDA CARTEREven though Paradise was riddled with rot, I reckoned I could make it a cleaner place for the poor types who came with the dirty trades. I could make them all love me, I thought. I was wrong about that. I've been wrong about so much. When Kitty Peck took over Paradise - her grandmother's East End criminal empire - she thought she would be able to run it her own way. What Kitty didn't know was that her grandmother had also left her violently entwined with the Barons of London. This coterie of fiends will stop at nothing to gain power, and they've already robbed Kitty of so much that she held dear.Kitty is determined to do away with the dark underbelly of Paradise and to transform her music halls into the jewels of Limehouse. But as she begins her final assault on the Barons, a new threat appears in the form of an eerily charismatic preacher on a crusade against 'wickedness and vice'. Can Kitty save Paradise from destruction, without losing any more of the people she loves?
