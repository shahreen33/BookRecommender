One day to remember forever, one trip to last a lifetime. Life has a way of throwing you curve balls. Dirty laundry, bad boyfriends, and a car breaking down. I thought I had been dealt the worst cards possible my senior year of college, then I got the call that would change it all. My brother had tried to kill himself and I had to get to him now. Jeremiah is my only hope.I have a secret, and I don't know how to tell Georgia. She's been my best friend since I started college, but this could change everything. When she calls me and asks for a ride when her car breaks down, I don't expect the interception we have to face. We only have today to create a Snapshot that will last a lifetime, or change our paths forever.
