Kae here for one last huzzah! I went all the way to Shiga to tell Mutsumi-senpai he's the only one for me! There, we ended up spending the night together in a hotel, and ... !!! Well, let's just say things would have gone a little differently if it was one of my BL ships!And remember how Mutsumi-senpai is graduating this year? He suggested that we spend time making as many memories as we can, but also says his dream college is all the way in Kyoto...Aaahh, what do I do?! I don't want him to give up on his dream! Will we find our happy ending, or is that the sort of thing that only happens in doujinshi?
