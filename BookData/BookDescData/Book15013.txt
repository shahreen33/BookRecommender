KANE - The Mystic Swordsman ranges Earth and Time to confront the demons of darknessWhere once the mighty Kane has passed, no one who lives forgets. Now, down the trail of past battles, Kane travels again. To the ruins of a devastated city peopled only with half-men and the waif they call their queen. To the half-burnt tavern where a woman Kane wronged long ago holds his child in keeping for the Devil. To the cave kingdom of the giants where glory and its aftermath await discovery. To the house of death itself where Kane retrieves a woman in love.The past, the future, the present - all these are one for Kane as he travels through the centuries.Cover illustration: Chris Achilleos
