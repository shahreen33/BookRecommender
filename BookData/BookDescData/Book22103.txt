George and the dragon is a fantastical reworking of World War II history. The story follows the adventures of a young boy, George, who is taken away from the dangers of the Nazi bombs by his Mother. While enjoying his new found freedom in the grounds of his Uncle's countryside mansion a series of events lead to George befriending a dragon and becoming the dragon's rider. He names the dragon Spitfire and, together, they are reluctantly recruited by the RAF to help fight against the Luftwaffe who have also managed to summon dragons to fight for them in the Battle of Britain. The story mixes war-time action and adventure with swords and sorcery in a way that any reader should enjoy; young or old.
