An utterly hilarious Seussian picture book--with a surprise ending--about a mischievous little boy who gobbles up everything in the whole entire world, except for one very important thing. . . .When Danny McGee, much to his big sister Frannie's surprise, drinks up the sea with a giant straw, it turns out he's just getting started. Soon nothing is safe from getting swallowed whole by Danny McGee--not the mountains, not the trees, not even the weather girl on TV! He eats up America and all the people in the whole world (including the author, who is writing this book from inside Danny McGee!). Danny swallows the alphabet and all the numbers, until there is absolutely nothing left . . . except, of course, his big sister, Frannie McGee. Absurdist humor throughout, along with a delicious twist at the end, will have kids laughing uncontrollably at this one-of-a-kind picture book.Praise for the work of illustrator Neal Layton:"Layton's playful mixed-media illustrations evoke Ludwig Bemelmans and John Burningham. They're fresh and funny, providing plenty to pore over." --Kirkus Reviews"[This] whimsical tale is given ample comic dimension by Neal's zany and inventive mixed-media illustrations." --Publishers Weekly
