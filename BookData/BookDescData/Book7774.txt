It was the final plan, the last desperate breath of a colossal empire. A race of scientists and inventors that had reigned like demigods over their realm; a species so advanced and cunning that when their world was destroyed, theyâ€™ve left their best creations behind; ageless beautiful servants determined to carry their masters final wishes. To explore new frontiers, undeterred from any difficulties; to bleed and kill in their name and lastly to bring them back from extinction..Final Colony Reloaded is a special assemblage of the first five books of the Final Colony series (ASHOS ELEVEN, DIRECTIVE 3.1, CONTACT, RAVEN and CITIZEN ONE) in a single volume..Special Kindle Edition
