From the glittering ballrooms of Regency London to the glorious gardens of countryside manors, Lisa Kleypas invites her readers to visit a lushly romantic world. Now, Lisa has written her most unforgettable love story..."Lady Hawksworth, your husband is not dead..." With those words, Lara's life turned upside down.

But now a powerful, virile man stood before her, telling secrets only a husband could know, and vowing she would once again be his wife in every way.

Soon she desperately wanted to believe, with every beat of her heart, that this stranger was truly her husband. But had this rake reformed—or was Lara being seduced by a cunning stranger?
