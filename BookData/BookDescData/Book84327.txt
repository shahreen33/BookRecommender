BODY AND SOUL is the third book in the Scarlet Plumiere Series. To avoid spoilers, read BLOOD FOR INK and BONES FOR BREAD first.  For good luck in finding a bride, Lord Forsgreen has received the dreadful African chair. Unfortunately, the ladies of the ton have been notified of his hopes to wed, and his every move is being watched. In his heart, however, he fears his father will be proven right, that the future Duke of Rochester can never trust a woman to love him honestly--not for his pretty face or royal blood. Georgetta has not the luxury to dream of marrying for true love. She has promised her hand in marriage to her second cousin, and in exchange, he will keep her past a secret from the world. But the famous Lord Forsgreen wants what he can never have, and if he discovers the secrets she keeps, she might hang before she can become any man's bride.  This series includes the tale of four noble men--Northwick, Ashmoore, Forsgreen, and Harcourt--whose loyalty to each other is unfailing, whose blades are ever at the ready, and whose women are unquestionably brave and uniquely qualified to win their hearts.
