Lauren Child’s spunky character returns and—as if things could get any livelier in Clarice Bean’s household—Uncle Ted is babysitting!Uh-oh! Mom and Dad have to go away for a few days and who can they get to babysit? Who would be willing to take on the irrepressible Clarice Bean, her pesky brother Minal Cricket, and the school’s guinea pig, Albert, who’s visiting for spring break? (Not to mention teenage brother Kurt, who abhors daylight; big sis Marcie, who chats on the phone all day; and Grandad, who tends to wander off.) Surprisingly, only Uncle Ted, firefighter and movie addict, can be persuaded. Will he survive the week? Find out, in Lauren Child’s hilariously original sequel to her award-winning CLARICE BEAN, THAT’S ME.
