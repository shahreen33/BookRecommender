This is a book about High Elven Magic. Not the magic of chants and spells and ceremonies, of which we've already written quite a bit, but of the Quest to become like those kindred of ours who we, and others, call the Shining Ones, and which most folks think of when they fantasize about what elves are-even when they deny that we are elven or that elves exist at all. The Shinning Ones are the evolved beings who guide the elven people upon their spiritual Path. If you would enter Faerie, or Elfin as we often call it, this is a book about the Path that leads there.
