In between the sleep-deprived lows and wonderful highs, Backman takes a step back to share his own experience of fatherhood and how he navigates such unchartered territory. Part memoir, part manual, part love letter to his son, this book relays the big and the small lessons in life. As he watches his son take his first steps into the world he teaches him how to cultivate friendships, support a team that loses and tries to explain why, sometimes, dad might hold his hand just a little bit too tightly. This is an irresistible and insightful collection from one of the world's most beautiful storytellers.
