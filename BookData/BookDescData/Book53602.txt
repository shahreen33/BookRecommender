   Keep the door locked... 
 Sam is excited to spend a week at her uncle's remote lake cabin. It's a chance for her to focus on her art without distractions: no neighbours, no phone, and a small radio as her only contact with the outside world.  But there's something deeply unnatural lingering in the lake.  The radio's news reports talk about disappearances on a nearby hiking trail. The car won't start. And Sam starts to believe she's being stalked when she catches glimpses of a tall, strange man standing at the end of her dock, staring intently into the swirling waters below...  "A beautiful marriage of supernatural to a terrifying scenario... if you enjoy a suspenseful, frightening horror story, then Dead Lake is most definitely for you." -Twisted Book Junkie
