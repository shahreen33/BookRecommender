The Witness for the Prosecution1920s London. A murder, brutal and bloodthirsty, has stained the plush carpets of a handsome London townhouse. The victim is the glamorous and enormously rich Emily French. All the evidence points to Leonard Vole, a young chancer to whom the heiress left her vast fortune and who ruthlessly took her life. At least, this is the story that Emilyâ€™s dedicated housekeeper Janet Mackenzie stands by in court. Leonard however, is adamant that his partner, the enigmatic chorus girl Romaine, can prove his innocence.And Other Stories- The Red Signal- The Fourth Man- S.O.S.- Where There's a Will- The Mystery of the Blue Jar- Sing a Song of Sixpence- The Mystery of the Spanish Shawl- Philomel Cottage- Accident- The Second Gong
