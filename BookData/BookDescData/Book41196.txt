A colorful pageant of princes &amp; kings, painters &amp; philosophers, scientists &amp; architects comes to life in Will Durant's study of the Italian Renaissance, Vol. 5 of The Story of Civilization. He sets the stage in Florence for the opening act of a magnificent cultural flowering spread across Europe &amp; continued thru time. Even more than its artistic awakening, the Renaissance stands as a declaration of mental freedom. It was a great contribution to the progress of humankind. "Dr. Durant has a keen and mordant wit that flashes forth frequently to enliven his pages...he is an artist in words."--Saturday Review
