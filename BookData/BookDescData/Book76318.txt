The brilliant mind of Grant Morrison (JLA, New X-Men) is showcased once again as his most groundbreaking and ambitious project yet continues! Independently, each of these characters is featured in a story arc of their own that redefines their purpose in the DCU. But their stories also interweave with the other Soldiers' tales, telling a grander story of a devastating global threat to mankind. Together these reluctant champions must arise and somehow work together to save the world...without ever meeting one another!Collecting: Mister Miracle 1-2, Zatanna 4, Klarion, the Witchboy 4, Bulleteer 1-2, Frankenstein 1
