Rose Collier refused to let them see her crumble as she sprinted across the lobby, the big white dress billowing out of the convertible as she fled. In a daze, she left the city behind, only stopping for necessities, until she found herself staring at the ocean, inhaling deep lungfuls of clean salty sea air. The vintage car sputtered and died as she coasted into Magnolia Beach.  Alex Parrish had it all. Money, women, model looks, and fast cars. Until the accident. Then his uncle stole his trust fund. Now he's broke, ugly, and ill-tempered, not to mention he doesn’t have a single employable skill.  Certain she’s in no danger of falling for another entitled rich guy, Rose takes a position cleaning for the town hermit. She needs time to heal, to figure out what comes next. Alex doesn’t know who he is without his money and his looks, but going by the new housekeeper’s reaction, he’ll never set foot in public again. He’s fired every other housekeeper in three towns so he’s stuck with the beguiling Rose.  Sparks fly. As Alex spends more and more time with Rose, he falls head over heels in love for the first time in his miserable life. Too bad she’s made it clear there could never be anything between them other than friendship.
