For anyone interested in European literature these stories are an undiscovered snapshot of some of the most interesting and important writing of the twentieth and twenty-first century. From the same culture that consistently draws worldwide attention for its groundbreaking and avante-garde movements in the visual arts, this collection displays the same playfulness, innovation and sense of humour in Dutch literary movements. The stories are varied: subversive, profound, hilarious; stylistically experimental and psychologically astute.The majority of these stories appear here in English for the first time, and many of these names will be unfamiliar to English-speaking audiences. Dutch writers have been gaining a swell of praise in recent years, and have been lauded by figures such as J. M. Coetzee, Milan Kundera and John Updike.
