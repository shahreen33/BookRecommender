New Hot Standalone from New York Times Bestselling Author Helen Cooper It was only supposed to be one night We met at a wedding. He was hot. And I’d been in a year’s drought. He smiled. We got drunk. We flirted. We hooked up. I left without early the next morning without saying goodbye. It was only meant to be a one night stand. I didn’t want the awkward morning after moment. Not at all. Then I went home for the weekend. And he was there. Sitting on the couch chatting to my dad. Turns out he was more than just a stranger. Turns out that my one night stand was about to cause a whole heap of trouble. Turns out that it never just stops with one night.
