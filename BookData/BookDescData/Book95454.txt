After the events of ORIGINAL SIN -- and the revelation of the Illuminati's desperate, world-destroying actions -- much has changed for the Avengers. What has become of Earth's Mightiest Heroes during the past eight months? Who comprises the new Cabal? And have all the battles they've endured, and the sacrifices they've made, prepared either group for the inevitable moment where time runs out for everybody?COLLECTING: AVENGERS (2012) 35-37 &amp; NEW AVENGERS (2013) 24-25
