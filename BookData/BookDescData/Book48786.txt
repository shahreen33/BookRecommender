Love Always, Patsy is the collection of that remarkable, cherished correspondence -- poignant, colorful, humorous, and genuinely revealing in its honesty and warmth. We meet the aspiring young singer from Winchester, Virginia, excited at the prospects of her burgeoning career -- and devastated by its impact on a volatile and demanding marriage. We experience the joy of the birth of her daughter, the strains of stardom, and her loneliness on the road to success, and share in the rewards of a relationship with the one man who would become the love of her life. Above all these intimate letters reveal the dreams and aspirations, the private heartbreak and the public pressures of an ordinary woman who would become one of the most recognized and beloved names in the history of country music.
