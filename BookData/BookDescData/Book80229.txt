When darkness descends, secrets come to light…  Just when I thought I could be happy in the walls of the Cage with my four dark protectors, everything crumbled beneath my feet. Three of them have marked me. Two are bound to my soul. And one has been lying from the day we met.  With Locke’s grip on sanity slowly unraveling, the Frosts taken over by their fiercely territorial natures, and Dominic’s unrelenting thirst for revenge, it’s all I can do to hold us together.  Because it’s time to take the fight to the darkness and burn out the corruption with wildfire. And if we make it out alive… Cimmerian will be ours.  Kissed by Midnight is the third and final novel in a steamy, medium-burn academy reverse harem romance trilogy. No choosing, no cheating- only unbridled passion and emotional angst in a haunted gothic mansion! Mature readers only.
