Fallen Navy SEAL and Titan Groupâ€™s Delta recruit Trace Reeves wants nothing more than a one-night stand to forget that his twin brother was killed-in-action. But when his one-time fling becomes his high value target, the lines blur between her rescue mission and saving himself. Delta: Retribution is the first title in the new Delta series, a spin off from the Titan series. This novella was available in the Hot Alpha SEALs: Military Romance megaset.
