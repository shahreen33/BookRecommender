Kirk McGarvey--one-time CIA assassin--dreams of a peaceful life and marital bliss. One man will change all that. In 1945, Isawa Nakaruma lost his mother and father at Hiroshima, his wife and child at Nagasaki, and has been planning years to wreak his revenge--and he holds Kirk McGarvey personably responsible.Â His plan begins with the murder of McGarvey's girlfriend and the kidnapping and torturing of McGarvey's ex-wife and daughter. But he won't stop there, not until McGarvey himself is six-feet under and nuclear bombs are detonated over Los Angeles and San Francisco.
