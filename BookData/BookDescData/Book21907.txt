YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE LIFE YOU’VE BEEN GIVEN.All that you can do is make the most of what you’ve been dealt—fight a good fight, resist being beaten by circumstance, and hope that somehow, despite it all, you’re able to accomplish the impossible. But even then you cannot change the fact that you were born cursed.I am one of those unlucky few upon whom the Curse of the Four Fathers has fallen.It is I who must bear the burden of having a life that is unchangeably intertwined with the Fae. A sorrow made all the more great by knowing that where they are tragedy, loss, misery, and despair most assuredly follow.As a Druid it is my responsibility to uphold the boundaries that keep the worlds of the Tylwyth Teg, and our own, separate. As a man it is my only ambition to protect the family and woman I so desperately love. The only problem: I'm not sure this curse will allow for me to do both.
