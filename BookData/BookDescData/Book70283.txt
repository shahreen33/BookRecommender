Stung by the ridicule, he takes it upon himself to play God and alter forever the course of a doctor’s life – ah, sweet revenge! Will he transform into a puppet master, or remain a clumsy pawn? NUDE: Yearning to become an artist, Dr. Vic is a reluctant warrior in the medical battlefield.

Writhing between them is a bitter soul unwilling to forgive an uncommitted crime.
