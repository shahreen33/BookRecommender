Winter, 1794, Flanders, and the British are retreating.Faced by appalling weather and pursued by an overwhelming enemy, the very survival of the British Army is at stake. With little supplies and ammunition, Lieutenant Jack Hallam of the 28th Regiment must prove himself by leading his company through the full horrors of the withdrawal, where morale is desperately low, and where looting and ill-discipline are rife. The men must endure freezing temperatures, disease and battle if they wish to see home again, and if any officer can accomplish this feat, then that man is Jack Hallam.Blood on the Snow is a gripping tale of honour, bravery and self-sacrifice in the darkest of times. Fight not for glory, but to survive.
