All great stories start with a death.  In this case, it's my own.  Instead of the pearly white gates and yellow brick road leading me to Heaven, my soul is chosen to join Afterworld Academy - an exclusive boarding school to train selected souls on how to manage the Afterlife.  Ghosts, Demons, Reapers, and Angels.  Classes on how to fly. Studies on the proper way to select souls. Weaponry. Premonition. Oh, and field trips to Hell.  Sounds peachy, right?  When souls turn up dead, I must work with my four sexy-as-sin mentors to uncover the truth of my new reality.  Things are about to take a deadly turn.  Welcome to Afterworld Academy where the price of admission...is your life.    Dearly Departed is book one of a four book series by bestselling authors, Loxley Savage and Katie May. This is a reverse harem romance meaning that the main character won't have to choose between her love interests. This is medium-burn and does contain strong language and sexual themes. Oh, and death. Lots and lots of death. Book one will end in a cliffhanger.  *Note from Authors The main character does pass away from cancer (which is how she ends up in the Afterworld Academy). Please keep this in mind while reading, especially if that may be triggering to you. We would love for you to read our book, but we want you to take care of yourself.
