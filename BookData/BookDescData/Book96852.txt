One accident changed my life. One single second changed everything for me.In one terrifying moment, everything I knew was gone.Music is the only thing that keeps me holding on.When the opportunity arises for me to tour with country music star, Scarlett Belle, I take it. An escape. A chance. Only it isn’t enough to lift the shadows of my past. And when I meet him, dangerous and different, I can’t turn away.He is forbidden to me. The President of a Motorcycle Club.A man who could bring noise back into my soundless world.But the shadows of my past haunt me. They linger like a dark nightmare, reminding me that we can never be. Because my sins are far too heavy. And my mind far too broken. Music is the only escape I can allow into my life. The only one that I will let seep through my hungry veins. But he’s always there. And he’s persistent. But if he knew what I kept behind closed doors…no.I must continue my life just the way it is. Without him. Breathing in my nightmare. Living in my Hushed Torment.
