  Take Me. Teach Me. Train Me. Please, Boss.
  I’m filthy rich and used to getting everything I want: A yacht, jet skis, a private plane and plenty of f*cking women. But my one rule is never to mix work and pleasure. An office fling isn't worth losing my lucrative law firm.  Now I have a spunky young secretary named Ruby. I also have a dilemma. Because I want Ruby in a way I've never wanted anyone. My c*ck is as ready as my mind is hesitant. I'm her much older boss— old enough to know better.  I can tell by the way Ruby looks at me: I make her knees weak and her panties wet. She thinks she wants me. For her very first time. But she doesn’t know what it is she’s asking for.  I don’t just want her on my desk, on my floor, on my lap. I want her tied up and begging me to do whatever I want with her. Taming her will be quite a challenge. Ruby’s no pushover. She has a mind of her own. I’m beginning to suspect she also has some dark secrets. Her own past, mixed with my present desires, could get us both into a lot of trouble.  Tying her up could take me down. But I don’t let anyone's rules f*cking stop me from getting what I want. Not even my own.  *Please, Boss is a standalone dirty office romance with no cliffhanger and no cheating. It features a dominant billionaire alpha male and a feisty BBW who earn their happily ever after.
