Curt is a precog and it's up him to try to avert disaster. He knows that it's only a matter of time until the Mutants take over from the Norms. But Curt thinks he has an answer that will put an end to the power imbalance between his kind and the Norms. He's discovered a kind of Norm that he calls Anti-Psis. They can cancel out the powers of any Mutants. If he can convince both sides of their importance the Anti-Psis can help the Norms and Mutants live without conflict. But no one seems to want to listen. In large part this was Philip K. Dick's response to John W. Campbell's belief that humans with heightened powers would somehow be more enlightened than normal men.
