A family massacre. A deluded murderess. Five witnesses. Six stories. Which one is true? One cold November night in 2014, in a small town in the north west of England, 21-year-old Arla Macleod bludgeoned her mother, father and younger sister to death with a hammer, in an unprovoked attack known as the Macleod Massacre. Now incarcerated at a medium-security mental-health institution, Arla will speak to no one but Scott King, an investigative journalist, whose Six Stories podcasts have become an internet sensation. King finds himself immersed in an increasingly complex case, interviewing five witnesses and Arla herself, as he questions whether Arla’s responsibility for the massacre was a diminished as her legal team made out. As he unpicks the stories, he finds himself thrust into a world of deadly forbidden ‘games’, online trolls, and the mysterious black-eyed kids, whose presence seems to extend far beyond the delusions of a murderess… Dark, chilling and gripping, Hydra is both a classic murder mystery and an up-to-the-minute, startling thriller, that shines light in places you may never, ever want to see again. ‘Bold, clever and genuinely chilling with a terrific twist that provides an explosive final punch’ Deidre O’Brien, Sunday Mirror ‘A genuine genre-bending debut’ Carla McKay, Daily Mail 'Impeccably crafted and gripping from start to finish’ Doug Johnstone, The Big Issue ‘The very epitome of a must-read’ Heat ‘Wonderfully horrifying … the suspense crackles’ James Oswald ‘A complex and subtle mystery, unfolding like a dark origami to reveal the black heart inside’ Michael Marshall Smith ‘A relentless and original work of modern rural noir which beguiles and unnerves in equal measure.
