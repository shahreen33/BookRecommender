Every Monday and Thursday, Roberto Marías crosses Rome on foot for his appointment with his psychiatrist. There he sits in silence, flooded by memories. He remembers surfing with his father as a child. He remembers the treacherous years he spent working as an undercover agent, years that taught him how cynicism and corruption are not merely external influences but exist within us as well. His past has left him devastated, but now his psychiatrist’s words, his hypnotic strolls through Rome, and a chance meeting with a woman named Emma—who, like Roberto, is ravaged by a profound guilt—begin to painfully revive him. And when eleven-year-old Giacomo asks Roberto to help him conquer his nightmares, Roberto at last achieves a true rebirth.
