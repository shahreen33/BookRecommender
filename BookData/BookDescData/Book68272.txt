Morgan Holland is a poacher’s daughter looking for a way out of the swamp. She’s been making secret moves to relocate, but it seems like every time she takes a step forward, she gets shoved two steps back. Her dad and friends are on the hunt for the Shifters, and they’re closing in fast. She doesn’t know Liam Lachlan, but he’s in danger, and she’ll take a huge risk to warn him. She’s walking a fine line that could get her in deep trouble with both sides. But the more time she spends with Liam, the more she wants to keep him safe—even if it means risking her own life and the future she’s been fighting for.  Liam Lachlan is one of the legendary gator shifters in the swamps of Uncertain. He’s been quiet about what he is all these years, but rumor has it some poachers have figured him out and are hunting him. Good. Bring it. It’s been a while since he had a good war. Only problem is, the girl who warned him is the daughter of the biggest, baddest poacher in the swamps, and hurting her people means demolishing her. If it’s up to the gator in him, he’ll put an end to anyone who is hunting his family. But the man in him will stop at nothing to keep Morgan safe.  Two worlds collide in the Swamps of Uncertain in this thrilling second installment of T. S. Joyce’s Keepers of the Swamp series…and these gators are just getting started.   Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. Intended for mature audiences.
