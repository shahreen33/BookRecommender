I’m all for girl power and sh*t. Guys are a disaster.Trust me. I know.My name is Josephine Poet. I’m the drummer in an all-girl band.My rule is f*ck a guy only once, then move onto the next one.The Rock F*ck Club reality show is no different than my real life. Only there are cameras rolling, and they’re offering me a ton of cash. The money and the publicity is just what Joey’s Band needs. A means to an end for a bad girl who knows how to rock, but isn’t looking for anything good.But what happens when wrong and right collide?It’s naughty versus nice in Rock F*ck Club Season Three.What could go wrong?
