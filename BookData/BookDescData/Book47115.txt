When Ian Gregg was just a boy he joined his father at work selling pies from his van to miners' wives in Newcastle. Now retired, he can look back on a business that began as a husband and wife team in the 1930s, survived a world war and two major recessions to become our favourite bakery, beloved by everyone from children to office workers to soldiers overseas.Ian Gregg led the family firm as it grew, employing generations of families from around Newcastle and then becoming a public company with bakeries in Scotland and across the North. Now with shops on every high street, this is a story of extraordinary success, but it is also a triumphant tale of how doing right by your people makes for great business. Bucking every trend, Greggs have always put their customer, employee and local community before quick profits for directors and shareholders. Their astounding record of charitable works includes hardship grants, an Environment fund, sponsorship of the North East Children's Cancer run and over ï¿½1 million raised annually for Children in Need.All Greggs' profits from the sale of this book will go to fund the Greggs Breakfast Clubs for Children.
