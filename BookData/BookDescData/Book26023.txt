But they find more than they expected in the frozen wastes of the Arctic north …  Sins of Violence: In a brutal post-apocalyptic world, a young girl is about to be taken to The Minotaur for a Blessing that will end her innocence. Can her sister gain access to the fortified city of Dis in time to stop the ritual and avenge her own lost youth?  Includes the Prologue of Desecration, a dark crime thriller, at the end of the book.
