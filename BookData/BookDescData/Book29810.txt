  A hilarious gift and perfect stocking stuffer, the third installment of the T-Rex Trying series features simple, charming, and hilarious illustrations depicting the hapless T-Rex and family doing their best in a world made for creatures with smaller heads and longer arms.
For the last six years, the lovable, hilarious T-Rex family--T-Rex himself, his partner She-Rex, and their adorable child, Wee-Rex--have charmed readers and dinosaur lovers throughout the nation. With a sweetly funny tone and truly adorable illustrations, the new collection will include all-new material, featuring T-Rex and family in situations like these:T-Rex trying to hail a cab... T-Rex trying to shear a flock of sheep... T-Rex trying to grab the toys at the bottom of his pool... T-Rex trying to put a comforter inside a duvet cover... T-Rex trying to play the bagpipes... T-Rex trying to cut down a tree with a two-person saw... T-Rex trying to feed a horse through an electric fence... T-Rex trying to plug in a lamp behind the bed...This book will leave you applauding (like T-Rex can't) and wiping tears from your eyes (like T-Rex wishes he could), but most of all, it will leave you wondering how on earth this animal survived a day, let alone the entire Cretaceous Period.
