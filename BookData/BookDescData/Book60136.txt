Set in 1932, this is the story of two misfits with no place to call home, who build a relationship during a train hopping journey from the cold heartbreak of their eastern homes toward the sunny promise of California.Pearl "Soupy" Plankette ran away from her abusive father, but has nowhere to go until she stumbles upon a disguise that gives her the key to a new identity. Reborn as a boy named Soupy, she hitches her star to Remy "Ramshackle" Smith, a hobo who takes her under his wing. Ramshackle's kindness and protection go a long way to help Soupy heal from her difficult past. But Ramshackle has his own demons to wrestle with, and he'll need Soupy just as much as she needs him."A compelling graphic offering that explores relevant gender roles and self-identity through a historical lens." - from the Kirkus Starred Review"VERDICT A well-researched and richly illustrated runaway tale that will appeal to fans of escapist fiction and thoughtful readers."-Anna Murphy, ï¿½Berkeley Carroll School, Brooklyn, From the School Library Journal review, March 2017"Soupy Leaves Home tells the story of a time no longer familiar to us--a time of living the rails and simmering Mulligan Soup, a time of chosen names and secret languages--yet a tale that anyone with a longing heart and a restless spirit can relate to. It transports you magically to a place long gone, but its tale of poverty and survival are still as relevant as they ever were--the characters may be penniless, but they are so emotionally wealthy that this book leaves you filled with warmth, hope, and love."--Gerard Way"Castellucci's heartfelt odyssey is a reckoning with death and identity on the tracks, brought to life by Pimienta's patient, ever-evolving use of color. Soupy Leaves Home is for all restless souls hungry to start again."--Nate Powell (March, Swallow Me Whole)"A charming and optimistic slice of Americana."--Hope Larson (Wrinkle in Time, Batgirl)"I love Cecil Castellucci, she is crazy and cool and full of energy and heart, and so is all of her work. And Soupy Leaves Home may be one of her finest and most effecting works yet!"--Jeff Lemire
