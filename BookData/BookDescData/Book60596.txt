I know that you are like me. The war that rages in my heart rages in yours as well. Things in the creation not only capture me; they capture your heart too. And I know that, like me, you need to spend more time gazing upon the awesome beauty of your Lord so that your heart would remember, and in remembering, be rescued.'So writes Paul David Tripp. He looks at the subject of awe through a number of lenses: ministry, transgression, materialism, growth, worldview, church, parenting and work.Awe of God puts other things in their proper place. It enables us to see as God intended, to lift our eyes higher, and worship him alone.
