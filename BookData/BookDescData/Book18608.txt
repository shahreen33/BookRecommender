The final novel in an exciting new Rock and Roll Trilogy!“Lies, sex and rock are always on the menu when touring and if this journey has taught me anything, it’s every empty, vacuous idea I had before I met Kaz was the stuff of little girl fairytales. Love isn’t pretty, pink butterflies and hearts drawn on pieces of paper, it’s scratch marks down Kaz’s back after we have wild crazy sex and the way his aquamarine eyes look into mine as if I’m his and he’s claimed every inch of my body, including my heart, mind and soul…“This journey isn’t about up and coming stars on the rock scene—it’s about the ones who’ve made it and still can’t get it together. It’s about drug abuse and unprotected sex, it’s about my love for a man who claimed he would never fall in love yet I managed to snag him. Not because I’m pretty, blonde and have a knock out body but because I can see past his sexy, drop-dead beautiful façade and underneath are the kind of dysfunctional, wretched secrets you hear about only in the most twisted romance novels.”The final part of Kaz and Syd’s journey will have them dealing with issues they never saw coming and a few they did. Friendships will be tested and relationships will be obliterated but at the end of the day, it’s all about the music and that always comes first. Kaz can’t fight his feelings for Syd any longer and he’s given up trying. When their togetherness seems almost perfect, a curve ball is thrown and it just might end up destroying the love they have worked so hard to keep. Can they survive the repeated assaults against their relationship and come out on top or will the tour always come first, even at the expense of what they hold sacred?The One More Night Trilogy is a Contemporary Romance set in the world of rock and roll:Falling Into LustFalling Into Us Falling Into Love
