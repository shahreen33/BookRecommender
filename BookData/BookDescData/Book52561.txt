Guilty. ExCon. Felon. Prisoner. Criminal.  Words that now represent me. Words that keep any decent person away from me.  I never gave much thought to words before now.  Slut. Hussy. Whore. Homewrecker. Jezebel.  Words that now reflect me. Words that will stay indefinitely.  The evidence of those words grow inside of me.  Those Words make the entire town assume they are vindicated to use them. I am wrong. They are right.
