I hired her to be my girlfriend. To fix my reputation. To save my career.  It’s not that I don’t want a girlfriend. I do. I want it all. Wife, kids, side-by-side burial plots. The problem is – I can’t have any of it. So I’ve made myself untouchable. The quintessential bachelor of baseball. Because it’s not worth the risk. Not even for someone I love. Especially not for someone I love.  We made the arrangements. We agreed to a contract. It’s iron clad. No sex. No love. No future.  What could possibly go wrong?
