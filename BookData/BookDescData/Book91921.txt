His Hellborn army spewed forth from the Plague Lands with an unholy force stemming from human sacrifice. For it was the blood of innocents that fueled the corrupted Sipstrassi Stones of Power--the source of Abaddon's might.But the Hellborn made a fatal mistake--they took the woman who had stolen Shannow's heart.
