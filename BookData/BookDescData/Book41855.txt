Loving Jules in high school was easy—gentle and natural. But that was eight years ago, before she left town. Before she took off and left my heart shattered.Now she’s back…with a kid I’ve never met.A hurricane, that’s what she is—powerful and potentially destructive, yet so thrilling and intense.If she leaves me wrecked again…I won’t survive.
