Some men only know how to do hard things the hard way! The battered women who drifted into the District Attorney's office all haunted him with the same, hard-bought lie: "I want to drop the charges." Every bruised face and split lip reminded the assistant D.A. of the violent home he'd escaped and how little he could do to prevent others' suffering at the hands and fists of the same kind of monster who'd raised him. But when Marisol Pierce appeared with an image of her son and a hint that she was willing to take a step away from the man abusing her, the prosecutor made a promise he knew he couldn't keep. A promise that could cost him everything. Bracken MacLeod's novella, "White Knight," appears back in print, for the first time together with several of his acclaimed crime and suspense stories written for Shotgun Honey, Beat to a Pulp, and Shock Totem, along with an interview with the author and brand new story notes. WHITE KNIGHT AND OTHER PAWNS is a tour through noir, hardboiled, and even an EC Comics-inspired "SuspenStory" - This is crime writing the way only Bracken MacLeod does it.
