Bellamy Muñoz is a Wanderland SUPER fan, and she knows everything there is to know about the iconic theme park... except about the very real, very magical world that it’s based on.Bellamy Muñoz is a Wanderland SUPERFAN, and she knows everything there is to know about the most “wander-ful” place on Earth, from the secret lore behind each ride, to all the spots to find the best snacks (with the shortest lines). So when she winds up in the very real and very magical world the park is based on, where there are actual princesses and quests and destiny, Bel is pretty sure she’s uniquely prepared for this situation...until it starts to become clear that Wander isn’t actually much like the theme park at all, and the characters Bel loves aren’t at all like she’d imagined... Created and written by CYBIL award-nominated writer Jackie Ball (Goldie Vance), and illustrated by Eisner-winning cartoonist Maddi Gonzalez (Elements: Fire), Welcome to Wanderland shows you a whole new world, and invites you along for the ride of your life!
