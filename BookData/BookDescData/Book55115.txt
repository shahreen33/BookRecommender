Everything is coming up roses for Robbie Munro, newly married and living in the country with his wife and child. That is until his wife takes up employment abroad just as old flame, Jill Green, asks him to investigate the unexplained death of her partner. Suspecting foul play, Jill insists Robbie does whatever it takes to find the killer. As Robbie begins his investigation, his father, ex-Police Sergeant Alex Munro, comes under scrutiny. Was the evidence at the trial of a man found guilty of child murder twenty years ago fabricated? Can Robbie juggle his duties as a father, investigate his ex’s claims, and prove his father’s innocence?
