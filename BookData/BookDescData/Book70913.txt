When a young woman linked to a list of missing Fire-Sky tribal members commits suicide, Pueblo Police Sergeant Nicky Matthews is assigned to the case. As the evidence leads her to a shocking discovery, she uncovers not only murder but an ominous, vengeful twist that strikes at the very core of what it means to be a member of the Fire-Sky people. With an intimate knowledge of Fire-Sky customs and traditions, the killer ensures the spirits of those targeted will wander forever, lost to their family and People. As Nicky closes in on the murderer, those closest to her are put in jeopardy. She realizes she must be willing to sacrifice everything--her career, her life, and even her soul--to save the people she is sworn to protect.
