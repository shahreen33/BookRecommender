There’s no one left to trust.  Our contacts turned.The gang we trusted, now works with the cop who betrayed us.The club is at risk like never before.And I would do anything to protect them all.So, when an innocent and gorgeous girl storms into my life, she throws everything off course..All I want is her long legs wrapped around my waist.Freya is determined to search for her half sister, but things got complicated. The only clue she has to find her sister is a picture – of Hayley. I don’t know who to trust.Only, Freya keeps pulling me back in.When she is threatened, I’ll stop at nothing to keep her safe.Even if that means going against my club.
