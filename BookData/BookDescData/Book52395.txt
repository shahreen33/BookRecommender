You don't need another Christian message or a self-help book. You need to have your paradigms about the world shifted into truth. That's exactly what you get in Love Does. Have you ever noticed that the real change in your life-the growth that sticks and becomes a part of you-never happens with a program or the sheer grit of your best efforts? It happens over time, like a glacier slowly carving valleys through the mountains.In this book of compelling stories coupled with eye-opening truths, author Bob Goff shows you a new way to live, a way that's drenched with the whimsy of God's love and the spontaneity of following where he leads when he says "Go!" In this book, you learn what it looks like to be secretly incredible and advance God's kingdom everywhere you are and wherever you're going. For anyone who's wanted to change the world but thought they needed money, a committee, and permission to get started, Love Does shows what can happen when you decide to do instead of plan, act instead of strategize, and fiercely, invisibly fight for the possibility God has gifted you to uniquely see.
