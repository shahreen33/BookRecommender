Meredith Schorr’s second novel proves that chick lit, beyond just entertaining the reader, can also empower and inspire.Jane Frank is ready to fall in love or so she thinks. It’s been a year since her long-term relationship with Bob (who was not the one) ended and she is ready for some passion. With the LSAT coming up and her goals to ace law school and become a partner in her father’s prestigious law firm penciled in her life plan, the only missing piece is the love of her life. The hunt is on, but there is just one problem: All the guys in New York City are flakes. Interested one day and gone the next – dropping off the face of the earth with no warning and no explanation. Initially a firm believer that love will conquer all, Jane becomes jaded and cynical, debating whether to join her best friend Marissa in singlehood, making cupcakes and watching True Blood or follow the advice of her co-worker Andrew and turn the game back on those who scorned her. As Jane attempts to juggle her own responsibilities and put up with the colorful problems of everyone around her, she realizes that having it all isn’t all that easy, and even the best laid plans sometimes require revisions.If you think you’ve read all that chick lit has to offer, think again as A State of Jane concludes with a curve-ball you don’t see coming.
