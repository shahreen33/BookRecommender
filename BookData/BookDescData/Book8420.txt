Hailed by The New Yorker as one of the funniest writers in America, "whose satirical brazenness holds up to Twain and Nathanael West, " David Sedaris has delighted National Public Radio listeners for years. Now, for the first time on CD and in a convenient box set, he gives voice to his biting sensibility.Barrel Fever and others Stories is Sedaris' first collection of comic stories and essays. Performed by David and Amy Sedaris, this program is described by the New York Post as "a nuclear barrage of humor you could never replicate by reading this material on your own."In Holidays on Ice, Sedaris skewers the absurd conventions and contrivances of the holiday season, with hilarious effect.Naked, a riotous compilation of stories performed by David and Amy Sedaris, was praised by Publishers Weekly as "highly likeable and spirited throughout."Traveling from his childhood in North Carolina to a second linguistic childhood as a non-French-speaking citizen of Paris, Me Talk Pretty One Day is both poignant and full of humor.
