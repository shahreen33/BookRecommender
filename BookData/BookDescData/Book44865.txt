"Oh, darling. You're going to be so easy to conquer." His finger reached under my chin and pulled my face back to meet his. "I can't wait to strip you out of that dress and watch you crawl around my home naked. I'm going to spank that delectable ass with every damn pervertible I can find. Hairbrushes, wooden spoons, spatulas, and I might even try a damn baking sheet. That ass of yours is always going to be prettily pink and perfectly swollen while you're under my roof."  My name is Mark Matthews. I own half of London, and the part I don't own, I'm working on.  Life was all going swimmingly well until Michael Redcliff entered my life, demanding that I marry his daughter. Actually, swap demand for blackmail. He's got goods on me that I want no one else to see, so for the time being I need to be his little lapdog.  I'll marry his daughter. I'll give him all the status, money and power he can handle... for as long as it takes me to get a divorce. You see, I can't renege on our little arrangement - but she can. I give her a week. One week and she'll be screaming the place down for her legal counsel.  I am never wrong.
