Pursuing the spirit of adventure and an altruistic goal of raising global awareness and funds for breast caner, Polly Letofsky broke down barriers and walked across four continents, 22 countries and covered over 14,000 miles in five years to be the first American woman to successfully walk around the world. With personal honesty, candor, and heart-pounding prose, Polly takes us deep into the pain and glory of being a woman that paid attention to her heart s desire and went in search of all that the world had to offer. Across four continents strangers welcomed her into their homes. The world had embraced her. But in the middle of Polly s journey, September 11 flung us all into a crossroads in world history, and she found her self in a vastly changing world.
