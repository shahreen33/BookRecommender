 Welcome to the Den...   Seven years ago, Niklaus "Red" Volkov was offered an opportunity, one that would give him the ability to even the score with the Albanian mobsters that had tortured him for days and took the life of the only girl he'd loved.

He willingly paid the price for means to fulfill the vendetta that plagued him each day.   Vengeance was all he knew...    And death was all he lived for...    Until it wasn't...    Until her...
