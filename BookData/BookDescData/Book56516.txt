It started with an invitation.A masquerade ball, the ultimate fantasy.The concept was fascinating, and surprisingly simple.Wear a mask and forget who you are.So, I did just that…maybe a little too well.Something about that night gave me a false sense of bravery.I met the most beautiful man, masked and delicious.Tempting as hell, and as naughty as they come.His touch left me breathless.Just one passion filled encounter and I’ll never see him again.No harm done.Until.My new gynecologist walked into the exam room, I look up to see that same gorgeous face.Those eyes.But this time, he’s the doctor, and I’m the patient.
