TIMMISTRIA! "Golden World of Opportunity and Adventure!" Or so said the emigration brochure. On that promise, Cara Harvestmoon had given everything so she and her brother Shawn could escape the hell of their home world for a new life on the golden forest planet. But they soon find themselves trapped at the center of a building global war between the two races of native peoples. The Timmon welcome the human colony for its promises of technology and space travel, while their cousins, the Delerin, fear an invasion and want the humans to leave-or die. In a race against time and the advancing Delerin, Cara fights to save the colonial village of Fairdawn, the primitive frontier town that she and Shawn helped build with their own sweat, perseverance, and relentless will. But with little left to offer, what will she give to protect them all?
