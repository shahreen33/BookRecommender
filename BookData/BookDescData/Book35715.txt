A Post Apocalyptic ThrillerBlindness was just the beginning. It was only when the virus progressed to Stage 2 that the true horror emerged. Ordinary people were being turned into mindless predators, and it didn't take Mason long to figure out their prey of choice. He thought he'd had nothing left to lose, but now he is all that stands between a young girl and a gruesome fate, and he's sworn to protect her with his very life. They'll have to be smart, they'll have to be strong, and they'll have to be every bit as ruthless as the swarm, but even as Mason and Mackenzie battle their way from one horror to the next in a desperate flight through a world gone mad, they both know that their time is running out. The virus isn't done yet. Stage 3 is coming, and things are about to get a whole lot worse.
