My name is Jack Steen. That name shouldn’t mean anything to you. Unless you’re about to die. And then I’m your bloody guardian angel. I work as a night nurse in hospital for the criminally insane. You picked up this book because of the title, right? Deathbed Confessions of the Criminally Insane. That’s exactly what you’re about to read.  The story you're about to read is of the Funeral Director. He was accused of eating the organs of his victims. A crime he never confessed to despite the evidence. This is his story...and yes, his confession. The only one you'll ever hear from him.  My name is the only real name you’ll find in this book. I won’t tell you which hospital I work at. I won’t tell you the names of those dying. But I won’t lie to you. You’ll read exactly what I’m told.  If you’re smart, if you’re deranged enough to read between the lines, you’ll know who is telling the story. I can’t say all the stories are real. I doubt they’re all one hundred percent true but there’s always a nugget of truth to every tale ever told - but then, what the fuck do I know.  These sadistic bastards could be playing their final game with me by messing with my head. And now they can play with yours.
