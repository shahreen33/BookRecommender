A madcap and magical retelling of The Goose Girl from a unique perspective.   Burndee can barely tolerate the mischievous Prince Colin, but the two of them are invariably thrown together in a way that keeps them at one another’s throats.  While attending a noblewoman’s wedding, Burndee and Colin’s private feud comes to a climax when Burndee loses his temper and does the unthinkable. With Prince Colin unable to attend to his royal duties and Burndee bound by an inconvenient spell, can the two of them work together long enough to unsnarl the mysterious goings-on around them?  The next installment in "The Tales of Ambia" series from Allison Tebo. A Royal Masquerade is a new addition to the charming fairy tale tradition of Cameron Dokey and K.M. Shea.
