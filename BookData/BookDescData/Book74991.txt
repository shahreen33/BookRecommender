There’s no limit to pain when the only person to trust is the one who let you down the worst.  Melissa Monroe may rule in the courtroom, but being a lawyer hasn’t helped in her personal life one bit. Every day she lives in fear that someone will find out her secret and to make matters worse, the one person who knows it, has blackmailed her into a relationship she never wanted to be in.  Her heart has always belonged to Gamble, President of the Brothers of Olympus MC. But the club life scared the hell out of her, and she had no choice but to walk away from Gamble and everything that came with him.  Now to make matters worse, there’s a rival MC terrorizing her to get to the man she thought she left in the past, and Gamble might be her only chance to survive. But that might mean telling him her secret…and that secret could crush them both and get way too many people killed in the crossfire.  Gabe “Gamble” Smith was born to ride. With his grandfather being the founder of the Brothers of Olympus MC, it was his destiny to take over one day. His rule has always been one of steel and lead, until Melissa Monroe walked into his life. She was the only woman to ever see through his hard exterior and then, he lost her.  When another club needs help, Gamble jumped at the opportunity to put a thousand miles between him and the woman who owned his heart but refused to be with him. But no matter how many women warm his bed or how many states are between them, she still owns him.  Gamble doesn’t hesitate to hightail it back when he gets word that she’s in trouble, deep trouble, and it’s all because of him. He’d do anything for his club, but when he learns the secret the love of his life has kept from him, he’ll move Heaven and Earth, or set the entire world on fire to get her back.
