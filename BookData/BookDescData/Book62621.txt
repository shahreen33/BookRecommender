Most people can name at least one situation—a business presentation, a job interview, a cocktail party, or a blind date—in which they felt uncomfortable, nervous, or simply self-conscious. Jane Marla Robbins, a successful stage and film actress and teacher for almost forty years, found that she could use the same acting techniques she employed to look and feel confident on stage and screen to make herself feel more comfortable in "real-life" situations. In clear and accessible language, Robbins describes acting techniques that actors having been using for centuries and explains—using real-life examples and easy-to-follow exercises—how each can be used by ordinary people to make difficult everyday situations easier to handle. Acting Techniques for Everyday Life will teach readers how to create a sense of well-being and self-confidence at will, giving them the tools they need to be as confident, strong, witty, authentic, relaxed, and happy as they want to be in any given situation.
