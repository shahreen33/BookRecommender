Like its well-loved predecessor, the fourth edition of this classic Louisiana survey textbook is the combined effort of four authors: Light T Cummins on Colonial Lousiana, Judith Kelleher Schafer on the Antebellum and Civil War Period, Edward F Haas, on the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and Michael Kurtz, who takes the Louisiana saga from the depths of the Great Depression all the way to the summer of 2001. Once again, the authors have re-examined their own research as well as that of many other scholars in order to present the most comprehensive history of the many different peoples that have and currently do make the rich, colourful land known as Louisiana their home.
