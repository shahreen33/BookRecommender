If you want to read gripping stories that don’t rely on sex, swearing, and graphic violence—you’ve come to the right place!  DEEP MAGIC is a bi-monthly electronic magazine that publishes clean short fiction in the fantasy and science fiction genres (epic, paranormal, steampunk, etc). Our issues are also filled with author interviews, art features, book reviews and tips for writers.  In this issue we feature "Metamorphistry" from Wall Street Journal bestselling author Jeff Wheeler. We also include a short story by NYT bestselling author Terry Brooks from his Shannara universe called "The Black Irix." We're also pleased to welcome the writing duo Tony Pi and Stephen Kotowych in their creative fantasy "The Waxing Disquiet". You'll also be thrilled with an alien invasion story told from the point of view of a canine - we loved "Bad Dog" by Patrice Sarath! And last but not least, you'll find a great story by Christen Anne Kelley on library magic called "Dreams of a Radiant Sentry".  In this issue you'll also get sneak preview of two new novels: "The Fifth Doll" by Charlie N Holmberg and "The Gold-Son" by Carrie Anne Noble. Both are Amazon bestselling authors. We've also interviewed literary agent Matt Bialer who represents Patrick Rothfuss and Tad Williams. And we feature two writing craft articles, one from the voice of The Passive Voice blog, attorney David Vandagriff, and the other about worldbuilding from author Sara Larson. As you can see, this issue is full of treats!
