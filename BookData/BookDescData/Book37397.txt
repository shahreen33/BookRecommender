 One look, and panties drop. One night, and they’re ready to marry me.   Too bad I’m not interested in anything more than a taste.  Until I’m tempted by Little Miss Goody-Two-Shoes. She’s a good girl, the kind I want to possess, dominate, ruin. No one’s ever told me no, and I’m not about to let it stop me now.  She keeps pushing me away, even with her curvy body pressed against mine and those soft moans spilling from her lips.  But I’m persistent. She doesn’t stand a chance. And now that she’s moved in next door, it’s only a matter of time before I'll have her screaming my name.  She can try to run, but she’s not getting away from the bad boy next door.  *Inked is a full-length standalone romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger.
