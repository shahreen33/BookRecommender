Then a series of strange and terrifying events take place, and Sep and his friends understand that one of them has broken the pact.As their sacrifices haunt them with increased violence and hunger, they realise that they are not the first children to have found the box in their town's history. And ultimately, the box may want the greatest sacrifice of all: one of them.
