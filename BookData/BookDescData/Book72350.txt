Womanizer. Casanova. Heartbreaker. Skirt-chaser. And my personal favourite, Mr Steal Your Girl. I've been called them all. But still, the women keep on coming. And coming. Hundreds of women slide into my DM’s and I slide into their…well, I think you can see where I'm going with this. Men want to be me and women want to bed me. Despite what the bunny boilers of San Francisco call me, I go by the name of Buzz. I'm 6’4” and the proud owner of a six-pack, beard and too many tattoos to count. I’m a walking wet dream. For the longest time, I didn’t believe in love. I didn’t even believe in relationships. I couldn’t understand why anybody would willingly choose to have sex with only one person. Until I met Lori. She turned my entire world upside down and made me feel things which I didn’t even know I was capable of. But when I couldn’t deal with her career as a honey trapper, I lost her. But now I want her back. And I always get what I want. It’s lucky that I found her again. It’s unlucky that she has a new boyfriend. Unlucky for him.  ***Although Buzz can be read as a standalone, it is advised to read The Honey Trap first as it provides some background to Buzz and Lori's story. The Honey Trap is currently free in Kindle Unlimited.*** A Second Chance Romance.
