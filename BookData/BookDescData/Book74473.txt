William Leith was in Manhattan, waiting to interview Dr Atkins of New Diet Revolution fame, when he realised that this wasn't just another journalistic assignment. He realised that he wanted to understand his pathological relationship with food and why he was fat - he was 18 stone at the time. William found it hard to talk about his weight and he also knew, from his experience as an interviewer, that being fat was something people found more difficult to talk about than just about anything else; this was a hugely controversial and substantial subject. In some respects it will be a literal journey (like Jon Ronson's Them, in terms of the up-close questioning of his quarry) with the eye-opening impact of a No Logo.
