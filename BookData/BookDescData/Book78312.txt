Jules was born with a gift, but until now, he's only used it for small and selfish reasons.That will all change as he's inducted into The Circle, a secret international organisation that takes the magickally gifted and puts them to work, fighting the forces of darkness, saving an unknowing world from malevolence that hide in the shadows.And Jules knows shadows all too well; he can command them to do his bidding...But it's not just The Circle that has their eye on Jules. There's another Magickian that watches him, intervening in his life, trying to put him on a path to discover the truth. Because The Circle is not what it seems. The world is not as it seems.And soon, Jules will have to choose between the status quo or the greater good. Either way, the lives of everyone he loves will hang in the balance.
