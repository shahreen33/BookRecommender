Wolverine promised Cyclops that X-Force would disband--he lied. A secret society has resurrected En Sabah Nur, putting into motion events that will turn this age of heroes into an Age of Apocalypse! To hold them back, Wolverine and Archangel bring together Fantomex, Deadpool, and Psylocke to form The Uncanny X-Force! Stained by their history, they are the only ones capable of making the hard resolutions necessary. A band of likeminded friends and mercenaries set to one purpose, one big ugly task--kill Apocalypse by any means.Collecting: Uncanny X-Force 1-4, &amp; material from Wolverine: Road to Hell, All-New Wolverine Saga
