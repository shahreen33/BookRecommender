Vows sealed us together. The mob tore us apart.But now this beast without his beauty is coming back to take what’s his.She’s mine. To love. To honor. To comfort. And this time, to keep.Forever.To a rough, filthy, savage mob fixer like me, she was an angel. My angel. The beauty to tame the beast I kept inside. I was lost the second I saw her. Abby was my everything. My second chance, the bride I never should have had.…And then one day, I didn’t.The mob takes its dues in blood, and I was their collector. And somehow, I let her get away from me. Too many shadows. Too much blood on my hands. Too many nights away from the only bed I wanted, warmed by the only woman I ever craved. But tonight, I’m through. Tonight, I’m taking back my wife.I’ve been keeping watch over her, and my desire has turned to obsession. It’s turned into a raw, fierce need—to have her, to claim her once again. To take her back and take her in our marriage bed. I’m through being the mob’s mad dog, and this beast is about to tear their world apart to get back his bride. Months ago, I let the only goodness I’ve ever known walk out of my life. But tonight, I’m taking her back.Tonight, I’m claiming her all over again. Tonight, I’m going to remind her of the vows we spoke.And I’ll storm heaven and hell to take back my angel.
