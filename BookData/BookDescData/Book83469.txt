“Gentle, affectionate, and genuinely touching stories about the street musicians, immigrants, artists, entrepreneurs, con artists and lovers who live on or near Martin Luther King Boulevard . . . . people who celebrate ‘every bit of brightness’ in their lives, and Patty Somlo makes their stories shine.” – Molly Giles, author of the story collections All the Wrong Places, Creek Walk, and Rough Translations.“Reading Patty Somlo’s stories is like sitting at the feet of a wise and ancient storyteller who both entertains and speaks words of wisdom. This is fiction written in the best possible way--writing that finds something noble even among the most down-trodden. Read her!” – E.C. Osondu, Winner of The Caine Prize. Associate Professor of English Providence College. Weaving together the real and the fantastic, the 15 linked stories in Hairway to Heaven Stories introduce a diverse cast of characters living in a once predominantly African American neighborhood, now in the midst of gentrification. In these 15 stories, faith plays a key role, either through traditional religion, spirituality linked to nature or belief in the promise of a better life. The stories also present a microcosm of many neighborhoods in cities throughout the country, in which people of different races, ethnicities, class and sexual orientation are living in close proximity to one another, with neighbors being both strangers and friends. The collection was published by Cherry Castle Publishing, a black-owned press “that honors the vibrant multicultural voice of American literature” and embraces work “informed by the social, political and cultural vigor of our times.” https://www.cherrycastlepublishing.com/.
