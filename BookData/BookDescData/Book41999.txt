The Greater the Change, the Stronger the ConstantThe human race had always been its own worst enemy. Before the shrink, war, murder, and genocide, had killed more people than any other outside force. Even after billions had died due to that mysterious act, little about human nature had changed.Devin and Dakotah could well attest to that fact. Having already experienced mankind’s brutality first hand, the young couple understood that other people were as big of a threat to their survival as the hungry animals left in the wake of humanity’s near extinction.Abducted by forces that seem to be protecting them and thrown into a group of strangers by whim, they soon discover that the practice of cold-blooded murder is alive and well. Not only must they deal with the usual hardships of life at the size of an action figure, but also the suspicion, paranoia, and fear created as the killings continue.Determined to get back to their friends, Devin and Dakotah navigate both the physical and social landscapes of this new environment in order to escape their overly protective captors before the killer comes for them.
