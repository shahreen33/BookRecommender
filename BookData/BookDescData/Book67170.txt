Now available in the same cute-as-a-kitten paperback format as the immensely popular Cats in the Sun (0-8118-1093-3) and Kittens in the Sun (0-8118-3905-2), Hans Silvester's latest reveals the full wealth and intensity of feline affection: from the amorous prowl of a tomcat to the motherly tenderness of a tabby, from the playful nips of tussling kittens to siblings curled up in a nap. Set against the idyllic whitewashed villages of the Mediterranean, Cats in Love will delight fans of Silvester's previous works and charm softies of every stripe.
