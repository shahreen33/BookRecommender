  An exciting approach to learning and refining reading and writing skills prevails throughout this provocative anthology. It interests readers in several works on a certain theme, engages them in reading instruction while reading, and prompts them to complete a writing assignment based upon what they have read.  Forty thought-provoking readings on a number of subjects are organized around five general themes: people, places, events, phenomena, and issues. The essays, short stories, poems, and excerpts--along with the six activities that follow each one--will help readers bring all the pieces together to create and understand "the big picture."   For anyone who wants to find out that reading can be fun, and that anyone can learn to be a good writer.
