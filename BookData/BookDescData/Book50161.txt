 I'm breaking every bro code in the book—but I can't help myself.  Unwrapped is published in Holiday Bad Boys Christmas Bundle! This exclusive edition has a brand new bonus chapter, deleted scenes and never before love scenes! Steven Maxwell After four long years in the sandbox, I was finally going home for Christmas. I expected Christmas trees, hot toddies and more cookies than I could eat. But when I went to visit my old pal Rick, I got more than I bargained for when Ruby, his little sister, answered the door. Ruby "Brace Face"— only now she's all grown up and I can't keep my mind off of her — or my hands. I know it's wrong. I'm breaking every bro code there is. But I can't help myself. I want her. Ruby I wasn't looking for a hero, but when Steven Maxwell showed up on my parents front porch, it was just in the nick of time. After my worst holiday season in history, Steven was just the distraction I needed to get me through New Years in one piece. As long as my brother didn't find out, we were safe. Which shouldn't be that hard, except one night turns into two and gets me wishing I didn't have to return to my catastrophic life back in New York. But that would be crazy, wouldn't it?  Unwrapped is a novella-length forbidden romance with a sexy Navy SEAL, no cliffhanger and a very happy ending. Intended for readers 18+ due to Kindle-melting scenes and other mature content. For a limited time, Northern Lights - A Novel is also included in this Kindle edition for your reading pleasure! Enjoy! xoxoxoxo
