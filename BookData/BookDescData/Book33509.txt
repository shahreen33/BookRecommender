From one of Canada’s most distinctive and intelligent emerging voices, a heartfelt collection of essays in Durga Chew-Bose’s captivating and truly inimitable style. In Too Much and Not the Mood, Durga Chew-Bose flings us headlong into her most intimate philosophical, and occasionally brooding, thoughts. The result is a lyrical and piercingly insightful collection of essays and her own brand of essay-meets-prose poetry about identity and culture. Reflective and highly astute, Chew-Bose invites readers to join in her search for a clearer understanding of who we are and the world we live in. This is a beautiful and surprising exploration of what it means to be a young first-generation writer today, shutting out the din in order to find her own voice. Exhibiting the confidence of Lena Dunham, the honesty of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and the extraordinary vision of Zadie Smith, Too Much and Not the Mood is a stunning debut from an author who is sure to become one of this generation’s most esteemed voices.
