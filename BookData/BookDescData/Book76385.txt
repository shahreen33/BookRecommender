JosiI was so lost when he found me.A young man of no experience, not knowing what love was, but he showed me. He made me feel what it's like to be alive and opened my eyes to what the world truly is. I'm nothing without him and he knows it because he's nothing without me. His words are often full of praise, of need, yet I know he deserves better. I need him. I can't live without him. I'll adjust to what he wants. And maybe, when he's ready, he'll show me just how much he needs me too. BishopBefore him, I lived my life with such rigidity that my shoulders were perpetually riddled with knots. I followed a strict code. He's sweet and young and sees the world through a different lens which helps me relax. The rules I abide by are important for many reasons, but he makes me do things I normally wouldn't. Things I shouldn't, but saying no to him is not something I seem to be capable of. To help him learn, I teach him the rules and punish him as needed. They say love knows no bounds. That it doesn't judge and it isn't biased, but can it survive his recklessness and my proclivities?
