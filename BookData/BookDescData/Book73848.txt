On an island off the coast of Maine, a man is found dead. There's no identification on the body. Only the dogged work of a pair of local newspapermen and a graduate student in forensics turns up any clues.  But that's just the beginning of the mystery.

No one but Stephen King could tell this story about the darkness at the heart of the unknown and our compulsion to investigate the unexplained.
