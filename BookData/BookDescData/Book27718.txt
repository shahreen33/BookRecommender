Desperate to get out of his debt to the Odyssey Shop, Jake Istenhegyi answers a quirky classified ad: TREASURE HUNTERS WANTED. He signs on with a crew that is looking for the Cross of Trismegistus, a relic stolen by Pierre Rameau, the Pirate King of Honey Island and lost during the Battle of New Orleans. According to legend, the Cross of Trismegistus holds a sliver of crystal called ‘Salt Vitam Aeternam’—The Salt of Eternal Life. This makes it more than just a pretty bauble to Istenhegyi. If it is a twin of the crystal that granted the Lombardi sisters immortality, he could use it to avoid their fate: turning to stone in a hundred years. If it there is only a slim possibility that the Salt exists, he has to take that chance.Unfortunately, Jake doesn’t know that waiting for him deep in the dark bayou is his oldest enemy.But first, Jake Istenhegyi has to cope with a surprise visit from home, clear his name for the murder of an Irish boxer, and continue the façade of Gunn Investigations, keeping the death of Bear Gunn a secret from Mama Effie and the mysterious owners of the Odyssey Shop.Who knew what trouble could come from answering a simple classified ad?
