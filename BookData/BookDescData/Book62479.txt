A bootcamp in Utah in 118-degree heat. A raw food diet. Hypnotic suggestions. A team of crack computer scientists who can age—and de-age—a face with the click of a mouse. The World Convention on Anti-Aging Medicine in Las Vegas (headlined by Suzanne Somers). These are just a few of the stops Lauren Kessler makes on her journey to reverse time from the inside out.At this moment, one in three Americans are entering midlife and many are wondering, ‘How did I get to be this old?’ Plenty will turn to miracle creams, injections, fillers, and surgery to reverse the hands oftime, but Kessler investigates the largely unexplored side of antiaging: what it takes to be younger, not just look younger. Guided by both intense curiousity and healthy skepticism, a sense of adventure, and a sense of humor, she investigates America’s youth obsession and decides, on a very personal level, what to do about it. She is at once the careful reporter, the immersion journalist, the self-designated lab rat, and a midlife woman who is not interested in being as old as her driver’s license insists she is.Kessler’s mission isn’t about vanity (well, maybe a little) but about discovering ways to maintain stamina, vitality, fortitude, and creativity right to the very end.
