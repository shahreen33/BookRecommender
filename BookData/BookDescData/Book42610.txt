The Nectar of Pain is a collection of poetry and prose that the pain of love and loss gave birth to. When pain knocks on your door, let it in. If you don't, it will knock harder and harder. Its voice will become louder and louder. So let it in. Spend some time with it. Understand it. Then walk it to the door and let it leave because it's time for you to welcome happiness.
