Terry Wardle presents compelling evidence that countless churches are made up of people who seem perpetually caught in spiritual infancy. What does it really mean to be Christlike? Christians today are struggling with immaturity because they do not know the answer to that question. This book surveys the life of Jesus to identify eight characteristics of Christ that are to be nurtured by the Holy Spirit in the believer's life. Being transformed into the likeness of Christ is the true mark of spiritual maturity.
