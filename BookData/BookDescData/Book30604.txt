Albuquerque CPA Charlotte "Charlie" Parker handles the business side of RJP Investigations while her brother, Ron, does the detecting. When Ron is out of town, however, Stacy North, who eloped with Charlie's fiance, Brad, 10 years earlier, comes calling, hoping to hire someone to find her missing Rolex watch. Charlie reluctantly takes the case and soon locates the watch. Stacy, it turns out, had been having an affair. Soon the lover is dead, and Stacy is an obvious suspect. Charlie sticks with the case and finds herself involved with still more murder. "An auspicious debut!" -- I Love a Mystery newsletter"This is a dandy. Don't miss it." -- Book Talk
