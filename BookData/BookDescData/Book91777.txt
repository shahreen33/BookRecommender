Aristotle was named the "master of those who know." He is a foundational thinker in almost every field of inquiry and for fifteen hundred years he remained the paradigm of knowledge itself. Even today, his contributions to, amongst many other areas, logic, metaphysics, rational psychology, political science, sociology, aesthetics, and ethics resonate in modern philosophy.
