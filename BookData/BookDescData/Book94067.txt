Grab your boots and spurs and hat—it’s time to be a cowgirl!Way out west, the warm winds blow. The grass grows high, the sun hangs low. I’ll find a farm, there I’ll go, and I’ll become a cowgirl. From sun up to sun down, the girl in this story pretends to be a cowgirl as she pulls on her (rain) boots, saddles up her (stick) horse, and gallops off through the (backyard) hills. Filled with humor and imaginative play, this sweet story from Angela DiTerlizzi captures the dream of zillions of little girls everywhere—the dream of being a cowgirl!
