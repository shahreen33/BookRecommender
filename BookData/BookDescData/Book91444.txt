It’s Pepper Dunn’s first Thanksgiving in the magical town of Magnolia Cove, Alabama. The entire town is ready to celebrate—except Pepper, who’s still yearning for her boyfriend, Axel Reign, to return.  But she has little time to mourn. When a new baker sets up shop across the street from Pepper’s cousin and starts stealing customers, it’s all out war. But when the storeowner ends up murdered and Pepper’s cousin becomes suspect number one, it’s up to Pepper to help.  Thrust into a mystery, she teams up with a talking rabbit that’s keeping more information than he’s revealing and an old foe turned friend. More secrets than Pepper bargained for unravel in front of her, but the main one—who killed the baker, is anyone’s guess.  Will Pepper solve the murder or will she become the next victim?
