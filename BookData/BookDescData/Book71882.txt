The series that includes Kid Presidents, Kid Artists, and Kid Athletes now chronicles the lives of Kid Authors! Here are true tales of famous writers, from long before they were famous--or even old enough to drive. Did you know:  - Sam Clemens (aka Mark Twain) loved to skip school and make mischief, with his best friend Tom, of course! - A young J. R. R. Tolkien was bitten by a huge tarantula--or as he called it, -a spider as big as a dragon.- - Toddler Zora Neale Hurston took her first steps when a wild hog entered her house and started chasing her! The diverse and inclusive cast includes Roald Dahl, Beverly Cleary, J. K. Rowling, Langston Hughes, Jules Verne, Lewis Carroll, Stan Lee, and many more.
