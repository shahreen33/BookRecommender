Tess Laurelton, PhD, likes things wild and unexpected. She's curvy, smart and not the kind of woman to let life stand in the way of adventure. Her career as a well-respected grizzly bear expert should have given her plenty of adventure, but instead, she's camped up inside a research lab. When she is given the opportunity to find out why the grizzly population at Cabinet Mountains in Montana is suddenly booming, she jumps at the chance. What she doesn't know is that the innocent trip will be a lot more primal and untamed than she could have ever imagined.  Jackson Arder might be known as a reserved forest ranger, but he is first and foremost the powerful Alpha of a prominent werebear clan. His clan has come under attack by a man he thought of as his brother, Ryder Hunt, throwing his life in turmoil. When Tess shows up on Jackson's doorstep, looking like a sassy, curvy treat made just for him, Jackson knows life is about to get a lot more heated than he was prepared for. How can a bear wage war when all he wants to do is claim the sexy, whip-smart woman who strolled into his world as if she belonged there?  As danger surrounds them, Jackson finds himself falling fast and hard for Tess. But with war at his door, can he give his heart to someone who doesn't know about his true nature? Can Tess love both the man and the bear or will she run for the hills when she finds out the truth?
