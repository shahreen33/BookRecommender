Rosie  They say that life is a beautiful lie and death a painful truth. They're right. No one has ever made me feel more alive than the guy who serves as a constant reminder that my clock is ticking. He is my forbidden, shiny apple. The striking fallacy to my blunt, raw, truth. He is also my sister's ex-boyfriend. One thing you should know before you judge me; I saw him first. I craved him first. I loved him first. Eleven years later, he waltzed into my life, demanding a second chance. Dean Cole wants to be my bronze horseman. My white knight has finally arrived. Hopefully, he isn’t too late.  Dean  They say the brightest stars burn out the fastest. They’re right. She sets my mind on fire. All smart mouth, snarky attitude and a huge heart. In a world where everything is dull, she shines like fucking Sirius. Eleven years ago, fate tore us apart. This time, I dare it to try. Getting to her is a battlefield, but man, that’s why they call me Ruckus. Rosie LeBlanc is about to find out how hard I can fight. And conquering her will be the sweetest victory.
