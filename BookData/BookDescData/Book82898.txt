Texas veterinarian Cayce Gerard has wrestled a sick bull to the ground, out-growled an angry Tibetan Mastiff with a sore tooth and climbed to the top branch of a hundred year oak tree to rescue an injured hawk. The only creature he hasn’t tamed is Ashley Sharpe.  He can’t crate her.  He sure as heck can’t sedate her.  Only option left is to spank her.  But teaching princess a valuable life lesson about being bratty takes a sudden turn.  Was that a moan he heard?  Yup!  Is he going to do something about it?  Damn straight!  **** This 32,000 word novel re-envisions the happy-for-now ending of Cayce and Ashley from the 6,900 word short story Spanked by the Vet. There’s still a spanking and more sultry heat than even a southern summer can hold. There’s also a happily-ever-after, right after Ashley teaches Cayce a lesson of her own.
