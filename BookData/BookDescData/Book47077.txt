After stopping the destruction of London, Dave and Melanie have earned a romantic getaway in the country. Even though they’ve left the stresses of the city behind, they’re soon up to their necks with paranormal researchers, witches and the ghosts of star-crossed lovers. Not to mention the lack of broadband and the unspeakable horror lurking in the woods.They’re getting closer to nature, but nature is getting far too close for comfort.  Serious Moonlight is the fifth part in a series of best-selling funny urban fantasy novellas that tells the story of Death and his friends protecting humanity from ghosts, zombies, vampires and medium-sized apocalypses. What Amazon readers are saying about the How To Be Dead series:★★★★★ “Dave Turner is a funny man and ‘How To Be Dead’ is a brilliant read.”★★★★★ “If Neil Gaiman and Simon Pegg sat down to write a story together they might come up with something like this.”★★★★★ “Hilarious and unexpectedly moving.”★★★★★ “Laugh out loud funny… It’s been a while since an author has made me laugh more than Pratchett does.”★★★★★ "If you like Tom Holt, Douglas Adams or Terry Pratchett, Dave Turner's books will fit perfectly into your collection."
