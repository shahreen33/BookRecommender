It's a chilling fact that suicide is today's number two cause of death for young people. Arcadia is a story about suicide, but it's also a story about life. This is the fascinating tale of a suicidal teen named Jacob Harper, told vividly and unforgettably by his loving father. It's a journey through Jacob's private world of torment, disappointment, fear, humor, hope, love, and finally, success. Arcadia is as relentlessly personal as it is entertaining, and as honest as it is encouraging.
