The author of Psalm 119 described God's Word as a lamp to my feet and a light for my path. Those words are as true today as they were thousands of years ago. No matter what we face in life, the Bible contains passages that offer valuable guidance and support. Sometimes it is hard to find just the right words when we need them. God's Promises books contain key passages of Scripture arranged thematically for easy and quick identification. These books contain only God's Scripture, taken from the NIV, ERV, NLT and NKJV translations of the Bible and nothing speaks into our lives as does his unchanging word. Each book is attractive, practical and is perfect for giving as gifts or for personal encouragement and reflection.
