Terrified she'll be taken away from him Henry stays away from prying eyes until one evening, a stranger steps out of the shadows and calls to him. He says he has lost his memory and remembers nothing but Henry's name and his own: Jack Turner.Henry is both terrified of and irresistibly drawn to jack: why does this man seem to familiar, so magnetic?
