"There once was a man named Bluff who thought himself great at all stuff..."  Mr. Kind uses lyrical rhyme coupled with the marvelous graphic imagery of Zacc Pollitt to weave the tale of the once pompous Bluff who steals fun only to be brought down by the virtuous message delivered via a contest with a cryptic stranger and the light words of an earth angel, thus allowing the children to play and laugh again. These are the stories that last for generations.  Mr. Kind Stories are a YouthWide jubilation produced in association with Prove Nothing.
