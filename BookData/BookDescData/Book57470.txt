Mr. Putter and his fine cat, Tabby, love reading their favorite books over and over. So when Mr. Putter sees a sign at the library that says “Read Aloud with Your Pet at Story Time,” he signs up! But then Mr. Putter's friend and neighbor, Mrs. Teaberry, wants to join. If Mrs. Teaberry brings her good dog, Zeke, to the library, who knows what will happen? With Zeke up to his usual tricks, story time might get too exciting! This volume in the beloved Mr. Putter and Tabby series was named a Geisel Honor Book by the American Library Association.
