From Publishers WeeklyAfter two miscarriages, writer Adam Senft's marriage is on the rocks, and his only satisfaction comes from his bond with his dog, Big Steve. One day, on a walk through local woods rumored to be haunted, man and dog come across a strange sight: a woman performing fellatio on a statue of a satyrâ€”which comes to life and sees them. Soon, all the women in town begin disappearing, summoned to the woods by the satyr's hypnotic piping. When Adam gathers the menfolk to hunt down the satyr and retrieve the women, what they uncover is an unholy evil bent on protecting itself and spreading its seed. Keene displays a fluid command of mythology and has a vivid take on contemporary magic. The conjuring of a blue-collar rural America, one riven with legends and dark crannies, is also superb. The latest from Keene (Dead Sea) grabs the reader immediately and doesn't let go.
