Whether it’s a clutch goal or a cocktail, nothing beats “top shelf.” In this new novel in Kelly Jamieson’s Aces Hockey series, a fun-loving jock and an ambitious career woman prove that sometimes the best drink is made by mixing business with pleasure.  Not only is Jared Rupp one of the stars of the NHL’s Chicago Aces, he’s also the owner of the Sin Bin, the after-hours hot spot where the whole team hangs out. Lately, Jared can’t take his eyes off the woman he’s hired to give the Bin a more modern feel: a sexy, sophisticated consultant who has carved out a niche updating drink menus. She’s as passionate about her career as Jared is about hockey—and yet he can’t help wondering what kind of cocktail she really wants.   In her line of work, Sidney Frayne is used to guys hitting on her in bars, but Jared gets her hot enough to burst into flames. When he’s wining and dining her, he’s sophisticated as hell; on the rink, he’s a testosterone-fueled powerhouse. Still, Sidney’s bitter divorce taught her to keep her emotions on ice. With her busy schedule—and Jared’s playboy reputation—she’s not sure she’s ready for a fling. Because if she lets Jared into her bed, she just may have to let him into her heart.  Praise for Kelly Jamieson and her Aces Hockey series   “Kelly Jamieson is my go-to author for hockey romance.”—USA Today bestselling author Jami Davenport  “A sweet story with plenty of heart about that bad boy you always wanted, who couldn’t wait to have you too.”—Award-winning author Cecy Robson, on Off Limits  “Steamy, sweet, and a whole lot of fun!
