Imogene, a country girl by birth, has always longed for the bright lights of New York City. After graduating from a small-town college, she moves to the big city with her husband Steve and supports him through law school by working low-level publishing jobs. An aspiring writer herself, Imogene struggles with both marriage and career. Then her former college roommate, Sara, arrives in town with plans to establish a film production company. Sara takes over an outfit previously run by her brother, a semi-retired rock star, and Imogene jumps at the chance to join this exciting new venture. She becomes Sara’s confidante and assistant in an ambitious movie project about a youth revolution that threatens to engulf the nation’s capital. As the cast expands and the script evolves, the story line flirts dangerously with reality. The filmmakers can’t predict whether the project will make their fortunes or shatter their lives.
