This book presents an overview of the key concepts in public archaeology—a field that examines the relationship between archaeology and the public—and seeks to clarify the discipline by adopting a socially and politically engaged vision. The individual chapters introduce the themes, theories, and controversies that connect archaeology to society by providing case studies that survey the trade in illicit antiquities and how digital media are used to promote public engagement with the field. Written for both students and practitioners alike, the book also will be an essential resource for pointing readers to further scholarship.
