From USA Today bestselling author Willow Winters comes an emotionally gripping, standalone, contemporary romance. It was never love with Daniel and I never thought it would be. It was only lust from a distance. Unrequited love maybe. He’s a man I could never have, for so many reasons. That didn’t stop my heart from beating wildly when his eyes pierced through me. It only slowed back down when he’d look away, making me feel so damn unworthy and reminding me that he would never be mine.Years have passed and one look at him brings it all back. But time changes everything.There’s a heat in his eyes I recognize from so long ago, a tension between us I thought was one-sided. “Tell me you want it.” His rough voice cuts through the night and I can’t resist. That’s where my story really begins.Possessive is an emotional, gripping story. Filled with heartache, guilt and longing! Possessive will take you on a journey of obsession and jealousy...it's emotional, raw and captivating. - Beyond The Covers Blog
