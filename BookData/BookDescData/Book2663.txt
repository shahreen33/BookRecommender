Will Caylee's salvation come from the solitude of the cold, dark grave or from the sinful delights of surrendering her body and soul to the seduction of a wickedly sexy, dark and dangerous, powerful immortal?From the beginning of time, Haden's kind has fought to stop the deadliest forces of darkness from destroying mankind. He has never feared defeat until now. He would sacrifice anything, even his life, to protect Caylee. But despite possessing the dragon's fierce nature and power, there's little hope he'll save her from a lust-crazed vampire that a rogue demon is aiding. Instead of completing the ancient ritual that'll give his eternal breath to her and bind their souls together for eternity, will Haden be forced to kill Caylee to prevent her from suffering a never-ending thirst for blood?
