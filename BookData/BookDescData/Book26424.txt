Ashley Suzanne follows up Raven with the next round in her scorching Fight or Flight series—the story of a damaged MMA fighter from the wrong side of the tracks, and the sizzling affair that forces him to grow up.   Cutter Greer lives at the gym—literally. Abandoned by his parents as a teen, Cutter dropped out of high school and ended up on the streets. In a simple act of kindness, mixed martial arts trainers Garrett and Rian put him up in the apartment above their gym. Now he’s got a surrogate family and a shot at MMA stardom—but he still has a lot to learn about women. And he certainly isn’t prepared for the earth-shattering consequences desire can bring.   Josette Sandoni is pleasantly surprised by the night of unexpected passion she shares with hard-edged, hard-hitting Cutter. But then comes the shock of a lifetime: She’s pregnant. Even though Cutter clearly isn’t a ready-made father, his adamant denial of any responsibility still shakes her to the core. But, for the sake of their child, Josette fights for their future. She just needs to find the right moves to show her wounded warrior the true meaning of love.   Praise for Ashley Suzanne’s Raven
