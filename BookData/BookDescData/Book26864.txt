Horrid Henry reads Perfect Peter's diary and improves it. He goes clothes shopping with Mum and tries to make her buy him some Rootatoot trainers. He is horrified when his old enemy Bossy Bill turns up at school. And he tries by any means, fair or foul, to win the class football match and defeat Moody Margaret.
