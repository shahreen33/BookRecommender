Everybody’s favourite forgetful cat in the original, classic story!‘Bother that cat!’Mog always seems to be in trouble. She forgets that she has a cat flap and she forgets that she has already eaten her supper. But, one night, Mog’s forgetfulness comes in very handy…Mog has been a beloved character for almost fifty years, and appears in many adventures. This loveable, laughable, and really remarkable cat was based on Judith Kerr’s own family cat, and fifty years since she first appeared in print, Mog continues to touch hearts and make us laugh. And almost never say, ‘Bother that cat!’The perfect gift for families, boys, girls, fans of Judith Kerr, and anyone who has ever known or loved a cat!
