From the day she laced up her first pair of skates, Michelle Kwan knew she belonged on the ice. When she was 7 years old, she vowed that she would one day be an Olympic skater, and went straight to work on making her dream come true. By the time she was 12, she was already competing with top skaters from around the world. At age 15, Kwan won her first national and world titles. And in 1998, she made skating history at the U.S. Championships when she received 15 perfect scores for presentation in her long and short programs, the most perfect scores ever for a female skater. Michelle Kwan is the story of a gifted young athlete whose determination and focus have enabled her to become the most decorated skater in U.S. history. Though the only medal ever to elude her was the Olympic gold, Kwan remains a true champion, and she has shown just as much grace in her setbacks as she has on the ice.
