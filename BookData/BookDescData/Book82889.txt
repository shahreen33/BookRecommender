More than Petticoats: Remarkable Massachusetts Women tells the stories of eleven strong and determined women, all of whom broke through social, cultural, or political barriers to achieve greatness. From Ellen Swallow, the first female graduate of MIT, to Fannie Farmer, who overcame physical disability and wrote the first cookbook using standard measures, these women embodied remarkable determination and an independent spirit.
