What do you do when your boyfriend of five years is sleeping with your best friend and you’re in a dead-end job, breaking your back for mere pennies? I’ll tell you what I did. I did the one thing I’ve been dreading for the last thirteen years, I finally went home. I needed to get back on my feet and I needed my Grams. As much as I wanted to pretend life was working for me, it wasn’t.The problem with home though is that everywhere I turn, her ghosts were haunting me. Crazy, crazy, crazy, just like her, just like my momma. I wanted to pretend that crazy didn't exist, but it was all around me, trying to do its best to pull me under. There’s one problem with that, Keenan Rys. He’s determined not to let it. And I’m determined to keep him away.
