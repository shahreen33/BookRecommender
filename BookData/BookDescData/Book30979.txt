When competing card sharps stir up Siobh�n O'Sullivan's quiet Irish village, a poker tournament turns into a game of Hangman . . .  Naomi's Bistro, managed by the many siblings of the lively O'Sullivan brood, is the place to go for a cuppa tea in Kilbane. For a pint or a game of darts, it's the pub you want. But when Dublin card sharp Eamon Foley is found swinging from the rafters of Rory Mack's pub, it's time for the garda to take matters into their own hands. Macdara Flannery would lay odds it's a simple suicide, but Siobh�n suspects foul play. With conflicting theories abounding, tensions are running high between Siobh�n and Macdara. Soon it's up to Siobh�n to call a killer's bluff, but if she doesn't play her cards right, she may be the next one taken out of the game . . ."The intricate puzzle and continuing Irish atmosphere make this the series' best to date." --Kirkus Reviews
