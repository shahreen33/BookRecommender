Though a number of texts for teaching Biblical Greek now exist, most are plagued by various deficiencies that detract from effective instruction within the time limits set by most college and seminary programs. This new primer by N. Clayton Croy offers a succinct, single-volume introduction to Biblical Greek that has already been tested in classrooms around the country.Taking a primarily deductive approach to teaching Biblical Greek, this volume assumes that students will have no prior knowledge in Greek. Divided into 32 separate lessons, each containing a generous number of exercises, the text leads students from the Greek alphabet to a working understanding of the language of the Bible.
