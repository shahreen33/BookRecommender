As the Apocalypse looms in the horizon, two immortal lovers recount their long lives and how they caused the End of Days. Ben is a half-demon who hungers for Ellie’s soul, but commits a crime against the universe when he shares his immortality with her after she is stricken with the plague. Hunted for breaking the Basic Rule, Ben, together with Ellie, must escape from the Guardian, a powerful demon enforcer who will stop at nothing to cast them both into Hell. From Renaissance Italy to 1800’s America to the Eve of September 11, 2001 to the End of Days, the two immortal lovers struggle to stay together as they stay one step ahead of eternal damnation. A love story set during the Apocalypse, Soul Mates examines whether love, like immortality, can really last forever.
