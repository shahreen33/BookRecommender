Everyone in Nashville knows Nathan Dumont. Thatâ€™s what happens when you develop half a town and sleep with the rest. Five years ago, his fiancee disappeared. Last night, he proposed to me.I had wanted to escape my life, the seedy strip club and the mountain of bills. I had seized the opportunity to live in a mansion, fill my days with country clubs and caviar, my nights with romance and sex.Maybe I should have done my homework first.
