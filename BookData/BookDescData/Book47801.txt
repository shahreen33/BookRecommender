Baby Blues is a pitch-perfect and hilarious family-oriented comic strip that typifies modern parenting. In this chronological collection, readers get a close-up view inside the home of the MacPhersons, a perfectly normal family with perfectly chaotic lives. Daryl and Wanda are deep in the trenches of childrearing and earning their stripes as parents to Zoe, Hammie, and Wren.Baby Blues expertly illustrates why Band-Aids remain in short supply, tattling and teasing lead to time-outs, and an unplanned visit to the dentist or auto mechanic occurs just when the bills seem to be caught up.Baby Blues transcends the comic page by fusing the award-winning imaginations of Rick Kirkman and Jerry Scott with familiar family life. Inside this annotated collection, Kirkman and Scott intuitively balance the humorous with the poignant though relatable and sometimes all-too-familiar parenting scenes.
