When I stumbled into a mafia run club seeking a job, I was looking for protection. Little did I know I’d need protection from him.Conor O’ Callahan was exactly the kind of danger I was trying to avoid. He was gorgeous as sin with an accent hotter than Hades, but that’s where the charm ended. He was also cynical, cold, and downright cranky. So, you could imagine my surprise when he gave me a proposition. Marry him or lose my life. Desperate times call for desperate measures. I’ve learned to do what’s necessary to survive in this world, and I guess that includes marrying a mobster. Regardless of what he might say, it’s only temporary. It’s not like I’m going to sleep with him. Or fall for him. Because that would be stupid, right?
