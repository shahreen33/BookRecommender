Sometimes life offers second chances …  Madeline Stuart, a St. Louis-based accountant, has sworn off relationships. Reeling from a breakup with her long-term boyfriend and her mother’s recent death, she’s determined to avoid personal entanglements of any kind.

Madeline’s curiosity is piqued when she finds an old letter hidden in her grandmother’s antique writing desk addressed to Josephine Amaud in Comfort Crossing. With Gil’s help, she tracks Josephine down and learns the letter is from her first beau, who disappeared suddenly many years ago. While they search for Josephine’s lost love, both Gil and Madeline try to deny the attraction developing between them.  Can a big-city woman and a small-town businessman help to reunite the star-crossed lovers? And can they find a way to put aside their differences to build a future together in this sweet, heartwarming tale of love and forgiveness?  Maybe, just maybe, a second chance is all they really need.
