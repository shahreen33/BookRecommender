She’s not the woman I thought … but dammit, she’s the woman I want.Let’s get this out of the way, right off the bat: I love women.I love the way they look. The way they smell. The way they feel. Especially the way they feel. And I’ve pretty much made it my mission to give each and every woman who shares my bed the ride of her life.Then I met her. All business and completely uninterested in me. And damned if I didn’t want her. Crave her. I told myself I only wanted to tame her. That it was all about the challenge.I never expected to break through her shell and find the softness underneath. Never expected how wild she’d be between the sheets or the way she’d cry my name with such sincere intensity when I totally rocked her world.Most of all, I never expected to fall for her.But I did.And the question is, now that I know I want her, how the hell do I go about keeping her?
