But who is he working for, and what will his former teammates in the Slingers - Dusk, Prodigy and Ricochet - have to say about the new man under the mask? Chances are, their views might not quite line up with Ben's... If you've guessed that it's all leading up to the return of the Slingers, you guessed right!
