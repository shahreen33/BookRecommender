They say there are three things you should do at least once in your life:Dance like nobody’s watching.Travel the world.And fall hopelessly in love.I aimed to do all three.I went to Italy to find myself.But he found me.It was like a story book, our eyes met across a crowded room.He asked me if I needed help reading the menu.We ate, we laughed, we danced, and I fell.Unfortunately, things didn’t go to plan, and we parted ways.Two years later, our eyes meet across a room again.Only this time I was on a date with another man.He went crazy in a jealous fit.But the man I met then is different now.He’s colder, harder, and officially one of the most powerful men in Italy.Dare I say it, even more enticing.But if you dance with the devil, you get burnt.And the fires in Italy are scalding hot.
