However there's another realm at play and Jace and Nadie's dragon will have to fight harder than he's ever fought before to keep the life he's waited eons for.Warning: Contains one not-so-innocent human, a bear known for his bear-hugs, a tattooed and pierced dragon with a fiery temper, and a connection so explosive, you'll be fanning yourself from page one.
