A warrior with fire in his soul! Fleeing an unwanted betrothal to the cruel king, Lady Carice knows her days are numbered. She has never felt desirable—until she meets Norman soldier Raine de Garenne. Soon she longs to experience passion, if only for one night… Aiding beautiful Carice's escape jeopardizes Raine's mission, for if he does not kill the king, his sisters will pay the price. And as each step toward his goal brings him closer to betraying Carice, he knows he'll have to make a choice. His duty…or his heart.
