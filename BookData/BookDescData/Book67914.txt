I feel bad for Søren since his birthday comes right before Christmas. He's always getting combined presents. I guess that's my fault. Sorry, Father Stearns! Anyway, a few years ago I wrote a short story for Søren's birthday/Christmas. Since it's MY birthday, I want to celebrate it with Søren. So here it is - "A Beautiful Thing." A bit of Christmas/Søren's birthday in June. A gift from me to you, my Sinners. Consider it my Un-Birthday present to you all...
