There’s a bear loose in the woods...and he wants to claim Callie Collins.  Callie doesn’t know what to expect when she gets an internship in Russia at the last minute with Andrei, a friend of her father’s she hasn’t seen since childhood. She certainly isn’t expecting to find the hottest guy she’s ever laid eyes on. Unfortunately he doesn’t seem to notice her at all. When he warns her to stay out of the woods and everyone around her starts acting suspiciously she realizes there is more going on than meets the eye.  Andrei fights not to reveal how much he wants Callie. He remembered his best friend’s daughter as a nerdy young girl but the woman who stands in front of him looks good enough to eat and the moment Andrei sees her he knows she must be his. But how does he tell her that not only is he the wild animal he warned her about, but he’s a criminal too...  As Andrei’s two worlds begin to clash and Callie gets caught in the middle they will both have to fight for everything they hold dear, including each other.  But even that isn’t as hard as trying to fight their lust...  *Dad’s Russian Mafia Bear Best Friend is a standalone romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger.
