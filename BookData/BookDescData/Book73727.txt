"Something terrible happened in Salem in 1692 . . . but it isn't what you think!" THE AFFLICTED GIRLS A Novel of Salem by author-researcher Suzy Witten presents a startling new theory of the Salem Witch Hunt which is certain to put this 300-year-old unsettled mystery to rest by expertly guiding readers through the Historical Record to revelation. Part parable, part star-crossed romance, and part supernatural venture, this is an intuitive human history--and inhuman--spun with a modern twist. Centering her story on Salem Village and its inhabitants, exploring their dark household corners as if she is solving a crime, the author adeptly details how the disintegration happened while spinning familiar facts in new directions, with the mysterious "afflictions" finally explained. A controversial debut by a new Historical storyteller. A Walt Disney Studios Fellowship Finalist, 2010 IPPY Silver Medal for Historical Fiction.
