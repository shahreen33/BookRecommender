Field Marshal Erwin Rommel has been described as one of the ten greatest military commanders of all time. This biography of the charismatic leader relies almost entirely on the original of the period. David Irving's exhaustive research has led him to a dusty personnel file on the young Rommel applying - and being turned down - for army commissions, the long-lost "Rommel Diaries", dictated day-by-day to an army corporal and covering two momentous years of his triumphs and defeats in North Africa and numerous other private papers. From them emerges the picture of both an outstanding soldier and military commander, whose tactical genius, brilliance on the battlefields and extraordinary exploits captures the imagination of the world, and Rommel as a husband and father.
