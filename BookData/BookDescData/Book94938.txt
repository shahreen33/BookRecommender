Before the accident, Nate would run. But that was before. A bike collision lands him in a hospital bed, but the people he meets on his ward make him realise that it's not the end, not yet.A beautifully written story with true depth, that tackles the mess that is life head on. Particularly suitable for struggling, reluctant and dyslexic readers aged 12+
