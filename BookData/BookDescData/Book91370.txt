Welcome to Chipping Cheddar, where supernaturals are hidden in plain sight  Be careful what you wish for...  I've only been back home a few weeks and already strange events are happening all over town. Wishes are coming true to the delight of those affected. Despite the seemingly good fortune, I need to put on my Federal Bureau of Magic badge and get to work. I can't let supernatural shenanigans disrupt the natural order of life here, no matter how awesome they seem.  When their good luck starts to take a dark turn, I have to kick my efforts into overdrive. Can I crack the case before these dreams-come-true turn into nightmares?   Fury Godmother (Federal Bureau of Magic Cozy Mystery, Book 2) is a full-length humorous paranormal cozy mystery.
