Kyle Blake likes plans. So far, they're pretty simple: Finish her senior year of high school, head off to a good college, find a cute boyfriend, graduate, get a good job, get married, the whole heterosexual shebang. Nothing is going to stand in the way of that plan. Not even Stella Lewis. Stella Lewis also has a plan: Finish her senior year as cheer captain, go to college, finally let herself flirt with (and maybe even date) a girl for the first time and go from there.Fate has other plans for Kyle and Stella when they're paired up in their AP English class and something between them ignites. It's confusing and overwhelming and neither of them know what to do about it. One thing they do know is that their connection can't be ignored. The timing just isn't right.But is there ever a good time for falling in love?
