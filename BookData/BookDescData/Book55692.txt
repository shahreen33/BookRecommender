We've revised, rewritten (including changing the POV), revamped, and expanded the story to a full-length novel. It is now book one in our first ever sports series. It was SO FUN revisiting this story and updating it! Cole Carson is one of our FAVORITE heroes, we think he is majorly swoon-worthy and we're so happy that his story is back and better than ever!
