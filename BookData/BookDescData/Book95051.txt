Learn the basics of brush lettering, the joys of happy mail and envelope art, as well as creative lettering projects YOU can do in this hands-on, project-filled guide to modern calligraphy.This book can be used to guide individual progress, but also functions well as a family-friendly, let's-create-something-super-cool-tonight, activity book. All projects are broken down step-by-step with accompanying photographs. I selected each project for its easy-to-do value and practical use potential, and offer creative variations. The goal is to introduce you to the concepts and then send you off on your creative path.It's time to reconnect with others through our words, our art, and send our messages of support through the time-honoured skill of letter writing. So join me on this creative journey and let's make some crazy beautiful letters together!
