Sophia Cova lived a quiet, normal life, shadowed in sadness after the loss of her parents in a tragic airline accident. With her older brother being her only living relative and her anchor, Sophia is sure she’s destined for a brighter future. But that was until she was taken.  Stolen from her mundane, orderly life, she was drugged, and woke to every woman’s worst nightmare. With only four grimy basement walls and a rancid mattress, she loses her sense of time, and preserves what’s left of her dignity by hurtling herself into the safety of her mind. The men, the beatings, they come and go with no reaction, until she hears one word that sends an arctic chill through her body. Sold. On the eve of Sophia’s bidding, at one of the largest sexual slavery rings in the world, all hell breaks loose in the mansion of horrors. Gunfire and screams erupt all around her, as panic rises.  Snatched by one monster only to be taken by another, Sophia slowly starts to learn that not everything is as it seems. When secrets unravel, and the twisted game of cat and mouse ensues, The Puppeteer pulls his favorite strings and chaos brews. Lives are lost while the clock ticks, and only time will tell who will be killed next…WARNING: This book contains very disturbing situations, dubious content, strong language, and graphic violence.
