The Targon Syndicate wants revenge, to the tune of half a million credits for Dace’s head. And Jerimon, Jasyn’s brother, is about to hand it to them. It doesn’t matter that he’s working undercover for the Patrol and Lowell. Targon isn’t going to wait for Lowell’s timetable. The two stowaways aren’t helping matters, either. They’re being hunted by the Sidyama for crimes against their government and their religion. It’s only a matter of who will catch up to Dace first - Targon, the Patrol, or the Sidyama.
