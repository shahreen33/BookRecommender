Thru history the world’s great conquerors have made their mark not just on the battlefield, but also in the societies they've transformed. Genghis Khan conquered by arms &amp; bravery. He ruled by commerce &amp; religion. He transformed the silk road into the world’s most effective trading network, established new laws &amp; drastically lowered merchant taxes. But he knew that if his empire was going to last, he'd need something stronger &amp; more binding than trade. He needed religion. Unlike the Christian, Taoist &amp; Muslim conquerors who'd come before, he gave his subjects freedom of religion using an argument that would directly influence Th Jefferson. But before that, he looted their shrines, killed their priests. Genghis lived in the 13th century, but he struggled with many of the same problems faced today: How may one balance religious freedom with the need to restrain fanatics? Can one compel rival religions—driven by deep-seated hatred—to live together peacefully? A celebrated anthropologist whose bestselling Genghis Khan &amp; the Making of the Modern World radically transformed our understanding of the Mongols &amp; their legacy, Weatherford has spent 18 years exploring areas of Mongolia closed until the USSR's fall &amp; researching The Secret History of the Mongols, an astonishing document written in code that was only recently discovered. He pored thru archives &amp; found groundbreaking evidence of Genghis’ influence on the founding fathers. Now, with this masterpiece of historical erudition &amp; religious insight, he's written his most resonant work.
