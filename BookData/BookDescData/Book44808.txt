My father is dead. Murdered. And I’m about to make a deal with the devil to keep my family safe and get the revenge my father deserves. *** Wren’s the only woman I’ve ever loved, but that doesn’t mean we’re right for each other. Don’t get me wrong… the sex was always crazy hot. That’s never been the problem.  But Wren and me? We’re explosive together, all sorts of wrong for each other—and sooner or later, someone’s going to get burned.   I walked away from Wren once, and broke her heart. She’s never going to forgive me or trust me again—but her mob boss father doesn't care. He's forcing me to marry her, and if I want to find out who’s threatening my family, this is my only option. As for Wren—she’s going to be pissed when she sees me, let alone when she finds out we’re getting hitched. Ask me if I care.   The deal is done. One way or another, I'm making her my wife.  *** This is a darker adult romance with adult language and steamy sex scenes.  This story explores darker situations that may not be to everyone's tastes and some readers might find disturbing.  Though this story has a Happily Ever After for the couple and can be read as a stand alone, there are small plot points that will continue in upcoming books.  ***
