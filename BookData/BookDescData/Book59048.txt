In this acclaimed novel from one of America's literary legends, two unforgettable characters take a lively romp through the baffling and often hilarious connection between the body and the mind. An eccentric Russian literature professor leaves his native Paris to be near his uncle--a world-class genius in botany but a total bungler when it comes to women--in the Midwest.
