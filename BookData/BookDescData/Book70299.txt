The heart wants what it wants. When hit by love, there is no reasoning. There is just intense, addictive, exhausting feeling of losing oneself. When found, love can make a person. When lost, love can destroy a person completely. We all have a couple of friends who have held our hands through heart break and celebrated our happiness with us. This book celebrated those friendships and love. Read if you have fallen in love. Must read if you have lost in love.
