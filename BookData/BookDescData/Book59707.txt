Relationships have the potential to drastically improve our lives, or to sucker punch us in the emotional gut. Impactful as these interpersonal ties can be, it's worth the effort to become more familiar with them, question a lot of our default notions that surround them, and calibrate them to best suit our needs and those of the people we care about. This is a book for people who want it all when it comes to relationships: something tailor-made for their unique beliefs, goals, desires, and lifestyles. This is a book for people who aren't afraid to ask, "How might we do this better?" Includes a foreword by Joshua Fields Millburn, author ofEverything That Remains andThe Minimalists."
