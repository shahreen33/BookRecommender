Hello, My Forever Ago, don't worry,you won't be reading this much longer.You will have already returnedin a snowcloud, which is suggestively,fashionably, only ever one second old.Yes, Darling, it's me, it saysas proof that in space,though there are many silences,fleeting isn't the oppositeof infinite, but its perfect match.Four years ago, Ali Blythe arrived with Twoism, a remarkable debut collection, every line shimmering with life and shivering with erotically charged glimpses of completeness. Now in Hymnswitch, Blythe takes up the themes of identity and the body once again, this time casting an eye backwards and forwards, visiting places of recovery and wrestling with the transition into one's own skin. Readers will find themselves holding their breath at the risk and beauty and difficulty of the balance Blythe strikes in the midst of ineffable complexity.Combining a stark, tensile precision with musicality that lulls and surprises, Blythe, a?surreal engineer of language, has once again created an unusually memorable collection. Imbued with emotional awareness, these stunning poems will imprint readers with startling images and silences as potent as words.
