  When the line between “need” and “want” gets blurred... 
Gabriel DuVal, rising soccer star. Jared Sheldon, team physician.To the outside world, they’re just good friends. But the truth is, Gabriel isn’t entirely sure what they are to each other. Some call their relationship unhealthy. Some call it codependency. Gabriel calls it confusing. He knows Jared wants him – as more than a friend. He doesn’t want Jared. He’s straight, he has a girlfriend, and he loves her. But Jared is… Jared is more. Jared is his. He needs him – his touch and his strength. But is it enough for Jared?Publisher's warning: This is not a light-hearted story; this is a rather twisted gay-for-you story. It contains some steamy MM scenes, explicit language, and two people so wrapped up in each other that the nature of their relationship goes beyond friendship--and beyond normal.
