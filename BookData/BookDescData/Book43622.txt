Together these stories form The Weird, and its practitioners include some of the greatest names in twentieth and twenty-first century literature.Exotic and esoteric, The Weird plunges you into dark domains and brings you face to face with surreal monstrosities.

Martin, Stephen King, Angela Carter, Kelly Link, Franz Kafka, China Mi√©ville, Clive Barker, Haruki Murakami, M. R.
