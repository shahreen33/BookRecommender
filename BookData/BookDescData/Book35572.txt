Reflecting the work of nearly 100 scholars and extensively reviewed and approved by the USCCB, the NABRE takes into account the best current scholarship as well as the new discovery of ancient manuscripts that improve our knowledge and understanding of the Biblical text.With it's extensive notes, commentary, and cross-references, the NABRE will promote a deeper love and understanding of Scripture in the home, parish and school. In addition to its wealth of study material, each Saint Benedict Press NABRE features a 3 year liturgical cycle of Sunday readings, a 2 year liturgical cycle of daily Mass readings, a listing of Popes, and a manual of favorite Catholic prayers.
