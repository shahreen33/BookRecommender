Lost WorldCatapulted into an unknown dimension of time and space by the wizardry of modern science, Richard Blade finds himself at the feet of a strange and beautiful woman. She is Taleen, Princess of Voth, and she is running for her life from the savage Albs who had kidnapped her. Without clothes or weapons of any kind, Blade was in trouble himself--but the seductive Taleen needed help....Strange experiences were nothing new to Blade, but he was ill-prepared for his trial by fire and sword, the secret cannibal rites of the Drus, the unquenchable lusts of the evil Queen Beata, and the maddening allure of the virgin Taleen.
