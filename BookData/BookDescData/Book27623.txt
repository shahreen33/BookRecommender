The night uncovers all we wish not to see.  A troubled man enters a dusky park before sunset. A young woman follows, hidden in shadow. Both have returned to the park to take back something the past has stolen from them, to make right six long years of suffering, and to find justice or perhaps redemption—or maybe they'll settle for some old-fashioned revenge.  But something evil is alive and awake in those woods, creatures that care nothing for human motivations. They’re driven by their own insatiable need: a ravenous, bottomless hunger.  The campgrounds are full tonight, and the creatures are starving. Before the night is over, they will feed.  An unrelenting tale of terror from Jason Parent.
