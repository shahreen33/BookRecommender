Rut, slump, funk—call it what you will, but when you’re trying to write, there are few things more frustrating. The longer you go without writing, the harder it is to jump back in. Days turn into weeks, and then weeks into months—do we even want to think about the possibility of years? And before you know it, frustration becomes doubt in both your work and yourself, building and building until you find every possible reason not to write. No matter what stopped you from writing in the first place, giving up on your craft will never be an option. Refilling Your Inkwell offers inspiration, motivation, and tactics alike, all to help pull frustrated writers out of their ruts and get you back to the page.
