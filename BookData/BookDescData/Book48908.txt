Like her famous characters, she's tough, confident, and never minces words. This frank, no-nonsense account features Bette Davis in her best role: her own remarkable life - on-screen and off...The glory days of Hollywood... the ups and downs with her husbands and children... behind the scenes with Joan Crawford in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?... a few choice words about Ronald Reagan... and her inspiring struggle to survive first a mastectomy, and then, nine days later, a crippling stroke. PLUS-- A candid letter to her daughter - whose stinging memoir has caused so much controversy.
