STOP! IN THE NAME OF LOVE!Since she was a child, Aoba has had only one dream: to fight evil and protect the weak. To achieve this dream, Aoba became a polizi, a teenaged undercover cop stationed at all-girls Hanagaki High. While Aoba will go to any length to solve a crime, her no-nonsense, by-the-book partner Midori constantly tries to reign her in. Just as this odd couple is starting to get along, Midori's former partner, Akari, shows up. Akari seems to have her own agenda at the school, and even worse, is determined to steal Midori away! Will this mysterious newcomer break up their partnership before Aoba gets the chance to tell Midori how she really feels?
