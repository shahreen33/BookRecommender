It was a murder made for TV: a trail of tiny bloody footprints. An innocent toddler playing beside her mother’s bludgeoned body. Pretty young Corinne Wolff, seven months pregnant, brutally murdered in her own home.Cameras and questions don’t usually faze Nashville homicide lieutenant Taylor Jackson, but the media frenzy surrounding the Wolff case is particularly nasty…and thorough. When the seemingly model mommy is linked to an amateur porn Web site with underage actresses and unwitting players, the sharks begin to circle.The shock is magnified when an old adversary uses the sexy secret footage to implicate Taylor in a murder — an accusation that threatens her career, her reputation and her relationship.Both cases hinge on the evidence — real or manufactured — of crimes that go beyond passion, into the realm of obsessive vengeance and shocking betrayal. Just what the networks love.
