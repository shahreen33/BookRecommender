The kind of life I’ve lived, it haunts you. Stains you. Destroys you. It took everything from me. My love. My family… my transgressions were paid with Tor and Cayla’s blood and I want revenge. Blood. Death. His head in my hands.I’ve lost everything, and all that’s left to do is end the men who took them from me. Betrayal. Secrets. Vengeance.
