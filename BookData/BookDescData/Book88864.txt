The new guy at school was officially Kate's worst nightmare. And that was before he turned her world upside down with a mind-blowing kiss.  Kate's an introvert. Levis is...not. Some might say he's a loudmouthed jerk. Kate definitely would, especially since he seems determined to make her life miserable by putting her in the spotlight every chance he gets. His opportunities are endless now that she's babysitting his little brother, and when they're paired up together for an intramural scrimmage? Well, there's no hope of avoiding him now. She's stuck with him, for better or worse.  But after her nemesis turned teammate kisses her, Kate has a much bigger problem on her hands. Suddenly Levi's mockery seems more like teasing, and what she thought were attempts to humiliate her feel like the push she needs to overcome her fears. So really, the problem isn't that she's stuck with Levi as her partner...it's the fact that she might be falling for her worst enemy.
