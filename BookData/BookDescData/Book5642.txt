  That’s only a few of the names people call me, and all of them are true. I did the unforgivable. I killed a man in broad daylight. I did it for her. I paid my dues, did my time. Now I’m out and I want her back, no matter the cost. She hates me, but that won’t stop me from hunting after her. I need her to be mine again. And there’s a secret I have to tell … But everything has its price. I’m willing to pay. Is she?
