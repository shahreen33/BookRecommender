This book came about as a direct result of my success with oDesk - I successfully used oDesk to quit my job in June 2012, a short 10 months after I started freelancing on the side. I kept getting asked questions like: - How did you find such great clients to work with? - How do you find the jobs that pay well and are not boring? - How do you increase your rating when you're new to oDesk? - Why do I need to complete oDesk tests? And so on... There's no doubt about it, it's overwhelming when you arrive on oDesk for the first time - there is so much to do to create a good profile, understand what oDesk tests are and what to include in your portfolio; that you can find yourself giving up pretty quick. This book is an introduction to setting up your profile the right way. It will show you ways to 'pimp out' your profile that results in oDesk promoting YOU to potential clients. In this book you will learn:- How to set up your oDesk profile so that clients FIND YOU - oDesk tests and how you can use these to INCREASE your rating - How to SET your rates - How to find the RIGHT clients ...plus so much more!
