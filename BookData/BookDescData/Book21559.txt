The true-life adventure of a couple who did what most of us only dream of doing, Ferenc Mate's enticing, beautifully written memoir of their first year in this enchanted place brings to life the real Tuscany: the neighbors, the spectacular hills where The English Patient was filmed, country life, the farm family down the road who virtually adopt them and with whom they relive centuries-old traditions of the harvest, grape picking, wine making, mushroom hunting, woodcutting, holidays, and, of course, the almost never-ending, mouthwatering feasts.Mate also captures the neighboring medieval town of Montepulciano, its tiny shops, open markets, squares, cafes, festivals, food and wine, and above all, its people. Steeped in that mesmerizing landscape and full of unforgettable characters, "The Hills of Tuscany" is a celebration of life, an affirmation of traditions, friendship, and neighborly ties.
