The last thing Octavia expects when she finds herself with Aaron Viteri’s gun pressed to the back of her head is that he won’t pull the trigger. After all, she’s a Ferrara, and her family and the Viteris have been enemies for decades. Not to mention she has snuck into his apartment to steal the files her family desperately needs.  But Aaron offers her a deal. He’ll spare her life if she pretends to be his sex slave and helps him take over his father’s business. Octavia knows she can’t trust the cold, arrogant, controlling, and devilishly handsome Aaron, but her only choice is to accept his offer.  The more time she spends with him, the more she realizes he isn’t who everyone thinks he is. And the way he looks at her makes her want to tie him to the bed and put his perfect mouth to better use. But if Octavia wants to stop a looming war before it’s too late, she can’t let her growing feelings for her enemy get in the way.   This is the first installment in the three-book Loving Your Enemy series. It contains potentially triggering situations, violence, strong language, sexual content, and a cliffhanger.
