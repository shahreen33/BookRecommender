An extraordinary tale of an ExtraNormal girl.Mira Johns is pretty much like any other teenage girl. Except that she knows how to harness electro-magnetic energy to communicate without words. And she's really, really far from home. Her assignment as an emissary to Earth sounds fairly simple: blend in, observe, and stay away from the planet's primitive males. But after she finds one boy too irresistible for stupid rules, she realizes the real reason she's supposed to keep her distance: mates from her world can die if separated. Mira's only hope is to uncover the truth to why she, the most mediocre of candidates, was actually chosen for this assignment--before the agency discovers her secret and sends her back home.ExtraNormal has characters you'll love, and a story you'll never expect.
