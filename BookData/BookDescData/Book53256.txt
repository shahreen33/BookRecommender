A shadow meets the light … When someone needs to disappear, the Chicago mob calls on Joe Rossi. A man who can move without a sound, and kill without a word, they don’t call him the Shadow for nothing. This time, it’s a New York crime family in need of his skills, but it takes one glimpse of her to make him agree to the job. Liliana Marcello is every inch a principessa della mafia. Her life has taught her to be wary of strangers, yet her ballet career contradicts everything by putting her on display. It’s a man with a dark smile and a constantly changing demeanor that makes her feel safe again, but it’s the unknown that holds her back. It takes one look … One dance …One word … One smile to captivate a man. And one second to kill a woman because of it, too. Not all monsters hide in the shadows. How are you supposed to see them coming?
