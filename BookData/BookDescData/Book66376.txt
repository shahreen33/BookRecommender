Dear Author, He’s all I’ve got. I know him as well as I know myself. I love him and want to be with him but I shouldn’t. Not in that way. He’s my twin brother, only minutes younger, but ever since our parents died when we were young, we have only had each other and over time he has become my world.I would love to see a story of how these twins became more and how their relationship developed without them being found out by anyone. They live their lives without anyone knowing their true relationship and enjoy being together without apology. Thanks, Simone H.Genre: contemporary Tags: performance arts, musician, high school, bullying, coming out, young adult characters, first time, coming of age Content Warnings: incest/twincest, underage sex, light bondage, death of a secondary character
