¡n we get some reality in here? asks Judy Sheindlin, former supervising judge for Manhattan Family Court. For twenty–four years she has laid down the law as she understands it:● If you want to eat, you have to work. ● If you have children, you'd better support them.● If you break the law, you have to pay.● If you tap the public purse, you'd better be accountable.Now she abandons all judicial restraint in a scathing critique of the system – filled with realistic hard–nosed alternatives to our bloated welfare bureaucracy and our soft–on–crime laws.
