Twenty-five-year-old Blake Powell’s world is baseball. His life goal is a major league contract and he is laser focused on honing his game and his body as close to perfection as he can get. Then a moment of distraction, a wrong step, and a bone-shattering injury put an early end to his baseball career.  Ian Chapman is happy with his life. He has his own house, a decent job, good friends, and he’s the de facto manager of a team in the city’s gay softball league. Unfortunately, he’s missing a key player to help his team rise from the basement and the man at his side to make his personal game complete.  When Blake moves in next door, Ian sees in him a solution to the team’s woes, and soon it becomes obvious something more personal might grow, too. Then Blake’s first love, the game of baseball, comes calling again, and he is compelled to answer.  Complete Game is a 55,000 word first time gay romance with no cliffhangers and a happily ever after ending.
