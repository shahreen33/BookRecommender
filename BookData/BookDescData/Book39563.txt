  Isabeau Finne’s perfect world utterly unravels when she meets Death's right-hand man one fateful night, spiraling her life into a world of chaos and the impossible...
Suddenly, she is no longer Isabeau and becomes part of the most secretive inner-workings of Death itself, as well as an otherworldly dominion of ancient magic.Now beings—which we were taught as children were merely fictional creations of wildly whimsical minds—are edging their way into her world as well.Buggans and Kobolds and Vargs…oh my!She yearns for the simplicity of her old life—this one is full of dangers, unanswered questions, and cryptic dreams.After one particularly anomalous dream in which she learns of the Nine While Nine Legacy, things become truly precarious.Now, someone sees her as a risk…a threat…and wants to eliminate her.Fortunately, she falls under the protection of Gideon—unless she leaves his territory—which is the one thing she wants the most…and wants the least.For fans of THIS SAVAGE SONG.
