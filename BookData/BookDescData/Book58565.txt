"In a class of its own." -Far Right Watch"Prezident Scumbag! really is a rollercoaster of a book. It is laugh out loud funny in places, but with political and social commentary that is sorely lacking in mainstream discourse." -The CanaryWhile kicking about their squat, a community of crust punks from the north of England learn all about the newly elected President of the World. Turns out this president happens to be their worst nightmare in a shirt and tie. He is, in their words, a corporate swine who promises to make things do stuff tomorrow. Nobody has a clue what he's talking about.  The punks soon figure that the only sensible response to the madness happening all across the world is to fly the band over to America and put on the protest show to end all protest shows. But shortly after landing in Los Angeles, the band quickly find themselves in trouble with just about everyone...  American presidential nightmares, Tory filth, alt-right gobshites; Prezident Scumbag! takes a pop at all of these and more in the crustiest, filthiest, angriest narrative ever to come out of somebodyâ€™s imagination. At a time when culture is begging for a reawakening of anti-establishment sentiments, Rupert Dreyfus continues to fill that void by taking his two middle fingers and ramming them down the collective throat of the mainstream.
