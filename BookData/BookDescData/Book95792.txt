But, Nico didn’t flee with us.While I began elementary school in the United States, he was building the greatest and toughest Mafia of the century. The Mafia Shqiptare.  Nico is now King of all underground trades. Sexy. Aggressive. Brilliant.  After years of nothing but silence, he’s back in my life, Ready to do whatever it takes to bring me into his universe. He isn’t leaving until he takes me with him.
