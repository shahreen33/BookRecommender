  “I’m not here to make friends. I’m here to slay Nessie.”
Jack Addison is on his way to becoming a famous monster hunter, but luck had been against him at the Annual Nessie Hunt the previous year. Now, he’s back at Loch Ness to show everyone what he’s made of. He’s got a lot to prove to Roux Chat-Bonnes, the snotty cat-like creature who saved his life last time, so Jack goes into the woods to hunt Nessie armed with a brand new detection device. But the creature he finds is nothing like he expected. Where he thought he would slay a monster, he ends up learning a valuable lesson about opening his horizons to new lifeforms. The learning curve is made delightful with the help of tentacles, suckers, and lots of slippery slime.POSSIBLE SPOILERS:Themes: pride, dreams, self-discovery, tolerance, fame, monster hunting, interspecies relations, tentaclesGenre: M/M romantic erotica, horror-comedyErotic content: Scorching hot, explicit scenesLength: ~10,500 words (Episode 2 in the serial)WARNING: This story contains morally ambiguous characters and scenes of sex that might be considered taboo.
