They experience something that makes them question their beliefs. All the things they had taken for granted, everything they had seen and learned, don’t seem to apply any longer. Something happens along the way that makes them yearn to come back to Earth. After all, home is where the heart is.This is not just another science fiction. Rather, it will make you question your own beliefs—may they be scientific, religious, political, or something else.In the first installment of The Galaxy Series, find out about the strange world they discover.
