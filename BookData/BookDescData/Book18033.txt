Six teenagers from Northern California are assigned a group project for their sophomore English class. Little do they know, this project will literally take them on a journey out of this world. Cantelia appears much like Earth, until the teens realize magic is as plentiful as the danger surrounding them. A dark and evil ruler has placed a curse on the tribal people of Sikuku Islandâ€”the same island where the teens have been transported. Now, they must help the tribal people break the curse if they ever want to see their own planet again. Alex and her companions quickly learn that there is so much more beyond their comfortable lives in Pollock Pines and its legendary Spirit Lake.
