Before she hired a huntsman to steal a heart, she surrendered her own. After years of torture and abuse from her wicked mother-a woman consumed by her lust for dark magic-Grishelda finally finds happiness in her marriage to a king. The joy is fleeting when the king's daughter grows jealous and threatens to drive a wedge between the newly married couple. Grishelda knows if she has any chance at a happily ever after, she must act-even if that means using dark magic. With each use of the seductive magic, Grishelda risks ruining the love she never thought she'd find and succumbing to the darkness she's always feared.
