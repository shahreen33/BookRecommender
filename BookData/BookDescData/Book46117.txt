WANTED: Shared girlfriend for exclusive 3-on-1 live-in relationship.  The ad was right there in black and white, sending a flock of butterflies fluttering through my stomach. 'Three young authors seeking an extremely open-minded female for an exclusive, sinful, and very unorthodox arrangement.'  Only these weren't any three authors. These were my employers. The same three hot guys I'd been working for as a personal chef, at their secluded Spanish villa.  And they were absolutely gorgeous.  There was Chase, dark-haired and beautiful, with a supermodel's face and a whole ocean of ripped abdominals I could sink my teeth into.  Nathan was his mirror image, the wavy-blond surfer with a panty-melting smile... not to mention a lithe, impossibly tan body I just wanted to hold against me.  Rounding them out was Burke; tall and brooding. A muscle-bound giant with smarmy good looks and a matching, razor-sharp wit. A total monster... inside the bedroom and out.  Their ad doesn't even seem real... until it actually is. Until I'm goaded into answering it, unable to bear the thought of another female just wandering in and being this insanely lucky.  Three of them... one of me. Sharing me. Possessing me. The guys are just too hot, too perfect.  Too mine.  THE ARRANGEMENT is a sizzling, stand-alone reverse harem love story filled with humor, suspense, and sweltering MFMM menage sex, in single and multiple partner scenes, hot enough to melt your kindle. HEA guaranteed.
