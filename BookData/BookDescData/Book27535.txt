“These are substantial, provocative, immensely stylish works which create an unsettling mixture of wild laughter and profound unease…a major hit.” –Daily Telegraph“A fiendishly clever and surreal play, timed to perfection!” –The Guardian“One of the wittiest, most gorgeously performed theatrical events… Ms Churchill [is] possessor of one of the sharpest and most restless theatrical imaginations in the world today.” -Ben Brantley, New York TimesBlue Heart consists of two related short plays, both teasingly entertaining and brilliantly executed, one about a father and daughter, the other about a mother and son.In Heart’s Desire, a father, mother and aunt are waiting for a woman to arrive home after years in Australia. In Blue Kettle, a middle-aged man and his girlfriend are involved in a con, making elderly women believe they are the man’s long-lost mother. But neither play is what it seems, as something catastrophic threatens to disrupt and destroy them.Caryl Churchill has written for the stage, television and radio. A renowned and prolific playwright, her plays include Cloud Nine, Top Girls, Far Away, Drunk Enough to Say I Love You?, Bliss, Love and Information, Mad Forest and A Number. In 2002, she received the Obie Lifetime Achievement Award and 2010, she was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.
