Private investigator Charlie Miner, freshly revived from his own murder, gets a call from Homicide Detective Dave Putnam. Self-styled "psychic to the stars" Tamara Gale has given crucial information about three murders, and the brass thinks it makes the Department look bad. Dave wants Charlie to help figure out the angle, since he has first-hand experience with the inexplicable. Trouble is, Charlie, just weeks after his full-death experience, once again has severe cognitive problems and may get them both killed. At once a riveting mystery and a completely unique character study, Down to No Good will both captivate you and work its way into your heart. PRAISE FOR EARL JAVORSKY'S FIRST CHARLIE MINER NOVEL, DOWN SOLO: "Earl Javorsky's bold and unusual Down Solo blends the mysterious and the supernatural boldly and successfully. The novel is strong and haunting, a wonderful debut." - T. Jefferson Parker, New York Times bestselling author of Full Measure and The Famous and the Dead "Awesome" - James Frey, New York Times bestselling author "Offbeat and dark and wonderful. This book caught me in the first few pages and never let me go. Javorsky is a prodigious writer: dark, intelligent, often hilariously funny, and he holds the accelerator to the floor throughout the whole amazing story." - Timothy Hallinan, bestselling author of the Poke Rafferty series and the Junior Bender series "Don't miss Earl Javorsky's Down Solo. It's kick-ass, man. Excellent writing. This guy is the real deal." - Dan Fante, author of the memoir Fante and the novel Point Doom "Javorsky's dark and gritty prose is leavened with just enough humor to make Down Solo a compelling story that will take readers to the outer limits of noir." - San Diego City Beat
