From Julie Houts aka @JooleeLoren, “Instagram’s favorite illustrator” (Vogue), a collection of darkly humorous illustrated essays that “perfectly capture what it’s like to be a woman in 2017” (BuzzFeed) and lampooning modern female identity in the social media age.LIVE. LAUGH. LOVE. or EXIST. SMIRK. LURK.  Julie Houts has cultivated a devoted Instagram following by satirizing the conflicting messages and images women consume and share with the world every day.  Literally Me chronicles the exploits of “slightly antisocial heroines” (Refinery29) in vivid, excruciatingly funny detail, including: —The beauty routine of a deranged bride who aspires to be “truly without flaws” on her wedding day —What happens when Kylie Jenner has an existential crisis and can no longer “step out” —A journey to Coachella by the Four Horsewomen of the Apocalypse —The true dating confessions of a fembot —The terrifying description for Alice Staunch’s book How to Be a Perfect Feminist —The diary of Fiddle Ficus, a tree that lives inside a C É L I N E store  …and much more.  Literally Me marks the launch of a brilliant new social satirist. Julie’s singular voice and beautiful illustrations reveal the truth about the absurdity of life in the social media age, showing us that the line between becoming a total “Girlboss” and a twenty-first century American Psycho is razor-thin.
