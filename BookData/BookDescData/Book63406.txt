Danger, betrayal, and redemption come together in the sixth installment in T. S. Joyce’s bestselling Saw Bears series.  Riley Miller is on the run. In an effort to do something nice, she lands right in the middle of danger. A trek to the wilderness will put her under Damon Daye’s protection, but it’ll also dump her in the direct path of one sexy, snarly lumberjack werebear, Drew. His interest is stirring up feelings she’s forgotten exist, but she can’t get too attached to him. She has two weeks to spend in the mountains, and after that, she must leave to reclaim her life back in the city. But the Ashe Crew isn’t making it easy on her. Here, she could find the life she’s been looking for if only her demons would stay in her past.  Drew Hudson is losing his mind. Coming off a devastating loss, he’s doing anything he can think of to keep his inner bear from going stark raving mad, including risky stunts that threaten to expose the Ashe Crew as bear shifters. When a chance encounter with a sexy hitchhiker settles his animal side, he can’t help but wonder about all the secrets Riley Miller is keeping. But when her past unravels little by little, he’ll have to take control of his animal in order to protect her.  And if he can allow this selfless, mind-consuming, tough-as-nails human to soften his heart, he just might find himself again.
