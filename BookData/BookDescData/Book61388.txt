Ghouls live among us, the same as normal people in every wayâ€”except their craving for human flesh. Ken Kaneki is an ordinary college student until a violent encounter turns him into the first half-human half-ghoul hybrid. Trapped between two worlds, he must survive Ghoul turf wars, learn more about Ghoul society and master his new powers.Things heat up in the Ward Eleven as the CCG investigates the high rate of Investigator deaths. Kaneki has an explosive run-in with Aogiri Tree, the Ghoul Gang, run by a Ghoul known only as the Sekigan King.
