One Rule: No More Men.  Two years ago I walked away from a marriage I thought would last forever and all I got from it was Dick … And I don’t mean the one between my stupid ex’s legs. I’m talking about the one hundred fifty pound furry dog said ex dropped off at my doorstep. But I’d take Dick over any man, any day. So why did I resemble my dog, panting and drooling, whenever I ran into Hudson West, my sexy new neighbor? True, the gorgeous veterinarian was hotter than sin. And my new roommate only made it impossible for me to avoid conversation with a man I didn’t need. Until tragedy struck and some jerk decided to run Dick down. It was hotter than sin Hudson who came to his rescue. Then it became impossible to ignore him. It was only supposed to be a fling, a quickie, a one and done. We both had reasons to keep it that way … my one rule and his five-year-old son. Except things didn’t quite work out that way. One turned into two, then three, annnnd you get the picture. Before we knew it, he gave me a lot more than puppies and fairy tales. And that stupid rule? I should’ve stuck to it because now more than my heart was at risk.  This is a full-length, stand alone, single dad, contemporary romance.
