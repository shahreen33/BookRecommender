Town doctor, Jude Southerland asked Autumn Maddox to marry him and she said yes. The dress has been bought, the church reserved, and the band booked. Happily ever after here they come.  But when the couple gets an unexpected surprise, plans have to change, leaving the whole town wondering if they will make it to the altar on time.  Feels Like Family is Book 2.5 in the Southerland series and while it is a fun story on its own, readers may enjoy it more if it is read after Loving Bailey and before Practical Arrangement.
