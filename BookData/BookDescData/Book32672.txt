Whoever said that nothing ever happens in a small town clearly never visited Dearmont, Maine. It’s getting hotter than hell around here. When the dead start crawling out of their graves, you know something’s up.  If there’s one thing I hate more than zombies, it’s having my memories erased by magic. That's a real bummer, right? So when I get a chance to break the spell that’s locked away part of my mind, I take it, even if it means dabbling with ancient Egyptian sorcery.  Big mistake.  Sometimes you shouldn’t go poking at things that are buried.  Because you end up having to deal with an army of the dead.
