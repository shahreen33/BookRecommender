LEGEND HUNTERS Syaoran and his companions continue their inter-dimensional travels in order to restore the memories of Princess Sakura and this time, they find themselves having adventures in two exciting and mystery-filled worlds. They first come to Jade Country—a cold, snow-covered land where the town of Spirit lives in fear of the legend of a 300 year-old princess who has been stealing the townspeople’s children. Following this, our worlds-spanning adventurers find themselves in Ôto, where to earn money, they become hunters of demonic creatures called Oni. Will they be able to find more pieces of Princess Sakura’s fragmented memories as they continue on through new and increasingly perilous worlds?
