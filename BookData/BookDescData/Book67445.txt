 I can't escape this academy   My name is Lexi Cameron, and I really need some help in the form of two sexy demons, a wayward alpha's son and an angel who is worse than the fallen.  The only (tiny) problem?  They'd rather kill me than help me get out of here.  Welcome to Demon Academy where the new students might do more than just trying to kill you. They might give your soul to hell and smile as they wave you goodbye. Funny enough, I think mine belongs there anyway. That is if Lucifer has anything to do with it...   RH Dark Academy Romance. 18+
