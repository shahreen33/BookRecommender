  
    Elena must venture into the Fae world to save the very people who would kill her if given the chance...
  
Tall and insanely beautiful, the Fae are not the angels they appear. When Elena comes into her half-Fae powers from the mother she never knew, the Fae threaten to harm the last of her loved ones unless she uses her ability to cure their people of a deadly disease. Her only shot at pulling that off? Enlisting the help of her brooding neighbour, Derek, who rivals the Fae in masculine beauty...Derek has seen the Viking-looking guy following his neighbour's every move. Elena doesn't know it, but he's kept track of all his neighbours - possibly paying special attention to the beautiful, brainy girl next door. And when she comes to him for help, he only appears to hesitate. He has secrets of his own to keep, and this business she's involved in could ruin everything.
  
    But when Elena and Derek work together, more than chemicals spark fire, and they soon discover just how complicated attraction can get when they find themselves on the other side of the portal, fighting for survival.
