The very act of the foundation of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia(FYROM), together with all its subsequent actions as a political entity from 1944 tothe present day, show that ‘Macedonianism’ is the basic totalitarian ideologicaltenet of that state. With this tenet the state and the Slavic component in apopulation of several different ethnic groups have constructed their existenceas a nation and their ‘historical’ mission. Right at the very start, ‘Macedonianism’was proclaimed as a sacred dogma, allowing of no discussion, let alonequestioning. It has been practised with all the means available to a Statethat, up to 1991, had been forced to operate under a totalitarian Communistregime where there ‘was but one’ Truth and where the question that bulkedabove all others was ‘the security of the State’. Anyone dissenting did so withthe foreknowledge that he or she would be ‘eliminated’
