Dear Santa,All I want for Christmas is the secret potion that’ll help me resist my brother’s new business partner. You know, the super hot, super sweet, super smart guy I now have to plan all the holiday parties with.I mean, really. Who thought THAT was a good idea?Oh, me. Yep, brilliant, strategic me who raised her hand and said yes I’d love to hang mistletoe with that sexy former sports star. I’d love to taste test spiked hot chocolate with that charming, flirty man. I’d love to get snowed in with the one guy I shouldn’t fall for.As long as I can make it through the holidays I’ll be on my merry way, fa la la la la. But the holidays have a surprise for me.
