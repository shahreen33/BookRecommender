Devour a good book!In this clever take-off on Little Red Riding Hood, the big bad wolf is the very hungry Winston who likes to eat books! When the librarian scolds him for this naughty behavior, Rosie (who wears a familiar red hoodie), rescues him and takes him out into the woods to teach him how to read books, not eat books. Winston grows to love reading and is soon devouring books with his eyes, and reading them (disguised as Granny Winston) to groups of children at the library. This hilarious book, complete with fabulous art and a die-cut cover highlights the importance of books and the joy of reading!
