Booker is a loner … at least in most respects. He has friends but is perfectly fine being a man of mystery. There’s one exception to that rule: June Seaver. Booker volunteers to help her around her aging hotel in the heart of Moonstone Bay’s business district whenever he can spare the time. On one of those visits, the older woman takes a spill and finds herself in the hospital … at the exact worst time. It seems she has a modeling shoot scheduled at her facility and it’s enough money to keep her operation running smoothly for at least a year. All that goes away if she’s not there. It’s Booker to the rescue, of course, but he’s won’t be doing it alone. Sheriff Galen Blackwood and local witch Hadley Hunter are helping. That’s good, because it seems there’s a mystery afoot. Someone keeps tearing apart the storage rooms and even attacks the photo shoot director. It’s up to Booker and his motley group of heroes to solve the case, keep the shoot on schedule and hunt down a potential killer. It’s all in a day’s work for Moonstone Bay’s favorite jack-of-all-trades. He just has to keep everyone alive to save the day … and show he’s a cupid with a heart of gold along the way.  Note: This is a 30,000-word short set in the Moonstone Bay universe.
