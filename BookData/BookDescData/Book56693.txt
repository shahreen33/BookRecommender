 I'm still dead. I know how I died. And these four vampires can't get enough of me. But believe me, this is far from over...1. The black figure is chasing me.2. I face the man who killed me.3. We face a darkness I never thought possible... hint: more vampires who are for some reason really mad at me.If that's not enough, Seth, Layre, Darick, and Kryan want me to play "tag" ... naked. 
  Yeah, things are going just fine being dead.
