The invasion has been cancelled, but now the Emperor’s vast army lies asleep, gassed into a collective coma. When our young hero Prince Llewelyn wakes he finds, yet again, that Gelert, his wolfhound, has been kidnapped. Which can mean only one thing; the rulers of Jiang have reactivated their plans to use his old friend to create their army of monstrous dogs. Will Llewelyn and Feiyan’s desperate dash to rescue Gelert be in time to prevent the Emperor’s wrathful punishment of the secretive kingdom? Or will their hellish journey into the heart of Jiang merely precipitate the conniving Queen and Friar William’s unleashing of their horde of ravening, disease ridden hyenas? Lost in the time-twisting labyrinth of Jiang’s tunnels, Llewelyn faces unspeakable evils and inexplicable forces that will test his sanity and change him forever. And on his return to the surface,he and Gelert will have to confront a sordid cesspit of shifting loyalties, the loss of love and the death of old friendships. Welcome to the apocalyptic conclusion of the first trilogy of the fart fuelled, gore-splattered, epic adventures of Llewelyn,the lost Prince of Wales and Gelert, the legendary faithful wolfhound.Look for the fully illustrated versions of ‘The Dog Army’, ‘The Dog Hunters’ and‘The Dog Assassins’ on Amazon and Kindle
