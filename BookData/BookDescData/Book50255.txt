 What does a too nosy secretary have in common with an alien? Nothing. Until she’s turned into an alien, too. And then, well, there’s everything.   Joyce’s life is mapped out: dead end job, after dead end job, until she is dead. At least, that is until Kede Tria—a Doshan alien—shows up and takes her away from it all. Literally. He’s overbearing, possessive, sexy as hell, and everything she never knew she wanted in a man, er, alien.  Of course, life happens and she discovers Death by Chocolate isn’t just a dessert, it’s a reality. Good thing Kede is there to save her… by making her Doshan.  Kede Tria is the Holder of House Tria, commander of the starship Vehly, and one of the most feared Doshan warriors. He’s also Joyce’s life mate—her harau. His curvy, deliciously lush mate just doesn’t know it yet. She was human and now she is Doshan, but through it all she remains one thing: his.  Kede will fight for what belongs to him. So, while others are intent on ending her life, they do not realize he will gladly end theirs.  This is the complete Alien Commander's Chosen serial romance in one boxed set.
