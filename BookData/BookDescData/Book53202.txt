Violet Carmichael knew her second year of college would be tough, but nothing could have prepared her for what was about to happen…  Violet’s goal is clear—to finish college and work alongside her father and uncle at their family business—but she has one major problem. The dreaded Professor Torres, head of the Architectural Department at Tulane, has a reputation as one of the toughest teachers on campus. Violet has heard more than once that he can be a downright jerk, but she’s determined to not let him get in her way.  He might be a successful professor, but his personal life is nothing short of a mess…  Diego Torres has the worst track record when it comes to women—which is why when he first lays eyes on his new student, he assumes she’s like all the other superficial Barbie dolls he’s always been attracted to. But it only takes a few encounters for him to realize he couldn’t have been more wrong, and the more time he spends with Violet, the more he desires her in a way no professor should desire a student.  Sometimes it’s impossible to walk away, even when there’s so much at stake…  After desperately trying avoid crossing that thin ethical line, Diego and Violet are no longer able to deny the sexual tension between them and risk everything, falling into an all-consuming, passionate relationship. But when outsiders threaten to destroy it all, Diego has no choice but to make a life-altering decision for himself and the woman he is forbidden to love.  As lines between student and professor begin to blur, the consequences might end up destroying them both…
