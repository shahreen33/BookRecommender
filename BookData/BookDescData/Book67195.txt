One day, Ben decided to go on a hike. He didn't plan on being out long. He had a business meeting later that night and a family to return home to. He didn't expect to get lost on a deep and twisting path that would lead him into a world of man-eating giants, demons, and colossal insects. And he didn't expect to find himself on a quest—aided by a profane crustacean and a variety of magical objects—that would test the depths of his very soul.
