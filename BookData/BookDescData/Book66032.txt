The life and times of the early church were every bit as exciting as our own. But the living pulse of early Christian life, worship and controversy is too often submerged beneath the text of standard introductions to early Christian history. Here from Laurie Guy is an introduction to Christianity of the first four centuries that is readable but not lightweight, interesting but not superficial, informative but not technical. It is a welcome supplement to chronological histories of the early church, a vantage point from which readers may sit aloft and view the broad patterns in the historical terrain. From the apostolic fathers to the great ecumenical councils, we see the church undergoing persecution and martyrdom and then rising to favor under Constantine, shaping its ministry and order while worshiping and developing its understanding of doctrine. Baptism and Eucharist, asceticism and monasticism, and the developing roles of women unfold in this thematic account of the rise of Great Tradition Christianity. Richly illustrated and filled out with maps, charts and close-up windows on related topics, Introducing Early Christianity will inform the curious and enliven courses in early church history.
