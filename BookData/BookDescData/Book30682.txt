Deep in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas in a place known as Grymme Creek Hollow was an abandoned homestead. Of course, being abandoned did not mean it was uninhabited. It was only abandoned in the sense that the original owner was long gone. This homestead was home to a chick named Chick. He was named Chick because his parents were not very imaginative. Chick, on the other hand, was very imaginative and had a real talent for finding adventure. This homestead was also home to a group of chickens who had claimed it as their own and established their own civilization. The homestead was surrounded by a stone wall which, as far as the chickens were concerned, was where civilization began and ended. Outside the stone wall was the dangerous wilderness known as the Deep Brush. The worse thing that could happen to any chicken was to be exiled from the safety of the homestead to the Deep Brush. This was exactly what was going to happen to Chick's Father, Walter, unless Chick could do something to stop it. Walter, who worked as a security rooster in the corn patch, had been accused by the malevolent hen, Aunty Hysidia, of stealing corn and giving it to the field mice of the Deep Brush. It was a serious offense and one that was punishable by exile. Chick Pinfeather, along with his friends Peq and Quinny, set out to prove Walter's innocence.
