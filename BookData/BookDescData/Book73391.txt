The Russians are hacking into British politics – the old fashioned way.  The lead singer of pop band, The G-String Girls, Valda Kramer reckons she’s streetwise enough to handle anything which comes on top. When she learns her bandmate, Renee, is playing both sides – taking turns doing it with a Russian emigre and a government minister – she’s too foxy to be fazed. Until Renee is drowned in her bath. It’s murder and all the evidence points at the fall gal. That’s Valda.  She’s savvy enough to know who the real culprits are also that they’re above the law.  Enter Jack Lauder, a legend in a lawyer’s suit. A chance meeting with the songstress in Belfast’s mean streets has him expecting a shot at romance! Instead, he finds himself taking aim at Profumo Mark 2.  Valda’s case will propel him from his quiet life up north into London’s political swamp, pitted against the Russian mob, their shady politicians and their bent cops. The capital’s media hacks salivate over the imminent Trial of the Century.  Hit men comb the Isles to find Valda and Jack. Will the fugitives find the evidence they need to save her, will they be liquidated before they get to the Bailey, or will Valda put everything on the line at trial?”  Readers who enjoy John Grisham and Sidney Sheldon will find this book right up their street.
