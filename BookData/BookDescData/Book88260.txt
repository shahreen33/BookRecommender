Crank up your respirator, strap on your goggles, and hide your antennae from the humans, because it's dangerous being a hybrid in 1912. Starting with the launch of a pollen-powered ship called the RMS Titanic, The Maiden Voyage &amp; Other Departures explores six tales of a historic alternate world poisoned by warring industries and populated by spectacular beings. Take jellyglass elevators to secret labs and bondage parlors where assassins and aviators, debutantes and corpse-snatching spiders wait to reap the honey of a dying planet.From the dark and wild mind behind The Green Kangaroos and Home Birth, Jessica McHugh's debut collection invites you to embark on journey into a spectacular world where the future lies in the minds of freaks and the forgotten.
