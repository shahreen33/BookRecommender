A vampire desperate to escape his past. A wolf shifter determined to protect her future. A killer on the loose.  One year ago, wolf shifter Emma accepted her dream job teaching PE at a Norwegian international school, finally freeing herself from her mother’s incessant matchmaking. As the alpha’s heir, walking away from her pack, from her obligations—potentially even her fated mate—weighed heavy on her heart. But deep down, she knew it was the right decision.  Unfortunately, her sacrifice may have been for nothing—because the new history teacher has fangs.  With a reputation for kidnapping and selling shifters to research labs, a vampire is the last thing Emma needs in her life, but she refuses to be intimidated. This is her territory and she’s not going anywhere, so that grumpy, gorgeous vampire can suck it.  Forced together at a prestigious boarding school, two supernatural enemies are torn between ripping each other's clothes off… And ripping each other apart.  Eager for a fresh start, vampire Calder accepts an invitation to teach history at a private school above the Arctic Circle. Its remote location appeals to his sensibilities, and years of practice have taught him how to charm his human colleagues, but a certain gym teacher is seriously trying his last nerve.  All Calder wants to do is teach, so if the strikingly beautiful shifter refuses to see him as anything but the big bad vampire, perhaps he ought to lean into the part and really give her a show.  As summer turns to winter, humans disappear from nearby villages, gone without a trace and presumed missing—or worse. Only one thing is certain: there are dark days ahead. Even for creatures of the night.   Dark Days is a standalone enemies-to-lovers paranormal romance duet. While Book 1 has a cliffhanger, all will be resolved with a supernatural happily-ever-after in Book 2.
