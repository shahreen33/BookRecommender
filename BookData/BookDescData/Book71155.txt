What is true faith? In Rediscovering Faith, Dr. Myles Munroe strips away the common errors and misconceptions surrounding faith to reveal the nature, character, and power of true faith, or, Rediscovering Faith. Rediscovering faith trusts not in the promises of God but in the God who promises; seeks not the blessings of God, but the God who blesses. Rediscovering faith will always be tested, but because it places its trust in the King of the universe, will always prevail under testing.Rediscovering faith, therefore is a triumphant faith that will overcome the world.
