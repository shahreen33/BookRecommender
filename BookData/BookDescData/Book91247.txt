Some people--a sizeable minority-- prefer to avoid the limelight, tend to listen more than they speak, feel alone in large groups, and require lots of private time to restore their energy. Often they feel different, not right, less than. But as Marti Olsen Laney proves, that is far from the truth. "The Introvert Advantage" dispels common myths about introverts--they're not necessarily shy, aloof, or antisocial--and explains how they are hardwired from birth to focus inward, so outside stimulation such as chitchat, phone calls, parties, or office meetings can easily become "too much." Most importantly, it thoroughly refutes many introverts' belief that something is wrong with them. Instead, it helps them recognize their inner strengths--their analytical skills, ability to think outside the box, and strong powers of concentration. It provides tools to improve relationships with partners, kids, colleagues, and friends, while offering dozens of tips, including 8 ways to showcase their abilities at work and strategies for socializing. In short, "The Introvert Advantage" shows introverts how to take advantage of their special qualities not only to survive in an extrovert-oriented world, but to thrive.
