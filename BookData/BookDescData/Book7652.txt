BEAUTY AND THE BEAST After a violent attack, Allegra Ennis lost everything—her father, her music career and her sight. Living in a world alone, full of darkness and fear, Allegra is haunted by nightmares that don’t end when she opens her eyes. When she is stalked by an unknown killer, Allegra must trust her life—and her heart—to former Navy SEAL Douglas Kowalski, a fearsome warrior who bears the scars of war. But Kowalski fears that someone as beautiful and talented as Allegra could never love a disfigured and mutilated war hero like him. He can protect her against danger, but can he protect his heart? It’s not what you see …it’s what you feel..**Note: This book was previously published by Ellora's Cave. The new edition has been lightly edited and updated.**
