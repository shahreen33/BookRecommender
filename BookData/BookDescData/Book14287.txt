Jane Nelson is a loving mother of two who has drowned her toddler son and is charged with his murder in this powerful examination of love, loss, and family legacy. When a prosecutor decides Jane's husband Tom is partially to blame for the death and charges him with "failure to protect," Tom's attorney proposes a radical defense. He plans to create reasonable doubt about his client's alleged guilt by suggesting that Jane's genetic predispositions contributed to her sudden snap. With the help of a woman gifted with the power of retrocognition-the ability to see past events through objects once owned by the deceased-the defense theory unfolds through an unforgettable journey into the troubled minds and souls of eight of Jane's ancestors. Janeology deftly illustrates the ways nature and nurture weave the fabric of one woman's life, and renders a portrait of one man left in its tragic wake.
