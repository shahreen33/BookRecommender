My life only has one purpose, and it's to protect them—my family.  Whether I fight, maim, or kill the enemy, it makes no difference to me. If have to take a bullet for my family, I would embrace death with a goddamn smile on my face.  When their safety is compromised, I put my life on the line and made a deal with the devil. I never questioned it, not even once...  ...Until her.  All it takes is one glance. With her pretty eyes now imprinted on my soul, the foundation my life has been built on is shifting. My loyalty has become hazy, and my life has a new meaning. There's a pull between us that's undeniable, and a carnal desire that threatens to ruin us both. It has turned me into a man obsessed.  My perfect, well-planned life is now in chaos, and a choice needs to be made.  My family…or my obsession?
