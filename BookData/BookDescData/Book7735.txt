For Delae, a lonely landholder on the edge of the Kingdoms, a frantic knock at the door on a stormy winter's night brings more than a cry for help. After centuries of war Elves have little contact with the race of men, but Dorovan can't bring himself to ride past those so obviously in need. Especially the small woman so determined to right the overturned wagon. One small act, with enormous consequences. Not Magic Enough is a tale of love and honor, duty and determination, that sets in motion a chain of events that will change the Kingdoms forever.
