Beginning high school is a completely normal, human right of passage but how normal would it be for someone who isn't entirely human?Let's say you're special, capable of harnessing the Earth's energy to defeat soul sucking monsters and you don't even know it.You go to school, meet new people and form friendships only to discover that you and your new click are something otherworldly. You're life becomes a comic book clich√©. By day you solve algebra problems and by night you rid the world of evil beings. This is my life. My quest is to protect innocent souls... and pass the ninth grade.
