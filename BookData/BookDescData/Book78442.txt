COMING SOON I had secrets that were drowning me, and my worst fear was he was going to gettired of waiting for me to put my big girl panties on and reveal the biggest one.Him. Shiloh My life started out with a tragedyâ€”the death of my mother.But I had something no other infant had, six amazing men. My father and his brothers in arms raised me and gave me the best life any kid could ask for.I grew up in the loving arms of the Wounded Souls, and each and every one of them protected and loved me beyond measure. Even when I lost two of the most important people in my life, the Souls never let me fall.After Dad met and married the best woman I had the pleasure of knowing, she and her flock, also wonderful women, gave me the feminine balance I needed in a life of soldiers turned bikers. They taught me to rise to every challenge and always be true to myself.Somewhere, I lost sight of that on the way to my aspirations to make my mark.Falling in love with a man who would die for me, adored me, and would do anything for me, should have been the happiest time of my life. So why was I hiding him?Could I really have it all? Or would my obsession with being everything and having it all mean I would lose the one person who meant everything?Then there was my ghost. Having him and his promise not to leave me was both a blessing and a curse. He knew all my secrets, and he also knew how to press my buttons. The danger of Rogue is a distant memory, and the kids of the Wounded Souls are all grown up. The club princess has big dreams and even bigger secrets. Will she keep her dreams alive and keep the love of her prince?
