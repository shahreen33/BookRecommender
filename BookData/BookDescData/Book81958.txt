God has returned with a gun in his hands. Now, he wants to play a game.Nephilim are the super-weapons of the future, hapless pawns in an unending trench war between two great super-nations: the theocratic, totalitarian state of the UNAC, and the techno-socialist Pacific Alliance.The Samuel-226 PatriotRangers are one of the most successful units in the Holy Legion of the UNAC. They have never lost a man, until one of their brothers, Twofer, disappears during a training exercise. The Host, self-proclaimed reincarnations of Christ, tell them that Twofer has been Saved and taken to Yetzirah, the promised land of the Nephilim.This, like many things the Host tells its slaves, is a lie.The leader of Samuel-226, Alpha, becomes obsessed with finding his missing soldier. Without his leadership, the medic, Mike, fights to hold the squad together as it is wracked by conspiracy and fear. As the horrific truth unfolds, the squad begins to question everything they know... but as Mike soon learns, even knowing the truth is a revolutionary act, and even if it remains unspoken, God is always listening.God Has Heard is military science-fiction told up close and personal: a dark war story of martyrdom and ultimate triumph, brotherhood and dignity in the face of total oppression. With echos of 1984 and Saving Private Ryan, it is a short, intense, thought-provoking read. If you are Christian, this book will probably offend you.
