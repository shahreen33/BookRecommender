It came from space…Something virulent. Something evil. Something new. And it is infecting the town of Falls Breath.Carried to Earth in a freak meteor shower, an alien virus has infected the animals. Pets and wildlife have turned rabid, attacking without warning. Dogs and cats terrorize their owners, while deer and wolves from the neighboring woods hunt in packs, stalking and killing their human prey without mercy. As the town comes under siege, Lauren searches for her boyfriend, while her policeman father fights to restore some semblance of order against a threat unlike anything he has seen before. The Natural Order has been upended completely, and nowhere is safe.…and it is spreading. Soon, the city will find itself in the grips of mass hysteria. To survive, humanity will have to fight tooth and nail.
