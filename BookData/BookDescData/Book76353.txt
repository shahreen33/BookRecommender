The final book of the Gilded Cage series, a dark romance that will floor you... Mafia kingpins have never been more dominant, delicious and oh-so-bad. You don't need to know my name, because I'll never let you use it. I am your Master. I am your Sir. I am your owner. I am going to destroy you. And you will cry for more... You never saw me coming. You never thought I'd get her. You rooted for the brothers. You believed I was gone. But evil never f*cking dies. And I'm back for what's mine... Ophelia. My pretty bird will sing again. There are good guys and there are bad guys. But there is also evil. It lurks in the shadows. It waits to strike. You will run. You will hide. You will never escape. And when you break, little bird... I will bathe in your f*cking tears.
