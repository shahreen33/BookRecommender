In "The Investigators," circumstances force Special Operations detective Matt Payne and his colleagues into the middle of two major cases simultaneously. With the commission of a brutal crime, an ongoing investigation into a squad of dirty cops suddenly grows ugly, and Payne must track down a key piece of evidence before things become even worse. At the same time, a woman he meets at a party may turn out to be a vital link to a group of urban terrorists, and if he doesn't follow it up now, the lead will disappear. During the next few days, as he juggles both cases and an increasingly complicated personal life, Payne finds himself drawn deeper and deeper into the circles of some very dangerous characters, and soon comes to realize that it may take all of his skills not only to prevail - but perhaps simply to survive.
