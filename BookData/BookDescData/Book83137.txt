Detective Brett Jacobs is a good cop. He’s honest, hardworking, and intent on bringing down a major criminal organization. But he's soon going to have his limits tested. After he finishes an undercover assignment, resulting in the arrest of a major crime boss, he’ll find out just how dirty the bad guys play. His world comes crashing down after an unspeakable tragedy, leaving Jacobs virtually despondent and wondering about his role in the unthinkable act.  Jacobs soon realizes that in order to beat a low-life criminal organization like this, he has to fight fire with fire. Will he really throw his badge away and become a one man wrecking crew? Or will he try to get retribution within the confines of the law? One thing’s for certain, the men he’s going up against have severely underestimated the lengths that he’ll go to. And he’ll stop at nothing in order to extract his revenge.
