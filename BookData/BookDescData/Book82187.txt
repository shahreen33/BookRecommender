You feel like heaven to touch.  It has been a month since plus-sized Kate Penney hooked up with the man of her dreams, her phenomenally handsome college Professor, Rust O’Brien. An incredible month in which all her physical needs and wanton hungers are fully satisfied and realized.  But now Kate wants more.  She wants Rust to gaze into her eyes lovingly, like he really means it. She wants to belong to him – body, mind and soul – just as she wants him to belong to her. But is she reaching? How can a man as obscure as he is ever belong to anyone?  Nevertheless, tonight is the night which marks a new threshold in their physical relationship. Tonight is the night he wants to do it raw with her.  But there are complex psyches at play here. Her classmate, Carlo, is in lust with her because of what she is to Rust. Rust himself is conflicted, though for reasons Kate would never have fathomed.  And when desires are stoked and games are played, it all must come crashing down.
