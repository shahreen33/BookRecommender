“They say nice guys always finish last. I say the only place that should apply is in the bedroom—it’s just good manners, after all.” – Brett MacKinnon, nice guy and frequent resident of the friend zoneLIV: There are really only three things I need in life: sex, baseball, and winning. My hot boyfriend and season tickets take care of the first two, while I always do my best to cover the last. So developing an unexpected crush on a new friend is more than a little inconvenient. I don’t have anything but friendship to offer Brett, but with the way he looks at me, he has me wishing I did.BRETT: I’ve been put in the friend zone so often, they’ve got a sandwich named after me. You’d think I’d be used to it by now. But when it comes to the delectable Liv, I’m determined to ditch the friend zone and show her I’m boyfriend material. Too bad the position’s already been filled by a ball-playing caveman who could flatten me with his pinky. What will it take to show Liv that nice guys can be more than just friends, and that love is the one game truly worth winning?
