Just you wait and see!"..."What's this all about?" Gordon asked.The policeman started the car before Uncle Josh could answer. "I'll explain," he said... The story of Gordon, a teenage boy, who is falsely accused and how the Lord changes his life.An interesting story with a message for young and old alike.Makes a great continued story for children or young people's service.
