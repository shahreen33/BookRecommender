As a hurricane gathers its power just off Apalachicolaâ€™s shore, another storm comes to a head in Lt. Maggie Redmond's home. Held prisoner by a man bent on avenging the death of a son, Maggie must find a way to save herself and her two children. No one knows where they are. No one is coming to help. Maggie and her children will have to find a way to survive both the madness inside their home and the madness raging outside. 
  Two storms that nobody thought were coming just made landfall.
    About the Forgotten Coast Series   The first four books of the series, 
  Low Tide, Riptide, What Washes Up, and Landfall,
 set the stage for the rest of the series. While there are subplots resolved in each book, there is an overarching storyline that is not resolved until 
  Landfall
, so readers will enjoy them best if these are read in order.  Subsequent books in the series are both longer (ranging between 200-250 pages) and designed to stand alone, so they may be read in any order.
