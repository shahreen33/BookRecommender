Ed Gaydos was not a hero. Shipped off to Vietnam in 1970, he did not capture a single enemy soldier or single-handedly dismantle the Ho Chi Minh trail. He sat on a remote patch of sand behind barbed wire with a bunch of teenagers, dodging incoming mortars, battling insects and holding back an avalanche of paperwork.This hilarious, intelligent memoir of the regular soldiers of the Vietnam War will leave readers of all types hungry for the next story. With an unflinching eye for detail that spares no one, even himself, Ed Gaydos reveals his personal struggles to make sense of the war. He somehow manages to exit laughing in Seven In A Jeep.
