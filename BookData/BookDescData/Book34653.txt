Jesus is nearly silent as he hangs on the cross, except for a few words. But these 7 Last Words provide a window into his soul, a way to understand what is important to this One who is dying on our behalf. 1. "Father, forgive them, they know not what they do." (Luke 23:34) 2. "This day you will be with me in Paradise." (Luke 23:43) 3. "Woman, behold your son." (John 19:26-27) 4. "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?" (Mark 15:34) 5. "I thirst." (John 19:28) 6. "It is finished." (John 19:30) 7. "Into your hands I commit my spirit." (Luke 23:46) Seven detailed lessons, each with probing discussion questions, can be used for personal enrichment, as a Lenten study by small groups and classes, and for preparation by teachers and preachers.
