A stirring account of America's vanished past... The book that earned Mark Twain his first recognition as a serious writer...  Discover the magic of life on the Mississippi.  At once a romantic history of a mighty river, an autobiographical account of Mark Twain's early steamboat days, and a storehouse of humorous anecdotes and sketches, Life on the Mississippi is the raw material from which Twain wrote his finest novel: 
  Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
.  "The Lincoln of our literature." (William Dean Howells)
