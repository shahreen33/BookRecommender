Must Read: Hopelessly Shattered previously.  Pregnant- ✔ Single mother of two - ✔ Biker best friend – ✔ Ex that’s still a D-Bag – ✔ ✔  New Years is the time for new beginnings. I thought I’d gotten that when I visited Texas over Thanksgiving. Then again, very little has changed. I’m still a librarian living in the same house. My daughters are growing up fast. Sure, I’ve acquired a new best friend, who’s convinced me it’s time to give dating fair shot. Which isn’t exactly easy when I’m pregnant with an As*hole’s baby. Does that complicate matters? Sorta. But there’s nothing left for me to do except move on. The jagged edges of my shattered heart have been polished, questions answered, and blank holes from my past plugged. Now I’m ready to take the plunge into uncharted waters to build a happier life… until a bomb comes along and tests my strength like never before. Nobody fu*ks with my family and gets away with it. Not even you.  Warning: Proceed with caution. Contains adult sexual content, the excessive use of the F bomb, violence, and whatever else that makes it unsuitable for anyone under the age of 18.  *Not a stand-alone, 2nd book in a Trilogy.*
