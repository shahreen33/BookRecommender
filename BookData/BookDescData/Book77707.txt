A newborn's absent face appears on the back of someone else's head, a filmmaker goes to gruesome lengths to achieve the silence he's after for his final scene, and a therapist begins, impossibly, to appear in a troubled patient's room late at night.

Here, self-deception is a means of justifying our most inhuman impulses--whether we know it or not.
