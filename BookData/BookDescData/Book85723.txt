He was supposed to be my last first kiss--my happily ever after. He promised to hand me the world, but in one night, all of those promises were shattered. Now, I was barely surviving the tragic loss of my husband, struggling daily to manage what was left of the life we'd promised to build together, when Cooper Hawke unexpectedly walked into my life.The Hollywood heartthrob had plenty secrets of his own and his eyes held the same darkness as mine. I couldn't stop myself from needing to know why. And as much as I tried to keep him out of my heart, he slipped past all my defenses. We both had pasts that destroyed our trust and had broken our hearts, but nothing will stop Cooper from trying to convince me we could have it all this time around.
