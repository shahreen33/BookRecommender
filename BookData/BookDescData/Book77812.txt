The prickly and complex Captain Tanisha is reluctantly paired with Kyle, a powerful untried pyro, to track The Prophet to his new headquarters and infiltrate The Natural Order cult. When their mission is complicated by a lovesick dragon horse, Kyle’s relationship to the leader of the dangerous cult, and the discovery of hostages in the tower of the Golden Temple, their choices suddenly aren’t as simple as black or white, good or evil, trust or betrayal. Even the dragon horse warriors must learn to embrace the mantra they are defending—stronger together. Dragon Horse War, Book II
