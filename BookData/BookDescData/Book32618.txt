Excerpt from Wieland or the Transformation Genius and knowledge command respect; but superior genius and profound knowledge, combined with exalted moral purity, cannot fail to excite unmingled admiration. The reputation of an author in whom these qualities are united may be circumscribed during life; but its rise and extension after death prove that his claims to distinction are well founded.

Charles Brockden Brown was the highly-gifted descendant of ancestors originally English, who came over to this country with the wise and benevolent Penn, and landed from the same ship on the banks of the Delaware.
