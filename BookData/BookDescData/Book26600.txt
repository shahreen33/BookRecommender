Even God stays away from the village of BETHANY'S SIN.For Evan Reid, his wife Kay, and their small daughter Laurie, the beautiful house in the small village was too good a bargain to pass up. Bethany's Sin was a weird name, but the village was quaint and far from the noise and pollution of the city.But Bethany's Sin was too quiet. There were no sounds at all...almost as if the night had been frightened into silence.Evan began to notice that there were very few men in the village, and that most of them were crippled. And then there was the sound of galloping horses. Women on horses. Riding in the night.Soon he would learn their superhuman secret. And soon he would watch in terror as first his wife, then his daughter, entered their sinister cabal.An ancient evil rejoiced in Bethany's Sin. A horror that happened only at night...and only to men.
