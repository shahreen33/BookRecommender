Everyone thinks of me as this happy and upbeat person. What they don't know is that I carry a deep, dark secret. Something horrible happened to me a year ago, and I have kept it quiet all this time. I was fine for a while, but somehow itâ€™s chosen this time to come back, and it's eating at me--like a cancer.I need to tell someone about it, I just don't know how. I'm pushing everyone I love away, including my mom and my best friend Charlie.Then there is Will. Handsome, sweet Will. We went out on a date a while back, but then the incident happened leaving me crushed and him confused.How do you tell someone you care about all of your secrets, and will they still want you when the truth comes out?
