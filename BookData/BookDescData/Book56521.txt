 My one piece of advice: Never kiss a stranger.See, I kind of kissed this sexy man at the bar on a dare once, and it turns out he's a Royal Fae destined to be my mate. Now I've been dragged to the Elemental Fae Academy to control the powers I unlocked that night.So kissing? Yeah, that won't happen again. Nope.Lesson learned.Except, I kind of kissed Titus, too. And well, now, I'm in a world of trouble. I keep burning things down, flooding dorms, and I've attracted the campus mean girl brigade.This Fae Realm is a nightmare come to life. Truly.But there are dreams here, too.Sexy ones.And they're in the form of five Elemental Fae mentors. They're supposed to help me control my powers, but who's going to keep the elements from controlling me?Note: This is a medium burn reverse harem paranormal romance, and book one of the Elemental Fae Academy trilogy.
