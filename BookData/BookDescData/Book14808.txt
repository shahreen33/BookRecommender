Fifteen-year-old Miriam is having stupid arguments with her mother, is bored to death in class, and is trying to get excited by the same old parties with the same old friends in the same old town. She wishes she lived in a big city where she could meet new people and experience new things. In other words, like 15-year-olds everywhere, Miriam is waiting desperately for her life to begin, for something, anything - a first love, perhaps. Love comes in an unexpected way when she meets her new classmate, Laura. Suddenly life is very complicated and unsettling, as Miriam finds herself lying to her girlfriends, avoiding her brother's probing questions, and second-guessing every move she makes. And as she tries to figure out Laura's moods, Miriam has to understand how her arrogant friend Philip fits into her life. When Philip, Miriam, and Laura take a weekend trip to the big city, every thing becomes clear - and more confusing than ever. Written in a smart, quirky, hip style Girl from Mars speaks to young people everywhere.
