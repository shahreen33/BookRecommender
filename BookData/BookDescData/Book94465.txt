Fritz Leiber's immortal tales of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser reach a turning point with this new edition of Leiber's final stories of the two intrepid adventurers. Their journeys have taken them from one side of Nehwon to the other, facing life-risking peril at every turn. Now, in a set of stories that show us Fafhrd and the Mouser both on their own and together, they will face some of their most challenging obstacles, and - against assassins, angry gods, and even Death himself - the duo must battle for their very lives.Contents:1 • Sea Magic (1977) • ss23 • The Mer She (1978) • novelette57 • The Curse of the Smalls and the Stars (1983) • novella111 • The Mouser Goes Below (1988) • novella
