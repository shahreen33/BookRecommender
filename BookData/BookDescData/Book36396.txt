I made a huge mistake.  No, not breaking into Panchard Enterprises, I did that on purpose. It was the getting caught part that changed everything. Instead of prison, Peter Panchard offers me a deal; steal something for him and he’ll help me find my little sister.  Now I’m at Neverly Prep wearing a uniform and trying to get close to Lucas Hook, the guy whose safe I need to crack. Did I mention the car and mansion and black card that goes along with this deal? Or the three boys so damned good looking it should be illegal?  They are the Lost Boys and they definitely don’t want me intruding into their lives. Something's going on and I’m sure it has to do with their missing mother, Wendi. Peter warns me to stay away from his boys, to do what I'm being paid for, but at every turn, the sparks fly between us.  I have a job to do and a sister to find, and getting involved with three guys who are off limits is a bad idea. Especially when Hook is their enemy. But when has a little forbidden ever stopped me?  I’m Ever Darlington and I've never been very good at following the rules.  Guilt, betrayal and lies make up EVER LOST, book 1 in the Lost Boys of Neverly Prep, a dark and dirty fast build/medium burn contemporary RH academy romance based loosely on the characters from Peter Pan. Complete at 52,000 words. All the players are over 18 and there is a cliffhanger, but I promise it will be worth it!
