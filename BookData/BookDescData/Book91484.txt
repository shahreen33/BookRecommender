Keyhole Lake has its fair share of oddballs and ne'er-do-wells, but sometimes even good folks do bad things, right? At first, the crimes seem to stem from desperation or teenage rebellion, but when the president of the ladies' auxiliary is busted stealing church funds, Noelle starts to piece together a pattern that points to a much more nefarious - and magical - explanation.  The infractions go from bad to worse, and to add insult to injury, the sheriff - her beau - doesn't believe her.  Though she has a town full of ghosts and a couple powerful witches on her side, the rest of the town - including her talking donkey - is convinced she's off her rocker. After all, "the devil made me do it" is an expression, not an alibi. The stakes skyrocket when one of the people closest to her is found standing over a dead body holding the murder weapon. The bad guys are about to find out what happens when you mess with southern witch's family, friends, and talking pets, assuming she can stay alive and out of jail long enough to find them.
