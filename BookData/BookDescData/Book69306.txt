How does one become an all-powerful Child of Chaos? That’s what Harley desperately needs to find out before her unhinged aunt raises the death toll. All she knows for sure is that magical kids are missing, and they somehow fit into Katherine Shipton’s grand scheme. Now that Harley is an official member of the San Diego Coven, she feels more responsible than ever for its protection—and that of the magical world. But she’s got a whole lot more on her plate than that. There’s a traitor lurking within the Coven. She still yearns to know the secrets contained within her parents’ Grimoire. And there’s also the fact that she might actually have feelings for a certain stubborn, green-eyed dude… All the while, Santana faces her own demons, with a magical Purge building within her and a crush on a boy with a dark side, one that might just lead them to real answers.
