Kendis Thompson of Seattle thinks she's as normal as the next computer geek, and up till now, she's been right. But her world is about to turn on its ear, for she is the daughter of a Seelie Court mage and her mortal husband--and her faerie blood is awakening. Suddenly the city she's known all her life is transforming before her eyes. Trolls haunt the bike trails. Fairies and goblins run loose in the streets. An old woman who is not what she seems and a young wanderer running from his past stand ready to defend Seattle--and Kendis--from magical assault. She will need those allies, for the power rising within her is calling her fey kin to the Emerald City to find her. And kill her.Faerie Blood was originally released by Drollerie Press in 2009. This second edition has been updated by the author, and includes new cover art and design.
