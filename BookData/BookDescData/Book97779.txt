She is the single most horrifying aspect of his life, and the only thing he has ever enjoyed about her are their truly spectacular fights. As such, he prefers having as little to do with her as possible. So when she unexpectedly summons him to London, he surprises himself by going, and finds his life turned upside down in ways he never thought possible.To loathe and to perish…Katherine despises her worthless and irritating husband, and nothing bothers her more than the fact that he actually came to London when she sent for him. Worst of all, now that he has come, she needs him to stay. With her. And with his every smile making her heart race, she begins to wonder if there could be more to him than meets the eye.
