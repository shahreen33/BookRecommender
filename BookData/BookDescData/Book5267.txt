I have a history of picking the wrong guy. Gay? Player? Momma’s boy? Check, check and check.Now I can’t stop fantasizing about one of the customers at the coffee shop I work at between classes. It’s just a harmless crush, right? It’s not like I ever see this guy outside of the coffee shop. It’s not like I’m going to see him while attempting to get birth control at the student clinic. While wearing a paper gown. While sitting on an exam table. Because he’s the doctor. Shoot. Me.But what if, for once, the man I’ve had the dirtiest, most scandalous fantasies about turned out to be everything but wrong?
