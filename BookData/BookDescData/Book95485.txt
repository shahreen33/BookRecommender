This collection of prose poems by the expatriate American surrealist Edouard Roditi was the last book of his to be published in his lifetime. Illustrated with a cover painting and four drawings by the Turkish surrealist Yuksel Arslan, Choose Your Own World gathers together 50 short prose poems by this important, though neglected, 20th century writer.
