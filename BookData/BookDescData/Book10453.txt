Lord Oliver Marsden has a secret. He's been in love with his childhood friend for years, though Vincent's never shown an interest in him beyond friendship. Ruggedly handsome, wealthy, and successful, Vincent is everything Oliver is not. And above all, Vincent doesn't prefer men.  Then Oliver discovers Vincent hires a man during his visits to a London brothel. Desperate to be with Vincent, Oliver orchestrates a deception, switching places with the brothel's employee. Yet Oliverâ€™s in for another surprise. Restraints and a leather bullwhip? Apparently Vincent isn't as conservative as he appears.  Lord Vincent Prescot has a secret of his own. One kept locked away and only indulged once a month. But this month's appointment is different. The mysterious man is so beautiful in his submission, rousing protective instincts Vincent can't deny. Yet Vincent refuses to believe he prefers men, for it could mean the end of his hopes of earning his father's respect.  Will betrayal destroy them or will they be bound together by deception?
