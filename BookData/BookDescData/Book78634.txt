The slayings are calculated and cold-blooded…  …but it is deceit that has Alex staring into the face of death.  Alex goes off the books to finally get to the bottom of a group that has re-defined modern-day terrorism. Extortion, bombings, and assassinations have created fear inside and outside of the beltway -- all while being nearly invisible.  Alex has no choice but to pull in Ozzie -- they only find more death. A young woman with so much hope…two bullets in the back of her head. How does she connect to all the other deaths in cities across the world?  Alex can only see one common thread: a blood-thirsty quest to obtain control. And that control will kill hundreds of thousands to pad the pockets of the group's leadership.  Shots fly. Alex and Ozzie try to escape death. But how do all the pieces fit together? They can't. Not unless there's a betrayal that will turn Alex's world upside down -- just before she's shot in the face.  You think you'll identify the Judas. But no one can predict how treacherous the mind becomes.  Is this the last day of Alex's life?  Get AT Any Cost now!

Why? Because, ultimately, they all connect -- Alex, Ivy, Ozzie. How? That's part of the mystery that I'm slowly unveiling throughout the Redemption Thriller Series.  Through each sub-series, characters from different books appear in the other novels. If it adds suspense, intrigue, or even a good laugh, I've included a cross-over character -- it's a lot more fun that way. Plus -- and here's the real kicker -- the final six novels will bring all of the major characters together -- Alex, Ivy, Ozzie. It will be explosive and gut-wrenching…in a way that will leave you breathless.
