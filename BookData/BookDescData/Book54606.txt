These poems were written by an earlier, teenaged version of the author. They aren't meant to be taken seriously... unless they speak to your inner darkness?Maybe they're not even good. In fact, they're probably terrible... unless you actually like them?Whatever. It's not like this plane of mortal existence even means anything.Warning: These poems contain themes such as suicide, death, abuse, sexuality, unrequited love, and generally taking oneself too seriously.
