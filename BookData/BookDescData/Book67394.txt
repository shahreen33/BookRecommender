Witch. Kitsune. Crazy cat lady.  Hey there! My name is Mei. Normally, I’m a ‘roll with the punches’ kind of girl, but I fear I’m going insane. I say things I do not think and do things I cannot control. My reality has become a nightmare. I feel like a puppet dangling from frayed strings.  Three vampire hunters alter my course when they stumble into me one night. Plagued by the same instability, they work their way into my life and my head. Together, we must try to find a way out of our madness. Hopefully.  Sounds like I have a plan, right? Wrong. You see, I have a couple of other problems that are pretty pressing as well. I’m almost sure that my boyfriend, Finn, is going to ask me to marry him. And, well, I can’t stand him. Oh, and there are a few other things, but I can’t tell you about them just yet. That would spoil the surprise.  Throughout it all, my search for the truth never falters. Insanity is the easier answer, but no one ever said life is easy.  **********  Box of Puppets is the beginning of a slow burn, reverse harem series. This means that she will not choose between men in the end. It does have cursing and some violence. It may not be suitable for all readers.
