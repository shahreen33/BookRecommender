Cultivated elevates floral design to fine art in this richly informative work on the principles of floral style. A charming and erudite mentor, Christin Geall emboldens designers, gardeners, and entrepreneurs to think differently and deeply about their work with flowers as she draws upon fine-art and historical sourcesâ€”the paintings of the Dutch still-life masters, the proportions of Versailles, or the work of floral innovators like garden designers Gertrude Jekyll and Constance Spry. Covering all aspects of floral design, including choosing plants to grow and arrange, selecting tools and vessels, balancing colour and form, and even photographing and selling arrangements, Cultivated elucidates universal lessons for all levels of practitioners, budgets, and materials. Geall's stunning photographs of her own lush designs illustrate techniques for creating brilliant arrangements that spark the imagination.
