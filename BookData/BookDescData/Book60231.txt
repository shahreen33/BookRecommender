Four young men with bright futures step off the path of graduate school and careers in search of something more--something epic. Desiring more from life than well-paying jobs and large bank accounts, they embark on a worldwide expedition, forging into the Guatemalan highlands, Russia's far north, the mountains of South Africa, villages in Bangladesh, Nepal's Himalayas, rural Vietnam and other rarely traveled lands. Through journal entries and first person accounts, Four Souls weaves together the tales of their journey, including near-death escapes and bribe-seeking officials, prison camps and race riots, hurricanes and illegal smuggling. More than just a collection of gripping stories, Four Souls chronicles the dawning realization that came through the adventure: that the life they were seeking is in the reach of all who are willing to grasp it.
