Travis King is the worst kind of asshole.He taunts me for being a good girl and mocks my high standards. He’s cruel, crass, and has enough confidence to last two lifetimes. And I hate him.It wouldn’t matter so much if he were avoidable. But considering he’s my older brother’s best friend and roommate, I see him more than I’d ever want to.His sculpted abs and gorgeous eyes are a waste on such an egotistical man, which makes me hate him even more.Even though I’ve had a crush on him since I was ten, the feelings weren’t mutual and he’s always made that very clear.He’s always loved getting under my skin and one night against my better judgment, I let him in my bed. I’ve succumbed to his manwhore ways, but that doesn’t change a thing.Because the King is about to get played at his own game—and lose.Checkmate.
