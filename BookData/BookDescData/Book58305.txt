Leading Well: Becoming a Mindful Leader-Coach This book combines two powerful leadership concepts: Mindfulness and Coaching. Leaders who are mindful-fully present, not distracted by failures of the past or fears about the future-lead well. Leading in the moment and engaged with their teams, mindful leaders help those around them keep calm and focused, not anxious and distracted. And when mindful leaders adopt a leader-coach approach-asking questions to help others solve their own problems-their leadership power magnifies. Indeed, when leader-coaches apply the four P's of coaching to both problem solving and career development of direct reports, the individual, the team and the organization all win.
