The Promulgation of Universal Peace is a collection of 140 talks given by 'Abdu'l-Baha-- the son and appointed successor of Baha'u'llah, the Prophet and Founder of the Baha'i Faith-- during his extensive tour of North America in 1912. This compliation touches on a wide range of subjects including the coming of age of the human race, the oneness and continuity of the Prophets of God, and the oneness of religion as a social force for establishing world order and peace. These talks serve as a priceless resource for studying the language and personal example of one of the most significant religious figures in recent history.
