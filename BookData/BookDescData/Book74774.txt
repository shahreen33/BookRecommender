At home or poised at the podium, the First Lady is uniquely poised to serve as advisor, confidant, and campaigner, with the power to shape American political and social conversation. At first blush, First Ladies Michelle Obama and Melania Trump appear diametrically opposed, but as women rising from humble origins to pursue their ambitions and support their husbands, the two have more in common than one would think.In Melania and Michelle: First Ladies in a New Era, author Tammy R. Vigil provides a compelling account of our modern first ladies, exploring how each woman has crafted her public image and used her platform to influence the country, while also serving as a paragon of fashion and American womanhood. Both women face constant scrutiny and comparison--from their degrees of political activism to their cookie recipes--and have garnered support as well as criticism. From their hectic lives pre-nomination to their attitudes while occupying the White House, Vigil builds a careful and thoughtful portrait of Melania Trump and Michelle Obama that provides new appreciation for the how these women, and the first ladies that came before them, have shaped our country.
