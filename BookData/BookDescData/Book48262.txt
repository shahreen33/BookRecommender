In Choose Me, RC Boldt brings us an unforgettable, heart-wrenching new standalone... Wearing the nicest suit I own, I stand in the very back with a flask full of whiskey in my inner pocket. I put on a brave face as I watch her walk down the aisle.Because it’s too late.I refuse to be the bastard who makes her cry on her wedding day, but I’m dying to tell her what I’ve always known. She’s my best friend, but she doesn’t realize she owns my f*cking heart and soul, too.  Each step down that aisle takes her farther away from me and brings her closer to him, forcing me to face the truth: I’ve fallen in love with someone who can’t be mine. If she’d just turn around, maybe she’d realize I love her more than he ever could. I won’t ruin her perfect day, but my broken heart begs me to try and convince her.Choose me.Amazon US: https://goo.gl/Fj8Rc9Amazon UK: https://goo.gl/J2sLgNAmazon CA: https://goo.gl/g2NWoYAmazon AU: https://goo.gl/ga9u7e Apple Books US: https://goo.gl/XtUPsxApple Books UK: https://goo.gl/pFzXZ5Apple Books CA: https://goo.gl/MRoM58Apple Books AU: https://goo.gl/bwB6YRNook: https://goo.gl/pi59Fw Kobo: https://goo.gl/h6jQ9rGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/DH3z82 Social Butterfly signup: https://forms.gle/a49ZogyaJjfiohRD7
