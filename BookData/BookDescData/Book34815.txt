In New York, eating out can be hell.Everyone loves a well-catered event, and the supernatural community is no different, but where do demons go to satisfy their culinary cravings?Welcome to Sin du Jour - where devils on horseback are the clients, not the dish.PRAISE FOR ENVY OF ANGELS:"Matt Wallace tells a raucous, riotous tale of culinary madness - a jaw-dropping horror-fantasy restaurateur Thunderdome that makes the 'monkey brain' scene in Temple of Doom look like something you'd see on Nickelodeon. It's like I dropped a heroic dose of acid and turned on the Food Network for eight hours. It's funny and demented and sticks in you like a pinbone. Matt Wallace writes like someone just jammed a needle full of adrenaline in his heart - and then, in yours. From this point forward, I'll read anything this guy writes."-Chuck Wendig, author of BLACKBIRDS and ZER0ES"No one makes me think, 'Dammit, I should have thought of that!' like Matt Wallace. The Sin du Jour series is something I read with equal amounts of envy and delight." - Mur Lafferty, Campbell Award winning author of THE SHAMBLING GUIDE TO NEW YORK CITY
