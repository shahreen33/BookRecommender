 bare roots  is a collection of poetry written for anyone that has ever buried parts of themselves away from the world. The book is divided into six parts-- Pruning the Damage, Battling the Weeds, The Roses [and the Thorns], The Seedling Shall Blossom, Cultivating Wisdom, and Buds of Hope are delicately crafted segments that touch on the subjects of femininity, love and loss, trauma, mental illness, the search for meaning, and ultimately, how to grow from it all.   Some portions of this book contain mature content and may be triggering.     The eBook version is optimized for reading on newer tablets and Kindle devices. It is not recommended for viewing on older devices, such as 1st and 2nd Generation Kindle Fire.
