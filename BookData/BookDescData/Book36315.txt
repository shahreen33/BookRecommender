Kyle Hanson was not a believer. That was a bit hypocritical since he made his living as a paranormal investigator on a TV show that was highly rated among it's demographic of unemployed college dropouts and late-night drinkers. Despite that, he was quite proud of his resilient doubt until the night his brother disappeared while recording an episode in the supposedly haunted woods around Greensborough, Louisiana.  That wasn't what shook his stalwart lack of faith. No, the event that changed his perspective was the night that followed three months afterward, and what he saw at the Strawberry Lane Motel.  The first in a Supernatural Thriller, Short Story Serial.
