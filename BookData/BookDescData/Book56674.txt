I'm at the end of my rope, planning a wedding with the man who has become a threat to my sanity.Everybody tells lies, but no one knows the truth we hide behind closed doors.That’s until Alec is hired to watch my every move. I thought the man threatening my mother’s life was my biggest problem. But he’s not. Alec Taylor’s sharp gaze and ruggedly beautiful smile are quickly becoming a danger to my heart.An accidental touch has me wondering what if.Little do I know he’d end up showing me the truth to the lie I’ve been living.What if I dare hope Alec is the one truth amongst all the lies I tell myself?
