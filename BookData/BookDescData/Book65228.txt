A heart-warming story of female friendship in the tumultuous days of the Suffragette movement...Sophia Seddon and Grace Thompson are poles apart - the one a member of the notorious Seddons of Plover Street, the other the vicar's spoilt only child. But their childhood friendship is revived when they find themselves fighting a common cause: womenâ€™s rights. And the ties of friendship prove stronger and more enduring than those of background or family, even in the face of danger.
