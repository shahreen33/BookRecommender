Painting Recipes Books are designed for mid-level art students and amateur painters who are looking to perfect their style by trying new interpretive forms and experimenting with sophisticated techniques they have never tried before. This new series takes its inspiration from cooking recipe books. Like imaginative chefs creating new recipes, artists are encouraged to try out and mix different substances to obtain new effects on canvas or paper. This Painting Recipes Book focuses on dealing with textures in painting and presents exercises and explanations, supplemented with how-to illustrations. It also discusses the uses of various materials that aren't traditionally thought of as standard in an artist's tool box. Color illustrations on every page.
