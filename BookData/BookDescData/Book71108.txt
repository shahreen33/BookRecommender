Sutton Hilliard  I've been watching my sexy neighbor lounge around his back yard in the nude for like three months now. Like a creepy weirdo, I do it with all the lights in my house off, so he won't know I'm there. When I think he is being attacked by wild animals, I run out to save him, shotgun in hand. And that is how I find out about shifters, mates and chosen. I can have babies?! WTF? Also, my gorgeous neighbor thinks I'm his mate. I've lived a life of people being forced to put up with me, when they didn't have a choice. Can I accept this mating, even to the most amazing man I've ever met, if the choice isn't even his?  Barron "Ronny" Franks  I'm a boring, serial-white-t-shirt-wearing, plain-looking grease monkey, who can't quite get over this curious obsession with my neighbor. Even though I'm sure I would have scented if he was my mate over three months ago when he moved in, my leopard and I are stuck on the man. When he tries to save me from my friends, and finds out about shifters, I finally get close enough to the sexy man to smell the truth. He really is my mate. And he's chosen. I couldn't be more happy with the gift I've been given, but his lack of understanding, the added comments of ignorant, bigoted leap members, and the continued investigation of cult activity among my people, might make it impossible for me to claim my sweet Sutton.
