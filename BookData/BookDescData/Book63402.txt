A Fool Again is the story of Genevieve, who once made a dash to Gretna Greene to marry, but was caught by her father. Now, a few years later, the story opens at the funeral of her elderly husband (not the man she ran away to marry)...and that's all I'm going to say, besides to tell those of you who enjoyed Fool for Love that the hero of this story is Darby's brother, Tobias.-Eloisa JamesThis novella originally appeared in the anthology The One That Got Away.
