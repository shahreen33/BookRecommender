Valeria Luiselli is an evening cyclist; a literary tourist in Venice, searching for Joseph Brodskyâ€™s tomb; an excavator of her own artifacts, unpacking from a move. In essays that are as companionable as they are ambitious, she uses the city to exercise a roving, meandering intelligence, seeking out the questions embedded in our human landscapes.
