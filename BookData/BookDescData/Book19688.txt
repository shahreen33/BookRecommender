Based on a real romance, Tempted tells what happens when relationships on Facebook & real life collide. Categorized as 'erotic romance' due to some raw & sexual content, Tempted explores how a modern woman deals with the complexities and confusion of online and in-person dating. It is packed with real people, real experiences, and real consequences...  Claire Eden desires nothing and no one. She has earned the world she’s created – a world she not only knows, but loves. Broadcasting her popular talk show from the comfort of her idyllic Marin county home, she spends her time working, contentedly frequenting her favorite haunts, socializing with her menagerie of pets, and trolling Facebook.  The last thing she was looking for was romantic love...until she found herself distractingly and deliciously tempted by a pair of dreamboats – one who arrives on her doorstep from the past, the other, an irresistible force from the other side of the country.
