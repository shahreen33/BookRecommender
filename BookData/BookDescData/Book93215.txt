In Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia a school of writers has developed over the last twenty years. They have been widely published in France, but their work has only occasionally been published in English translation in such journals as Black Orpheus and The London Magazine. This selection will thus provide, with the help of Len Ortzen's valuable introduction, a sample of some of North Africa's best writing. The Algerian war has obviously been a powerful influence on several of these writers; but all of them have a common urge to express the aspirations, bewilderment and resentment of their fellow countrymen in the period of decolonisation.
