Miss Juliette Aston is facing a deadline. This is her third London Season and her father has declared it will be her last. If she doesn’t find a husband this year, she can simply retire with him to the country where she can continue as his housekeeper. Juliette would like nothing better than to find a husband and start a family. There’s only one problem: she is simply invisible to the men of London society. She’s never mastered the art of small talk or mindless flirting, and she lacks the golden beauty and musical laughter of her best friend and society’s reigning debutante, Eleanor. It doesn’t help that she would rather discuss a scandalous novel rather than the weather or a gentleman’s new horse. Then there’s her unfortunate sense of humor which seems to shoot right over the heads of the men she does meet.Jacob Wilding, Baron Worthing, had not thought to marry in the near future. He is not against the institution, rather, he is loathe to settle for one of the indistinguishable young misses that populate London society, for wit and intellect do not seem to be prerequisites for a young lady’s debut into the ton. His father, worried that Jacob is simply not looking hard enough, uses his own failing health to…encourage his son to settle quickly. Jacob’s father pushes him toward Lady Eleanor Chalcroft and loath to disappoint his sire, Jacob sets out to court her, only to discover that he is more interested in her wallflower friend, Juliette Aston.
