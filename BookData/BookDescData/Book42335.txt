"Ask Me Anything isn't just any YA romance. This is a badass YA romance…" -Hypabale.comI should’ve kept my mouth shut.But Wilmont Academy’s been living in the Dark Ages when it comes to sex ed, and someone had to take matters into her own hands. Well, I’m a kickass coder, so I created a totally anonymous, totally untraceable blog where teens can come to get real, honest, nothing-is-off-limits sex advice.And holy hell, the site went viral overnight. Who knew this school was so hard up.Now the school administration is on a war path to shut me down, and they have Dean—my coding crush—hot on my trail. If he discovers my secret, I could lose his trust forever. And thousands of teens who need real advice won’t have anyone to turn to.Ask me anything…except how to make things right.
