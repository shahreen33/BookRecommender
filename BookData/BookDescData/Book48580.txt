From the author of "Iron &amp; Silk" comes a moving memoir of love and family, loss and spiritual yearning Anxiety has always been part of Mark Salzman's life: He was born into a family as nervous as rabbits, people with extra angst coded into their genes. As a young man he found solace through martial arts, meditation, tai chi, and rigorous writing schedules, but as he approaches midlife, he confronts a year of catastrophe. First, Salzman suffers a crippling case of writer's block; then a sudden family tragedy throws his life into chaos. Overwhelmed by terrifying panic attacks, the author begins a search for equanimity that ultimately leads to an epiphany from a most unexpected source. "The Man in the Empty Boat "is a witty and touching account of a skeptic's spiritual quest, a story of one man's journey to find peace as a father, a writer, and an individual.
