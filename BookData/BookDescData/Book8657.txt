During the summer before her senior year, 17 year old band groupie, Salem Vale, has been following her favorite punk rockers, Malice, from gig to gig hoping that one night she might get backstage and meet the sinisterly sexy guys. She's been saving her virginity for the lead singer Thane. One fateful evening she gets her wish. It's a dream come true. Except the dream turns to a nightmare when she wakes up in a dumpster, tossed away like yesterday's trash, with no memory of what happened the night before. She feels strange, different, as if something is trying to get out. Soon she realizes she's changing...turning into something not quite human. Now a hunger deep inside claws at her to feed, to siphon energy from those around her. Before she can do just that, Trevor, the band's roadie shows up and stops her from killing. With his help she learns to control the hunger inside, because he's just like her. And in return he wants her help to do one little thing... Help him kill the members of Malice.
