Will the Masks of Deception steal their Chance for True Love? Sparks fly when Delaney Brannigan and Blake Morrisson meet at the Glebe Point annual costume dance. Known only to each other that night as the leopard and the Lone Ranger, Delaney discovers soon afterward that the cowboy she thought had ridden off into the sunset never to tempt her again, is none other than the man she came from New York to find and discredit. Against her will, she is drawn into an overwhelming attraction to Blake, an attraction she can't give in to if she wants to keep the one thing she values more than anything else. During a chance encounter with an old friend, Blake discovers he has a son he never knew existed. Finding the boy has been the only thing he cared about for months—that is until Delaney Brannigan came to town. Now the bewitching woman has him thinking about settling down—but then he discovers Delaney isn't who she appears to be, and Delaney's hopes and dreams are shattered as the truth threatens to uproot her world. Will these two lovers lose one another in a web of deception, or will the small-town boy and the girl from New York find a way to trust their hearts and discover a once in a lifetime happiness?
