  She warned of the pain. She did.But no warning can prepare you.Nothing can.
Long, long ago, a little mermaid became intrigued by the way tall-crabs don't act at all like the prey she's more comfortable chasing. Her quest to understand will take her places she had never dreamed possible - onto land and beyond the endless cold.But quests always come with a price and hers is no exception. If she cannot find love within a year, she'll become sea foam. With only a month left and no closer to understanding 'love' at all, what is Maris to do? Tall-crabs - humans - are confusing and contradictory and love comes in so many forms, how can she ever know which one is right to win her life amidst friends and family on land?Fantastical worldbuilding meets verse novels in this queerplatonic retelling of The Little Mermaid, the first story in a series of queer fairytale retellings.
