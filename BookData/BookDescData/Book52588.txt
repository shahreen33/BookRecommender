Oakley Spurlock is dying.  She only has weeks to live thanks to a freak infection that totally and completely destroyed her kidneys.  Despite her family’s desperation, not a single one of them is a match.  In a last-ditch attempt, Oakley’s father takes to social media to beg for help to save his daughter’s life. ***  Pace Vineyard is lost. So lost, in fact, that he’s not sure he wants to be found.  But then a beautiful woman’s face is splashed across social media, and Pace finds a spark in his soul for the first time since a bomb went off beside him.  He’s already missing two legs. What’s one more kidney?  At least, that’s what he tells himself.  What he doesn’t expect is to give his heart to the woman, too. Or for the woman to run away with it and force him to follow.
