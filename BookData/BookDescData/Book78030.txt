"A master of those embarrassing, gloppy, painful, and suddenly wonderfulthings that happen on the razor's edge between childhood and full-fledgedadolescence" (The Washington Post), Newbery medalist Jerry Spinelli has pennedhis early autobiography with all the warmth, humor, and drama of hisbest-selling fiction. From first memories through high school, including firstkiss, first punch, first trip to the principal's office, and first humiliatingsports experience, this is not merely an account of a highly unusual childhood.Rather, like Spinelli's fiction, its appeal lies in the accessibility anduniversality of his life. Entertaining and fast-paced, this is a highlyreadable memoir-- a must-have for Spinelli fans of all ages.
