From the winner of the 1999 David Cohen British Literature Prize — the richest literary award in the UK — comes an unforgettably chilling novel, written with the compassion and artistry that define Trevor's fiction.There were three deaths that summer. The first was Letitia's, shocking and sudden, leaving her husband haunted by the details of their last afternoon. No one expected that drizzling Thursday in June to signal the approach of two more tragedies — deaths that shook both the apparently blessed and the obviously afflicted. William Trevor gives us an unputdownable novel, beautifully written and wonderfully sympathetic.From the Trade Paperback edition.
