For anyone who loves cats or dogs (or both!), James Patterson's newest illustrated middle-grade story is set in an imaginative world populated entirely by animals, where society is defined by the oldest rivalry in the world: katts versus doggs! Oscar is a rambunctious dogg who loves eating and being a Scout. He and his family know that snobby katts are good for nothing but chasing up trees. Molly is a clever katt who just knows she's destined for fame and fortune as an actress. She comes from a family of well-bred katts who despise drooly, disgusting dogs!Oscar and Molly have been told their whole lives that katts and dogs hate each other--until they each get hopelessly lost in the woods. Their lifelong prejudices flare up when they cross paths, but slowly, they realize that the only way to survive and find their way home is to...work together?!Yeah, that's not going to happen!
