Meet bad boy catcher, A.J. Gonzalez...When I stood Mia up eight years ago, I never dreamed I’d run into her again. But here she is, making me look like a fool in front of thousands of fans.The sweet, innocent girl never knew why I left. But I had my reason. A good one. In no way was I worthy enough for Mia Gunner. Today, grown up and hotter than ever, she’s still too good for me. But when she walks by, wearing those skin-tight leggings, that doesn't stop me from wanting that taste I denied myself. And I get it.Almost.It turns out; Mia isn’t through plotting her sweet revenge. Now, left in a not so compromising position, Mia won’t have anything to do with me. That is until we find ourselves in another awkward situation. When I think life can’t get more complicated, Mia packs a few more surprises. And believe me, she may not be as timid as I once thought.  I can’t help wanting her, but I need to stay away. Especially with our paths taking different courses. But I’ve never been one to back away from a challenge. It’s the bottom of the ninth. Time to score. I’ll either step to the plate or strike out. No matter what happens, this will definitely be a December I’ll never forget.
