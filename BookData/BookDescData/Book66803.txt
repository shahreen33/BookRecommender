Alternate cover edition of ASIN B07D1M68T2She’s forbidden. Too young, too pure, and not mine. I’ll break all the rules to be with her. She belongs to me, even if she doesn't know it yet.  He’s taboo. Too old, too experienced, and my stepfather. I’ll cross every line to be with him. He's not mine, and never will be.  It’s not about the danger of what's forbidden, it’s about the pleasure we get from it.  All consequences be damned.
