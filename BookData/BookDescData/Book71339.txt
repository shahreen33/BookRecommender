IN PIONEER NEBRASKA, A WOMAN LEADS WHERE NO MAN WILL GOSoon to be a major motion picture directed by Tommy Lee Jones. The Homesman is a devastating story of early pioneers in 1850s American West. It celebrates the ones we hear nothing of: the brave women whose hearts and minds were broken by a life of bitter hardship. A spokesman; must be found to escort a handful of them back East to a sanitarium. When none of the countys men steps up, the job falls to Mary Bee Cuddy&amp; ex-teacher, spinster, indomitable and resourceful. Brave as she is, Mary Bee knows she cannot succeed alone. The only companion she can find is the low-life claim jumper George Briggs. Thus begins a trek east, against the tide of colonization, against hardship, Indian attacks, ice storms, and loneliness; a timeless classic told in a series of tough, fast-paced adventures. In an unprecedented sweep, Glendon Swarthouts novel won both the Western Writers of America's Spur Award and the Western Heritage Wrangler Award. A new afterword by the author's son Miles Swarthout tells of his parents Glendon and Kathryn's discovery of and research into the lives of the often forgotten frontier women who make The Homesman as moving and believable as it is unforgettable.
