KANEShe wants to be my buddy. You know, the naked type—no strings attached, no awkwardness. Friends who are lovers but with no relationship hassles. To a man who has nothing to offer a woman except pleasure, it’s an offer too good to refuseDays of laughter and nights full of hot searing passion. It can’t last. I need it to end, my life depends on our demise.But I miss her clothes on my bedroom floor. As she looks up at me from her knees, my heart … the distraction … I just can’t. She’s here in front of me, so how do I keep her safe?LILLYHoly hotness! It’s a crime to be that good-looking, surely. It’s not just looks, I’m certain. His skills in the bedroom keep me awake dreaming of more. I don’t want to be attached, but I’m not ready to let him go. I come up with the perfect plan.Friends with benefits, an arrangement with rules.F… buddies—his name and his rules. A name he takes seriously and lives up to. I’ve never known life to be this good but just as I fall under his spell, he’s gone.The rules say I should too. But I won’t because his love is worth fighting for.I’m about to make him see that too.
