From the author of H2Oâ€¦She's been taught to fear him.He's been taught to fear her.What if they're both wrong?In River's world, XYs are a relic of the past, along with things like war and violence. Thanks to the Global Agreements, River's life is simple, safe, and peaceful...until she comes across a body in the road one day. A body that is definitely male, definitely still alive.River isn't prepared for this. There's nothing in the Agreements about how to deal with an XY. Yet one lies before her, sick, suffering, and at her mercy.River can kill him, or she can save him. Either way, nothing will ever be the same.
