Can be read as a stand-alone, but we recommend you read the stories in sequence for maximum enjoyment. This is the backstory on Kari and Death; their full story will be told over the course of the next three books. Whisked from Earth to the matriarchal planet of Galis by forces unknown, Kara Summers finds refuge in the mountainous crystal fortress of the Gy'at Li sector. Taken in and renamed Kari by the sector's High Mystik, she spends seventeen years being honed into a formidable warrior. Sent to Crystal City to complete her training, Kari Gy'at Li knows there is one species of male she must avoid at all costs because of their proclivity for stealing women-the warriors of Tryston. When Kari is hunted by an eight-foot-tall muscled warrior, she realizes what she must do-vanquish the predator or become the prey. Reader Advisory: This story has graphic sexual language and scenes-no closed bedroom doors (or other rooms) here! An adult Scifi romance from Ellora's Cave Publisher's Note: This story was previously released in the Alien anthology.
