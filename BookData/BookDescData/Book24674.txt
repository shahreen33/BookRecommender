Ally's worried about money. Or rather, the lack of it. Her big sister Linn has gone and got herself a Saturday job so she can help out, but Ally's too young to get a job...unless. Well, unless economical with the truth and goes for that job helping out in the card shop down the road. Never mind if it is run by a wig-wearing crazy woman who likes to sing children's songs (loudly). But the prospect of a job seems to just add to her worries...and then Rowan starts shopping for Britain even though Ally knows sha can't afford it-what is going on with her...?
