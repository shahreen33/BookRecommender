*NO LONGER AVAILABLE* THIS WAS RE-RELEASED AS A RESTORED YA VERSION WITH AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT COVER. IF YOU READ A VERSION WHERE ALEXIS IS 17, PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE A REVIEW HERE. THANK YOU. Not once in twenty-four years has Alexis slept a dreamless night. She used to relish the visions, but lately they've grown dangerous. Darkness is invading her days, showing the true nature of her existence. After a nightmare occurs while she’s not sleeping, she discovers much about her past. Her real mother was killed the day she gave birth, leaving Alexis a faery changeling. Now the murderous evil is on the loose and stalking Alexis, desperate for her soul. A simple bedtime verse holds the key to her life and safety, as well as the lives of many other fae. With only strangers to depend on—one being a depraved faery whom she can't help but fall for—Alexis’ emotions become stuck in overdrive. Not even her wildest dreams could have prepared her for this chaos. But that's exactly where she must delve, back into dreams, to steal and sacrifice. This, according to the prophetic rhyme. Alexis’ strength must lead her toward the greater good. She’s in a race against fate, evil, &amp; time … and doesn’t have a clue if she can actually win.
