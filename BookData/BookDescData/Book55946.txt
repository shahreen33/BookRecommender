Claiming our birthright! One taste of this ancestral land and my husband was smitten, so much so that nothing would do but that we all experience the wonders he had discovered. From the Ionian Sea and Calabria, the former Magna Graecia, through Naples, Salerno and Rome to Florence and Venice up to Switzerland and the Italian and French Rivieras, we drank unstintingly, savoring all that Italy had to offer. While delighting in the more storied cities, their museums and landmarks, nothing was as rewarding as setting foot in the small villages in the provinces of Rome, Naples, Salerno and Catanzaro that Carmen's father, our grandparents and my great-grandparents had relinquished for the opportunities they found in America.
