I’ve been looking for a mate in all the wrong places. When the right one shows up in Pine Falls with a man in tow, I almost miss her. Caroline Abbott is a sweetheart of a city girl who is making one last stab at keeping her (dead) relationship together. When her fool of an ex takes off and leaves her alone in the forest, I’m more than happy to step into his abandoned shoes.  While I can make her shout with pleasure, I worry those screams will turn to fear when she realizes that my hidden half is a bear.  I can’t keep the secret much longer, but telling her might scare her off for good.
