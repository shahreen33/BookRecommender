Bookstore owner Kate comes home from work one day to find her two flatmates in bed...together. Joe - a sensitive composer - is mortified. Sean - an irrepressible bad boy - asks her to join in!Kate's been fantasising about her hunky new housesmates since they moved in, but she was convinced they were both gay. Realising that pleasure is a multi-faceted thing, she sets her cares aside and embarks on a ménage à trois with the wild duo. Kate wants nothing more than to keep both her admirers happy, but inevitably things become complicated, especially at work. Kate has told her colleagues that Joe and Sean are gay but the gossip begins when she's caught in a clinch with one of them in her lunch hour! To add to this, one of Kate's more conservative suitors is showing interest again, but she's hooked on the different kind of loving that she enjoys with her boys - even though she knows it cannot last. Or can it?
