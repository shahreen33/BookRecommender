A humorous but serious and practical guide on how we can finally rid ourselves of those commonplace, bureaucratic bottlenecks that plague every office in every company around the world. The author presents a five-step plan on how to make our work lives much, much easier. The TV remote control that requires a PhD to operate. The weekly hour-long conference call hijacked by screens freezing, employees dropping in and out, and ten minutes of actual discussion. The Power Point Presentations read by literally no one.   What has happened to common sense? Where did it go and how can we get it back?   Best-selling author Martin Lindstrom combines numerous real-life examples of common sense gone wrong in global Fortune 100 organizations with his own ingenious plan for restoring logic—and sanity—to the companies and people that need it most. Funny, entertaining and immensely practical, The Ministry of Common Sense is a must-read for anyone who works in an organization of any size.
