Cara Moreau is dying from a supernatural curse. Her only chance of survival lies with the warrior, an enigmatic man who comes from a realm "in between." Quin St. Clair lived hundreds of years ago, but now exists solely to protect the world he once called home. That's all he will tell Cara, the woman he must keep alive by remaining close to her. Very close. But Cara is determined to discover more answers as she grows to like her warrior. While they search for the book of spells and the cure contained within its pages, their feelings for one another can no longer be denied. But what will happen when Cara is cured and Quin's assignment is complete? And can she trust this mysterious man with the book if they find it? As friends and family from the previous Freak House novels help them, and old and new foes vie for power, Quin and Cara must not allow their feelings to get in the way of their task. Or Cara's life, and Quin's afterlife, may be cut short.
