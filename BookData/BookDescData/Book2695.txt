The war between the Guardians and the Shadow Riders ended in total devastation. The final battle killed all the dragons and left nothing but fields of ash. A small clutch of dragon eggs was all that remained to provide hope for the future. Five hundred years later, the ability to use magic is a death sentence and dragons are remembered as a curse. But the unhatched dragons sing for their riders...and six lives will be changed forever. The elements of magic are drawn together as the dragons' call leads them on a journey where they learn everything they've been taught to believe about magic and dragons is wrong. When an evil from the past rises again, and Shadow Dragons ride the dawn once more, they will risk everything to save a future none of them thought possible.
