Business is tough for Critter Catchers, the animal control company owned by best friends Demetrius and Cody. Their first big job was a few months ago, but no one likes to talk about it because that critter turned out to be a murderous wolf man. When a new job finally appears, they jump at it, and end up chasing an unidentified creature through the woods around Parson’s Hollow. Soon they’re smack dab in the middle of another potential paranormal case, complete with a mysterious blood-thirsty creature, a secretive laboratory, and a farmer they’re not sure they can trust!
