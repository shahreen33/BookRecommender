Bear wishes he could fly. He wants to swoop and glide and feel the wind in his fur. Yet no matter how hard he flaps his arms, he can’t get off the ground. Goose and Fox offer support, but Bear remains earthbound—until he hears music. Suddenly, Bear is gliding and swooping and light on his feet. In Suzanne Bloom’s lovable story, the seventh in the popular Goose and Bear series, Bear discovers that not getting what you want isn’t always a bad thing. In fact, it may lead to something surprising.
