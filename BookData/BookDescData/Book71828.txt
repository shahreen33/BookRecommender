The Trashcan Man was spared for a reason. To join the Dark Man Randall Flagg's swelling army and to set the world on fire. It's a dream come true for the pyromaniac, but he has to reach Flagg's compound in Las Vegas first--and, somehow, survive crossing paths with "the Kid," a hardcase who's even crazier and more dangerous than Trashy is! The villains are front-and-center as we cross the mid-point of this epic adaptation of Stephen King's horror masterpiece! Collecting: The Stand: Hardcases #1-5
