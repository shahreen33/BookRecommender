SIX WEEKS FOR LIFE OR DEATH ......In 'Six Weeks', Jessica L. Degarmo departs from the style of her very successful Romance novels - 'Hooking Up', 'The Storm Within', 'Decisions' and 'How To Meet A Guy In The Supermarket' - to examine every teenage girl's nightmare: that she is pregnant and not certain she's ready for a child.It is a life and death decision â€“ not her life, but her decision - and despite the opinions of those around her, she is on her own.In a world of gray, one thing is black and white. Six weeks is her deadline to decide.Maybe you have been there, in which case you will understand.
