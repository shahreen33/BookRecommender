War hurtles in, a typhoon over the sea.After Bree’s life was torn apart, Nereidium had represented a haven to her. A place that—if she could save it—was beyond the King’s reach.And, at last, she’s arrived upon its shores. But things in Nereidium are not what they should be.The land is plagued by a rash of mysterious earthquakes, the likes of which it’s never known. The governors are distracted by old traditions, while Bree and her friends grapple with changing identities and the sense that the longer they wait to take action… the greater the danger from Egria grows.Bree is tired of living under the shadow of King Langdon’s power. And she’s tired of waiting for him to be the first to act.In this final chapter of the Threats of Sky and Sea series, it all comes down to Nereidium or Egria. To Bree or the King. It’s kill… or be killed.And not everyone will escape the battle unscathed.
