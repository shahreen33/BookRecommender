  My professor gave me my first D.

  Now my next assignment is due…in nine months.
You know when you meet your new professor, and he ends up being the same man you had a one-night stand with three months ago?Okay, maybe not. Let me explain.I hadn’t intended to sleep with my professor. I might be known as the impulsive, prankster daugh-ter in my family, but I’m not insane. I just wanted to have some fun in Ireland at my sister’s wed-ding, and maybe lose my virginity, too.When I met Lochlann Gallagher at a pub one night, I couldn’t resist him. He was hot, Irish, and en-tirely set on seducing me. One unforgettable night under the sheets with him, and my V-card went up in smoke.Well, that night had one itty bitty consequence because Lochlann totally made my eggo preggo. And if this story isn’t crazy enough, Lochlann is not just my baby daddy: he’s now my professor and my advisor for grad school. Somehow we have to figure out a way not to reveal this rapidly gestating secret while re-sisting the explosive attraction between us. Except there’s just one more complication to this story: I think I’m totally falling for my baby daddy. Oopsie daisy.
