Grumpy Old Bear: Chosen Book 2 Thompsyn Lane is a grumpy, old, reclusive bear shifter that has no intention of changing anything about his life for anyone.

Sweet Sutton: Chosen Book 3 Sutton Hilliard has been sneaking around at night watching his sexy neighbor run around his backyard naked for months. And he's spent the same amount of time hiding from the man during the day. When he tries to save the man from being mauled by a bear and an leopard at the same time, he gets a crash course in shifters and a lot more...  Warning: Mpreg elements!  Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama.  Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses::
