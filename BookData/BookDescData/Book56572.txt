He’s arrogant.I’m sassy.He’s an ass. I’m classy. He works for the prosecution.I work for the defense. We are enemies, yet I crave him more than anything. A night twisted beneath the sheets doesn’t equal a lifetime commitment, but it does begin my downward spiral. I’ve dusted myself off more than once, but he’s a smudge that refuses to budge. That pompous, arrogant, beautiful man doesn’t deserve me, so why do I keep giving myself to him?
