Let the web unravel itself and try not to die in the process.   After losing her mother in a freak accident, Suede Harris is trying to pick up the pieces and move on with her life. With a history of trouble, including bad relationships, alcohol, and ditching college, finishing up her criminology degree seemed like the best way to start.  While catching up back home with summer courses, she joins a study group to keep on track, but when her friends convince her to go geocaching, a simple trip will shake up her entire world. When the only treasure they find is a human bone, it will send her on a mission fueled by personal trauma to figure out what happened to the victim.  Will she find the killer, or uncover secrets that have been long buried?  Author Note: This is book 1 of a 6 book murder mystery series. The books cannot standalone, so please be warned that you'd need to read all 6 to get the full story. Each book will release the last Thurs of the month! The town in the story is fictional, so the coordinates on the cover do NOT correlate to the murder locations. Hope you love the story.
