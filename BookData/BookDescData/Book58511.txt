A story of oppression and loss, of uprising and joys. Rubberman's Citizens pushes through grim tyranny with the courage, compassion, and humour of those forced to fight troubled times.In Citizenry, Leena knew cruelty was normal.Order was kept by Warren, through intimidation and abuse. Normal meant deliveries from above, supplies from the great, unknowable, Actual. Normal meant hating the lessers who live below. Normal meant routine public degradation. Normal meant hearing screams, and knowing no one dared help. Normal was knowing that tomorrow, it could be your own screams being ignored. Leena found a way to help. Leena found a chance. Leena discovered revolution. ------The first book in the series, Rubberman's Cage, serves as a broad introduction to most of the regions inside the series environment.
