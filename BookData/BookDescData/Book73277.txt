Ernie Harwell, the long-time voice of the Detroit Tigers, has created an audio scrapbook that's a virtual time-machine into baseball's legendary past. Includes old interviews with legends Connie Mack, Ted Williams and Joe Dimaggio -- as well as classic calls from Ernie's early days with the Atlanta Crackers to his legendary career as the Tigers' play-by-play announcer. A must have.
