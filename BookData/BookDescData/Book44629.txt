John Blake and Miranda Sugarman dated in high school, but after graduation they went their separate ways: he stayed in New York City and became a private investigator while she moved to the Midwest and settled down to a safe, respectable life as an ophthamologist. Or so he thought - until the day, ten years later, when he opened up the Daily News and saw Miranda's photo staring out at him under the headline "STRIPPER MURDERED."How did Miranda end up back in New York, shot to death on the roof of one of Manhattan's seediest strip clubs? The closer John gets to the answer, the more dangerous and violent his investigation becomes, until a bloody assault on someone close to him leads John to a shocking discovery and a shattering face-off with the person responsible.
