Having got too far into the dangerous world of The Brethren MC for comfort, Iain was now out again, but out in bad standing. He has been in hiding in Ireland when he discovers that not only do Wibble and Charlie both know where he lives, but that he's now wanted by both sides as a potentially bloody biker conflict heads towards its final showdown and worse, a trial in front of the media. But as the case unfolds in Court, the questions become more and more urgent. Is everything what it seems, and who, if anyone, knows or is telling the truth? The final explosive instalment of The Brethren Trilogy.
