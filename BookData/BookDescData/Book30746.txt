Not by Chance is a collection of poems written for those who call life purposeless. In Octavia D. Mason's debut collection of poetry, she reveals that life is good and joy does come. Despite what's shown in the darkness of night or felt in the stillness of one's heart, there is light, and there is a song of hope. Come join a world where life doesn't happen by chance.
