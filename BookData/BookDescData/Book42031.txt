With an attack against the Las Vegas Monorail, CIA Director Alexandra Dupuis calls in the agent she counts on in dangerous situations - even though that agent feels betrayed by the very government she serves, the very country she protects - in order to protect American interests. In Jaclyn Johnson's latest adventure, Dupuis sends the secret agent into the path of a radical Christian terrorist, one whose designs for Sin City would spell disaster for not only the entire southwest, but for the country as a whole, too. Double Agent is third book in the Snapshot series.
