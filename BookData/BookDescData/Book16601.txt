All I want is my happily-ever-after.That's all I've wanted since meeting Noah Miller.From the day we met, the world has tried to keep Noah and me from being together, but now that I'm carrying his child, no one will be able to tear us apart. Or so I hope. But Noah and I have made some mistakes along the way, and the consequences are impacting the people we love. Worse, there's a storm on the horizon, and it's sure to cause serious devastation.If we can get through this, we'll finally be Rose and Noah; a family, forever.But first we have to survive the road ahead. And happily-ever-after is a long way off.
