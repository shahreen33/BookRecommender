Luciana Rossi is untouchable, the Principessa of the Zanetti Famiglia, until one day she becomes extremely vulnerable. Unsure of who to trust, or where to turn, she follows the man that she’s had a connection with since childhood. Gavino Santoro is hungry. He craves power, control, and Luciana. Taking over the Zanetti Famiglia has been his goal since he began climbing the ranks of one of New York's most powerful families. Now that the power he craves is within his grasp, he needs the wife that will complete his image of being the new Zanetti Boss. Even if he has to lie and manipulate the beautiful woman to bend her to his will. Two people doomed by circumstance. An organization in upheaval. Nothing but uncertainty in the future. Morality is nothing but a concept. This is the beginning of the Zanetti Famiglia’s new empire.
