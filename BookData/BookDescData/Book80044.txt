Today having an excellent book with an great idea isn't enough for success. Over 2,000,000 books published every year, don't expect the crowd to pick up your book and say "it is a masterwork" even if it is.I swear you won't find any marketing bullshit in this book:No "social media is the king" crap No "just order a gold marketing package" and problem is solved No "do a giveaway" or "kindle free promotion" and everybody will buy your bookI collected all the working marketing steps for those who want to make an impact with their books. You won't find any of the words "strategy" or "planning" in this book. I'm a practical guy and so I try to keep the bullshit and time-wasting things away from you, but I deeply believe that there are methods that should be shared with the new authors who have limited resources to do marketing.I'm focusing mainly on KDP authors, since it is the best platform to publish indie books in 2019. You will find small steps (not time-consuming), and some bigger steps in this short book which will be effective in long term. I tried to keep these steps in a linear timeline as it may happen even in real life.I hope you will enjoy reading this book, and you will find some useful resources and unique tactics that will raise your book out from the crowd.
