'I believe that we haven't changed much in the last two thousand years and as a consequence we must try still to learn from history. History is ourselves.'From the collapse of the Roman Empire to the bridges of Brunel, through art and architecture, philosophy and history, engineering and science, Kenneth Clark's unique personal guide to civilisation based on his landmark TV series has been hugely popular and influential. Almost half a century after its first publication, and with half a million copies sold, Civilisation still offers the perfect introduction, witty and full of wonder, to the greatest artistic achievements of the West.KENNETH CLARK (1903-83) was Director of the National Gallery, Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford and Chairman of the Arts Council. His legendary TV series and this seminal book made the history of western culture widely accessible for the first time. Civilisation remains an esential cultural classic.
