All passengers, please prepare for departureâ€¦An employee, a cop, and five prisoners; a prisoner, a stowaway, and a madman.These are the people waiting at the Lawton bus terminal. Mostly late-night travelers who want nothing more than to get to their destinations, and employees who want nothing more than to get through the graveyard shift.But when a strange, otherworldly fog rolls in, the night changes to nightmare. Because something hides in the fog. Something powerful. Something strange. Something... inhuman.Soon, those in the terminal have been cut off from the rest of the world. No phones, no computers. Just ten strangers in the terminal... and The Other.The Other is the force in the mist. The Other is the thing that has captured them. And The Other wants to play a game. The rules are simple:1) The people in the terminal must choose a single person from among them. That person will live. The rest will die.2) Anyone who attempts to leave the terminal before the final vote will die.3) The final vote... must be unanimous.A nightmare. And getting worse, because the best way to make a vote unanimous... is to kill the other voters.Welcome to the end of the line. Welcome to the Terminal.
