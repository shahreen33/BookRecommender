  A happy ever after is not in the cards for me. But a short fling aboard a ship crossing the Atlantic might just be exactly what I need.
  When my friends suggest I take a much-needed vacation on their Valentine’s Inc. hosted cruise, I leap at the chance. I don’t have a lot of expectations for this matchmaking singles cruise—I’m certainly not looking for a future Mr. Chase Kelton.  What I’m not prepared for is walking into my assigned suite to find a man passed out on the first day. I recognized the shy barista immediately. He’s been serving me my morning fix for a year and driving me crazy with the hard shell he keeps locked around him. I want to break it. I know there’s an entirely different man beneath it that I’m itching to reveal.  Reign is the proverbial fish out of water, and when I learn the real reason he’s on this cruise, I see an opportunity I can’t resist. He needs a companion to show him the ropes—I can do that and so much more.  
  An introverted barista with a crush, a wealthy executive afraid to fall in love, and a twist on fake boyfriends. Shipping Orders is a full length, standalone novel in the Valentine’s Inc. multi-author series.
