Someone wants me dead.  Worse yet, my link to Spirit is dying. Why? Because Exos has been taken by a new enemy. Now I have to rely on my other elements to find my missing link before it’s too late.  Oh, and I need a guard to protect me while I learn how to defend myself. No big deal. Master the elements, find my lost Spirit, and identify the bad guy.  Yeah. Easy.  Except Titus is tired of playing by the rules of others. Vox just wants to be friends. Sol is pissing everyone off.  And Cyrus, well, he’s a force of nature and very much in charge.  I’d better solve this puzzle quickly before my heart starts making choices on my behalf. Because all these fae are beautiful, cunning, and perfect in their own ways.  But how can I feel complete without my Spirit?  The hunt is on, and whoever is out to hurt me and mine will pay.  Note: This is a medium burn reverse harem paranormal romance, and book two of the Elemental Fae Academy trilogy.
