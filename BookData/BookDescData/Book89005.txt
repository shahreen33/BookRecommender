  A Steamy office romance
  Jade The job is exactly what I want. I know I can do it well. I'm excited until the woman at the agency says there's no point applying since, the essential but unspoken qualifications are being either married, or middle-aged, and I'm neither. Apparently, Luke Remington, the CEO is a workaholic who's sick of having his young secretaries fall in love with him and lose concentration on their job. Turns out unattractiveness is considered a bonus since he didn't want to be distracted either. But I'm not giving up that easy. I convince the agency to send me for the interview. I ditch my cosmetics, invest in a cheap wedding ring, put on some dowdy clothes. For good measure, I add a pair of ugly glasses, pull my hair into an unflattering bun, and voila. Married and unattractive. Yeah, I got the job, Oh, and guess what? I now understand why the other secretaries couldn't concentrate on this job. Luke Remington...the hottest CEO alive   Luke My new secretary is super-efficient, but even better she doesn’t fawn over me. I guess she could be attractive, but she doesn’t make much of herself. The woman is still wearing coke bottle glasses and her fashion choices might look better as curtains. Well, not my problem. We’ve just arrived for a conference in Thailand. If I’m really hot I could potentially cut a couple of big ticket deals at the same time. Jade made all the arrangements, and so far, so good. Then I hear a scream coming from the room next door. Her room. I rush in through the connecting door and she’s in the bathroom. Yeah, I see the massive spider. But that's the least of my problems. Jade is in a towel. Without her thick glasses. Or her granny clothes. And her long thick hair is loose and tumbling down her silky back. Damn, the agency screwed up after all. I’m so f**ked!
