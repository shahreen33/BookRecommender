Cold. Callous. Cocky.A total playboy with abs for days, a panty-melting smirk, and a face the gods themselves would be jealous of.And he’s my new boss.None of that matters, because as a single mom, men like Alexander Harding are the last thing I need. What I do need is this job, so I’m going to keep my head down, work hard, and avoid that asshole as much as humanly possible.But then he gives me an offer I can’t refuse, even though everything inside of me is warning me to run away and never look back.It’s just one weekend.One weekend to convince a potential client that Alexander has changed from the player who spent more time in the bedroom than the boardroom into a family man they’d be happy to go into business with.But the more time I spend with him, the more I realize that there might be a beating heart buried under his designer shirts and spectacular pecs after all…which is bad news for me.Because the only thing worse than hating your boss is falling in love with him.
