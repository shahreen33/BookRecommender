For optimum probiotic nutrition, it's time to say goodbye to supplements and pills and to bring all-natural, all-delicious, real-food probiotic (and prebiotic) meals into your life. Doctors and nutritionists firmly agree that probiotics are essential for everyday health and nutrition. Probiotics add "good bacteria" to the human gut. They crowd out "bad bacteria" and foster the absorption of nutrients through the intestinal walls. Everyone needs probiotics, just as they also need prebiotics, which make probiotics work. Probiotics also aid in the relief of chronic health issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), as well as all kinds of occasional belly discomfort. They have anti-inflammatory properties, too.Kelli Foster's The Probiotic Kitchen makes probiotic cooking easier and tastier than it's ever been before.
