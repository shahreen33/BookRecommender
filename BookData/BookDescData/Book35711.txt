  Every story has a hero. Devin O'Leary was mine.
Everybody has a dream,And mine could take me far.Just me, and my voice,A stage, and this guitar.With patience and some luck,I could see me, standing there.But, that was before I met her-The girl with the purple hair.Enchanted by her beauty,By her soul, and then, her eyes.I saw the broken girl within,And my dream became her life.So, I found myself on a journey,Of tragedy and letting go,Of happiness and daisies,Of serenades and Poe.But no one taught us how to cope,With life's unpredictable scheme.Still, I'm the hero in her story,And she's my only dream.
