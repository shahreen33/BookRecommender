One look.Just like that.That’s all it takes for me to know I wanted Ava for more than one night. She takes a single look at me and only sees a player. The young, single mom doesn’t give her trust easily. Convincing her I want more than a one night stand is the best thing I’ve ever done until it all crashes down around me. As I’m framed for crimes I didn’t commit, I fight to prove my innocence and battle to convince Ava and her daughter to stay.When the stakes rise, will I be able to prove my vow of devotion?
