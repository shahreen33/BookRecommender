When a newly single girl like me decides to play the field, what’s better than one big, sexy, rough-and-tumble professional football player? How about two of them?Cameron and Nixon have been best friends for years, and now I’ve found myself in the middle of them. Literally. The two cocky wide receivers compete over everything – who kisses me better, who can last longer, who has the biggest…well, you get the point. At first, it’s all fun and games, until I start to fall for both of them. Hard. But I’m just not the type of girl who sleeps with two men at the same time. I would rather walk away from both rather than end up hurting one of them. The problem is, I’m pretty sure that decision is out of my hands.
