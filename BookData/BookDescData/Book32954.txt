I gaze out the frosty window, watching in fascination as my breath creates a pale fog along the glass.You love the snow.You love the holidays.You especially love Christmas morning.I think about you all the time, but never so much as I have the past few days. December is always hard because everything reminds me of you. The frozen river where we like to skate. The hot chocolate we love to drink. The glittering lights on the tree that you can't wait to decorate.I see you everywhere.It's the sweetest torture.
