The sequel to the wildly popular romantic comedy SINGLE DAD ON TOP has arrived.My bride-to-be Arianna wants to meet my parents.But...they live in a trailer. Dad thinks Playboy T-shirts are classy because the naked women are silhouettes. Mom has a tattoo of a dog humping a palm tree. I don't think either one has said a sentence without an f-bomb since 1985.I changed my name a long time ago. Started a new life with a clean slate and never looked back.I don't know how to mend that bridge.Or why there's a pig-on-a-spit at their surprise engagement party.Or how Arianna and I ended up wearing matching "Ball and Chain" bride and groom shirts.But you don't get to choose your parents.And in my family, crazy is definitely relative.___While Single Dad Plus One could probably stand alone, a lot of the humor builds on book one, Single Dad on Top. We recommend reading them in order.
