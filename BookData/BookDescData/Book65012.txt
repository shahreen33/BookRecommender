The story follows an astronaut and his canine companion as they drive an old pickup through Rocket Town, passing all manner of space craft like a taxi rocket, a police rocket, a school bus rocket, and even a rocket that looks like a shark.Each colorful spread is bursting with an eye-dazzling array of rockets from big to small, fast to slow, practical to extremely silly. Our intrepid astronaut and his dog then get into their favorite rocket (a pickup truck-shaped rocket of course!), and the final count down and blast off is sure to thrill young readers.
