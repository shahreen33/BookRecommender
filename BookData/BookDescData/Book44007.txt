A reality TV show starring a clone of Jesus Christ causes chaos across the U.S. of the near future in PUNK ROCK JESUS, a new graphic novel written and drawn by Sean Murphy, the acclaimed illustrator of JOE THE BARBARIAN and AMERICAN VAMPIRE.J2 causes both outrage and adulation. Religious zealots either love or hate the show, angry politicians worry about its influence on the nation, and members of the scientific community fear the implications of cloning a human being at all, let alone the Son of God.Thomas McKael is the clones's bodyguard and former IRA operative, who despite his turbulent past is hired to protect the new Jesusâ€”a baby who captivates the world, but grows up to become an angry teenager.When falling ratings force the network to cut Jesus's mother from the series the young star runs away, renounces his religious heritage and forms a punk rock band. And what starts off as babysitting for Thomas becomes an epic battle, as Jesus goes to war against the corporate media complex that created him.Along with his artistic credits on JOE THE BARBARIAN and AMERICAN VAMPIRE: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST, Murphy also wrote and illustrated the graphic novel OFF ROAD (Oni Press), and cowrote OUTER ORBIT (Dark Horse Comics).
