The third zippy and zany tale by Pamela Butchart sees Izzy and her friends plunged into more primary-school craziness. This time, they decide that their new head teacher is a vampire rat, based on his being slightly scary, having the blinds drawn in his office during the day and the fact he's banned garlic bread at lunchtimes. Now they just have to come up with a plan to vanquish him... Readers of all ages love these books but they really strike a chord with 7 -9 year olds, who firmly believe that every hilarious thing that happens could happen to them too!
