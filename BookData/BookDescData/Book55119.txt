All the Hidden Truths is the story of a tragic shooting at an Edinburgh college and its aftermath. It is narrated by three women at the heart of the story - the mother of a victim and the mother of the shooter, and DI Helen Birch who is tasked in solving the case. The book is both a "knotty crime novel" and a story of grief "trying to make sense of something that defies reason".Readers of Kate Atkinson, Denise Mina and Susie Steiner will love it â€“ along with anyone who wants their fiction both moving and gripping.
