In 1992, Lois Duncan, acclaimed author of fictional suspense novels, wrote a horror story she could never have imagined writing—a true account of the murder of her own daughter, Kaitlyn Arquette. Kait, 18, was shot to death as she drove home from a friend’s house on a Sunday evening in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Police closed the unsolved case as a “random shooting,” refusing to accept information that indicated otherwise, although it had all the earmarks of a professional hit.That first book, WHO KILLED MY DAUGHTER?, was Duncan’s desperate attempt to motivate informants and prevent the facts of Kait’s story from becoming buried. It turned out to accomplish much more than that.Duncan’s new book, ONE TO THE WOLVES: ON THE TRAIL OF A KILLER, is even more horrifying than its predecessor as new information poured in, the family ran for their lives, and their original suspicions turned out to be the tip of an iceberg so immense that Kait, herself, could not have known how dangerous the information was that she had been sitting on in order to protect a now-estranged boyfriend. Since Kait didn’t live to reveal it, her mother now does so in a book so intense and yet so painfully human that the reader will never forget it. All of the elements of a suspenseful mystery are here--intrigue, turns and twists, cover-ups, and page-turning action. The sobering fact is that, this time, the story isn’t fiction.Perhaps most chilling is the fact that the cover art is an etching of a wolf that Kait made when she was ten years old. Is it possible that, even then, she was having nightmares about the predator who would come for her eight years later? This is probably the only occasion when a murder victim was the cover artist for a book about her own murder.
