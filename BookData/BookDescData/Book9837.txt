What defines justified transgressions? No two people will agree on what is acceptable, moral, right, wrong, deserving, heroic, or criminal in Eliot and that is what pushes us to truly look inside our own souls. Do you see the actions of the vigilante killer set on revenge, the drug dealer just trying to survive, or the cop trying to preserve his legacy as justified, or is it all just excuses to mask our own hidden understanding that very little separates sanity and psychosis?Eliot was written by an actively serving Baltimore Police Department Officer. It doesn't get any more real than that.Eliot lets you into the mind of a killer and the real world of police on the streets.Give Eliot a try, you will not be disappointed.There is also a website with extras to enhance the experience.http://www.michaelawoodjr.com
