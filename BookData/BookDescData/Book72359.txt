Cover Reveal: March 12, 2019Release: March 21-25, 2019Six years. That’s how long I was able to stay away. To ignore the call back home. I could’ve stayed away longer. Could’ve stayed away forever, but I came back for someone who’s now gone. Leaving me alone. I thought it’d be safe. That I’d be okay back in a city that’s always felt more like my prison, but then he took notice. Noah Kincaid. My tormentor, my first crush. My devil. And he’s not only after me. Something was taken from him. Something he requires my help with to get back. Six years ago, I left this city unscathed by the man who ruled my teenage angst. Now? I don’t think I’ll be as lucky.
