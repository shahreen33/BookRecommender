On the run from the FBI.Targeted by a murderous cult.Labeled a cyber-terrorist by the media.Irritated texts from his best friend.Eye contact with a nice-looking guy on the train.Aidan has a lot to deal with, and he's not quite sure which takes top priority.Finding himself alone in a posh New York City hotel room for the night, Aidan does what any red-blooded seventeen-year-old would do---he tries to hook up with someone new. But that lapse in judgement leads to him waking up next to a dead guy, which sparks an epic case of mistaken identity that puts Aidan on the run from everyone---faceless federal agents, his eccentric family, and, naturally, a cyber-terrorist group who will stop at nothing to find him.He soon realizes the only way to stop the chase is to deliver the object everyone wants, before he gets caught or killed. But for Aidan, the hardest part is knowing who he can trust not to betray him---including himself.
