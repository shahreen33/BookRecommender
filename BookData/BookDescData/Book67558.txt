Dragon shifters have a horrific habit of kidnapping human children to sacrifice to their goddess.  They miscalculated when they took expert thief Yara Parmstone’s little brother, though. Now, Yara is out for revenge—after she finds the final key that will allow her to save him.  But the three scorching hot, mysterious men who hold that key have a message for Yara—the dragon goddess has something important in store for her.  Too bad it’s not as fun as a forked dragon tongue.
