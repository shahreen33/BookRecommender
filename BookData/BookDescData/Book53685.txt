 I met her among the chaos of a gang fight - one that I inadvertently started.  Ember.  Beautiful, feisty, and passionate. And the sister of Mercy, an infamous assassin.We fell for each other, hard. Until forces outside of our control intervened.  Now, she's a prisoner, doing everything she can to keep her family safe. And I'm her guard, doing everything I can to set her free.  I'd take a bullet for her. Hell, I'd take a few.  In this dark, twisted world, we only have each other. I'd take a bullet for her. Hell, I'd take a few. But I have to wonder, is that enough?
