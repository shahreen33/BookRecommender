Jean White, recently widowed, traveling in Europe alone for the first time in her life, feels she is blossoming in a way she hasn't since she was a young woman. Back then, she was a smart, feisty girl who landed a spot on War Stories, one of the hottest literary reviews in the nation. Her straitlaced military family didn't envision a stint as a war correspondent as the proper venue for their well-protected daughter, and much preferred that she settle down with someone reliable, like Al White. And so she does, but not before she lives just a little... Diane, her daughter, is a woman in the middle in every way, juggling her growing jewelry business with the demands of her husband and children with admirable aplomb... until the day the FBI comes knocking on their door, asking about her mother... Julia, Diane's daughter and a student at the prestigious Gressex Academy, has a secret of her own. She has fallen in love with Sam Weyborn - with a passion only possible when one is eighteen. Nothing matters more than being with him, and she's willing - despite her mother's deep concern - to risk everything to be with him forever. Three generations of women - grandmother, mother, daughter - each at a turning point, each linked by the secrets they discover about themselves and each other, secrets that reach back to the days of World War II and some of the most exciting times of this century. For each, the process of discovery will be an unforgettable one - dramatic, heart-wrenching, but ultimately healing - and one that will bring them together in a way nothing before in their lives has. Not since her classic Three Women at the Water's Edge has Nancy Thayer created a generational novel this memorable. Whether you're just discovering Nancy Thayer or have been a devoted reader for years, Family Secrets is a richly textured, wholly adsorbing story that will ring true for women of all ages.
