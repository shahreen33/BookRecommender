  Haunted art is in the eye of the beholder . . .
Artist Celeste Cabot welcomes the chance to show her paintings at a craft fair in her hometown of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, where she and her Chihuahua, Van Gogh, can park her vintage Shasta trailer and sell her creations, too.Unfortunately, her sales take a hit when a customer returns a painting, claiming it's haunted. When a fellow vendor discovers images hidden in Celeste's artwork--and a ghost pays her a late-night visit--she's shocked to realize she has psychic abilities. After the grumpy manager of the craft fair is found with a knife in his neck, Celeste's brushes with the paranormal may help fill in the picture--and make sure the wrong person doesn't get framed . . .
