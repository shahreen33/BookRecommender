This college jock is a total player. He’s used to getting who and what he wants. Until her. . . KatrinaThe hottest guy on campus won’t stop asking me out. I know that sounds like a good problem to have, but this guy… this guy has no idea how complicated my life is trying to juggle being a single mom and college student.Every Thursday, he shows up at the café where I work.

I know, I know, that sounds presumptuous, but this girl… this girl has gotten under my skin, and I can’t seem to walk away.Every Thursday, I show up at the café where she works.
