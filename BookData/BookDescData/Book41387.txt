Read by the author.The "New York Times" bestselling author of "Nickel and Dimed" returns with a powerful memoir of her quest, beginning in childhood, to discover the truth about the universe and everything else.In middle age, Barbara Ehrenreich came across the journal she had kept during her tumultuous adolescence and set out to reconstruct that quest, which had taken her to the study of science and through a cataclysmic series of uncanny or as she later learned to call them, mystical experiences. A staunch atheist and rationalist, she is profoundly shaken by the implications of her lifelong search.Part memoir, part philosophical and spiritual inquiry, "Living with a Wild God" brings an older woman s wry and erudite perspective to a young girl s uninhibited musings on the questions that, at one point or another, torment us all. Certain to be a classic, "Living with a Wild God" combines intellectual rigor with a frank account of the inexplicable, in Ehrenreich s singular voice, to produce a true literary achievement.
