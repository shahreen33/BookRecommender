But soon, Manning makes some startling discoveries. Nolan's body is found with a bullet hole in his back, and the last interview with Zarnik is missing. Now, the story is no longer a matter of metaphysics, but of murder. And to complicate matters, Manning's young, new assistant is haunting is days and dreams. Together, they're determined to find the truth about Nolan's death. . .and the inevitable, damning piece of evidence that the killer will do anything to destroy -- even it means committing murder again.
