What would you do for someone you love? Would you lie? Would you leave? Would you kill? When Jamie MacDonald arrives at the police station with the body of his wife and the confession that he killed her, he is placed under arrest, and a small Massachusetts town grapples with the questions raised by the act. Is it murder to kill a terminally ill person who begs you to do so? Mercy explores this highly charged emotional and ethical issue in a novel that is as haunting as it is beautiful.
