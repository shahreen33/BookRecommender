Year 2 of Raven’s quest for Love and Revenge begins!  With the whole crew back together in one piece, it’s time for a celebration.  But some of the crew have ulterior motives for this party and they’ll take a romantic twist!  What no one expects is the party to be cut short by an attack that will tear some relationships apart, push others closer together, and leave our crew one lady short.
