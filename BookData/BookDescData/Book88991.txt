I was supposed to keep my hands off her. But I put a baby in her. If word gets out, both of our careers will be ruined. She decided to leave town so no one would find out. She thought she should keep it a secret even from me. But, just like when I took her innocence, I always take what I want and claim what's mine. So I vow to find her, and protect them both. 
  But will the stakes be too high for our love to last?
