Many, many years ago, a ninja named Kagetora devoted his life to protecting Princess Beni (Beni-Hime). Unfortunately, they were attacked and Kagetora was flung into a lake, where he sank to the bottom. He was somehow warped at the future where he saw the princess Beni being threatened. Little does Kagetora know that Beni is not the real princess, but she is, in fact, the descendant of her. Beni, on the other hand, thought that Kagetora was just a cosplayer. She is the daughter of a rich man and because of that, she has been kidnapped a hundred times already, but fear not because Kagetora is now here. Will Kagetora be able to go back to the past, or will he remain by Beni's side forever?
