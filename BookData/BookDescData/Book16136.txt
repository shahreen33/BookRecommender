Can a cool reputation really deliver on promises of happiness?Nick’s got problems. He's a social outcast who dreams of being popular, he’s an easy target for bullies, and he doesn't understand why he's just not attracted to girls. So, after a series of misunderstandings label him a troublemaker on his first day of high school, he’s really stoked to have Jesse Gaston and his gang take him in.Jesse starts a PR campaign around campus to give Nick a new image, and the shy loser soon finds himself transformed into an anti-establishment hero. While Nick would rather explore his growing attraction to Bobby Warren, he’s forced to fend off would-be girlfriends and struggles with the demands of acting cool. And things at home are spinning out of control as the Vietnam War’s destructive impact threatens to change his life forever.Nick's story is both humorous and haunting–a journey of ridiculous misadventures, unexpected psychedelic explorations, and tragic turns of fate. Can a world still reeling from the sexual revolution and the illicit pleasures of marijuana and underage drinking accept two boys in love? Can Nick and Bobby's relationship survive a hostile time when acid rock rules, status is everything, and being gay is the last taboo?Newly revised edition; complete and unabridged.Seasons of Chadham High explores the evolving experience of gay teenagers in different eras from the counter-cultural sixties, through the me generation seventies and eighties, to the jaded nihilistic nineties, and beyond.
