There are many who feel that Leviticus is a dry, dull, and boring book. That is not so. The gospel is the life, the teachings, and the cross of Jesus, the Son of God. The only way that a person in this present age can have the forgiveness of sin and peace with God is through the gospel of Jesus the Son of God. The gospel is not dull and boring. It is the most read, the most cherished, the most translated, and the most published literature in the entire world. However, the Law of Moses, and the Levitical sacrifices that were part of that law, was the gospel of the Israelites. It was through the Law of Moses and the Levitical sacrifices that a person who lived before Christ could have the forgiveness of sin and peace with God, and therefore it cannot be dull and boring.This book is intended to make the book of Leviticus a living book and a very interesting Bible study. It will open up the Levitical letter and make it interesting by making it easy to understand. The book itself is easy to read and understand. It is written in a way that is quite reasonable-in other words, it just makes sense. The purpose of this book is to give a portrayal of the Levitical sacrificial system, what the sacrifices meant to the worshipper who offered them, their purpose, what they accomplished, how God viewed them, and how they were fulfilled in Christ. That is all accomplished by very careful scriptural references that establish the points that are made in the book. When a person understands why there were so many different sacrifices such as the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the guilt offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, and others-and then he sees that each one of those sacrifices served a different purpose and they were all fulfilled in Christ is different ways, Leviticus becomes a book that you just cannot put down.
