When my old friend Jim Walker asks me to fly up to Canada and take a look at a strange murder case, it sounds like a good excuse for barbecue and brewskis.  But the party gets crashed by a pit-load of demons and things take a turn for the worse. Throw a faerie queen and a couple of ancient vampires into the mix and you’ve got a recipe for disaster.  Time to sharpen the stakes and start slaying the undead.  Because if you gaze long into a vampire’s eyes, the vampire gazes also into you.  Then it glamors you. And kills you.
