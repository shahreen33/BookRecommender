We consider this extraordinary story a classic, and certainly the best science fiction story so far for 1926. How large can insects grow? Is there any limit to their size? Frankly, no one knows. We have almost microscopically small flies, and in some of the tropical countries we have some almost as large as the fist. It is possible to have still larger flies, and could monstrous flies such as are depicted in this story, be bred at some future date. The author of this brilliant tale evidently thinks so. Anyway, we trust he is mistaken, as we should not like to meet such monsters. The science of entomology presented in this story is excellent, and will arouse your imagination. It is a pleasure to publish this new, high quality, and affordable edition of this timeless story.
