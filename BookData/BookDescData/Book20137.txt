Written as part of Kris 'n' Good Books' 'choose your own m/m story' challenge. This is now hosted by Goodreads' M/M Romance Group. The story prompts for the author were: 1. the setting ~ an abandoned stone tower... or is it...2. some background to one of the main protags ~ one wishes the seven guys he lived with were more his type3. another character/s ~ a snarky side kick & a talking wand in her story4. a conflict ~ a dragon thinks the virgin hero would make a yummy meal 5. an object/phrase to be mentioned in the story somewhere ~ 'Where the fuck is a Fairy Godmother when you need one?'
