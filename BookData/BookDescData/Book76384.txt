This is the final book in the two-book duet. Book one must be read first.  One man thinks I'm a saint. The other thinks I'm a sinner. One man lives in the public eye. The other lurks in the shadows. One man wants to use me for his own needs. The other wants to use me for his revenge.  One man will get what's coming to him. The other will get what he deserves.  They told me good girls get rewarded. But I've been bad. Very bad.  I made a deal with The Devil...and I liked it.   Please note: This story contains content that may be offensive to some readers.
