1395It has been six years since Gregory Maudesley, sword-for-hire turned baron, unmasked a plot to assassinate the king. Despite saving Richard's life, his friendship with the king has never entirely recovered from the shards of Richard's distrust and autocracy. Since the Merciless Parliament, in 1388, England has enjoyed a period of peace. But an unfavourable end to the war with France and an alliance with Charles VI threatens to set the Duke of Gloucester and many of the lords against the king once more. But Richard is no longer a boy, nor a petulant young man. With his cousin, Henry Bolingbroke, safely exiled, the king begins a campaign of revenge and tyranny. The realm stands on the brink of civil war. Torn between the duty he owes an increasingly erratic king and a deep sense of what is right, Gregory must risk everything he holds dear and face his most difficult test of loyalty yet. Henry will return and Gregory will be forced to make a fatal choice.The knight will be compelled to draw his sword once more.
