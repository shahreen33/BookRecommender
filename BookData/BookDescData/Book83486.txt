Marathon and Half Marathon Training, One-Day-a-Week (It Can Be Done) describes a two-year running challenge completed by the author. The challenge was to determine if someone could successfully complete multiple marathons and half marathons during a two-year timeframe while training only one day per week. Learn if this training method might right for you and how the author came up with this idea and why. This book reveals how the author determined that marathon and half marathon training one-day-a-week is probably viable for many runners by going out and doing it over a two-year timeframe. It describes the author's varying experiments throughout with weekly mileage amounts and what the effects were physically, and during actual races. There are descriptions of the author's experiences during the races completed during this timeframe and impressions of previous races he has completed. There is practical advice from an experienced marathon and half marathon runner for those who have never completed one or either race distances. If you are not a marathon of half marathon runner, or are new to this type of running, there is also advice for how to strategize training for, and completing a race. If you enjoy running non-competitively, are otherwise fit, and have limited time to train extensively for a marathon or half marathon, this book might be for you. Even if you are not a runner in any way and are simply curious about what a marathon runner's life is like, you also might enjoy this book.
