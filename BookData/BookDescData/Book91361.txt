Toni Owens is at a crossroads. Divorced, low on funds, and unhappy with where she's at in life, she decides to buy a lodge in the mountains and start over. When she arrives at her new home, she finds the grand lodge is a run-down mess. To make matters worse, she finds the one person she's connected with standing over a dead body on her first full day in town. Now, Toni needs to find a way to clear her new friend of murder while searching for a job and figuring out what to do with the lodge she'd pinned her dreams on. Throw in a goofy dog who needs a home, a ghost reluctant to share his space, and a handsome neighbor eager to help her rebuild, and she's got her hands full. Determined to make her fresh start a success, she rolls up her sleeves and gets to work, but will it be enough? This is the first book in the Haunted Lodge Cozy Mystery series.
