A brand new contemporary romance from New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today bestselling author Katy Evans.  It started as a game. We flirted. We played. Most importantly—we won. Then I discovered who he was: Gambler. Famous playboy. Silver-eyed player who never plays to lose. …And my best friend’s soon-to-be brother in law, Cullen Carmichael. He needed a good luck charm, I needed a distraction. So we made a gamble and set off for Vegas—but pretty soon—I was in too deep. My heart, soul, and body weren't supposed to be part of the deal. But somewhere between big wins and long nights, my house of cards started to tumble. What was this devil with those piercing eyes doing to me? I’d given up on love, but the wicked, all-in Cullen Carmichael was upping the ante and wouldn’t stop until he’d won it all.  *This book contains characters from the Manwhore series but can be read as a complete standalone.
