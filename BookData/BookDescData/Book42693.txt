An exclusive hotel on a tiny picturesque island seems to be the ideal retreat for Hercule Poirot from the stresses of criminal detection. But with the appearance of the beautiful Arlena Stuart, the quiet and peaceful atmosphere becomes charged with an indefinable erotic tension. And when she is found viciously strangled in a secluded cove, there are few, especially among the women, who seem to feel either surprise or regret. As Poirot follows a twisting path of bizarre and bewildering clues, his only certainties are that the solution lies within Arlena herself, and that there is evil under the sun.John Moffatt is Hercule Poirot in this BBC Radio 4 full-cast dramatization by Michael Bakewell with an all-star cast including Iain Glen, Fiona Fullerton, Robin Ellis, Wendy Craig, George Baker and Joan Littlewood.1/5 Can't a Belgian sleuth have a holiday in Devon without getting embroiled in a murder?2/5 When an American starlet is found dead, Poirot has a hotel full of suspects to investigate3/5 There are suspects-a-plenty, witchcraft and a love-letter for the sleuth to investigate.4/5 Hercule Poirot makes a chance discovery in a nearby cove.
