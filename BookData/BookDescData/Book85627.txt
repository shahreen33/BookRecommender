Walter Klein can't stop thinking about death. He wonders what would happen if he stuck a knife in his toaster. He wonders if his latest elevator ride will end in the cable snapping and everyone plummeting to their doom.He wonders if today will be the day he dies, but he knows it won't be from a toaster or an elevator. It will be from the cancer. He has refused treatment, and soon the cancer will take him away. When Walter finally passes on, after a painfully ordinary day full of a million little regrets, he has no idea what awaits him. Heâ€™ll be guided through the afterlife by Vincent, and as the two men make their way through different planes of existence and contemplate the true meanings of life and death, something surprising will happen.
