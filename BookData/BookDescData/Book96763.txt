So close but so far was an understatement when it came to her love life… Ever practical Claire Adams has been dealt an impossible blow, she’s lost her fiancé the night before their wedding, then shortly after, her unborn child. But for everyone else, it seems, life continues on, and with all the wedding and pregnancies in town, the aching hole in her heart continues to grow. Knowing she can’t be the only person suffering from loss, she starts a coping-through-art program at the new Archer Conservation Park of Cape Van Buren. She will never have the family of her dreams, but helping other’s overcome grief is the exact kind of distraction she needs. Until she finds herself working alongside the one man who reminds her exactly why remaining single is her best life strategy. When it comes to dating, Mitch Brennan has two simple rules: keep it casual but make every moment memorable. Only now, his life-of-the-party reputation isn’t making his run for the City Attorney’s seat easy. So he agrees to some pro bono work, consulting for the new Conservation Center—and he has one month to change people’s minds. Except escaping his playboy image is harder than he imagines, especially when he’s paired with the sexy event planner—who is in desperate need of a happy memory of her own. But one laugh leads to a kiss, and before he knows it, he realizes he’s broken his number one rule. Now the biggest risk of all isn’t losing out on the attorney seat, it’s losing her. Can two hearts terrified of love brave the waves or will fear keep them from reaching the shores of happy ever after?
