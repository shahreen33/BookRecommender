Warning: This book could change your ideas about history for ever!!Do you know why the Celts got the best girls? Or who had his portrait painted after he was dead? And have you any idea who planned the first Channel Tunnel? From the dawn of civilization to the end of the Second World War, it's all here in the factually accurate and hilariously funny Very Bloody History of Britain.Bizarre, barmy and almost beyond belief, you've never had a history lesson like it!
