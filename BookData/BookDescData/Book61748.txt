I know two things when I meet my new boss, Greyson Parker Montgomery III. One, he’s an egomaniac. And two, we’re going to get naked. Something I didn’t know? That I’d end up pregnant.  No one is more surprised by our off-the-charts chemistry than me. I’m a free spirit with a passion for design and a taste for the bohemian. Greyson is a cocky venture capitalist who’s as pretentious as his sharply cut power suits.  He owns half of Charleston, and has the other half at his beck and call. But the only place he owns me is in bed...or in the backseat of his car, boneless and begging for mercy.  We argue over contracts and costs all day long. Behind closed doors, however, we engage in a different kind of business. The kind that has me surrendering to his unique brand of dominance.  Our no-strings attached arrangement suits me just fine. Until I wake up one morning with what I think is a wicked hangover.  Only it’s not a hangover.  I thought Greyson was a typical “greed is good” grump. But when he demands to be involved in the life we accidentally created, I start to see a different side of him. One that’s more gentleman than jerk.Am I crazy to think we could be a family together? Or is making me fall for him just another one of his power plays?  SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN is a STANDALONE, full length, accidental pregnancy/enemies-to-lovers romance.
