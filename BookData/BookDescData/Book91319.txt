I never got involved in the dirt and the details of an investigation. I never let my preconceptions muddy a reconstruction. And I steadfastly refrained from ever allowing my past to dictate my future.At least until the one person I couldn’t lose went missing.Because then I’d relive every dark moment of my childhood, confront every heartbreak, and even sell my soul if that was what it took to get her back.Because I couldn’t accept a future — not even a promised one of immortality and unbridled power — that didn’t include one of the only two people I’d ever truly loved.--------------------This 76,000 word urban fantasy is the second book in the Reconstructionist Series by author Meghan Ciana Doidge. Author’s note: the ideal reading order of the Reconstructionist Series is after the first six books in the Dowser Series and the three books in the Oracle series, but it's not absolutely necessary to read the Dowser or the Oracle series before reading the Reconstructionist Series.
