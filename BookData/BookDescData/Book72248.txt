THE CITY: [un]poems, thoughts, rhymes &amp; miscellany is A.D. Carson's first collection--carefully crafted poems, lyrics, and narratives that mirror the realities of the city's life. Not only a meditation on the sometimes grave circumstances faced by those living within its limits, THE CITY offers glimpses of hope in places where it's most needed and seldom seen.
