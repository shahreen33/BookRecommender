The Canterbury Tales is a collection of 24 stories written in Middle English by Geoffrey Chaucer. They were written at the end of the 14th century; given mostly in verse, (although a number of them are in prose) they are told as part of a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims during their travel on a journey to the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. This is a reprint of a book published before 1923. This book may have occasional imperfections such as errant marks, etc. that were either part of the original writing. We believe this work is culturally important, and despite the imperfections, have elected to bring it back to you due to its value.
