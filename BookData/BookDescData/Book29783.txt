Fans of The Raven Cycle and The Haunting of Hill House will devour this diverse paranormal romance novella from the author of "Hosanna Americana"!  It takes a lot of commitment to make a marriage between a modern ceremonial magician and a chaos witch work, but when a malevolent entity takes up residence in Rhys and Moiraâ€™s home, their love will be pushed to the limits. Brewing up a solution is easier said than done when your magical styles are polar opposites; throw a psychic ex and a secret society in the mix, and things are bound to get messy.
