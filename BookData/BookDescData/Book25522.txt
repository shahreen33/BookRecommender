Stretching from the Oregon border to the Baja peninsula, the California Coast ecoregion (ecoregions are geographical areas that share similar natural features and cultural history) is known for mild, Mediterranean-like weather. This book gathers stories, poems, and essays chosen because they feature the natural heritage of the region and because kids often are the protagonists. A book in the acclaimed Stories from Where We Live series, "The California Coast" includes pieces both historical and contemporary and many contributions from ethnic groups. Individual pieces tell of gold rush fortunes, Wells Fargo stagecoach "whips," and surfers who brave the sharks in the "Red Triangle." They recall a Native American woman who survived for eighteen years alone on an island and the "Pigeon Express" that carried mail to the Channel Islands in the days before radio. There are pieces about seals and sea otters, foxes amidst the dry chaparral, redwoods and the La Brea tar pits. The book includes information about the region’s habitats and a list of natural areas to visit. Divided into four sections—Adventures, Great Places, Reapers and Sowers, and Wild Lives—this book is a wonderfully imaginative way to get to know the natural life of the California Coast.
