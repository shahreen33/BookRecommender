Three heros, three rescues, three weddings.You are cordially invited to the wedding of Miss Heather Cynster...but not before she encounters kidnappers, danger, and a daring rescue at the hands of Viscount Breckenridge.Determined to hunt down her very own hero, one who will sweep her off her feet and into wedded bliss, and despairing of finding him in London's staid ballrooms, Heather Cynster steps out of her safe world and boldly attends a racy soiree.But her promising hunt is ruined by the supremely interfering Viscount Breckenridge, who whisks her out of scandal-and straight into danger when a mysterious enemy seizes her, bundles her into a coach, and conveys her out of London.Now it's up to the notorious Breckenridge to prove himself the hero she's been searching for all along...
