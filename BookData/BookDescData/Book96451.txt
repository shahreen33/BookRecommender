Rebecca ‘Beck’ Anderson is in Damon’s mountains for one thing: to improve public relations between shifters and humans. She has a heap of reasons the shifter rights vote has to go their way, but when she meets her driver, Mason Croy, the sexy boar shifter is adding one more. Mason is smokin’ hot, and just her type if she wasn’t reeling from a divorce that has left her drained. Even if her heart was open to moving on, Mason is dealing with things she can’t understand. Brawling publicly to escape his pain seems to be the beast boar’s go-to method of therapy, but he’s making her job as shifter publicist harder as he spirals out of control. All she needs to do is keep her head down, and work for that pretty salary Damon has promised her, but Mason is a mystery she becomes desperate to solve. He’s wrecking those walls she’s constructed around her heart one by one, but the more she gets to know him, the more she realizes Mason’s past could be the death of her.  Mason Croy has been doing a bang-up job of hiding from his past in Damon’s mountains but now it’s coming back to haunt him, and his boar is on a tear. All he wants is to be left alone to spiral, but now the beautiful publicist he’s been hired to drive around has him wishing he could be a better man. He hasn’t paired up with a mate for a reason. Not only is Beck’s interest in him dangerous for her, but she’s conjuring a destiny he just can’t escape—one that could bring destruction to all the people he cares about.  Dragons, boars, and bears, oh my! Don’t miss the thrilling fourth book of T. S. Joyce’s bestselling Boarlander Bears series.
