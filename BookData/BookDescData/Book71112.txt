Cage McCann and Carrie Miller go way back. As kids, they meant everything to each other. But Cage left town years ago to escape his future as leader of the local motorcycle gang, the Aces, and though he promised to come back, Carrie has given up on seeing him again. Until he shows up at her bar and pulls her into a sensuous, soul-shaking kiss and back into his life, which is currently full of danger and secrets beyond what Carrie can imagine.  Cage has never forgotten Carrie. After serving in the special forces and then starting up a private security company, he has just been waiting for the right time to go back, claim her as his…and tell her that the man she has always loved can actually shift into a bear. But when Carrie is in danger from the very biker gang he tried to escape, Cage drops everything to protect her. The only problem? In order to make sure she is never in danger again, he has to go undercover as an Ace.  Making Carrie fall in love with him while wearing Ace leather isn’t going to be easy, but if Cage blows his cover, he risks losing his chance to rid the town of the Aces once and for all. Now Cage will just have to prove that the Aces may be bad to the bone, but Cage is bear to the bone, and no one messes with what a bear holds dear.
