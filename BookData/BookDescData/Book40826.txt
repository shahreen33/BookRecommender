When life has shown you death, can you bring yourself to love again? Eli Todd is a tall, handsome Captain of a wagon train bound for Oregon. Life has taught him if he allows people into his heart, he ends up losing them. Amelia Cruthers is a pretty young woman with a limp. She’s a hard worker who starts out the trip to Oregon with her parents, until they try to leave her behind. In shock, she watches them cross a river by ferry without her. Thankfully the kind, strong Eli Todd takes her with him. Admiring her spunk and work ethic he gives her a job cooking for the crew. After a fall from his horse, Amelia tends him and he realizes she is sweetness on earth. Her parents demand he marry Amelia since she spent time alone with him, nursing him. Eli figures why not? He won’t be home most of the year anyway and Amelia could have a safe place to live on his ranch. What could possibly go wrong? Amelia never thought to be married. She’d been told her hip was too hideous for a man to look upon and that she couldn’t have children. Knowing that she could never be a real wife, the love she begins to feel for Eli frightens her. The distance they try to place between them doesn’t work leaving them both hurt with longings that could never be fulfilled. But there are secrets and when they realize they’d been lied to; do they take the leap at a lifetime to share?
