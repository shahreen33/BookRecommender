"The Storytellers" are baseball s play-by-play and color men who have created the legends and lore of the game. From the days of static-filled radio broadcasts to today's internationally televised games, baseball has been shaped into America s pastime by these wizards of the microphone. Assembled in this terrific collection, these great announcers from all over the country share with us some of their favorite stories about the job - their best games, most admired players, preferred parks, biggest flubs and more. With their unique styles of speech, cadences, and catch phrases, these broadcasters have become our friends at the ballpark conveying the excitement, celebrating the victories, and commiserating on the defeats. Baseball fans of all ages and from the East coast to the West coast will enjoy welcoming these ballpark friends into their homes once again. "The Storytellers" will be released in an audio version in Spring 1997.
