Alternate cover edition of: ISBN 9781939274007Rock star Chad Evans's tortured past hides just beneath the surface. Even fans screaming out his name in ecstasy can't drown out the screams of his childhood. He can usually keep it under control, but not always. Tonight the alcohol doesn't seem to soothe. Part of the crowd, Beth Donovan smiles, really enjoying herself for a change. But her smile isn't usually this bright. It is the kind of smile that masks sorrow. Three years just isn't long enough to get over losing Paul. When a vicious attack behind stage brings this unlikely pair together, something changes inside of them both. But can a jet-setting superstar and a Midwestern lunch lady ever manage a real relationship? And even if they can, will the person sending Chad death threats take it all away? Or is it their fate to remain forever trapped under ice?
