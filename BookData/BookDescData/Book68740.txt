"I just can't be a mother today."These words have been whispered to God in quiet desperation by mothers who love their children to the depths of their soul, but who are struggling with how hard motherhood is.Motherhood turns you inside out. Sometimes you feel overwhelmed by how tired you feel; the days go on and on, and you want to be a "good" mom, but you feel like a failure so much of the time. What happened to all your ideals? When did you end up feeling so...lost?Sarah Mae and Sally Clarkson have been to the edge and back. "Desperate" is the story of one young mother's trials and one experienced mentor's priceless exhortations. "Desperate" is not a book about despair, nor is it a rule-laden mothering manual. It is a bouquet from a friend who has been there, reminding us that we are not alone. Sarah Mae's unvarnished account of her own struggles mothering three feisty young children is a lesson in learning patience, loving idiosyncrasies, accepting help, and--most of all--leaning on God.Each chapter includes a brief Bible study with journal exercises to help you find your own quiet center, and get you back into the fray soul-filled and refreshed. Written with candor, empathy, and faith, "Desperate "is like coffee with a trusted girlfriend; one who knows how hard being a mother can be, and how to navigate the often turbulent road.
