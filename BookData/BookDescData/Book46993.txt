Carrie Fisher's first novel is set within the world she knows better than anyone else: Hollywood, the all-too-real fantasyland of drug users and deal makers. This stunning literary debut chronicles Suzanne Vale's vivid, excruciatingly funny experiences---from the rehab clinic to life in the outside world. Sparked by Suzanne's---and Carrie's---deliciously wry sense of the absurd, Postcards from the Edge is a revealing look at the dangers and delights of all our addictions, from success and money to sex and insecurity.
