Who was the first king of ancient Egypt - and who was the last? Which Egyptian queens ruled in their own right? What do we really know about the 170 or more pharaohs whose names have come down to us? Chronicle of the Pharaohs is the first book to set down in narrative form, using timelines and other visual aids throughout, all the rulers and dynasties of Egypt in their chronological order. Now no one need be in any doubt as to who came first, Tutankhamun or Ramesses the Great, or which pharaohs built the pyramids, and when: the Chronicle provides the answers. The biographical portraits of each pharaoh build into a comprehensive and immensely readable history of ancient Egypt, brought to life through the exploits and personalities of her rulers. From Narmer, who first united the lands along the Nile, to Cleopatra some 3000 years later, we see the way in which individual pharaohs helped to shape Egyptian civilization, and were themselves shaped by it. The narrative is supplemented by specially drawn cartouches of each pharaoh and translations of their names. Chronicle of the Pharaohs is at once a book to be enjoyed as popular history, an essential work of reference, and a visual introduction to the extraordinary diversity and richness of an ancient civilization. Museum-goers, students, tourists and everyone fascinated by the world of ancient Egypt will want to make the Chronicle their inseparable companion.
