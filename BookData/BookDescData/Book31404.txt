 MicahConstantine Ross is a cocky, provoking little...yeah.And I swear, I'd think that even if his family's business wasn't my biggest competition.It's time someone taught the man a lesson or two about life.At least that's what I tell myself when I offer him a job.Call it my good deed for the year... maybe the century.But now he's in my shop.In my space.In my every damn thought.In. My. Bed. And how the hell am I supposed to resist him?ConstantineI'll be the first to admit I've royally screwed up, but what can I say?I was a stupid teen who lost his dad and spiraled out of control.Almost a decade later, I'm still trying to make amends.The last thing I need is my family's arch-nemesis wading into my life like he's got all the answers.Except... I really need money, and the arrogant jerk offered me a job.I can deal with Micah's attitude.My attraction to him? That's different.He's my boss, not my boyfriend.And he's way too old for me.But God, he's gorgeous.Dominant.Compelling.I don't want to want him...But I can't turn away.
