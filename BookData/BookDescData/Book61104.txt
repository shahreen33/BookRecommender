The shifter world is dying. At least, that’s how it looks to Hunter. Whole packs are losing the ability to change form and the talents of shifters are starting to sound like myth and legend. But Hunter can’t take on the problems of his world, not when his own troubles are much closer to home. When his uncle demands he choose a mate or be kicked out of the pack, Hunter knows there must be some way around it. He’s too young to settle down, especially not with someone he barely knows. And then he catches sight of an omega in a cage and comes up with a plan to help them both. Cade just wants to go home. He hadn’t planned on being abducted by wolves, locked in a cage, and forced into a mating. So much for shifter hospitality. When he catches the attention of Zane, a dangerous, unstable alpha, he knows he needs a champion. Enter Hunter, a dormant alpha shifter with a temper, who wants Cade for reasons the omega doesn’t understand. Cade is determined to make a break for it and escape to the safety of his den. But when Hunter risks everything for him, even his life, Cade can’t just turn his back on him. Not with his growing feelings for the alpha. Saving Hunter turns both their lives upside down, revealing a secret Cade has done his best to keep hidden; within the dens, the shifter world is very much alive.
