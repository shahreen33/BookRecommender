[Contains Episodes 038-060]When their continued search for the Knight Sisters' vanished mother takes them to the 'neutral' city-state of Cemetery, Damian and co. find themselves dragged kicking and screaming into a violent web of corporate interests, civil unrest, apocalyptic conspiracies, and political corruption.Even after two and a half weeks, none of them can get along for long. Jenny somehow managed to keep tensions down to a simmer between Damian and their other tag-alongs. So when a psychotic anarchist named Painkiller takes a comatose Jenny as a bargaining chip, Damian and co. are faced with an ultimatum: help Painkiller achieve his goal in manipulating the city-state's angry denizens into a catastrophic free-for-all frenzy, or lose the one person who kept them from killing each other. Damian doesn't want to run, because Jenny's older sister Aria will surely track him down and kill him. He doesn't want Jenny to die, but he doesn't want to go through the trouble of saving her, either.What's a guy to do?
