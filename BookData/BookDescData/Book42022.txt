It’s been said the eyes are the windows to the soul. What happens, however, when those windows crack? Tempe, Arizona resident Greg Gnops, is about to find out.When an accident involving sunlight and a telescope alters Greg’s vision, he suddenly finds himself with a strange new ability that drains psychic fragments of a person’s soul from their body, killing his victim in the process. Despite trying to hide behind a pair of sunglasses, the slightest naked glimpse activates his power. And the next available appointment for a visit with an optometrist is weeks away at the earliest.Meanwhile, Greg’s sister, Ashley, winds up spiraling out of control with a lack of a job, chronic drinking, and a boyfriend, Flint Kyles, who doesn’t seem the least bit interested in showing her any affection. When Ashley’s best friend, Dani Staras, beseeches Greg to help her persuade Ashley to leave Flint and regain some life stability, Greg’s efforts to lay low and avoid eye contact with people is thrown into peril.Torn between wanting to help his sister and trying to keep anyone else from falling victim to his lethal stare, Greg turns to Serenity Fleace, a psychic who may not be what she appears. Can Greg figure out a way to stop absorbing people’s minds, or will Ashley’s latest drinking episode jeopardize Greg and everyone around him before he can get to the eye doctor?
