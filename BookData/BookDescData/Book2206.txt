"Behind every good man is a good woman,ï¿½ the old saying goes. How can a wife help her husband grow and progress and be a priesthood leader in the home without criticizing, nagging, or making him feel like heï¿½s not measuring up? As a result of some wide reading, pondering, and research, John Bytheway attempts to answer that question in this book. With his trademark humor and unique insights, the author shares experiences from his own marriage, practical counsel from several marriage experts, and inspired statements from Church leaders. Simple tools such as ï¿½praising betimes with sharpnessï¿½ and ï¿½making requests with an exit strategyï¿½ will bless marriages and help husbands and wives fulfill their roles as they try to lead their families in the latter days.
