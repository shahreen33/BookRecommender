The second half of Angelic Layer picks up where we left offâ€”with Misaki and Hikaru in a desperate fight against Kaede and Blanche! But even getting out of the Layer intact means facing new rivals in the competition ahead . . . and facing the true, personal meaning of the game for Hikaru . . . and her so-faraway, so-close mother. The Angelic Layer saga concludes in Book Two!Set several years before Chobits, Angelic Layer also tells the story of Chi's creator, and was the book where CLAMP developed their art style later seen in Chobits and Tsubasa. Remastered from the original artwork in CLAMP's studio vaults, Book One and Book Two contain several bonus Angelic Layer illustrations in full color.
