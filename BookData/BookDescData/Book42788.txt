Deck the iceberg wrap a gifty Fa la la la la la la la la...   Tacky, Goodly, Lovely, Angel, Neatly, and Perfect are celebrating the holiday with good cheer, singing, and lots of presents. Tacky’s present is a little bit different, and not exactly what his friends had in mind, but when the Christmas merrymaking is interrupted by hunters in search of pretty penguins, it's Tacky's gift that helps to save the day….   A bonus CD of original carols includes: Deck the Iceberg, Sandy Clawz is Coming to Town, The Six Days of Christmas, I’m Dreaming of a Green Christmas, and Oh Tackytree!
