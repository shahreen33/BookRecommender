Andrew Holland is a bestselling horror writer. While none of Andy's neighbors has any interest in reading his macabre books, they're pleased to have a celebrity author living among them. Then, one morning, Andy finds the body of a child several hundred feet from his front door. A little girl who has been raped and murdered. And everything changes on Poinsettia Lane. Andy's neighbors turn on him. Their animosity is subtle at first: a dirty look from across the street, a friendly wave that is not reciprocated. The local media exacerbates the tension in the neighborhood by insinuating connections between the horror writer's work and his role in the girl's murder. The authorities clear Andy of any wrongdoing, but the stain has set. Before long, this once-quiet, peaceful neighborhood becomes a maelstrom of anxiety and chaos. Andy's neighbors surround his home like a horde of zombies - but instead of a hunger for flesh, these monsters are driven by lies, fear, and hatred. Andrew Holland's survival rests in the truth... but sometimes the truth isn't what people want to hear.Cover and interior art by Alex McVey and an introduction by Ray Garton.
