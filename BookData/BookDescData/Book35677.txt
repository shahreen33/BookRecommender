Then Xin walks in, with his dark eyes and maddening smirk, and Jonathan feels like he's waking up for the first time in months. Well, parts of him at least. He knows Xin is trouble, but when trouble looks this good it's impossible to resist.Two men. One dangerous planet. To survive they need to trust each other - too bad neither of them does trust.
