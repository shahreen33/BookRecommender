BATTLE OF THE GODS Syaoran and his traveling companions continue to hop, skip, and jump across dimensions—from a land of demon-hunters that hides a reality-shattering secret, to a world inhabited with furry creatures who are being terrorized by a living squall, and beyond—all in the name of restoring Sakura’s memories. This time, Syaoran, Sakura, and Mokona find themselves separated from Fai and Kurogane, divided between two camps in a conflict that reaches to the heavens. Will Syaoran be forced to stand against his friends in this bloody battle between deities?
