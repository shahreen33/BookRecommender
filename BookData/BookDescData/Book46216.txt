Some things in life were inevitable; death, taxes, and lying, whoremongering men.One woman would never be enough for one man.So I traded in men for a Harley.Nothing beats that kind of power between my legs.Then I blinked.And he was there.Some things in life were inevitable; death, taxes, and badge bunnies willing to hop into my bed.The only problem is I’m a one woman kind of man.In my line of work, I’ve seen it all.Nothing bothers me until I find a woman’s wrecked body.When she blinked,My world changed.Forever doesn't come close to giving me enough of her.
