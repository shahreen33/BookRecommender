Zoe Saldivar is more than just single--she's alone. She recently broke up with her longtime boyfriend, she works from home and her best friend Jen is so obsessed with her baby that she has practically abandoned their friendship. The day Zoe accidentally traps herself in her attic with her hungry-looking cat, she realizes that it's up to her to stop living in isolation.Her seemingly empty life takes a sudden turn for the complicated. Her first new friend is Jen's widowed mom, Pam. The only guy to give her butterflies in a very long time is Jen's brother. And Pam is being very deliberately seduced by Zoe's own smooth-as-tequila father. Pam's flustered, Jen's annoyed, and Zoe is beginning to think "alone" doesn't sound so bad, after all. Friendship isn't just one thing--it's a million little things, and no one writes them with more heart and humor than book club sensation Susan Mallery.
