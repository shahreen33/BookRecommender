Deputy Sheriff Rich Taylor has many secrets. His sexuality is only the top of the list. Even his best friend Dan doesn't know Rich is gay. For good reason. His feelings for Dan are more than friendship. When Dan's injured, the thought of losing him forces Rich to admit his years-long lust has turned to love. An accident turns State Trooper Dan Fletcher's life, and his car, upside down. With his right hand out of commission, he has to rely on his best friend for his basic-sometimes intimate-needs. After spending most of his life looking for the right woman, he begins to wonder if he's been looking at the wrong gender-an impossible concept in their small-minded world.
