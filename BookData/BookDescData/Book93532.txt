With an introduction by Mark Lawrence, author of Prince of Thorns and Red Sister.Hidden pasts. Secrets untold. Legends half-remembered. Fifteen fantasy writers gather to bring fifteen tales to life, each one a unique glimpse into a wholly original world.On the Emerald Road, a dead Sage triggers a brutal trial beneath the forest floor. There, a young man must fight--and kill--both friends and enemies to become the next wielder of the fabled Emerald Blade.In Midgard, a priestess of humble birth forges a strange bond with an ancient being as she searches for justice in a land that often rewards cruelty, betrayal, and bloodshed.And in the Yarnsworld, the Magpie King teaches two brothers a dangerous lesson about the power of stories. Sticks and stones may indeed break bones...but they cannot hurt the Bramble Man.In worlds ravaged by flood, fire, and frost, mere mortals strive to make their own legends amidst demons and deities a like. And in lands racked with human strife--where evil endures and no one is ever safe--scarred heroes fight forces even darker than their own personal demons.Why do they fight?Some seek to better the world, or themselves. Others are out to right old wrongs. But whatever their goal--reward, redemption, or just respite--the truth will out eventually. For no story is ever truly lost so long as there exists one to tell it.
