What could possibly go wrong?But the girl is snatched off the street and Milton is nearly killed. As he recovers at a Group Fifteen safe house, he works out what to do next.He has two objectives: first, he’s going to find the girl. And, second, he’s going to find the criminals who took her and punish them for what they’ve done.The conspirators think Milton is an old, washed-up drunk living on past glories. They couldn’t have made a worse mistake. Milton’s trip to Rio turns into a lethal quest that leads to the lawless favelas and the corridors of power, and then right into the horrific heart of darkness.
