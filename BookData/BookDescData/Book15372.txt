The truth is not as simple as he thinks...Secrets have a way of coming out...Notorious rake Lord Charles Carlisle and his cousin, Fitzwilliam Darcy, can can only agree on one fact: a house party at Bentham Park is bound to be intolerably dull. To relieve his boredom, Lord Charles takes a bet that he can seduce his sister’s pretty friend. After all, it’s easy money for an experienced seducer. Why should he care if his staid cousin Darcy disapproves? But Lord Charles’ target is none other than Elizabeth Bennet, the woman who just refused Darcy’s offer of marriage. Darcy cannot stand as his cousin tries to ruin the woman he still loves. But Lord Charles has a dark secret, and his attentions to Elizabeth may not be what they seem. After a midnight rescue, clandestine meetings, a long-lost son, conspiracies, blackmail, and an attempted elopement, everyone can agree this house party is anything but dull.
