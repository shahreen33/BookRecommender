Luke Fielding suddenly and unexpectedly finds himself heir to an earldom. Uncertain about his new role and the changes it has wrought, he does not broadcast his true status when he comes to stay in Crompton Hadlow.

As they stave off the threats to her life and liberty, Grace finds she faces a greater danger: losing her heart to a man she cannot have.
