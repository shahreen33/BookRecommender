A novel that adheres to the classic mystery formula, and yet transcends it, Sleeping Murder -- published the year of Agatha Christie's death -- marks the final appearance of her very popular sleuth. And this time "Christie makes us feel her shiver" (New York Times) as the usually unflappable Miss Jane Marple delves into the moral complexities of an immoral crime.
