SILVERKiss me.Hold me.Claim me.Love me. It’s hard to remember what life was like before the dark-haired, dark-eyed devil waltzed into Silver’s life and set fire to her soul.The town of Raleigh is gradually returning to normal after the painful losses it suffered. Jacob Weaving and his football f#@k boys are nothing but tainted memories in Silver’s rear-view mirror. The halls of Raleigh High don’t even inspire the same terror that they used to…But…Falling in love so hard, so fast was always bound to blind a girl. Silver has been too wrapped up in her inked-up hero to notice any of the signs: all is not as it should be at Raleigh High. The Raleigh High elite haven’t forgotten the girl who dared defy them… And now it’s time to make her pay.
