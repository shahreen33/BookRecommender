Every day a new choice.For as long as A can remember, life has meant waking up in a different person's body every day, forced to live as that person until the day ended.

Now comes an understanding of the extremes that love and loneliness can lead toâ€”and what it's like to discover that you are not alone in the world.In Someday, David Levithan takes readers further into the lives of A, Rhiannon, Nathan, and the person they may think they know as Reverend Poole, exploring more deeply the questions at the core of Every Day and Another Day: What is a soul? And what makes us human?
