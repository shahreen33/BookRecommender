The Boarlanders aren’t what she thought, and the more Kirk shows her his world, the more the line between humans and shifters is blurred. But as she falls head over heels for her man, a war is brewing that she is unwittingly a part of. She’ll have to let her heart decide where her loyalties lie, because suddenly, the job she was sent here to do doesn’t make sense anymore. And one of those illegal claiming marks from the man she loves is becoming mighty tempting.

He has everything figured out until he meets Alison, the beautiful undercover cop with a tough, tatted up exterior and a serious soft side that has his gorilla roaring to be with her. Too bad she’s arrived right in the middle of a storm brewing over his crew. Now Kirk has to figure out if he can trust her and fast…because the biggest threat to Damon’s mountains might just be the woman who has stolen his heart.
