Weary of the saloon girl life—and tired of being slapped around—Darla North decides to start over and let her new-found faith lead her. A friend sends her to Downs House, a place for ‘unfortunate women.’ Darla is offered a home—if she can behave herself. Old habits are hard to break, but Darla is desperate to prove to everyone that she's changed, especially Ethan Downs, the owner's sensitive and sweet son. But when Darla's past threatens to catch up with her, she must decide to face the truth . . . or run away again. A clean, Christian read.
