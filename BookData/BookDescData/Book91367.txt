Welcome to Chipping Cheddar, where supernaturals are hidden in plain sightThere's been a discovery of demons.Again.The appearance of a strange plant on the Taskers' farm sends Neville and I straight to the Federal Bureau of Magic database, where we discover that deadly demons are snatching bodies all over town. Meanwhile, with the Day of Darkness looming on the calendar, family tensions abound and I'm reminded once again that I'm the white sheep of this black magic family. Can I put a stop to the Stepford invasion before it's too late or will the demons take up residence in their hosts--permanently?
