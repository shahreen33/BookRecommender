Meet Juliet Milagros Palante. A self-proclaimed closeted Puerto Rican baby dyke from the Bronx. Only, she's not so closeted anymore after coming out to her family the evening before she flies to Portland, Oregon (of all places), to intern with her favorite feminist writer—an experience that Juliet is certain will change her world. However, coming out doesn't go so well, and, when she leaves home, Juliet's not so sure if her mother will ever speak to her again. As she embarks on a summer full of explorations of race and identity, queer brown dance parties, and a motorcycle-riding librarian, Juliet will ultimately learn that feminism is whatever she decides it is, and only she can create the life she wants. As praised by Roxane Gay, Juliet Takes a Breath is "quite dazzling, funny as hell, poignant, [and] F***ing outstanding." You'll fall in love with this coming-of-age story about a young woman's journey to find herself—to define herself—as she comes out to her family, herself, and the world.
