introduce your little ones to words of the festive season with cute characters, bright colors, and playful scenes. From decorating the tree to Christmas dinner and candy cane to sleigh, this charming book introduces a range of different holiday scenes and objects. Along with the seasonal items, each scene contains one feeling word and one action word to spot, such as cheerful and ice skating—color-coded circles point them out. With a glitter-accented cover that adds visual and tactile interest, this fun book inspires a deeper knowledge of the world, introduces language skills, and supports emotional intelligence. An original, contemporary take on teaching first words, the My World in 100 Words series of board books helps children ages 1–3 boost vocabulary, engage with the world around them, and become familiar with specific subjects. With bright, playful illustrations from Sophie Beer, each book explores a different theme, including starting kindergarten, the garden, and the seaside. With 10 words per page and variation between full scenes and visual lists, there’s plenty for children to look at and enjoy.
