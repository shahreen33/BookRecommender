This is not a book but a loose chapter of Gyo: Volume 2.The Enigma of Amigara Fault (Amigara means "Empty Shell") is a short story originally published along with the second volume of Junji Ito's Gyo, but has nothing to do with the story.People are being unnaturally drawn into a mountainside fault. A boy named Owaki, and a girl, Yoshida, meet on Amigara Mountain, where an unsettling discovery has been made. Human-shaped holes are scattered across the mountain, and it soon becomes clear that the holes are "calling" to the people they are shaped like. So what happens when they enter the hole?
