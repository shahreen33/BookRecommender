Spending a month filming a reality TV show with your ex is no picnic.  Especially when you’ve signed a contract stating that the two of you will not, under any circumstances, have romantic relations while filming.  Leanne Simmons and Callum Davidson never had an easy relationship. From enemies to lovers and back to enemies, they’ve been on again/off again for years. Things come to a head when Callum gets into an altercation with a rival for Leanne’s affections. Their management decide enough is enough and give them both an ultimatum: sign the contract or leave the show.  Unwilling to give up their livelihoods, Callum and Leanne sign on the dotted line. However, like always, they can’t resist making a bet. Callum thinks it’s only a matter of time before they break the agreement, while Leanne is determined to see it through.  Can she resist him for an entire month without losing her sanity? And what if this is the one bet that finally breaks them both?  Off the Air is a contemporary romance and Book One in L.H.
