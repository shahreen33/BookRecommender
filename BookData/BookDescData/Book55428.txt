Protecting my heart was the only way... After the childhood I survived, I built a wall and locked it away. I would never let anyone in. Never let anyone close enough to take more than I was willing to give. Starting over in a new town is hard, but running from my past left me no choice. I was desperate to say goodbye to the memories that held me captive. The pain I’ve experienced is more than anyone should have to bear. Then I met him...He takes my breath away. I can’t ignore the way he makes me feel. I know he has the power to destroy me.And that's what scares me the most.Author's Note: This is Book One in the Heart's Compass series.
