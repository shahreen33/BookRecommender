I’m the girl in the corner, quiet as a mouse.The girl in her bedroom, never leaves the house.The girl they call names. The girl with a frown.The girl who always feels down, unless she’s alone.All alone, just me and my thoughts and the thrill when those thoughts turn naughty.When the heart really races and the thrill hits big, as you play all alone in your own filthy little world, knowing that you just might get caught.
