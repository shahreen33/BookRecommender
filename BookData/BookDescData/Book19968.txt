Awaken in 1168 as a prince who must live by his wits to save his own life. In 1911 as a youth, striving to keep hold of his sanity while those he loves turn away. In 1996 as a teenage girl surrounded by conspiracy. And, in an unspecified future, as a consciousness trapped inside a weaponised machine. FOUR LIVES LIVED IN PARALLEL Four lives to choose who to love and who to fear. Four lives to choose who to trust and who to kill. Four lives to lose and die in obscurity. â€¦Or four lives to use to change the course of history. And therein lies the paradox. This is my story. ** All New Revised Edition Includes 5 new chapters and an extensive professional edit **
