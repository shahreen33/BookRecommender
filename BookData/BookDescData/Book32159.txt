Heather's curiosity in Wicca brings new confidence and reassurance, but alienates her from others. Even so, this enchanting path seems harmless, even helpful. But when terrifying things begin to happen that Heather can't explain, it becomes clear that she has less control over her world than ever before. The eleventh book in the TrueColors teen fiction series, this book discusses spiritual warfare, tragedy, anger, and more.
