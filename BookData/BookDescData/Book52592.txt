My arrangement with Clara had been simple.My name is Sawyer Crown, I own Bloodlines Tattoo Parlor, despise drama, and have a penchant for broken women.It's a habit I intend to kick.My arrangement with Clara had been simple. We slept together if and when we wanted too. We were always best friends first. We raised Allie together with love. Four years into it did people assume we were married- yes. Did people assume I was Allie's father- sure. Did I love every second of those assumptions- most definitely. Then my world exploded. Clara went for the gold. She carved out the happiness she needed, wanted.Now it's my turn. Everything seemed to be going great until an epic one night stand changed my world.
