Join Brooke and Eva for their second Pack~n~Go Girls Austrian adventure! It's raining so Brooke and Eva have nothing to do but play hide and seek in the castle's attic. It's just an ordinary game on an ordinary rainy afternoon. But the Brooke stumbles into a room everyone has forgotten for decades. A beautiful porcelain doll sits at a table set for tea for two. It's as if she's been waiting for Brooke and Eva to arrive.
