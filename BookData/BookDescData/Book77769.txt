"McNaught's comics are slow, quiet and very sensitive to place and time. The work is certainly poetic but not precious or twee. And the drawings are beautiful. Masterful stuff for someone so young."—Seth, author of Wimbledon Green and George Sprott: 1894�1975 in TimeDockwood is a small town in the Southeast of England, seven miles east of Brampton Moor. It has a population of 26,000 and is home to a bowling alley, a boating lake, and Willowbrook Outlet Village.It's a cloudy Tuesday in October and the residents of the town are going about their business as usual. In Elmsview Nursing Home, a kitchen porter dutifully prepares lunch for residents. Elsewhere, a council worker sweeps the fallen leaves from the pavements. Along Nettlefield Road, a paperboy is delivering his daily round. And in the trees, swallows gather noisily in preparation for their annual migration.In this new work, Jon McNaught weaves together the everyday lives of three locals against an evocative backdrop of autumnal transitions. Bittersweet and contemplative, Dockwood is for anyone who believes the stories that take place within life's small moments can often be the most meaningful of all.Jon McNaught is a printmaker and cartoonist living in Bristol, England. He also works as a printmaking instructor at the University of the West of England. He has produced comic strips for Nobrow, Art Review, and Stripburger, among others. His first book Birchfield Close was published in 2010 by Nobrow Press, as was his second, Pebble Island.
