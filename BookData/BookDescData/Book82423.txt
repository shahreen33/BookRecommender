LIGHTSPEED is an online science fiction and fantasy magazine. In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF--and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales.  We have original science fiction by Rich Larson ("The Cyborg, the Tinman, the Merchant of Death") and Joseph Allen Hill ("The Venus Effect"), along with SF reprints by Margo Lanagan ("The Fifth Star in the Southern Cross") and Christie Yant ("This Is As I Wish To Be Restored").  Plus, we have original fantasy by Carlie St. George ("Every Day Is the Full Moon") and Charles Payseur ("The Death of Paul Bunyan"), and fantasy reprints by William Alexander ("The War Between the Water and the Road") and Shweta Narayan ("Daya and Dharma").  As usual, we've put together some terrific nonfiction, including an interview with award-winning author Nancy Kress, plus our usual author spotlight mini-interviews. Of course, our media and book review team has put together some sensational insights about what to read and watch, as well.  For our ebook readers, we also have an ebook-exclusive novella reprint from Michael Bishop ("Twenty Lights to 'The Land of Snow'") and a book excerpt from THE TRAITOR BARU CORMORANT by Seth Dickinson.
