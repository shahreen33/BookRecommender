Who are the Rat Queens? A pack of booze-guzzling, death-dealing battle maidens-for-hire, and they're in the business of killing all god's creatures for profit. It's also a darkly comedic sass-and-sorcery series starring Hannah the Rockabilly Elven Mage, Violet the Hipster Dwarven Fighter, Dee the Atheist Human Cleric and Betty the Hippy Smidgen Thief. This modern spin on an old school genre is a violent monster-killing epic that is like Buffy meets Tank Girl in a Lord of the Rings world on crack! This deluxe hardcover edition combines the first two volumes of the New York Times bestselling series. It includes the never-before reprinted Rat Queens Special: Braga, &amp; plenty of extras all in an over-sized hardcover with a silver-foil stamped cover!Collecting: Rat Queens 1-10 &amp; Rat Queens Special: Braga
