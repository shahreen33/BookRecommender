HaydenI am a hothead, a wild card, and son to a murdered man. I crave the things I can’t have and don’t want the things I can. Now, I’m left to pick up the pieces—stitch our family back together with a damaged thread. This isn’t the life I envisioned. And to make matters worse, the women in our lives are testing the strength of our brotherhood. My name is Hayden Pearson.I am the eldest—a protective, but vindictive son. People may think I’m too young to fill our father’s shoes, but it won’t stop me from proving them all wrong. ****First came the Four Fathers.
