The Authority, the powerful team that rose from the ashes of StormWatch, stars in this world-shaking collection of their first adventures. Led by hot-tempered, electrically powered Jenny Sparks and headquartered in a fifty-mile-wide spaceship that exists outside space and time, the Authority explodes into action, first against a global attack of genetically engineered super-human clones, and then against an invasion from another reality.
