If you want to read gripping stories that don’t rely on sex, swearing, and graphic violence—you’ve come to the right place!DEEP MAGIC is a bi-monthly electronic magazine that publishes clean short fiction in the fantasy and science fiction genres (epic, paranormal, steampunk, etc). Our issues are also filled with author interviews, art features, book reviews and tips for writers. In this issue you'll find "Salt &amp; Water," a short story written by Charlie N Holmberg, author of the Amazon-bestselling Paper Magician Series. If you like mermaid lore, this story is for you! We also T.E. Bradford's debut story "The Dragon Between Worlds" (hint: we loved it!), Christopher Baxter's history-bending story "The Wizard's Granddaughter", and a steampunk story we all went crazy for called "Juliet Silver and the Realm of Impossibility." We also feature some science fiction pieces this month from Brock Poulsen, "The Drawer" and Amy Power Jansen's "On the Other Side." We also include the first chapters of a novel from Hollywood director-turned-writer Kieth Merrill from his debut epic fantasy novel "The Immortal Crown" published by Shadow Mountain. There is also a wonderful article by professional dev editor Angela Polidoro (she's the brilliant editor who helps get Jeff's and Charlie's novels up to snuff), and an interview with literary agent Marlene Stringer. You'll want to pay attention to both of their advice. Finally, we include a writing craft article by author Eldon Thompson and an interview with cover artist Tais Teng from the Netherlands.
