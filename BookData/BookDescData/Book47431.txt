Steven Archer and Donna Lynch collaborate once again for a collection of illustrated poems and short stories about witches—some familiar and some secret; some based in history and lore, and some manifested directly from the minds of their creators. This 7″ by 10″, full-color art book includes more than 30 poems and paintings and is the sequel to Daughters of Lilith, their collaborative work released in 2010.
