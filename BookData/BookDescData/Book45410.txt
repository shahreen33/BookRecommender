Unlike her neighbors, Maggie McGillicuddy has an eye for trouble. And while she's knitting on her porch swing, she manages to spot it --- everywhere! With the ?tickety, tickety, tack!? of her knitting needles, the elderly Maggie scares off a prowling tiger! And with the ?whickety, whickety, whack!? of her walking stick, there goes a slithering snake! Of course, readers can see the tiger is really just a cat and the snake is only a tree root, so they'll be as delighted as Maggie when Charlie, the boy who just moved next door, seems to have an eye for trouble of his own! With wit and great charm, author Susan Hughes has created a playful story about friendship and the joys of an active imagination. She uses direct questions ---?You see it there, don't you??--- as hints to help children recognize what's imagined and what's actually there, expanding visual literacy. Brooke Kerrigan uses soft colors and quirky details to beautifully illustrate a child's cozy yet expansive world. Maggie McGillicuddy's Eye for Trouble will make a fun and involving read-aloud, as well as a starting point for talking about imagination. And when real trouble, in the form of a car coming down the road as Charlie is about to run into it, is spotted and averted, adults will find it a useful opportunity to discuss the difference between real and pretend danger with young readers.
