 Cheat on your husband, not on your diet!   Eva Cassady is stuck in a marriage that's completely lost its luster. She's even envious of her twenty-year-old daughter, living la vie Parisienne (complete with les condoms) in France for a year. Somewhere inside, Eva knows she's still a woman with dreams and desires -- but her whole dull, status-quo existence can be summed up by the tyrannical numbers on her bathroom scale. At 176 pounds, is she just one more invisible, middle-aged woman who will never inspire lust in a man again?  Then fickle fortune -- via her job -- puts Eva back in touch with Michael Foresman, her passionate lover one unforgettable college spring break. Michael seems tr√©s interested in meeting up and rekindling some old sparks, but she can't possibly let him see her the way she looks now. With reborn fantasies burning through her blood, Eva starts dieting and exercising like a woman possessed...by passion.  With the pounds dropping away, Eva feels as if twenty years have rolled back as well. She feels young, sexy, desirable...and when Michael arrives, he obviously agrees. So now Eva has to make a choice. When a diet promises to change your life, just how big a change do you really want to make?  To every woman who has ever craved a spoonful of ice cream or agonized over the minefields of romance, this book is for you. It's witty, it's wonderful, it's smart and perceptive. The Adultery Diet is a light-hearted but emotionally honest look at life, love, letting go...and, of course, losing weight.
