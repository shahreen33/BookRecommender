ON THE HUNT FOR FREEDOM AND A LIFE WORTH LIVING… Two men – one white, one red. Tough, driven, as hard as the mountains and the Llano Estacado they inhabit. Opposites in every way, but bound by a bond of blood and respect even as the years bring hardship, conflict and grief.Comanche Blood is an action-packed thrill ride through the Old West.
