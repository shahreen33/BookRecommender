All my life I've never fit in. Since the accident, I went from foster home to foster home until I just ran away. I thought life would always be like that. Scraping by, barely living. That is, until I was chosen.  The Ravanas saved me. They brought me to The Fort so I could become a part of their world. Wanted. Secure. Training to be their human guardian was the only way they could let me in. Except, it's also the most dangerous. Now, we all have enemies--even me. Together, we must fight to keep the bond between us, or lose the most precious gift I've ever received.  Chosen By Darkness is the first novel in the Ravana Clan Vampires Series. It includes Books 1-5 in the Chosen By Darkness: Ravana Clan Vampire Serial.
