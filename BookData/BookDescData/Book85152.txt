Daywalker Brynne Kirkland survived a hellish upbringing as a product of a madman's lab. Tough, driven, and devoted to her work in law enforcement, Brynne has never dared to risk opening her heart to anyone--least of all a handsome immortal from a world on the verge of war against hers.Atlantean warrior Zael left the intrigue of his realm several lifetimes ago, along with the battles he fought as one of the queen's legion. As a free-spirited loner walking the fringe of two worlds--that of his secretive and powerful people, and the outside world belonging to mankind and the Breed--it was never his intention to return to combat and bloodshed. Nor had he imagined that he might ever be tempted into anything stronger than desire . . . until he meets Brynne.Thrust together as allies of the Order in the fight against a diabolical enemy, Zael and Brynne embark on a mission that will ultimately force them to decide between duty to their people, and a passion that defies all bounds.
