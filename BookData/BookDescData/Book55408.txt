Viola's husband, Cecil, has shut the door behind him for the last time, and their four adult kids seem determined to send her to her grave with worrying. Paris always comes to everybody's rescue - although she doesn't have a clue as to how to save herself. Lewis keeps landing himself in jail. Charlotte knows she's gotten the short end of the stick for years and would just as soon divorce herself from them all. And Janelle is defensive about the course her life has taken. Meanwhile, Cecil has some ideas for taking his hard-working life into his own hands. With her hallmark exuberance and a cast of sassy, resilient characters, McMillan takes us deep into the hearts, minds, and souls of America.
