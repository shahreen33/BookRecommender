“Getting Aries as my mate is a fantasy that I never would have had the imagination to dream up on my own, but to get those two beautiful angels too? That's just the complete package.”  Micah is a young alpha, on a mission to find the infant daughter of an old friend. When he also finds two other lost little angels, he has no choice but to rescue them as well. Before he is able to return them home to their dad, they already have staked their claim on his heart.  Aries is an omega whose babies were stolen from him, ripped from his arms right at birth. He's tried to stay strong, but the pain of their absence haunts him every moment of every day.  When he discovers that his children have been found, by an alpha that is already on the way to deliver them into his arms, Aries is beside himself with nervous excitement. What he doesn't expect is that the alpha is the one man that he has reason to hate due to a regrettable incident from the past.  What neither of them expected to happen when Micah arrived with the children, was to find their fated mate. Can these two men who have zero respect for each other find their way to somehow form a family together with the children that they both adore?
