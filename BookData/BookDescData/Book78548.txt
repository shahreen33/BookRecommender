Years and light-years away, one father must find the courage to do whatever it takes to protect his children ... As a surgeon for the Mercy Interplanetary Alliance, Micheel Reshi is no stranger to difficult choices. But when his wife, Nabelle, gives brith to their twins, Micheel is horrified to find Callox and Pasher bare the Sign of Gemini on their arms. The bright constellation marks them as carriers of the hidden code Earth’s last generation had engineered into human DNA—and marks them as targets by the Collectors, a group of people determined to wipe out all memory of Old Earth and its existence. When Count Lux, Nabelle's cousin and a member of the Collectors, arrives on their starship, Micheel knows he must do something to save his family—even if it means breaking them apart.THIS IS THE SHORT STORY GRAPHIC NOVEL VERSION OF THE PREQUEL TO "THE SIGNS OF THE STARS," AN UPCOMING SPACE OPERA ADVENTURE SERIES FROM C.
