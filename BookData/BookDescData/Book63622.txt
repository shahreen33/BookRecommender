By surpassing most transitional commentaries, Lane's work unveils Hebrews as a sermon rendered by a concerned "preacher" to his Roman church, which is under persecution and dangerously close to rejecting the faith. As an exposition of encouragement and exhortation, Hebrews addresses the central concerns of our contemporary insecurity: the tension between secular conformity and spiritual maturity and the threat of societal perversion and materialism to a Christian commitment.
