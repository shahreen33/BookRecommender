Michael - I bought her a drink. Then I bought her two. In fact I was ready to buy the whole bar if it made her loosen up a bit.  She looked so good in that cute dress and being on this island I assumed she was from money too. Most women were, unless they were somebody's staff.  Either way, she was coming back to my yacht tonight for some wild fun and I was going to enjoy every minute of dominating that cute ass.  Stephanie â€“ I wondered why he kept buying me drinks? Was he just being nice or did he want more?  He did look kind of familiar, and it was obvious he was wealthy. Most men are on this island, not that I could afford to come here often.  Anyway, I decided I was just going to go with the flow and have some fun. I hadn't had sex in a LONG time and it would be fun to be a bad girl for the night.
