With the promise of easy money, Hart finds himself in possession of a mysterious box that needs to be delivered to Rio de Janeiro in 6 days. Nothing, though, is ever as simple as it seems. There are others who have an interest in the little box and are determined to stop him from making his delivery.  Hart discovers he has entered a high stakes political game where the players are shadowed and more than his delivery money is on the line. He may have unknowingly just gambled away his life.  Rand Hart and the Pajama Putsch is a 22,500 word Dieselpunk alternative history adventure novella with a healthy dollop of romance and a little bit of luck.
