When world famous singer Maggie Tressider crashes her car on the way to a concert, she wakes up in hospital, dazed, in a post-operative shock - and haunted. From some secret place in her subconscious arises the awful conviction that somehow, at some time in the past she has been responsible for a death. A psychiatrist, her doctor suggests, might lay the nameless spectre to rest. But Maggie chooses a very diffrent expert to find the truth for her.
