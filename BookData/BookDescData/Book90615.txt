The world around her is callous, unjust and horribly scarred by the past. But she brings compassion and even a glimmer of hope.’Summer 1923. The modern world. Orphaned Lucy Marsh climbs into the back of the old army truck and is whisked off to the woods, where the funny men live. If she can only avoid all the hazards on the path, she may just survive into a bright new tomorrow.
