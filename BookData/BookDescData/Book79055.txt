Every year beautiful Rachel Treherne must rewrite her will--and decide who will inherit her late father's vast wealth...But this year, things are just a little bit different:Somebody clearly wants her to die."You have had that money long enough," said the anonymous note. Two venomous snakes coiled in her bed, a suspicious fire and poisoned chocolates made the same point.

Enlisting the very capable talents of Miss Silver seems the only way she can stay alive...From Paperback Swap
