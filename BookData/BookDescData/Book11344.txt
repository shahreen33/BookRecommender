You know the story.  Boy meets girl, they fall in love, two kids, white picket fence.  This isn’t that story.  This is more like...  Man meets woman.  Man sleeps with woman.  Man meets another woman, sleeps with her.  And so on.  You get the idea.I own a small boutique hotel in New Orleans, the Kingston.  I’ve seen men do some stupid stuff in the name of the woman they love, or at least the woman they love for the night.  That’s not me.  I’m always in control.  You’d be surprised how much you can get away with on just good manners and a smile. It’s the only way to keep my secrets safely locked away. And my smile hides a lot.  Until her.She turns me down flat.  Playing hard to get is my favorite game.  It’s the thrill of the chase.  Only problem is, I think it’s me that’s getting caught.
