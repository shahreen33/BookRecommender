This is an ACE for ISBN13:9780994383907 SoullessWelcome to Soulless.We are the generation that laughs at death. Reincarnation; what was once considered a gift of immortality has become an eternity of nightmares.Nadia Richards lives in a world plagued by reincarnation, a system of recycling souls where all past memories, personalities and traumatic events are relived daily in disjointed sequences. Trapped within their own warped realities, not even the richest and most powerful are saved from their own minds unraveling. Madness is the new human nature, and civilizations are crumpling beneath themselves trying to outrun it. Within a society that ignores death, Nadia appears to be the one exception to the reincarnation trap. Born without any reincarnated memories and with printless eyes, the hot tempered 19 year old quickly becomes the ultimate prize to all those wishing to end the vicious cycle, or for some, to ensure they could evade death forever.Readers discretion: Adult language, violence and some adult scenes. For mature audiences only.
