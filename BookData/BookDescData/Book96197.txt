Grey Dorning, Earl of Casriel, needs to marry well and soon. He has five brothers whom he must assist to get a start in life, an estate going ragged around the edges, and nothing he's tried thus far to repair the earldom's finances has worked. He needs to wed an agreeable heiress looking for a title, a lady content to marry a man more renowned for his manners than his fortune.  Beatitude, Countess of Canmore, wants a friendly, temporary liaison with a charming fellow who won't infringe on a widow's freedoms. She's not wealthy, but she has earned her independence and intends to guard it well. Grey knows what he needs, Addy knows what she wants, so why can't they stop thinking about each other?
