Autumn Christian's third novel is a dark journey of self-discovery. An existential labyrinth of love, sex, and self-actualization where the only way out is through.  When high schooler Beverly Sykes finally has sex, her whole life changes. She feels an explosion inside of her that feels like her DNA is being rearranged, and she discovers a strange power within. After chasing that transcendent feeling and fucking her way through the good, the bad, and the dangerous boys and girls that cross her path, Beverly notices that all of her ex-lovers are undergoing drastic changes. She witnesses them transcending their former flawed selves, becoming self-actualized and strong. Beverly gives herself over and over to others, but can she become who she is supposed to be, with the gift and curse that nature gave to her?  “Girl Like a Bomb is a journey through the gratifying, delicious, and sometimes-vicious horror show of having a body — particularly a femme body. This is a book of blood and guts, of humanity and brokenness, woven by passages of beauty and smart storytelling. Salacious &amp; sea-deep, this is a book for readers who are hungry for both a party and meaning.”  Lisa Marie Basile, author of Light Magic for Dark Times and Nympholepsy  "Girl Like a Bomb is a book like a bomb -- explosive, heavy and dangerous. A must read by an exciting new voice."  Brian Keene, author of The Rising and Pressure  “Fun, fast, and fascinating. GIRL LIKE A BOMB hooked me and held me.”  New York Times Bestseller, Peter Clines, author of Paradox Bound
