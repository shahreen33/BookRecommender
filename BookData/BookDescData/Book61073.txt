Ocean lives in a world where water is scarce. Her village names all of their females after water, in hopes of gaining favor with the Fates. For every 20 years a Water Blessed is chosen. Someone who can create water at will. Men take multiples water wives with the sole purpose of fetching water 10 miles away from the dangerous and crowded well. When Ocean finds herself being auctioned off to the highest bidder, Seth, a royal knight, changes her life forever. But what the Fates have in store for Ocean might prove too much and sometimes love isn't enough.
