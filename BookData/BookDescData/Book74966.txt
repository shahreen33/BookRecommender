They think I'm sick in the head. I might be. I am who I am and I don't apologize for it. When my sister goes missing, I step up and take action. My Prez throws me a bone with a hot little girl that has been through a lot of trauma herself. I'm not looking for love. In fact, I'm not all that sure that I hold that emotion in me. But I can have some fun with her. Our lives are far from the same but she gives me a strength I didn't know I needed. My fear? I'm going to ruin her.
