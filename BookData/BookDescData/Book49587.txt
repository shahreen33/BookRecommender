My name is Jack Steen.  That name shouldn’t mean anything to you. Unless you’re about to die. And then I’m your bloody guardian angel.  I work as a night nurse in hospital for the criminally insane.   You picked up this book because of the title, right? Deathbed Confessions of the Criminally Insane. That’s exactly what you’re about to read.   You’re about to read the first three stories of my ‘collection’. The Well Marker The Funeral Director The Babysitter  My name is the only real name you’ll find in this book.  I won’t tell you which hospital I work at.  I won’t tell you the names of those dying. But I won’t lie to you. You’ll read exactly what I’m told.   If you’re smart, if you’re deranged enough to read between the lines, you’ll know who is telling the story. These sadistic bastards could be playing their final game with me by messing with my head.  Now, maybe they're messing with yours too.  Basically, I’m starting you off with the easiest story. - Bucket from the Well Marker was probably my favorite patient/inmate. - The Funeral Director isn’t for those with a weak stomach. OR if you’ve recently attended a funeral. - The Babysitter…well, let’s just say Ken is a sick fuck and there’s no love loss between the two of us.  You can get each confession as it’s own book or read them here in this one. There will be more confessions coming so if you like what you read, you’ll want to keep an eye out.
