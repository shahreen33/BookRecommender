Throughout history, some books have changed the world. They have transformed the way we see ourselves &amp; each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war &amp; revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked &amp; comforted. They have enriched lives &amp; destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals &amp; visionaries whose ideas shook civilization &amp; helped make us who we are. Elegant, insightful &amp; startlingly modern, the philosophy of Lucretius deeply influenced the course of European thought; here, he provides one of the first accounts of atomic theory, argues that there can be no life of the soul after death &amp; explores the sickness that we call love.
