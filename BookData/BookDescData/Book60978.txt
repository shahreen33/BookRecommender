The memories of a world at war are fading in the face of a prosperous future. Doors are left unlocked at night, and neighbors are always there to give each other a helping hand.  The people here know certain things as fact:  Amorea is the best little town there is.  The only good Commie is a dead Commie.  The Women’s Club of Amorea runs the town with an immaculately gloved fist.  And bookstore owner Mike Frazier loves that boy down at the diner, Sean Mellgard. Why they haven’t gotten their acts together is anybody’s guess. It may be the world’s longest courtship, but no one can deny the way they look at each other.  Slow and steady wins the race, or so they say.  But something’s wrong with Mike. He hears voices in his house late at night. There are shadows crawling along the walls and great clouds of birds overhead that only he can see.  Something’s happening in Amorea. And Mike will do whatever he can to keep the man he loves.
