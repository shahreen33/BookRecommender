What if dreams were portals to other worlds and you got trapped there?  The doctor’s diagnosis was grim. Cillian Rysgaard was dying. As an eighty-six-year-old man, this news was terrifying, but not surprising. The true shock came when he walked out of the doctor’s office and was suddenly in a city unlike any on Earth. Just as startling, he had the body of his early thirties.  Assuming it’s all a dream, he agrees to steal a powerful sword to kill a dragon, but the quest goes awry when he’s tricked into releasing an imprisoned man. Once freed, the man claims to be the god Loki and vows to unleash a war between the other gods that could destroy the universe.  To find and recapture Loki, Cillian must navigate a world of cowboys and dragons, of robots and mythical beings. Where magic and advanced technology coexist, and demigods wage war for control. Where time travel and wormholes are real, and the line between dreams, simulation, and reality blurs.  Should he fail, he will never see Earth, or his family, again.
