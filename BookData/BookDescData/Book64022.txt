The Return of King Lillian is a mythic journey tale - a metaphysical fantasy for dreamers and nonconformists of all ages. So, why the manly moniker in tandem with the womanly name?"The Firstborn Child of The Emperor-King Inherits the Ruling Crown, the Title of Emperor-King and All Powers Thereof." (Item 37, The Royal Manual) Enter Lillian, the firstborn child of said Emperor-King. Cast out of her Kingdom by malevolent forces, mysteriously waylaid by Destiny, the spirited, self-reliant Lillian sets off on an exuberant journey to find her way home and claim her birthright. As she travels through marvelous and mystical lands in search of her origins, Lillian encounters and befriends a kaleidoscopic cast of characters. Most of the tale is told by Lillian herself, as she chronicles her extraordinary adventures.The audiobook of The Return of King Lillian is performed by the author, Suzie Plakson.
