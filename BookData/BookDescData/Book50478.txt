In the early 1850s, as settlers began to move into central Iowa, a small pioneer community developed in the tall prairie grass. These first settlers named their community Fairview and began to transform the rich soil along the Skunk River into productive farmland. In the following years, an influx of Scandinavian immigrants arrived in the area, playing a major part in the development of a thriving rural community. After the introduction of a railroad line, the community continued to grow and was renamed Story City after US Supreme Court justice Joseph Story. Today, Story City is a heritage-minded community with a thriving Main Street district, a number of successful businesses, and beautiful historic architecture.
