A merry guide to more than 100 witching words.When he was a little boy, Gregoire Solotareff was very fond of his mother reading stories from her native Russia about the famous Slavic witch, Baba Yaga (-old woman-), spooker of children across Eastern Europe for many centuries.After the success of his Loulou the wolf series of books, Solotareff decided to turn his efforts to a more personal topic -- portraying the mythical Baba Yaga witches as -real people- with defects, secrets and all that make us laugh at our silly fears.Dictionary of Witches looks at all we think we know about witches and a lot that we don't. Why are crows witches' accomplices? What color is a witch's hair? What are witches' husbands called? And their babies? Where do they go to the toilet? Do witches get airsick on their brooms? How can you recognize a witch in disguise? And the scariest, why do children like witches when they want to kidnap them and eat them?There's even a recipe for Christmas Dinner (feeds eight witches):Take a handful of medium-sized snakes (you can easily catch them in winter). Stuff the snakes with six crushed toads (the snakes will put up a bit of a fuss). Put in the oven at 220 degrees. Cook for one hour, holding your nose. Cool slightly (while still holding your nose).  Everything there is to know about witches -- more than a hundred facts -- are here. Amusing, never truly scary and featuring stunning saturated illustrations, Dictionary of Witches is a unique stroll through the not-so-dark forest home of witches.
