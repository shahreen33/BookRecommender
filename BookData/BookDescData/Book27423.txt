Summer, 1983.As fall approaches and the summer stock theaters on Cape Cod close for the season, three promising young actors and a stagehand pile into an old Ford Fairlane and head for a vacation resort in Maine. Hoping for a relaxing getaway before pursuing their dreams in New York City or going on to college, they instead encounter a bizarre storm while on a lonely stretch of state highway and soon find themselves stranded in the strange rural community of Boxer Hills.At first glance it seems a harmless little backwoods town, but Boxer Hills has a horrible secret and a deadly history. It's a place of horrific age-old rituals and a legendary evil that will let no one escape without paying a terrible price.Before the sun rises on a new day, they will have to fight their way through the night and out of town, or risk falling prey to an endless cycle of depravity and violence at the hands of a demonic creature so profane few will even speak its name.They were young, reckless and chasing hell.What they hadnâ€™t counted on was actually catching it.
