Shh, I have a secret.  The sinfully gorgeous members of the Student Council—Church, Ranger, Spencer, Micah and Tobias—can't ever find out.  I already get picked on because my father's the headmaster.  I don't need them to know I’m the only girl, too; I’d rather dress like a boy.  Adamson All-Boys Academy now has its only female student, but I'm not about to be their guinea pig.  Not when there's a secret at this school nobody is talking about. Not when the last female student here ended up dead.   ***THE SECRET GIRL is a 90,000 word lighthearted reverse harem/high school bully romance novel with a mystery/suspense twist. This is book one of three in the series. Contains foul language and sexual scenes; any sex featured is consensual.
