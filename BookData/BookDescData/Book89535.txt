Sarthak Arora is a good looking and intelligent engineering graduate from Delhi who has recently bagged a high paying job with an IT company in Kolkata. Sarangi Sen is a beautiful, vivacious Bengali girl working as a front office manager at The Grand Vilas, a luxury hotel in Kolkata. Opposites in every way, the attraction is instant and mutual; so is their falling in love, though it remains unprofessed for long. When things seem to be falling on track, like a bolt from the blue, Sarangi is diagnosed with a medical condition that leaves her with only three months to live. With no visible solution at hand, nothing but fate seems to be holding power. Would Sarthak be able to alter Sarangi's destiny and save his love? Or would he let Sarangi succumb to the design of the mighty invisible script of fate? When the Heavens Smiled is a heart-stopping spiritual, heroic, tender and intense love story that will open up your mind to new and uncharted realms of life.
