When a little girl plays dress up in her leotard and socks she becomes Circus Girl star of the show. Even her toys morph into her dreamscape of circus acts. At each page turn she jumps and tumbles, flies through the air, juggles, spins, balances and contorts.  Vibrant and winsome, modern and timeless the illustrations and words convey a captured childhood moment with directness and simplicity.
