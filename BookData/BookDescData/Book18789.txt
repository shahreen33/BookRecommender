I’m that teenaged girl who has MS. You haven’t met me, but you’ve seen me around. You probably know my sister. We’re twins, and she’s the pretty one. Maybe you’ve heard about my reputation, how much I like to hook up at parties—how easy it is to get me in bed, get what you want, and forget about me after. Forget what you think you know. I’m leaving that girl behind. College is all about new beginnings. So from now on—I’m just Cass. And the rest…it isn’t written yet. And no one else gets to write my story for me.--------“Tyson Preeter doesn’t do can’t.” That’s exactly what I want people to think when they see me. I am strong, invincible, confident, intelligent—arrogant. I’m the man who always finds a way around, over and through—until there’s nothing left. Since losing my ability to walk six years ago, I’ve relearned life. I don’t need sympathy. I don’t want charity. And I don’t do love. It’s better this way, saves my disappointments for me, and me alone, and it saves my strength for everything I want. But Cass Owens is about to wreck everything. She’s about to steal all of my strength away from me, because she needs it more. She’s about to break all of my rules, and break down all of my walls. She’s about to own me…completely.And I’m about to let her.* This is the second book in the Falling Series, and it is scheduled to release Dec. 5. Book 1, This Is Falling, is out now. Each book can be read as a standalone and will focus on a different couple.
