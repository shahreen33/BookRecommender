I can look, but I can’t touch.As the enforcer of The Lost Boys MC, I am used to getting my hands dirty. I’ve always kept my emotions in check. It helps given the position I am in. When I was tasked with watching over our President’s sister, I was ready for it. What I wasn’t ready for, is how that beauty would pull at my heart. I’ve known Ella for years. After a horrible break up with her ex, all I wanted to do was protect her. But now, all I want is to bend her over and make her mine. I know I should resist her. But I think my heart has other plans. Texas is the first book of The Lost Boys MC.
