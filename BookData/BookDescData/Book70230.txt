This work is a critical exploration of a book by Sam Harris entitled 'The End of Faith: Religion, Terror and the Future of Reason'. While the book by Mr. Harris puts forth arguments that attempt to paint all spirituality and religion with broad strokes of derision, castigation, and rejection, Mr. Harris also reserves a great deal of space within his book for casting aspersions on Islam and Muslims. The present critical review of Mr. Harris' work examines the many errors, misunderstandings, and problems contained in 'The End of Faith'.
