John Milton is driving from San Francisco to Las Vegas when he picks up a young woman in distress at the side of the road. His act of kindness has consequences that he could not possibly have anticipated, and leads him on an adventure from Sin City to Siena, from San Francisco to El Salvador. The stakes are higher than they have ever been, and Milton's unexpected need for revenge awakens the devil he has tried to smother for so long.
