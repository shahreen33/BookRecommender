A Non Shifter Alpha Omega MPreg Romance. Mitch opened The Fallen Nut as a safe haven for alphas and omegas to meet up. Keeping omegas safe was a priority for him and his brother Ike after their younger brother was killed ten years earlier. As one of the hottest bars in Oak Grove, The Fallen Nut was the pinnacle of success for local craft brewers.  Kaden didn't know much about brewing beer, but he committed to helping out his brother with his craft beer: Tapped. When Tapped was named as a finalist in the quarterly contest at The Fallen Nut to get keg space, Kaden was happy for his brother. At least until realizing Ike would be out of town for the event and Kaden would have to take charge of promoting Tapped and getting enough votes to win.  When Mitch saw Kaden, he had to have him. They had a quick encounter and both went their separate ways. But once wasn't enough for either of them. And when they're paths cross again, their connection is stronger than ever and undeniable.  Omega On Tap is a sexy and romantic romance with plenty of knotty heat, male pregnancy, a cute baby, and an HEA.
