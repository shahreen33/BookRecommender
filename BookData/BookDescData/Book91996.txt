Ernest Morlaisse leads an unadventurous life. He comes home every day and eats the same snack: a green apple and a cracker, and then he sits down to do his homework. Enter Victoria de Montardent, the new girl in class. When Victoria sees Ernest, it's love at first sight. And she makes her declaration to everyone: "I love Ernest... We're getting married in thirteen years, eight months and three days. This is an invitation to our wedding". And believe it or not, Victoria's bulldozer approach works! Quickly Ernest begins to discover that beating inside his chest...is his heart. And he begins finding ways to use it.Secret Letters from 0 to 10 has won twelve international prizes, including France's Prix Totem (the equivalent of the Newbery).
