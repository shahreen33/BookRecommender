Bloom County: The Complete Library Volume 3 collects every strip from July 1984 through February 1986. Many fondly remembered strips are in this volume, including the classic 1984 presidential elections featuring possibly the finest running mates ever for such a campaign: Opus and Bill the Cat. Plus, a cornucopia of ingenious satire featuring the rest of the Bloom County cast: Steve Dallas, Mio, Binkley, Oliver, Cutter John, and all the rest.
