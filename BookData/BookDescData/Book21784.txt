Apocalypstick contains two deliciously dark short stories: Finding Home, a supernatural horror, and Killing Tiffany Hudson, a post-apocalyptic tale of two genetically modified people who must decide the fate of humanity.Finding HomeIf you have ever glanced at a stranger in the grocery store, and wondered what their life must be like, and then followed them home to peek at them through their windows, and then slipped inside their house at night just to look around, and then stood next to their bed to watch over them while they slept, and thought I could live this life, then please seek help. Weirdo.But on your way to the hospital (or the police station), walk a few steps in the shoes of a troubled man on a quest for a new home and a new life, while he deals with a few disturbing personal issues. Finding Home is a short paranormal horror story that lets you test-drive the lives of strangers in a perfectly legal, non-creepy way.Killing Tiffany HudsonIs there any line you wouldn't cross to save the life of a loved one? Is there any price you wouldn't pay? A young man battles with the consequences of his answers to these questions, in this Post-apocalyptic short story, where right masquerades as wrong, weakness as strength, and deadly monsters as... camels? Well, sometimes, yes.
