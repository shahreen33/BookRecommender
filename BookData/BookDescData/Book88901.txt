  QUINN THOMPSON
When I walk into a room, the popular kids whisper about me. I don’t own designer clothes or name-brand shoes. I don’t wear low-cut shirts or tons of makeup either. I’m as plain Jane as a girl can get. I live on a farm, where the uniform of the day is boots, jeans, and a T-shirt unless it’s winter; then I trade my T-shirts for heavy sweaters and a parka. Baggy is my style.But I’m considered one of the nerds in school for reasons besides my wardrobe. I have my nose in books while the popular girls have their noses up jocks’ butts. I do everything I can to avoid the in crowd at Kensington High—until a new boy waltzes in. He’s tall like my brothers, handsome like Zac Efron, and disrupts my belief that boys only want one thing. My only problem is he’ll never notice me, not if my arch-nemesis has any say.

Basketball has been my life until my dad died. I’m trying not to get depressed, but it’s hard to breathe sometimes. He’ll never cheer from the stands at any of my basketball games or shout at me to shoot that three-pointer. I promised him I would step up if anything happened to him, and now it’s time to be the man of the house.Only I’m torn between playing for the Kensington High basketball team and finding a job—until the girl with butterscotch hair snags my attention. She’s pretty, quirky, and her presence takes my mind off my troubles. Above all else, she makes me feel things that I’ve never felt before. In my mind, girls are just a distraction. They’re nice to look at, they talk too much, and they’re extremely pushy. Yet Quinn Thompson might change my opinion that all girls are created equal.
