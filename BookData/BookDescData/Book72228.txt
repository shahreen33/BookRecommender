Smoothies are a great way to extra nutrients into your diet. Packed with multiple servings of fruits and veggies in every sip they’re quick to make, easy to digest, delicious to drink, and they charge your body with the energy and nutrients you need to stay healthy. The benefits of these frothy drinks come from “functional foods,” foods that contain large amounts of immunity-boosting nutrients to fortify your entire body—a feat no pill or supplement can match. Each of the wholesome and luscious recipes in Smoothies for Better Health is annotated for both its overall nutritional profile and for the specific nutrients it delivers, so you’ll learn exactly what benefits you are getting from every drink.
