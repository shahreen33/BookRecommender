Gifted artist. Drug addict. A beautiful liar with the soul of a poet.Connor Vincent.Once upon a time, my foolish heart believed that my love would be strong enough to fix him.How very wrong I was.We soared to the greatest heights and crashed to the lowest depths together.Starting over wasn’t possible.Yet here he was, heart in hand, asking for another chance.Only a fool would agree.But when it comes to Connor, I’ve always been a fool.My muse. My bluebird of happiness. The cunning thief who stole my heart.Ava Christensen had been the best thing in my life, but I ruined us.One more chance to get it right.I would show her that I’ve changed. I’m not hell-bent on self-destruction anymore. I won’t be careless with her. Not again.This time everything will be different.But once again my past catches up to me, and I’ll have to prove that I’m stronger than my addiction. Stronger than my secrets and lies. Strong enough to be the man she deserves.No more secrets. No more lies.They say that truth is beauty … they’re lying.
