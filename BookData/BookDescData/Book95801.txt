Is it possible for a shattered girl to love a broken boy? Each of them marrying the chips and holes in the cracks that are barely holding them together. Drawn to each other like two magnets, fighting for what they want. What is meant to be.To be together.Or are they just two broken people? Lapping up the love that’s dripped down the side of a knife, hoping they don’t get cut.I lived in hell growing up. Trusting a man, I believed to be a best friend, only to find out he was the devil disguised as my savior.I had a dad that cared more about his next high, than he did his daughter.I lost a sister, who is the only reason I’m standing here today. I love a man, that I won’t let myself have.Unaware and unassuming, I have danger staring me right in the eyes, oblivious to the destruction looming ahead of me. Timing my demise perfectly, never wanting me to have my happy ending.Because for people like me, the good things in life come much later than you think.*Contains sexual situations, violence, sensitive and taboo subjects and language.
