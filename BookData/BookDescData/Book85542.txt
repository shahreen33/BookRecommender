“Knock knock!”“Um… Who’s there?”Yeah. That was me, on my last date. Before you feel sorry for me you should know that I was the one telling the jokes. Jokes as in plural, because I didn’t stop with just one. Of course not. Hi, I’m Chloe Scott. The most awkward single girl in the city.But I’m going to get it together. I am. I’m going to learn how to date like a grown up.I’m going to have an orgasm not given to myself. I’m going to fall in love and live happily ever after. Right after I get out of this interrogation room.
