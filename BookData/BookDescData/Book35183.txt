Every day I tell Mama,I want to go home.Every day she tells me,We are home, Angelina.New York is home now. Angelina's heart aches for Jamaica, and no matter how much Mama talks of having a better life in New York, Angelina still dreams about mangos, johnnycake, rainbow-colored birds, and the warmth of the sand under her feet. Then one day Mama sees something in the paper about Carnival in Brooklyn, New York, and she thinks she may have found a way to soothe Angelina's homesickness. With vibrant colors that seem to dance right off the page, Jeanette Winter pays homage to Jamaica and the traditions of the West Indian people.
