Daddy drives Matthew to kindergarten in his old green car. “See you this afternoon,” says Daddy when he drops off Matthew at kindergarten. But Matthew says, “What if, this afternoon, the old green car doesn’t start?” Thus begins a series of what-ifs that Matthew poses to all of Daddy’s ideas about how he’ll fetch him, each one more fantastic than the last: he’ll come by teddy bear, by the wings of birds, by dragon! Finally, Daddy says he’ll use his own two long legs, the ultimate reassurance that he’ll come back for Matthew, no matter what!Author Nadine Brun-Cosme's endearing picture book offers warm comfort to young children that their parent can always be counted on. With gentle and imaginative humor, the father's increasingly wilder ideas about how he will make his way to his son prove the steady and unwavering certainty of a parent's commitment to a child. The whimsical artwork by Aurélie Guillerey plays lightly with the father's flights of fancy, keeping the tone of the book just right for a storytime read-aloud. Filled with the love between the boy and his father, this is a perfect book choice to address separation issues common to kindergartners and preschoolers who have difficulty saying goodbye to their parents.
