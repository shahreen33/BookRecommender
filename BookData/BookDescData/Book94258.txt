In the 5 years since the great war, the world has changed. Now a reluctant Larin must tear himself away from his family to finish the final step of his journey: Finding the last Carver on earth and begging for release of the ancient race an ignorant humanity calls "demons".But across the Linesai mountains, a treacherous and spiteful king has different plans. With death on his heels, Larin must flee across the south continent accompanied by his lethal uncle, a misfit historian, and a strange, selfish girl who speaks only truth. It is a journey that defines this godless age--for along the way, they must assemble answers to the questions that have mystified humanity from day one: Who are the indigen, and how did humanity come to this place?Book 3 of Spellgiver.
