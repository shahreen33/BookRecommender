Four months have passed since Edmund Lowell vanished in Minneapolis. The police have done little to find the homeless transient and his desperate mother finally turns to Private Investigator Justinia Wright to find her son. The former CIA operative hates missing person cases, and refuses this one--until Mr. Lowell agrees to pay a hefty retainer. Even so, it takes the constant badgering of her brother, Harry, to get her to actually work on the case. And when she does, her investigation takes her into the world of the homeless where she uncovers a dark and sinister secret. Festival of Death introduces us to private eye Justinia Wright and her "Watson," her brother and majordomo, Harry, as they work to ferret out the secrets lurking in the dark side of the Twin Cities."
