From the author of the bestselling debut novel of 2015 Luckiest Girl Alive comes Jessica Knoll's new thriller, featuring a pair of competitive and uber-successful sisters whose secrets and lies result in murder.When five hyper-successful, beautiful, and hugely competitive women agree to appear on a new TV show set in New York City called "Goal Diggers", executives expect a season filled with the petty grievances, vicious social media attacks, and outrageous posturing that makes these shows catnip to the viewing public. But they can't anticipate the second season of "Goal Diggers" will feature murder.Structured as a series of episodes, Jessica Knoll's second novel again delivers a deliciously scathing expose and the same hair-raising plot twists readers loved in Luckiest Girl Alive.
