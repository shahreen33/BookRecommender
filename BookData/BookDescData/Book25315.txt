As a schoolgirl, Jane Austen must have suffered terribly under her lessons of English history. The sixteen-year-old finally took revenge and wrote her own history of the Kings and Queens of England. Containing thirteen mischievous portraits of the English Royals, this very entertaining--and incomparably unreliable--history book is illustrated by Mandy Schludt, whose previous work in illustration and book design received the distinguished Stiftung Buchkunst Prize in German (2005).
