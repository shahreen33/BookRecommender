Zara Riddle is a thirty-something woman trying to balance her career and motherhood. Scratch that. Career, motherhood, and being a novice witch.  When someone from her past shows up in the most dramatic fashion (i.e. bleeding and nearly dead), this sassy single mother gains a whole new set of relationship problems to juggle.  And now there's a new ghost haunting Zara, making her do the strangest things, like gardening.  Zara's back yard is starting to resemble the lush lawns of a stately manor, yet not all is calm and serene in Wisteria. There's been an unexplained death, and someone close to the Riddle family is the prime suspect. It's time for Zara to put down her garden spade and trade it for a sharper weapon. Or, at the very least, a bigger shovel.
