The dictionary defines drift as "a driving movement or force." While on a ship at sea, drift is caused from the force of winds and the current. Your life will experience all kinds of forces that will cause you to drift just the same. If you're unaware of those influences in your life, most likely, you'll end up in a place you never intended to go. Jesus didn't die on the cross just to set you free from sin. He died to set you free from drifting throughout this life! DRIFT will challenge you in practical ways to be more intentional in your day to day life. Learn how to get more out of your Bible. Discover how to hear God's voice in prayer. Develop the necessary perspective to break through your past hurt, pain &amp; loss. Whether you are a new believer, coming back to your faith, or have been diligently following for years, this book will help you develop the necessary skills to set your direction through life rather than merely drift.
