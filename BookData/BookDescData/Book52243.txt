Smart, successful, and sitting pretty at the top of her game, Neera Malik has it all figured out. Save for the small issue of Gustavo Guillmand.  The artist with a cult—and Instagram—following has a problem and it's not his preference for shirtless selfies. No, he has an attitude problem, a minding his own business problem, an infuriatingly sexy problem.  They can't stand each other and they can't stay away from each other.   This steamy enemies-to-lovers office romance originally appeared on the Read Me Romance podcast. This edition includes a seriously extended epilogue beyond the podcast content.
