 "Never kick me when I'm down, because when I get back up ... you're screwed." Briar should be living the easy life. She finally checked off the last name on her kill list. The new pack Alpha isn't an a-hole, and her smoking hot shifter boyfriend is finally ready to spelunk her bat-cave. But she should've remembered that life hates her. An unknown evil force is kidnapping people to create an army of drug-induced, soldier-like supernaturals. If that wasn't bad enough, the Abydos, the ancient blood Briar has vowed to protect, has been discovered. Briar must risk moving it before the growing evil in Rouen gets their hands on it. Just when she thinks she's safe, Briar learns of a deep betrayal by someone close to her that threatens not only her pack, but the entire city. She can't fight against it as she is. She must become more, become greater. If she can't accept her destiny and fully embrace the shifter she was meant to be, then history will repeat itself, and she'll lose her pack and everyone she cares about.
