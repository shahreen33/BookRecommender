Twice Navy SEAL Curtis Lloyd has been ready to marry. Twice his bride to be has left him at the last minute for another man. So when a bride and her bridesmaid crash their car just outside Base Camp, in the biggest snowstorm this century, Curtis knows he has to get them to their wedding in Bozeman even if they have to walk the whole way. His motives aren’t entirely selfless: He needs a bride, too, in order to save the sustainable community he joined when he left the military, and feisty maid of honor Hope Martin is just the kind of woman he’d like to take to the altar.
