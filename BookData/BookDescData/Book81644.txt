This novella tells the story of Johnny and Diane Laski, a sculptor and his wife, and their attempt to bring a new life into the world, during a cold Maine winter, deep in the country.William Kotzwinkle tells the story of the coupleâ€™s night drive to the hospital, their long labour, and their ultimately, unsuccessful breech birth. Unafraid of his subject, Kotzwinkle destroys any sentimental illusions about the beauty of childbirth or the distance of birth from death; he reminds us of how closely the two are intertwined, of the frightening power of the life force, and of the unpredictability and uncanniness of death.And yet, his small book is not without hope."A beautiful piece of work... the economy of the writing and the matter-of-fact acceptance make it immensely moving" - The Daily Telegraph"Swimming in the Secret Sea is a deeply moving book. The textures of its delicately conveyed anguish, simplicity make its grief all the more stunning." - Publishers Weekly"Swimmer in the Secret Sea reveals a depth of emotion and an immensity of feeling seldom seen in American writers today."- The San Francisco Review of BooksWilliam Kotzwinkle, well-known for his many enduring children's books such as Trouble in Bugland and his novelisation of the movie E.T. The Extraterrestrial, is equally adept at writing seriously and poetically about life in extremis. He is also well known in the UK for his adult novel Fata Morgana and Dr. Rat.
