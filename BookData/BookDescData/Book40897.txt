 
  He was looking for a wanted man, missing jewels, and a prize horse. But all he found was a young woman...that would change his life.
   Regina Maythorpe craves more adventure than what the high society of Philadelphia has to offer. The balls are the same, the tea parties are dull, and her parents wants her to marry an old man.  But she wants the wind in her hair and the Wild West before her.  When this charming man writes to promise her a life of adventure, Regina is more than eager to accept. She doesn’t need love, or so she says...  Sheriff Xavier Martinez has plans of his own. He wants to improve his little town to make it last. Putting his gunslinger days behind him, he is seeking for the opportunity to build a better legacy than one printed in bullets.  Until he stumbles on her.  When Regina is deserted by her betrothed in a small town without her jewels, she realizes this new adventure might just leave her in over her head. Trapped in a cell in the middle of nowhere, Regina must find a way to convince that sheriff that she’s not a thief - and she wants justice.  Xavier, on the other hand, will have to find a way to bring the railroad to his town and ensure that it has a future - and that young woman holds the key.
