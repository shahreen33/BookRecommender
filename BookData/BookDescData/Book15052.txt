"I didn't quite understand any of this. I wasn't a fan of his. I despised his administration and everything it stood for, but yet I wanted him in the worst way." Kayla is stuck in a rut writing puff pieces for a magazine that she doesn’t even like and is far from being a political reporter for a publication with actual substance. Until then she writes a political blog that blasts the current administration and their policies. She can feel her big break coming soon when she gets the chance to do a piece on the President. President Matthew Von Hansen is the youngest president to date and the first single president in the last 130 years. He’s found himself in the seat of power, but with no real power. He wants to make a difference, but that can be hard when being forced to stay within party lines. Matthew is everything that Kayla despises about Washington or so she originally thinks. Sparks fly and love is on the horizon, but can these two find their way around broken politics?
