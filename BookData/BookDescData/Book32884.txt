A brand new best-friends-to-lovers romcom from Emma Hart.Let your homeless best friend stay with you, he said. Being roommates will be fun, he said. It's only temporary, he said.He never said I'd fall for him.You know what isn't 'temporary?' The endless stream of dirty socks in my bathroom and empty food packets under the sofa—and don't even get me started on the hot guys who take over my living room every Sunday to watch sports.I can't take anymore. So I propose a roommate agreement. One that will bring peace and order back to my life, complete with rules that might just stop my newfound crush on my best friend in its tracks.After all, there’s only so many times you can see your best friend naked before you start to lose your mind.Rules. They're meant to be broken... Aren't they?
