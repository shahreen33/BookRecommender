America’s first serial killer is on the loose…  It’s 1885 in Austin, Texas, and a string of grisly murders has put the entire country on edge. Eight murders have happened within city limits, each in eerily similar circumstances, and the police are no closer to catching the culprit than when they started. Austin needs a hero to put an end to this brutal reign of terror, and fast.  Enter bounty hunter Frank Vito. Brought in by the marshal to help solve the Servant Girl Murders, as the papers are now calling them, Frank is damned and determined to put a stop to these killings…especially when they hit just a little too close to home.  But as always, Vito makes enemies along the way, including, perhaps, his daring partner Ellie Stockwell. With the killer hot on his trail and set on making Vito pay, it’s only a matter of time before this investigation comes to a violent, bloody end.  The second entry in the BESTSELLING Frank Vito Bounty Hunter Series, The Servant Girl Murders is a heart pounding mystery inspired by true events that can also be read as a standalone novel.
