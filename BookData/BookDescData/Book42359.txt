Six days. That’s the amount of time until Lezah’s execution. She’ll die never knowing what got her locked up in this godforsaken prison in the first place. Her only chance of survival is to escape. Except the monitoring bracelet that digs into her wrist, the roaming AI, and the implant in her neck make freedom close to impossible. Her best chance is to team up with the four other inmates who are determined to break out, even if one of them is beyond (gorgeous) annoying—oh, and in for murder. But he has a secret of his own. One that could break Lezah if she finds out, but could also set him free. Figuring out how to work with him and the rest of this mismatched group of criminals is the only way Lezah will survive to see the outside world again. But nothing in this prison is as it seems. And no one.
