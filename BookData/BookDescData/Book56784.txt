  When I went to my neighbour’s apartment to investigate strange sounds, I never expected to fall through a portal into another world. Yet here I am, a stranger in an even stranger land... and I'm stranded. In this world, might makes right, men carry swords, and gods walk the earth. Within minutes of arriving, I’m enslaved!
  
    
      Fun place...
    
  
  How do I get home? GREAT question. Wish I had an answer!
  The one person that might be able to help me is also the one person I want to throttle most. Aron, Lord of Storms, Butcher God of Battle, is my new companion. Or rather, I'm his. As Aron's anchor to the mortal realm, I'm the one that's supposed to be guiding him through his exile in the mortal world...
  Ha. Joke's on him. I know nothing about this place!
  But Aron and I have a common goal - get home. And we're bonded - anchor and god - with a bond unlike any other. So we travel together. We bicker. We bathe together. We fight our many, many enemies together. And sure, he’s a god, but he’s also an arrogant jerk. Brawny, smoking hot, irresistible jerk. I should want nothing to do with him. I certainly shouldn’t want to do things to him...
  Mortals and gods don’t mix. We stick to the plan and ignore our attraction. Focused, with one goal in mind...
  
    
      One task...
    
    
    
      One goal...
    
    
    
      Focused!
    
  
  
    
      I-oh heck, I’m going to end up kissing him again, aren’t I?
