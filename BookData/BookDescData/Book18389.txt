What happened to Dr. Jonathan Brandon, a dashing RAF flight surgeon, who disappeared from London in 1945? Kidnapping? Murder? Or did Brandon merely vanish of his own free will, seeking another life? American teacher Anne Howard is stunned by a different explanation―that her British grandmother’s long-lost fiancé was unwillingly wrenched back through time, to Elizabethan England. Anne knows time travel is nonsense―until she is handed a fresh-cut thornless rose, a bloom extinct for over four hundred years! And then, when the impossible happens and Anne journeys back to 1560 London, she must somehow survive encounters with royal enemies, accusations of witchcraft and the possibility of never returning home. In the midst of the chaos, she meets Brandon. Drawn into the perilous web of Elizabethan court life, they must confront their growing feelings for each other, complicated by poignant familial ties, while struggling with the shared danger of knowing what the future holds.
