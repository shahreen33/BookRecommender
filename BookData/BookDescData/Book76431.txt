Delve deeper into the mafia world of Gilded Cage, where dominant alpha males take what they want and never look back... My name is Ryker Marino. There's only one thing you need to know about me. I hate my f*cking brother. His bride, Ophelia, should have been mine from the start. I can give her what she needs. I can make her submit. And I am the one that will finally break her. The curse of the younger brother follows me everywhere I go. I'm compared to Max every damn minute of my life. But not anymore. Not for much longer. You were taught to root for the good guy. You never wanted to fall for the bad boy. I'm here to prove you wrong. I'm here to make your filthy dreams come true.
