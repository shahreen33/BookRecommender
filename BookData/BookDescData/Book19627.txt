Where Pain Thrives is a collection of poems in three chapters by Danish poet Mie Hansson. Autobiographical, and at times erotically so, the book takes the reader from a bitter adolescence to toxic love affairs before leaping into a bohemian life where pain would come to thrive. Each section explores the relationship between joy and pain, and the different fashions in which they undress. “Do not judge a woman on her knees; you never know how tall she is when she stands”
