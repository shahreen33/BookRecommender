Thanks to the talent of her pushbutton super-horse, Ava, Mavis wins every ribbon, trophy, and championship she competes for. No rider effort required, and not much skill either – Ava does it all.  So, when Mavis’s dad loses his job, and Ava must go up for sale, Mavis is swamped with … relief.  She knows it’s the wrong thing to feel, but Mavis is used to feeling, thinking, and acting the wrong way. It’s why she has no friends.  Also, riding’s been really boring, for a long time.  With super-Ava sold super-fast, Mavis is ready to start enjoying her horse-free life.  Until she meets Lucas. Lucas is everything Ava’s not. Stocky, dirty, untrained, and unproven, the former trail horse has the complete opposite on Mavis as her former show mare did.  Mavis likes Lucas. She loves him, even.  Lucas has a lot to learn, but it might be Mavis who gains the most from their new, unlikely, partnership.
