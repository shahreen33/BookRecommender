Vampires are coming out of the woodwork, a new evil walks the hallowed streets of Putney, South London and the ridiculed Putney Vampire Killers face their biggest challenge yet – saving the World…and Boat Race Day…in under 12 hours.  Armed with their magical pool cues and working out of The Great Lodge, a living building disguised as a pub (The Pig &amp; Phoenix) and rumoured to have gone senile, Carl, Lola, Johnny and Bert take on a host of supernatural beings on the Lower Richmond Road while trying to rid the world of the infamous magical Eight Ball. Vampires, zombies, fish demons, Time Police and a pan-dimensional indestructible plague of female pirates stand between them and the end of the planet. Can they do it and get back in time to open the pub before a swarm of angry punters have their necks?
