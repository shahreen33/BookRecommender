In her seventeenth Alexandra Cooper novel, New York Times bestselling author Linda Fairstein delivers an edge-of-your-seat thriller that explores the secrets—and terrible danger—of New York City’s waterfront. The Manhattan waterfront is one of New York City’s most beautiful vistas, boasting both the noble Statue of Liberty and the George Washington Bridge, the world’s busiest for motor vehicles. But in Devil’s Bridge, Assistant DA Alex Cooper will discover the menace that lurks in this seemingly benign corner of New York City as she and Detective Mike Chapman, in the midst of their own growing relationship, take on a case that forces them into their most vulnerable positions yet—apart from each other, as a killer’s twisted plan draws ever closer to home.
