 Mr. Right has never been so freakin’ wrong.  I'm a single mom and a cop. When some arrogant superstar thinks he can speed through my town and smirk and charm his way out of a ticket, he’s wrong. I wrote the ticket and impounded his car.  Then he moved in next door.  This muscled up god with his glorious physique, panty-dropping smile and smart mouth is my new neighbor. He hates the ‘burbs, but that doesn’t seem to stop him from flirting with me every chance he gets. As if strutting around in boxers with his abs and chest on display is enough to make me forget his snide comments and wisecracks. Oh sure, he knows how to turn on the charm... like I'll fall for that.  I bet that would make a great story, bagging the cop that gave him the ticket- but I’m not some ditzy arm candy lining up to be the next notch in his bedpost.  I don’t have time to fool around. It doesn’t matter if he’s hot, and younger than I am, and just looking at him makes my legs shake.  The closer we get, the more I think I misjudged him. Somewhere beneath that arrogant smirk is a good man, maybe even the right man, but my past threatens to shatter us both...  BENCHED is a standalone, full-length romance with an HEA. This special edition includes a second full length novel, Player's Princess, with an all new, exclusive epilogue!
