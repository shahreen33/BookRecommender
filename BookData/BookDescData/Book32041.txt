Two rather young women, Amy and Helen, traveling with an older uncle, are doing the "tour" of Europe, and are supposedly soaking up education but secretly yearning for adventures and romance. At this wish for adventure, a pair of gloves suddenly drops beside them from a balcony above their hotel room near Coblentz. Ah, whose gloves? The two young men who enter the lives of these ladies are rich and eligible adventurers traveling through Europe, and agree to play a prank on the young women by becoming aides to their uncle.
