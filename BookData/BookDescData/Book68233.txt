For the Bratva, retribution is the law. An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth. A life for a life.  But the man who killed my beloved deserves a fate worse than death. He’ll live knowing his only daughter was captured by a monster... That he’s utterly powerless to stop me.  Olena Baranov will be my prisoner. My retribution. My undoing. Vengeance will be mine.
