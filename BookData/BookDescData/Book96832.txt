Reese Bradford is a typical Bradford, he enjoys his food, is easy on the eyes, and has a killer smile, but there's one thing about him that he doesn't want anyone to know about, which of course is the first thing that his ex-fiance makes sure that everyone finds out about after she leaves him for his best friend. Out of options, he reluctantly heads out of town to spend the summer in the cottage that he'd rented for his honeymoon only to find himself tormented by a woman that never should have crossed his mind twice.More intrigued than he'd ever thought possible, he can't help but wonder about the woman that made him smile.
