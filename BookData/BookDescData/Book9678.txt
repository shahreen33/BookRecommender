Open your heart and mind to the simplicity and complexity of a name.I know only my name. Beyond that is confusion, a void where fantasy and reality swirl together. Fairies, Giants, Elves, Dwarves, ancient Keepers, and...Dragons?A dark soul threatens the Five Kingdoms, but I am powerless to stand against it, overwhelmed by phantom memories, broken and lost.Somehow, I must live. I must find my purpose. There are friends to love and battles to fight.I know my name. Perhaps that is enough.I am Ocilla.This is my story.
