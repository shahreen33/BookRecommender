Recovered from a strong box on the Millennium Falcon, Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide traces its own extraordinary journey through such notorious characters as Maz Kanata, Hondo Ohnaka, Drydon Vos, Lando Calrissian, and Han Solo. Explore previously unknown details about the underhanded dealings of the galaxy's underworld. The lengths to which the underworld will go for a legendary prize is unparalleled. What started as a simple logbook with a piece of valuable information was soon stolen, traded, and smuggled around the outer rim and shady ports. With each pirate, thief, gambler, and criminal who took possession of the book, new insight and details were added, creating the Smuggler's Guide--a coveted collection of hidden treasure locations, advice, and hard-earned data.
