How should an atheist respond to a sneeze? In an argument, how do you kick ass when you don't have a leg to stand on? After years of exploring the small pockets in life's backpack in his celebrated weekend Guardian 'How to...' column, Guy Browning has become the authority on such matters. The runaway #1 British Bestseller Never Hit a Jellyfish with a Spade offers intelligent, practical advice on the level you need it, the trivial level: o How to evaluate a bottle of wine (if the alcohol content is less than 15 percent, send it straight back) o How to get what you want at the barber's (no multipart instructions, please)  o How to stay warm in bed (when your partner has cold feet and steals the covers)  o How to be a fashionista (when your twenty-year-old wardrobe is suddenly back in vogue)  o How to pretend to laugh at a friend's joke (the closest most men get to faking orgasm)  o How to fix a computer (If restarting it doesn't work, turn it off and go back to a pre- industrial lifestyle.)  Covering cooking and eating, sleeping and waking, men and women, love and marriage, religion and politics, hedges and neighbors, Never Hit a Jellyfish with a Spade delivers the truth about the things that really matter. With a package as fun as its contents, it's the ideal gift for anyone who wants to live life with a sense of humor.
