"The History of My Insanity" is the memoirs of Trisha Paytas. It takes an in depth look at the real world of stripping, escorting, and what the overall sex industry can do to a person's mental state. The book inquires to the thought that someone can become crazy over time through courses of life's events rather than just born to be that way. A prelude to the upcoming "The Stripper Diaries", this book gives insight to the world of exotic dancing, prostitution and more. "The History of my Insanity" is a real, raw, and true book about a girl's life full of regrets, written to inspire others to do more than they think they can.
