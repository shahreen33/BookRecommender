It was supposed to just be a quick trip to Manhattan.My best friend was heartbroken. She needed support, and I needed inspiration.I hoped to love the city. Bustling. Crazy. Inspiring New York.But I ended up at the airport, heading home in the same condition that I arrived.In a rut.Add to all that, missing my flight and losing my laptop—the laptop, where the Best Love Story Ever sat on my hard drive.Enter Noah Steele. Eerily familiar. Movie star. Heartthrob. Sultry romeo with bedroom eyes.(But we’re not going there.)He missed his flight too.Noah is so smoldering, lip-bitingly hot, he’s not taken seriously as an actor, and is struggling to launch his career in New York.He’s only ever had superficial girlfriends, so he’s having trouble showing true passion in his acting—the same challenge I’m having with this book.When we met, we didn’t know that our connection would bring us the change we’d been craving.That we’d be the very thing the other needed and didn’t know.Each other’s muse.** MUSE is a complete standalone, no previous reading is necessary to enjoy.
