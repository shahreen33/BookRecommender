“I thought I knew who I was, but I was wrong.”The Silver Swan- 1.  A girl who is tarnished. Tainted. One who does not fit into the confinement of legend.The Silver Swan-2. Madison Montgomery.I was lied to.I was cheated.Resigned to pick up the scraps of empty memories and disarrayed thoughts, I left. After finally cutting the strings of manipulation, I resorted to do what I’ve done since I was a child, something my father drilled into my brain since I could handle my first rifle.Run.I’m a mere shadow of the girl they all knew.Lies and deceit change you. They alter your entire outlook on life.I’m Madison Montgomery, and I want to play a game.Here’s what happens when I win.Riddle me this, Mads.What goes bump in the night,but is something you can’t see with sight?You may run, and you may hide.If by happily ever after, you mean Bonnie &amp; Clyde.
