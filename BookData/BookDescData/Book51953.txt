In this creative wonder, artist Monte Shin uses shape and symmetry to turn what look like random squiggles into recognizable forms. This uniquely interactive book needs the reader's help to finish the pictures, because they can only be seen using the attached fold-up mirror. Once the mirror is in place, readers can spin the central art on each page to reveal not only an array of fun abstract shapes, but a delightfully surprising final image. Enormously fun to play with, little ones will get a taste of how this book works on the MirrorPlayBook YouTube video or by using the QR code on the back cover.
