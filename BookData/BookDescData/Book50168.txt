Some ties can never be severed.Illusion. A word shaded with nuance, making the men who practice it-the masters-enigmas. Particularly when they magically materialize from the shadows of a woman's past.It's been fifteen years. No longer the tormented young men Blair knew and loved so long ago, Damon and Trey still know how to touch her heart, how to draw out her secrets, and how to bring her to the edge of ecstasy. Blair has two weeks to unravel the ties that have bound the three of them together. Two weeks to solve the mysteries veiled by her seductive masters' illusions.And two weeks to surrender to the smoldering desires burning in her body as she submits to their darkest demands.
