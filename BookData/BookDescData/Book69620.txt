DI Ray McBain's new case finds the victim’s family and friends all under suspicion, and he has to untangle a sordid web of lies, deceit, blackmail, infidelity and cyberstalking. When Stigmata, a deranged serial killer from McBain’s tortured past, starts taking out new victims—with the suspects and McBain himself in his sights—the case gets even more treacherous. The pressure intensifies until McBain calls on Kenny O’Neill, his old underworld crony and Glasgow's answer to Tony Soprano, to help watch his back. Will that be enough to stop the killing?
