Young for his class and small for his age, Porter Osborne, Jr., leaves his rural Georgia home in 1938 to meet the world at Willingham University, armed with the knowledge that he has been "Raised Right" in the best Baptist tradition. What happens over the next four years will challenge the things he holds infallible: his faith, his heritage, and his parents' omniscience. As we follow Porter's college career, full of outrageous pranks and ribald humor, we sense a quiet, constant flow toward maturity.
