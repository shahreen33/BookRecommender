Rabbit doesn't want to go to bed, so he decides to kidnap The Dark and trap it in a cookie tin so he can stay up all night long. But then The Dark reminds Rabbit of all the good things that darkness brings. What about all the nocturnal animals? And surely you can't have a yummy breakfast of toast and honey and fresh orange juice unless you've been to bed? But the BEST thing about the dark, of course, is reading a really good bedtime story!
