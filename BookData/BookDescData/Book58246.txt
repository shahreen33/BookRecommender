Get ready for SUPERMAN: TRUE BRIT, an original hardcover graphic novel with a humorous new take on the Superman legend, courtesy of writer Kim "Howard" Johnson (Monty Python: The First 280 Years) with some help in his comics debut from Monty Python's John Cleese (Fawlty Towers, A Fish Called Wanda)! And with art by fan-favorites John Byrne (JLA, DOOM PATROL) and Mark Farmer (JLA: ANOTHER NAIL), this book is sure to be Super! In this veddy British tale, the Last Son of Krypton's rocket ship crash-lands in an English town even smaller than Smallville, where the infant Kal-El is taken in by adoptive parents - the Clarks - who raise their son Colin to hide his powers, because the worst thing anyone can do is stand out in the crowd. But when Colin grows up to become a mild-mannered reporter working for the Daily Smear, a powerful tabloid newspaper dedicated to uncovering the biggest story of the century, he finds that the key to his success may be in going public. What will the neighbors think?
