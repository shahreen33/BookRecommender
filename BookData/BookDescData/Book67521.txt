They say I’ll be able to sleep when I’m dead. The jokes on them…  The alphas expected me to be dead by now. The fact that I’m not? Well, they’re beginning to have questions.  Questions I can’t let them discover the answers to.  So I need to figure out a way to get them off my case, especially if I want any chance at uncovering the secrets of this school. The only problem? I’m beginning to think it isn’t just curiosity driving the alphas in my direction.  But they can’t actually like me? Can they?  ROYAL ALPHAS is a bully academy reverse harem romance. All the characters are over eighteen. There is swearing and sexual situations. It is also a series of "episodes," like television episodes. Each story will be short, and it will end on a cliffhanger, but the next episode will come soon after.
