Everywhere I look, my friends are settling down - marriage, children, white picket fences; but not me. Marriage isn't in the cards for me. I’m a ladies man. A rock star. I was born and raised in the industry. I love everything about my life, especially the attention from the women that my status brings me. Women find me. I don’t chase. I know what they want and they know I’ll deliver. But after one look, one touch, one night... Now I’m the one doing the chasing. I need to find a way to show her that I’m serious, that I can change. I need to find a way to show her that I can love her fully, and only her. I need to find a way to show her that she’s my forever.
