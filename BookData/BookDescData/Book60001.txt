Years ago, everybody knew that the earth was flat. Everybody knew that the sun revolved around the earth. Today, everybody knows that life on earth is either the result of random evolution or the work of a supernatural God. Or is it? In "Message from the Designers," Rael presents us with a third option: that all life on earth was created by advanced scientists from another world. During a UFO encounter in 1973, he was given the first of a series of messages, face to face, by one of these designers. Those messages now lie within the pages of this book - an astonishing revelation for mankind.
