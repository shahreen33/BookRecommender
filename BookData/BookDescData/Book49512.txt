My friends are being slaughtered one by one. Decapitated. Burned alive. Chopped to pieces.The hooded killer has vowed to keep murdering people I care about until they’re all dead, their profile pics on social media replaced with photos of their mutilated bodies. The police can’t catch him. They have no leads.The horror is making the visions come back—the fire that took my parents, leaving my twin Alex and me alive, but broken.The hooded killer won’t stop until I’m completely shattered. He’ll eat away at my mind, heart, and soul until there’s nothing left. No one left to love, no one left to trust, and nothing I can be sure is real.Dr. Cross thinks a trip back to the place my parents died will stop the visions. Alex is afraid it’s a trap.But I know the hooded killer won’t hurt me. That’s not his game. His game is much deeper. Much darker.
