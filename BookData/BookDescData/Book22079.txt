Leah Manning grew up among so many domineering, protective males that it left her frustrated, longing for a different life. Her family couldn’t, or wouldn’t, understand that she needed to dance, and she’d lived away for several years. Unknowing, she’d embroiled herself in a deadly game from which there seemed no way out. Now she was home. Would her family welcome her back? What if trouble followed? Most importantly, did Cal still work the ranch? Brian Calhoun,Cal to his friends, had hated Leah when she’d left, but hated himself even more for not going after her. Now she was back and more lovely than ever. Would his adolescent love for her return, develop into something more, or die a slow death at the hands of this new Leah? Trouble does follow Leah home, and her ex will stop at nothing—even murder—to silence her. Will the terror draw them closer together or drive them apart forever?
