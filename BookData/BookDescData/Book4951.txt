Deep in the muggy swamps where there is but one rule, kill or be killed, a new species has emerged—born not from nature but spawned from evil. Octavia wasn’t stupid. Those unfortunate souls who have crossed paths with her didn’t just become swamp creatures, they became the least deadly of them. She hadn’t counted on the strong spirits of those she’d cursed.  From those murky swamp depths, a hero emerged. The type from which legends are born. Moss, whose sensual iridescent tattoos are in fact thanks to his reptilian side, still struggles to come to terms with his fate and wants nothing more than to be left alone.  Beth’s life becomes upturned when she reluctantly agrees to accompany her idiotic brother on a hunt for the Bog Man. When she becomes separated from the others she comes face to face with the legend himself . . . only no one ever mentioned how damn sexy he was. The swamp’s dark history tests the duo on their survival skills as well as luring them deeper into the magic of the swamp.
