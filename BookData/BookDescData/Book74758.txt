Learn how to spot the lies and deceptions of our politicians in action. You can’t turn on the television, check your phone, or scroll through social media without being besieged with political headlines and the "Who’s Who" of today’s news. With so much spoon-fed to us by the media, fake news, and from politicians themselves, it’s time to  take the reins and control what you see, feel, and know so you can make informed political choices in our hot, political environment. In The Body Language of Politics, body language expert Dr. Donna Van Natten provides you with the tools and resources that you need to analyze movements of today's most notable politicians. She looks at some of the looming figures in our political landscape—Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, among others—and analyzes their physical behaviors, breaking down the lies and deceptions embedded in their everyday movements. Further, Dr. Van Natten challenges you to understand your own emotional biases towards certain politicians, and examine how that may skew your read of their body language. Finally, she confronts the gendered stereotypes that we often apply to our nation's leaders, examining how those labels play into our opinions of politicians. Clear, concise, and filled with expert knowledge, The Body Language of Politics will help you make an informed decision at the voting booth.
