Kat doesn’t believe in happily-ever-afters – and she’s far too practical to believe in fairytales. Royalty may be on the guest list of the parties she works but Prince Charming never shows up. She’s definitely not the damsel in distress he’d be looking for either; she can take care of herself, her brother the emotional artist, and anyone else that comes along just fine. Sebastian, the Royal Rebel of Sezynia, doesn’t believe in love or commitment – he’s more into one-night stands. His greatest ambition in life is to be James Dean, not a king. But to prevent his conniving cousin from taking the throne, that’s exactly what he has to be. There’s just one small problem – Sebastian has to be married to do it. Not an easy feat for the guy who’s spent his life avoiding all sense of responsibility. When Sebastian and Kat meet its fate – the prince definitely needs a lesson in propriety. But Kat has doubts – princes and propositions were never part of her plan. Then again, where’s the harm in helping the flirty prince find a wife anyway?
