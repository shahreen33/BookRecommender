Being spellbound has its charms...When you're half-incubus, your reputation precedes you.All eyes are on Gabriel Mac Braire the day he makes his first appearance in the Seelie Court, including those of Aislinn Finvarra. Despite deep bitterness over her last failed relationship, Aislinn cannot help but be curious about the half incubus who is known to possess dark magick, both lethal and sexual in nature. Rumors abound of the women who have become enslaved to his irresistible charms.So when the Summer Queen of the fae orders Aislinn herself to act as his guide in the court, she is understandably on guard. She's fallen under the spell of far less persuasive men before. In addition, Gabriel might be more than he seems, and his true mission is far from innocent.This time, Aislinn must protect not only her heart, but her very life.
