It started on day one… New school. New life. And there he was, the boy I grew up with, walking up the steps of my very first class. Except now, the boy from my memories was gone, and his place was an Adonis of a man. It didn’t take much for me to fall for him. Even though I knew we were doomed from the start. But when you find something that perfect, you don't second guess it. Until it ends. Four years later, he’s back. Steamrolling through my life like he never broke my heart to begin with. Only this time, I’m older, wiser and know that second chances are the stuff of fairytales. *A standalone contemporary romance!*
