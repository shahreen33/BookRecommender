Theater actress and occasional thief, Josephine Hewes, lives in Belyne a beautiful yet treacherous city where the dead don't always stay dead and the living sometimes disappear. She's played many roles on stage, but after her father is abducted by a mage assassin and her family is threatened, she must play the most dangerous role of her life - the hero. Foreign diplomat and altruistic friend, Ian Weatherall, has struggled to maintain the illusion of a harmonious marriage to the local princess for the sake of their son, the heir and future king, but the theft of a special dagger may be just the tipping point that puts an end to the illusion and advances the prospects of war. Dashing nobleman and cunning manipulator, Devin Ragget, thrives on managed chaos and commands a vast web of deceit. He has his eye on a grand prize and he will not stop until all his dreams are achieved, no matter the cost or casualties. In a city of hundreds of thousands where the majority despise their biracial heir, it doesn't take much to stoke their animosity and when their ugly prejudices explode in vicious ways, it doesn't take long to realize that true peace cannot be achieved when society is ruled by savage nobles. Stolen Crown, which ends the adventure begun in Stolen Dagger and continued in Stolen Justice, is the third and final part of The Savage Nobles. The three books which form one continuous narrative is a companion novel to The Penitent Assassin as they are both set in the fantastical land of Gallesia.
