We like Jeff Goldblum. You like Jeff Goldblum. Helen McClory likes Jeff Goldblum. Treat yourself to The Goldblum Variations, a collection of flash fictions, stories and games on the one and only Jeff Goldblum as he, and alternate versions of himself, travels through the known (and unknown) Universe in a mighty celebration of weird and wonderful Goldbluminess. Maybe he's cooking, maybe he's wearing a nice jumper, maybe he's reading this very pamphlet. The possibilities are endless. Available exclusively here: http://www.404ink.com/store/the-goldb...
