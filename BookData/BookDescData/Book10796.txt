Life is like high school.For Grey Talbot teaching high school history was a choice. When a gorgeous blond punk of a kid walks into his class with attitude to spare, Grey fears his choice might just be his undoing. High school kids kept getting younger and Paul Gaines stayed the same. Moving from one city narcotics unit to the next, his youthful looks and slender body made him a perfect undercover cop for the job. Meeting the professor wasn't part of the deal.

Fire that could burn them both.Warning: This is a Mercy Celeste book. Proceed with caution. Contents are hot!
