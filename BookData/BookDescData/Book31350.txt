Falling in love with your boss is never a good idea. Now if someone could just explain that to my heart.  Dane: When I first started working for Holt Atwood, I respected him. That respect turned to like, and eventually into love.  But Holt is married to his job, and I am not about playing second fiddle to mergers and acquisitions. So it’s time to move on.  I can do this one last thing for him though. I can go on this singles cruise with him and help him see that work isn’t all there is to life. If I can do that, I will feel better about leaving him with such short notice.  Holt: Work has been my focus for so long I’ve forgotten what it’s like to just let go and have fun.  At first, when my parents insisted I go on this cruise because I was on the fast track to burn out, I thought I could take my assistant along and make it a work trip.  But Dane has other ideas, and the longer I am around him outside of work, the more I realize maybe everyone is right. Maybe I have been so focused on work I’ve missed what’s really important.  I just hope it’s not too late to convince Dane I want him for more than work. I want him forever.
