RHYSONShe doesn't wear my ring.We never stood before a preacher.The only vows exchanged were between our bodies; between our souls.But she was mine and I was hers until I ruined it. I have to believe that every day, every step, every breath brings me closer to making things right. To making her mine again.KAII've seen promises broken. I know love makes no guarantees.But things were different for Rhys and me, until he lied, and I walked away. Only there's a chain between our hearts that I can't break. Even if I forgive him, a shadow from my past hangs over us; over this love that reaches all the way down to my soul.
