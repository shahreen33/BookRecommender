All Bertie wants to do is cook. Well, actually, become a Certified Master Chef, host his own prime-time cooking show, own a four-star restaurant, and write a best-selling cookbook. Cooking is Bertieâ€™s big secret. His business-obsessed dad wants him to become an accountant. His New Age mom wants him to become a dream analyst. His math teacher wants him to repeat eighth grade. And his mortal enemy just wants him dead. Will Bertie find the courage to reveal his passion for cooking? Will his bravery win him the girl? Will he turn the tables on the class bully and get his revenge? Or will Bertie chicken out and spend the rest of his life analyzing the dreams of his fellow accountants?
