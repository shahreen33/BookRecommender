On her eighteenth birthday, Sasha Pierce's perfect life tragically comes crashing down. Now, working at a Strip Club in New York City, her only focus is surviving from one day to the next-at least until a handsome stranger makes her an offer that she can't refuse. Everything about Jaxon Edwards draws her in. His charm, his mystery, and especially his simple request; to accompany him to his sister's wedding as his fake fiance and to live with him for six months in exchange for more money than Sasha could ever imagine. But, to top it all off, he also offers her a glimpse into a dark, secret lifestyle unlike anything she's ever experienced.
