A flamboyantly dressed man enters a bank and proceeds to commit a most curious robbery. Rather than demanding money or jewelry, he asks each of his thirteen victims to surrender that which they hold most valuable: a calculator, a cheap watch, photographs of children, a copy of The Stranger, and so on. The lives of the robbery victims then begin to come apart in otherworldly yet strangely fitting ways, forcing them to discover and claim that which is truly valuable to them before it's too late. The Tiny Wife, the latest work of contemporary wonder from bestselling and award-nominated author Andrew Kaufman, is an imaginative and inspiring display of pure storytelling.Length: 1hrs 41min
