He’s also called in when someone needs to be turned. Sean’s oath to never mix business with pleasure takes a hit after he changes a dying but extremely sexy Morgan Grady. Against his will he’s drawn to her, but her penchant for disobeying orders makes him want to file his fangs.Morgan, a Los Angeles undercover police officer, never considered vampires might actually be real until she’s shot and left for dead...and awakens an immortal. But just because the hot and sexy Sean changed her doesn’t mean he gets to call the shots. She’s her own woman and plans to do what she always does and on her own terms—fight evil. When confronted with an entity bent on destroying them, Sean and Morgan must fight together, facing not only their enemy but also the terrifying possibility that they were meant to be together forever.
