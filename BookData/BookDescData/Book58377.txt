For hundreds of years, the stone heads of Easter Island have sat perched on their platforms, gazing mystically out over land and sea. Now the impressive Pacific site can be viewed on a desktop near you! This kit comes with four miniature replicas of stone heads of Easter Island in various shapes and sizes. One can stare back above a computer screen like a micromanaging boss, while others act as paperweights or mesmerize co-workers to turn away each time they reach for your candy dish. Those heads will never let a cubicle or office feel lonely again!
