  Samantha:
I had the perfect life; a husband who loved me, and two kids who were my world. Until someone else answered his phone and my perfect life shattered. When he died, I was left with answers he couldn't give me and a box full of lies. He left me broken. 
  Blake:
I fell in love when I was fifteen, knowing she was the one. For five years, she was my everythingâ€”my every breath, every heartbeat, every thought. She made me promise to move on, promise to find love again, but I broke those promises because I can't move on. 
  Two broken souls brought together by tragedy and heartbreak. Can a broken love story be fixed?
