And his sister Amanda should know the two things Zach hates more than surprises is change and people touching his stuff. Gabrielle Lee Interiors &amp; More has done all that — and more.Zach survived Houthi rebels, but he might not survive these two women.Just when he finally gets Gabby out of his house, if not out of his mind because she is as distracting as she is exasperating, she goes missing and he has to find her.When he does, things get wild — and not just from the chemistry they’ve been trying to ignore for more than a decade.What happens in Tijuana... might just get you killed.
