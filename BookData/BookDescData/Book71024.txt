Brighton WalkerI'm a bit of a mess. I'm hyperactive, but lazy at the same time. I apparently have an annoying pen tapping problem. I can't cook even pre-made meals without a major catastrophe happening and I'm a little on the forgetful side. All reasons having a roommate isn't really a great idea. Which makes it a bit of a problem when my aunt kicks me out of the house I have been living in since I was born. Now I need a place to live, and Knox, one of my closest friends and the man who stole my heart almost from the moment I met him, is kind enough to offer the spare room in his house, but I just know I'm going to fuck this up. I'm just waiting for the day when the crazy ball of reckless energy that surrounds me at every turn is going to bounce right off of Knox's head and mess up his routine life.Knox GreenI am a man of routine and I don't like for that routine to be interrupted… with the exception of it being interrupted by Brighton. He is funny and sweet and gorgeous and hates walking with the type of dedication professional athletes put into their career, which is why I usually carry him everywhere. When Brighton needs help with a place to live, I am more than happy to take him in. Spending time with the man has never been a hardship, and my feelings for him aside, having someone around all the time would be nice. I might not have been prepared for the type of life having him in my house has become, but even with one catastrophe after another, my feelings for him grow daily. Now if I could just find a way to prove to him that I won't ditch him at the first sign of trouble. As with all my books, this series is pretty fluffy. Not much angst at all, no cheating and definitely a happy ending! Meant to be a light hearted read to make you laugh… or at least smile.Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses::
