Bringing her into their world, was not part of the plan.When Samantha (aka Sam) finds herself falling in love with not one, but two men she's been having a no-strings m√©nage relationship with, she decides splitting up is the right thing to do. Jordan and Alex refuse to commit, but Sam needs more stability in her life, especially when she finds out she is about to take on a whole lot more responsibility.Jordan and Alex grew up together in a small town of jaguar shifters, where being a half-blood was looked down upon, even by their own fathers. Once they became adults, they left their community and joined a secret military operation call the Alpha Division, a team of shifters keeping the peace with any means necessary, and their next mission comes close to home. Both men feel they have too many secrets for commitment, but at the same time cannot stand the thought of losing Sam.When Jordan and Alex's past comes back to haunt them, a possible traitor on the team threatens the woman they love and a future they have never dreamt. Once secrets are revealed, can the three of them forget the past and forgive the lies or will fear drive them further apart?*Warning* This book contains content not suitable for readers under the age of 18; including adult sexual content (M/F/M), violence, and adult language.This is an ACE of ASIN:B00CCYPUWU Shifted Temptations.
