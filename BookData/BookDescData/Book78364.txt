They all thought they knew him… but she knew his heart.  Seth Brothers had it all: the hottest album in the world, more money than he’d ever dreamed of, and Dirty—the band he loved like family. But as Dirty hit the big time, Seth hit bottom.  Now all Seth’s got is the guitar on his back, a heart full of regrets, and one last chance to get it all back… including the one thing he never expected.  Her.  Elle Delacroix has it all—talent, money, fame… except the one thing that truly matters.  Love…  The only thing Seth has left to give.  There are two sides to every rock ’n’ roll story; it’s time for Seth to tell his.   Dirty Like Seth is the third full-length novel in the Dirty series—a rockstar romance series about the members of the rock band Dirty and the women and men who love them.  Novels in the Dirty series are interconnected standalones, each with an HEA; other books (novella/story collection) are not HEA, but are essential pieces of the overall story arcs. (There are ongoing storylines that develop throughout the series; reading them in order is not crucial but is HIGHLY recommended.)
