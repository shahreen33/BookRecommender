They’re cut from different cloths…but their hearts are a perfect fit.Asa Caldwell returned from the Great War with nothing to show for it—as in nothing below his left knee.

Before he can bring Mags Bledsoe home, though, a spate of mysterious attacks reawakens his investigative instincts.During the war, Mags did her duty to God and country by stepping into a management role at the textile mill. Now she’s been shuffled back to the rank and file—and Asa has her hard-earned job. Not only is the infernal man doing everything wrong, her plan for revenge against the mill owner who lynched her childhood sweetheart is farther out of reach than ever.As they clash over almost everything, Mags begins to set fire to Asa’s soul, bright enough to dim the memory of the killing fields of France. Enough to give him a new mission in life—to make her feel the same way.Warning: Contains a wounded warrior who’s done with fighting…and one feisty woman who makes him snap to attention.
