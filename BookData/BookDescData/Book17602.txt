As the most popular superhero in the world, Stella Stargirl has it all; fame, fortune, legions of adoring fans, a place on the world's best superhero team and even a number 1 hit single to her name. Stella, however, has a secret that even she doesn't know. She is a fraud. An average-powered hero who stood on the shoulders of giants and got all the glory whilst her more powerful teammates did all the work. When a new supervillain appears on the scene, one who manages to de-power the world's heroes, Stella decides it is time to put aside her self-doubts and show the world that fraud or not, she can be a true hero.
