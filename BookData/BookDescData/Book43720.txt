PARALLEL LINES Putting the past to rest. This is the final instalment of Kiri's tale. Now aged forty-one we find her working at the Courtauld Gallery in London guiding visitors around the exhibits, on her feet all day . . . sometimes seven days a week . . . but loving every minute of it. She has moved to a house with a small garden in Fulham, dyed her hair brown and at last she looks like the picture on the cover of the books. There is a new man around, Graham a millionaire businessman looking for the love of his life. This is partly Graham's story too; he sells cheap imports from China and we watch as he accumulates more and more wealth and money, at the expense of British and European jobs. But these are only the rails along which the parallel lines of Kiri's new life runs; re-building shattered relationships; abandoning others that refuse to be resurrected and attempting to construct meaningful new bonds from the flimsiest materials, mud, straw and a lack of commitment. Meanwhile, Madison and Keith are bidding to rule the world and fill their bank accounts by bringing the North American economy to a standstill. Honest and unsentimental, Kiri embraces the life she has rather than the one she might have hoped for, with her customary restraint and dignity. Engaging from the start, and like the previous novels sensually immersive, the novel begins slowly but builds to an intense and fast-paced contemporary thriller.
