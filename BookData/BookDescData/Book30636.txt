The mind-bending sequel to No Greater Sacrifice:In a remote laboratory, genetic scientists are challenged to create a serum that heals injured soldiers and quickly returns them to the battlefield. Thus, Project Angel is born… only to fail under suspicious circumstances. Years later, archaeologists Renée Arturo and Dianna McEvoy discover in Norway what could be Mjolnir, the legendary hammer of Norse mythology. Neither event seems related until Dianna disappears and Renée’s son is kidnapped. Renée and her husband, David, begin a desperate search to save their loved ones. When they discover both Dianna and her scientist father supposedly went missing when Project Angel ended, the mystery deepens. Was it really Dianna in Norway? Are her father’s experiments the reason the Arturos’ son was taken? Do cryptic codes on the hammer hint at the location of other fantastic treasures? Or something more sinister? Renée and David are no strangers to puzzles, but nothing can prepare them for this deceptive game where the consequences of losing are darker than anyone can imagine.
