'The Long View', a revealing portrait of a marriage, is the ingenious construction of a couple's story that offers a remarkable and very real view of the shifting relationship between two people from 1950 to 1926.(The author, Elizabeth Jane Howard, rose to international stardom with her magnificent Cazalet family saga.)
