  After Colin cuts off their connection to Underhill, the high fae lose their position of magical supremacy. Sensing a shift in the balance of power, an unknown faction begins a brutal assault on the fae. Incensed by the injustice of their actions, Colin embarks on a one-man quest to find the persons responsible... so he can mete out some Druid Justice.
When I came back from Underhill, I was certain that my dealings with the fae were done. Sure, I knew they’d be after me—I mean, I had cut off their unlimited supply of magic, after all.I just didn’t think I’d have to help them anymore.But when fae started dropping like flies and the Red Cap Syndicate came begging for my help, I felt kind of obliged to lend a hand. Thing is, nobody would have attacked the fae in such a brazen manner before I betrayed their queen.So, I guess it’s my fault all the fae are being assassinated. Oops.Do I feel bad about the killings? Nah. The fae have been preying on humans for millennia, and I think it’s about time someone turned the tables on them. That being said, it’s still wrong—so it is my duty to put a stop to it.The only problem is, I’m not the same druid who went to Underhill and lived. My Hyde-side is getting out of control again, and if I get in a tight spot I can’t take the risk of letting him out to save my skin.So, I’ll have to solve this case and deal with the killers the old-fashioned way… with magic and guile, all while handing out a little Druid Justice.
