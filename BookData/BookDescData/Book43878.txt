-- Reinterprets biblical hermeneutics as a "creational task", not a "labor to be overcome"In This Book James K. A. Smith cogently surveys contemporary hermeneutical discussion, identifying three traditions and how they understand interpretation.Questioning the foundational assumptions of secular and religious theorists such as Rex Koivisto, Wolfhart Pannenberg, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Martin Heidegger and Jacques Derrida, Smith deftly draws on and reworks Augustine's biblical understanding of the goodness of creation to propose a creational-pneumatic model of hermeneutics. In his words, such a hermeneutic would result in "an understanding of the status of interpretation as a 'creational task, ' a task which is constitutive of finitude and thus not a 'labor' to be escaped or overcome. Such an 'interpretation of interpretation' revalues embodiment and ultimately ends in a ethical respect for difference as the gift of a creating God who loves difference and loves differently".
