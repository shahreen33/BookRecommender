By NEW YORK TIMES Bestselling Author H.M. WardBlackmail. Sex. Ferro.His dark hair, bright eyes, and cocky grin look just the way I remembered. The last time I saw Bryan’s Ferro’s beautiful body, he was naked and shimmering with sweat. This time he’s wearing a tux and a wicked smirk that makes my heart beat too fast. It’s been so long since I’ve seen him, the moment feels supercharged. But, the words that fall out of his mouth aren’t what I expect and shock me to the core. They aren’t light and pleasant, like ex-lovers who decided to part ways. His tone is clipped, and if his jaw locked any tighter, it would crack. He doesn’t care about my personal life, my recent loss, or my boyfriend. Bryan makes his intentions clear—if I don’t sleep with him, he’ll ruin me.Genre: New Adult RomanceThis story unfolds over 5 volumes approx. 125 pages each.
