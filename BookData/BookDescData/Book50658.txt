Simon Madison is unlike any other boy in his hometown. He doesn't date. He doesn't drive. He doesn't play sports. He's too busy avoiding life as the sole heir to the family business, Mad Brothers Renaissance Faire. After witnessing the star of the Faire, Ginger, a Bengal tiger, maul his father to death, Simon's world crumbled into tiny shards of glass. But with the arrival of the newest member to Mad Brothers, the mysterious young psychic, Amanda Moon, he is confronted with his well-guarded past, unraveling from his fisted grip. Challenged with the brutal murder of one of his employees and fellow students, Simon and Amanda embark on a dangerous journey to discover the dark secrets of the disappearance of her mother, the twisted affairs which traumatized Simon's family, and the identity of a crazed murderer in their own back yard. They soon discover they don't know who to trust and their lives are in just as much danger as the boy whose mutilated body is found in the swamp behind the Madison's home.
