Disturbed psychological states have baffled both religion and medicine for as long as human beings have existed. Despite the explorations of modern psychology, we are often no closer to understanding these expressions of human suffering than we were a thousand years ago. Although it can offer no solutions, astrology can provide many insights into why some individuals respond to conflict and unhappiness by retreating from life, and why others respond with savagery toward their fellows.The three seminars in this book use astrological perspectives to explore a spectrum of extreme psychological states, from the condition known as psychopathy to the collective mechanism of scapegoatingâ€”as much a pathology as any diagnosed mental illness. Astrologers often avoid confronting the issues of madness and human destructiveness, and political correctness has made it even more difficult to face such issues honestly and without sentiment or hypocrisy. But only by exploring the roots of what we call madness can we find any positive and creative approach to the mystery of why some individuals fail to cope constructively with life's challenges. This book will sometimes shock and disturb, but it is an invaluable resource for any practicing astrologer concerned with the dilemma of human suffering, and any lay person wishing to understand how astrology can contribute to our comprehension of human behavior.
