In her third Barsetshire novel, Thirkell continues the saga of the irrepressible Tony Morland. Whether shelling peas in the bath, coaxing a snack of bread-and-dripping from the formidable housekeeper, or worrying his mother with his bicycling exploits, Tony is a charming, utterly infuriating creature to the adults who at once adore and despair of him.
