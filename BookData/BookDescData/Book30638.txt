Rescued from a street gutter, she had the good fortune to be adopted by author Brian L. Porter and his family.Despite suffering from a catalogue of injuries, including two broken legs and skin allergies, and eventually being diagnosed as a serious epileptic at just two years old, Sasha's story is one of triumph over adversity; of love, happiness and inspiration.
