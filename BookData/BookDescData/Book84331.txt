   THE GEORGIAN RAKE is a thrilling adventure story by Alice Chetwynd Ley: a traditional British, pre Regency romance novel with a twist of suspense and mystery, set in Georgian England.   ‘Ley tosses in little hints and glimpses of what is really going on in her characters’ heads rather than let every thing wait until the end when it blows in out of the blue. This one is a Georgian era which is one of my favorites.’ – Dear Author  It is a fast-paced story, well plotted and really well written that made me "turn" the pages impatiently because I just had to know what would happen! I really loved this book and can definitely recommend it! - Cup of Tea and Book Blog
