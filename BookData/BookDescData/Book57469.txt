Lesbian sex has been confounding people since the dawn of time. What is it that two women do together exactly? The Lesbian Sex Haiku Book (with Cats!) is a humorous guide to lesbian sex, dating rituals, and relationships, and aims to dispel all myths. Haiku paired with hilarious watercolor illustrations of cats in various stages of sexual awkwardness will enlighten, demystify, remystify, and most importantly entertain as you learn about all the aspects involved in girl-on-girl action.  From lesbian pick-up lines:
   Pronounce Annie Proulx's
  
   name correctly—watch lady's
  
   cargo pants fall off.
 To icebreaker haiku for first dates:
   It has been MANY 
  
   years, but I'm not done griping 
  
   about The L Word.
 To, of course, the mechanics of lesbian sex:
   It's like straight sex but
  
   afterwards we ask ourselves,
  
   "We just had sex, right?"

   Lesbian sex is
  
   like water polo—no one 
  
   really knows the rules.
 This laugh-out-loud book is the perfect gift to amuse and educate your friends, loved ones, and lovers.
