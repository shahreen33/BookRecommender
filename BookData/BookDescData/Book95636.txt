This collection of prose poems, How Groundhogs Play Croquet, is a fabulist's universe of hallucination, dream, absurdity, horror, madness, and obsession. Onions bloom like lotus flowers, a husband is given a tune-up at the garage, penguin are cast as existencial actors, a bar serves poetry rather than beer, and an office worker is sucked up by a desk. Written in a clear, compressed, highly energized and visual language, these pieces invite the reader to enter worlds both magical and surreal.Born in 1949, Glenn Russell grew up in the shore town of Beachwood, Ocean County, New Jersey, and graduated from La Salle University in 1972.
