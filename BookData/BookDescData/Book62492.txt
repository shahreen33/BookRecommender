 Have you ever wondered what it takes to find the love of your life? Is it your dream to find a life partner who will love, cherish, and adore you? The Soulmate Secret will show you how to take control of your romantic destiny by using the Law of Attraction. Finding true love is possible for anyone at any age if you are willing to prepare yourself, on all levels, to become a magnet for love. Arielle Ford knows this from experience. She used the techniques in this book to bring her soulmate into her life at age forty-four. They were engaged three weeks later.   This ancient formula reveals that our universe is set up to deliver the people and things into our lives that are consistent with our personal belief system. If you don't believe you will ever find the One, then guess what? You probably won't. If, however, you learn to believe that the One is not only out there but is also looking for you, then true love can be yours.   Using a series of processes called feelingizations—feeling in every cell of your being the outcome you want to create—Ford reveals how to manifest the man or woman of your dreams. The techniques, rituals, and projects found within these pages will allow you to prepare your home, body, mind, and spirit for the lover your heart truly desires.
