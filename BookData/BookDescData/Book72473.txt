Groom? Check.Dress? Check.Cake? Check.More cake? Double Check.Even more cake? Triple check.(Seriously, who left Lethe alone with Grier's credit card?)Anything that can go wrong has,but all the deposits have been paid, and the menus are set. Mostly. There's always room for more cake, right? All that's left is for Grier and Linus to exchange vows and set off on their honeymoon. Their happily ever after awaits, so close they can taste it.No.Wait.That's probably just more cake. Frosting gets everywhere.Anyway, there's also murder, arson, and general mayhem. This is what happens when two potentates marry. Just cross your fingers they survive exchanging vows, and that the knot they tie doesn't turn into a noose.
