Former con artist Ciara Griffin hopes to settle into a normal un-life as a fledgling vampire, with the help of her fianc , grunge DJ/guitarist Shane McAllister. But when the WVMP station crew reports that hippie vampire DJ Jim has murdered a pair of humans - humans who happen to share Ciara's last name - that's when trouble rolls out the red carpet. To redeem her past and pay back her most wounded victim, Ciara plans one final triple-crossing con game - with her own "miracle blood" as the bait. And as Ciara clings to what's left of her humanity, she'll need her new vampire strength - and old con artist cunning - now more than ever.
