Moving two thousand miles away wasn't my plan, but when family needs you, you come.  Before I can head back to my hometown of Chicago though, I have two men to say good-bye to in Los Angeles. Neither one of them will be happy to hear the news. One is losing his assistant and the other his seven-year-old daughter. Neither will be an easy sell on my part, but I have no choice, and I'm not exactly thrilled with starting over with a Clean Slate.  (This is a PREQUEL to our Charity Case series.)
