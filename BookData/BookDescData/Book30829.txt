When you’re a thief trying to get by on the scraps of your labor, life is anything but easy.  Lexa Blackmoon is a low-end magical thief with a penchant for taking things others won’t miss. An orphan haunted by the memory of her murdered parents, she lives her life just trying to get by, only looking out for herself. When a shadow mage unexpectedly confronts her and tells her she’s meant for something greater, she can’t help but feel he’s telling the truth.  Taken to a secret resistance camp outside the city, Lexa learns that not only is she a mage, but she possesses the Mark of Merlin, a magical power greater than she’s ever dreamt of. She joins the resistance, training her powers to infiltrate the ranks of M.A.G.I.C., a magical police force tasked with cleaning up the streets from crime and keeping the magical realm a secret from normal humans.  But when the sinister president-turned-dictator, Kiren Nightstorm, attempts to take over the realm, Lexa knows she has to hit him where it hurts: by defeating his secret crime syndicate aimed at enslaving the magical race.  This is an urban fantasy novel with some new adult aspects, including some language and violence. This is the first in a five book series.
