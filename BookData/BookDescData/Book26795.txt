Excerpt from The Madonna of Sacrifice: A Story of Florence "It was not well for a youth whose frail body could scarce endure his daily labors to spend so much of his time in this damp, sunless chapel. They might indeed be even more persuaded could they have noted the changes which had taken place in Fofo since his young mistress had gone to her new home. The little acolyte had lengthened out until his blue, homespun blouse came down only to the hips, and his loose trousers failed to touch."
