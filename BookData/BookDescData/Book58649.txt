I might be the quiet one, but I hear everything. The women who come into my bar aren't at all silent about their wants or desires. And I'm one of them. They call me "sexy, alluring and mysterious." They want to be "spanked by Frank." Hell, there's even a hashtag. But none of that matters until she walks through my doors.My body reacts.My whole world shifts.I want her, but I can't have her. And if she finds out the truth about me, I'll lose my shot forever. That's not a chance I'm willing to take. I just hope I'm strong enough to do what needs to be done before it's too late.
