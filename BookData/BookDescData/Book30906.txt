At the Village Blend, Clare Cosi realizes her best baristas may refer to a decaffeinated espresso as a "why bother?" but knows that a good percentage of her customers prefer the neutered brew. So when an old friend of her ex-husband develops the world's first botanically decaffeinated coffee bean and smuggles it into the country, Clare believes it's a business opportunity she needs to investigate-at least until the first dead body shows up. With casualties piling up and a complicated blend of old and new loves muddying the waters, it's up to Clare to find the murderer before one of her nearest and dearest takes the fall. Otherwise, her latest addition to the menu will prove to be a real buzz killer.
