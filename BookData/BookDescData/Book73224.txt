Living Out the Word Made Flesh Sixty years ago I found myself distracted, Eugene Peterson writes. A chasm had developed between the way I was preaching from the pulpit and my deepest convictions on what it meant to be a pastor.  And so began Peterson s journey to live and teach a life of congruence congruence between preaching and living, between what we do and the way we do it, between what is written in Scripture and how we live out that truth.  Nothing captures the biblical foundation for this journey better than Peterson s teachings over his twenty-nine years as a pastor. As Kingfishers Catch Fire offers a never-before-published collection of these teachings to anyone longing for a richer, truer spirituality.  Peterson s strikingly beautiful prose and deeply grounded insights usher us into a new understanding of how to live out the good news of the Word made flesh. This is a stunning record of one man s decision to discover not only how to be a pastor but how to be a human being."
