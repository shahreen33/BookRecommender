Wyoming? Kill me now. Reed: I've spent my whole life causing trouble for my parents, but this time I went too far. After the scandal I caused nearly ruined my mom's political career, they decided to do something drastic-and that's how I ended up in on a ranch in Ely, Wyoming, a zillion miles from civilization. But it's not like I care that I have no friends, my family despises me, and I totally ruined my life in a really public way. And I definitely don't cry myself to sleep every night. The good news? The ranch hand, Brady, is super hot. I mean, I only want to get him in bed to prove I can. So what if he's the first person who's ever been really kind to me? So what if, behind his stoic cowboy act, he's unbelievably considerate and thoughtful and so totally wonderful. I just want to sleep with him-it's not like I have a crush on him or anything. The bad news? I think he hates me. Brady: Life on the ranch is quiet and simple, and that's the way I like it. But then Reed comes along-blond and bratty and completely out of control-and suddenly I can't get a moment's peace. When he's not busy accidentally destroying something, he's hitting on me or throwing a tantrum. Good thing he's only here for a year. When Reed's not being a diva, he's insightful and clever and shockingly sweet-and, yes, I suppose I think he's gorgeous. But after all the loss and heartache in my life, I'm afraid to risk loving someone, only to lose them all over again. Something about Reed's vulnerability, though, is making me open up. Reed's someone worth saving... and maybe I am, too. Someone Worth Saving is an m/m slow burn contemporary romance with enemies-to-lovers and hurt/comfort themes, plenty of heat, and a happy ending.
