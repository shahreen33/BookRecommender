Rowan Phillips is a woman on a mission to provide the best she can for the community served by the Cartwright Center. When things look bleak, a mysterious benefactor steps in with an offer that could be a win-win situation... or a catch-22.  (This started - and finished - as a serial on my blog. If you read it there, there is NOTHING new here. If you are looking for warm and fuzzy, don't like adult language, topics, or scenes in what you read, you should skip this one.)
