Venice is about love and the tensions that pull us apart: the love between Harrison and his uncle Ryan, who is in need of a person to belong to, Natalie, who is pulled between her art and her heart, and Phil’s awkward stilted love. Think, Nick Hornby’s About a Boy.Nick paints the picture of Brisbane perfectly. The smells, sounds, tastes and temperature surround us as we witness Ryan’s relationships grow. A sensory wonderland that carries us on the journey.—Gyton Grantley, actor
