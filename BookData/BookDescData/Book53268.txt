Marry Clementine Bright or watch your carefully crafted kingdom crumble. Well played, Grandfather. Well played. I’ll say my I do's and pretend to be the doting husband, but this is one union that’s strictly a marriage of inconvenience. Clementine may be disarmingly beautiful, but she defies me at every turn. I'm the king of my castle. The ruler of my bedroom. And even though I want her, I’ll fight the urge to have her, until death do us part.
