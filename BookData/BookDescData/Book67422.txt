The only way to escape is to die.  For eighteen years I’ve suffered at the hands of the Hunters. For eighteen years they’ve done their best to break me, to tear me open and unleash the terrifying monster that lives within.  Until the day they go too far.  When a desperate escape leads to another brush with death, I’m forced to place my trust in the hands of four formidable strangers. Wild and untamed, their feral natures call to me, their warrior hearts make mine come alive. And when they offer me a place to stay while I heal, I can’t say no.  But the secrets I carry are deadly, and my past is a twisted, evil nightmare better left forgotten.  They may think they want to know me, they may think the secrets they guard behind hard eyes and closed expressions comes close to the ones I keep. But should they ever discover just who they’ve let into their home, just what I really am...their hatred could be the one thing that finally breaks me.  And if I break, the darkness inside me will finally be free.   ***Author Note*** Hunted is the first book in the Feral Soul Trilogy.
