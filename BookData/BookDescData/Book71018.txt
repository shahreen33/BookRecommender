Watch out for the Assassin’s Claws…   Clay Moreno is a paid killer, just like his four brothers. It’s the family business—they fight together, they die together. Whether they’re working as a group or alone, they are a tight unit who protect their own.  Clay drew the short straw on their latest mission: assassinate the American president. He knew the case was going to be tough, but the last thing he expected to find was his mate… the president’s own son. The fact that he began the case with plans to seduce his way into the White House via that same son is beside the point. What his mate doesn’t know shouldn’t hurt him…  Nick Jackson is lonely and ordinary in a family of overachievers. He doesn’t want to do photo ops for the press, prep for the next year’s tests over the summer or any of the hundreds of other things his mother hassles him about. All he wants is to relax after his first year of college, work on his tan… and maybe find a boy to flirt with.  This is the first in a new series of short reads. Note: While mpreg exists in this world, we won’t have a birth in every book. This book contains killer cats, ninja bunnies and a life-changing mating bite. Get ready for naughty-knotty fun and low-ball humor as only Susi Hawke can provide.
