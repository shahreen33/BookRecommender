  From the international bestselling author comes a dark, sinful story filled with steamy scenes and a rocky road that’s raw, unapologetic, and carnal.
“Greed was my vice. A sin that led to my addiction.”  Love was not an option for Nate. He didn’t want it. Didn’t claim it. Until her. I hid the monster from everyone, including myself. Emotions were firmly locked away. As much control as I had in my life, I could never control my heart. Eva exposed me. She begged and pleaded, and I swore I'd make her kneel. And when she finally did, I broke the only jewel I ever owned. *This is a dark erotic romance with BDSM elements. Due to scenes of an adult nature, this book is for 18+ ONLY."Wow. This book is beautiful in a rough around the edges, raw, carnal, way. It will rip you open and make you feel so much." - The Reading Cat
