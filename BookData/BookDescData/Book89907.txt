The potential of the human spirit has always amazed me. Through poetry I try to capture the essence of the fragility and the resiliency of our hearts....the brilliant beauty of life's journey. We all love/loved deeply and most likely have been on both sides of goodbye. We know the immobilizing force of grief…we experienced hardships that have brought tears, revelations, and self-discoveries of strength unknown. Trials that could easily dishearten us, but instead we are more loving, compassionate, and kind. The Heart’s Journey Home is a collection of 23 poems titled: Reckless Words, Borrowed Angel, Nobody's Fool, Silence of the Heart, Love's Illusion, Fallen Angel, Let's Dance, Where Does the Love Go, Young Love, Small Town Girl, Winter's Gift, Destined to Fly, Eternal Love, The War Within, To my Sister on our 40th Birthday, Goodbye without Warning, Old Oak Tree, Names in the Sand, Can't Let Go, Memories Linger, Caged Bird Sings, Surrender, and Heart's Journey Home.
