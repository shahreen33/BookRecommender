Avery Castle carries the weight of a thousand moments of sorrow. Donavan Hardy carries enough anger for them both.  When they were young, Donavan learned sign language so he could talk to the deaf beauty. He cared, even when Avery’s influential father couldn’t be bothered with her “flaw.”  In spite of things, the bad boy made her fall in love with sound… with music.  They couldn’t have been any more different, but he was always meant to protect her, just like she was always meant to calm his rage.  And then, Avery’s world came crashing down when the love of her life disappeared without a trace, leaving her broken-hearted and pregnant. She loses her baby, the last bit of him she has left, and her world plunges deeper into darkness. Seven years of hurt, confusion, and pain collide when they are thrown back together. Avery has to decide if the life she’s been living with the sizzling Cuban cop, whom her father approves of, is worth not having Donovan back in her life. But Donavan is fighting for her forgiveness, to prove that deep-seeded secrets far greater than their love tore them apart. Donavan will force Avery to return the key to her heart no matter the cost…   ***This is a FULL LENGTH, STANDALONE novel Make Me Stay is complete at a little over 80k words... of a heart-wrenching second chance romance that will make you fall in love with Donavan and Avery and root for them.
