Spunky television sports reporter Lyla Garcia has just received a proposal from her boyfriend, Stedman. After she accepts his offer to accompany him to Japan on a professional golf tour, Lyla requests a leave of absence from work and secretly hopes the trip will bring Stedman and her closer to a long-term commitment. But just days before she is to depart, Stedman shatters her world by telling her he needs to focus on his golf career without her. Heartbroken and with several weeks of time off ahead of her, Lyla meets up with her three best friends - Chloe, Ava, and Marissa - for a little estrogen-laced advice. At their insistence Lyla decides to use her sabbatical to write a book about dating, sex, and astrology. Lyla throws herself into her risqu√© new project, wanting to experience a freedom in her dating life that she has never allowed before. As she begins research that takes her from Fort Lauderdale strip clubs to the Gateway Arch, Lyla's manuscript begins to come together but not without consequences. Once Lyla finally returns to work at the dysfunctional television station, she discovers that in her quest to win in the game of love, passions on and off the field don't mix.
