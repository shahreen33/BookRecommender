The 50 classic rock and pop songs listed in this book are arguably some of the greatest of all-time. These tracks still sound good or "hold up" against today's popular music. The publication is intended to spark conversation and discussion. It is not a definitive list. Your opinions are welcome and encouraged. So get your stereo ready and listen while reading. Enjoy!
