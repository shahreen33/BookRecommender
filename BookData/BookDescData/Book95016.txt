Synchronicity: the phenomenon of experiencing a striking and meaningful coincidence that connects our inner and outer worlds. Synchronicity can act as a guide along our life path, helping us through challenging times, restoring self-belief and awakening a deeper understanding of ourselves and our destiny. Writing for both practitioners and anyone interested in mental health, wellbeing and the opportunities offered by altered states of consciousness, psychologist Chris Mackey provides astounding case studies and many practical suggestions for working with synchronicity, from journaling and symbol analysis to dream interpretation and ideas for accessing flow. He makes a passionate case that acknowledging synchronicity, as well as other forms of transcendent experience, plays an important role in positive psychology - the science of wellbeing - enabling us to thrive and find fulfilment in life. Chris Mackey is a clinical psychologist with 40 years' experience.
