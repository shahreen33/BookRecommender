Our planet, Mortuus, is lost and dying.A desolate place where a few lone survivors dwell.My men have lost hope. Our future is bleak.Longevity is a luxury we can’t afford.The most we can hope for is survival.We’ve all but given up when an opportunity presents itself.Five females—a chance at a future.Procuring these women went against everything I’d been taught, but desperate times call for desperate measures.They’re ours now.Asleep and made ready for breeding.We won’t die out—lost and forgotten.It’s our destiny to grow and once again inhabit our lonely planet.I am Breccan Aloisius, the forgotten commander.My people will have the future they deserve.I’ll make sure of it.My mind is made up…until she wakes and nothing goes as planned.
