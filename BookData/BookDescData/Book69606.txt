Lockhart—about fifteen-year-old Nico Walker, whose sister returns home after a four-year disappearance.When Nico Walker's older sister mysteriously disappears, her parents, family, and friends are devastated.

Sarah's retrograde amnesia has caused her to forget almost everything about her life, from small things like the plots of her favorite books and her tennis game to the more critical—where she's been the last four years and what happened at the park on the fateful day she vanished. Despite the happy ending, the dark details of that day continue to haunt Nico, and it becomes clear that more than one person knows the true story of what happened to Sarah. . . .
