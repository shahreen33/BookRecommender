  Behind every little secret…
Mary Hamilton has had enough of being passed over by all of the eligible men in London, though she’s had years and years of practice, and she’s ready to give it up. But before she hangs up her dancing shoes for good, she wants one season of everything she’s never had - invitations, flirtation, and suitors. But will all of that actually give her what she’s always secretly wanted?
  …there’s another secret waiting…
Geoffrey Harris is more than happy to spend his time being permanent escort to Mary during her final season in London. After all, she’s been his best friend for years, and what better way to send her off than in grand style? But when her plan actually starts to work, he isn’t so sure he wants any part of it, leaving him to wonder what it is he does want. Or who.
