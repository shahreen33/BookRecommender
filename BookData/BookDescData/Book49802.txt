Monsters are real.But so are heroes.Sparks are champions of weird science. Boasting capes and costumes and amazing super-powers that only make sense if you don't think about them too hard, they fight an eternal battle for truth and justice . . . mostly.Darklings are creatures of myth and magic: ghosts, vampires, were-beasts, and the like.

Now it's up to four newbie heroes to save the day, before they even have a chance to figure out what their team's name should be!
