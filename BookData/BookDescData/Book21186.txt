Legends and stories call her the Blood Fox, a cunning warrior with plenty of wit and awkward charm, stuck with a curse that keeps her alive and young even as it devours her sanity. When a hidden lord sends his sharp-tongued sorcerer with answers and an offer, she’s tempted to bite… even though the source is far from trustworthy, and the cost could be her life. Luckily, she's splendidly unhinged and has nothing left to lose.*****Full Description:Curses are not subtle.They are things of pain, and for a very long time Santo has been caught in one. She haunts the roads of the country of Kurdak as a mercenary, fighting back sleep every night so that she won’t have to face the horror that comes for her when she rests. Weary, with sanity almost gone and no end in sight, Santo doesn't know who did this to her or why she is still alive.Someone does, though. As the mythical Week of Colors arrives, she receives a visit from a long-time acquaintance. Traken is a sharp-tongued sorcerer with a sadistic streak, and he comes bearing an “invitation” from his master, a secretive lord who has been watching her for far too long. Santo isn't thrilled, until another message arrives in the form of an ominous prediction: following the sorcerer will mean the answers she wants, but she’ll likely die in the process. That’s fine with Santo, though, because she isn't searching for a way out… she’s searching for revenge.
