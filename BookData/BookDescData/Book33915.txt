The blood farm is gone. Those behind it have either died, been caught, or are on the run. Time to return to the real world.  Only normal life isn't quite what Tessa expected. Good thing, because there is no 'normal' anymore. She's different. Her family is different. Her friends are different. The world around her is different. Trying to find her place is not easy. She wants nothing more than to be a normal teenager and join Cody and his friends on a Friday night out.  Cody wants the trouble to be over so he can get back to living the life he used to with one major addition – Tessa.  Only Ian and Jewel aren't healing well, Rhia is acting out of character, and Jared keeps tripping over dead bodies. Then there's David, who'll do anything to help Jewel… even something he knows he shouldn't do.  Something is wrong, and once again it's up to Tessa to figure out what is happening under the surface of this 'normal' life.
