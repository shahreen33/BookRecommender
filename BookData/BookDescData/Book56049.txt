A fitting tribute to a great philosophical writer who found science fiction the ideal form for the expression of his ideas - The IndependentThe third volume of the definitive five-book set of the complete collected stories of the twentieth century's greatest sf author; twenty-three tales which were written in little more than a year, before Philip K. Dick's first novel, Solar Lottery, was published in 1956. Many of these stories are previously uncollected, but also included here are some of Dick's most famous pieces, like Foster, You're Dead, a powerful extrapolation of nuclear war hysteria, and The Golden Man, a very different story about a super-evolved mutant human.This is a brilliant collection vividlly displaying some of the best of Dick's originality, quirky-humour and overflowing ideas.One of the most original practitioners writing any kind of fiction.
