  
    CHARACTERS LIVE AT THE CORE OF FATE! 
  
  A High Priestess of the barbarian hordes, an undead Wild West gunslinger, and a Second Lieutenant of the Intergalactic Security Forces are about as different as they come, but they’ve got one thing in common: they need a strong engine to drive their stories. 
  
    Fate Core is that engine. 
  
  Fate Core is the latest evolution of the award-winning Fate roleplaying game system from Evil Hat Productions. We’ve streamlined and clarified the rules while maintaining the system’s trademark flexibility. Name your game; Fate Core can make it happen.
