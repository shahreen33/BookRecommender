The Odyssey of Daniel Bonner. The first chapter finds Daniel Bonner as frightened fifteen year-old making an escape from a young offenders' institution, incarcerated for a crime of which he is innocent. During a harrowing escape he receives unexpected help from a total stranger who later becomes his mentor, to aid and abet his survival as a fugitive on the open moor. Daniel learns to trust him implicitly in what is seemingly an unbreakable friendship, and remains unaware that the stranger, Anthony Windrow, has a hidden, and altogether, sinister agenda. At the time of his escape, Danny, unwittingly, sells his soul to the Devil, and nothing in this, or any other world comes free. Anthony Windrow, hell's second-in-command, otherwise known as the Chancellor, sets Daniel on a course to leave the moor and make his fortune, hoping that greed would be the catalyst to turn him into the perfect representative for the forces of evil in the living world. However, no one had counted on Daniels inbuilt sense of right and wrong. With an act of selfless philanthropy he undermines the Chancellor's plan, proving that his path through life is destined to carry him on a very different journey; to become the Chancellor's nemesis.
