Join self-confessed Scrabble junkie Todd Kreisman as he embarks on a journey within the online Scrabble community. He was challenged to play 10 opponents of increasing ability, from Jorge (ranked 1065) all the way up to Maria (ranked 1940). Along the way he wrote down every single move he made, every word he played, and exactly what he was thinking when he made that move, and why he did it. It's like being inside his head as he plays! And Todd even made some surprising discoveries about himself with the rapid improvements he made in just 10 short games. Will you take the 10 game challenge? 238 pages with 163 illustrations.
