Libby and the gang visit the Isle of Wight for the funeral of an old friend, whose death is (for once) entirely un-suspicious.Some elderly cousins of the deceased do however have an unexplained death in the family. Libby's best friend Harry seems to be somehow involved, and Libby is therefore determined to get to the bottom of the situation, and valiantly ignores the growing reluctance of the elderly cousins to help as she investigates.But will she get to the bottom of it, or will the cousins resistance prove too much? And why are they even resisting in the first place?
