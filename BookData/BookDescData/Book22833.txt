"He's a jock. I'm not. He's popular. I'm not. He's good-looking. I'm not. And have I mentioned that we're the best of friends? So he loves me... as a friend. Too bad, because I don't just love him... I'm in love with him." -Dakota Evans Dakota's sarcastic, Aaron isn't. Aaron's a morning person, Dakota most definitely is not. Dakota's a nerd, while Aaron's a jock. Aaron loves High School, while Dakota thinks nothing about school is cool. Who would've thought that these two people are the best of friends? Not many people are happy, that's for sure. Being in love is hard. Being in love with your best friend is harder. Being in love with your best friend who is in an entirely different clique in High School is the hardest.
