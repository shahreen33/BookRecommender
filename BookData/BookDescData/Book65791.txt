All Mari Everett’s life, she’s had two secret dreams: To own a bookstore, and to reunite with her long lost father. But when he passes away unexpectedly and she inherits his home and business, the only way she can learn about his life—especially why he abandoned her when she was three and never came back—is by leaving California to take over his bookstore in London.   Owen Sullivan lives and works on Elderflower Island, a close knit community in London where it’s impossible to keep a secret. It turns out, however, that Charlie Forsythe kept his daughter a secret from everyone for nearly thirty years. When Mari comes to London, Owen immediately falls for her. He’s never met a woman so intelligent, determined and honest. Not to mention so beautiful that she takes his breath away.   Soon, everyone on the island—including Owen’s four siblings, parents and grandmother—is pitching in to help give the bookstore a fresh start. But as insatiable passion develops into love, will Mari and Owen be able to grab hold of their fresh start? Or will their pasts continue to cast a dark shadow over their chance at a brilliant future together in London?  "I adore the Sullivans! They love hard, laugh uproariously and live in the moment."
