Sixteen-year-old Callisto May feels a deep connection to astronomy, but feels completely alone on planet Earth. Now that she's pregnant, her loneliness is acute. She can't turn to her mother, her father, or even her surfer boyfriend. Only Callisto's little brother loves her unfailingly, but she can't be there for him right now. She's got to make a huge decision--and that means thinking of herself first. An ALA Best Book for Young Adults.
