In New York Times bestselling author Karen Robards's latest heart-pounding romantic suspense novel, a woman must track down her husband's murderer—or risk being the next victim of a vicious killer. When Riley Cowan finds her estranged husband Jeff dead in his palatial home, she's sure it's no coincidence. The police rule it a suicide, but Riley thinks someone's out for blood—specifically someone Jeff's father ripped off in one of the biggest financial fraud cases of all time. She suspects that someone is trying to send a message to Jeff's father: Tell me where the money is, or everyone you care about will die. Riley's in-laws might be billionaires, but she's afraid that not even their dirty money can protect her from an irate investor who will stop at nothing to get his hands on his misappropriated cash. Enter Finn Bradley, Philly-based FBI agent and Riley's love interest from way back when. Finn agrees to help Riley, and the two reignite sparks they both thought were extinguished long ago. But can they discover the killer's identity in time, before he resurfaces—and strikes again? Dubbed an "exceptional storyteller" by the Chicago Tribune and "one of the most popular voices in women's fiction" by Newsweek, Karen Robards's latest action-packed novel will keep you glued to the pages until the final, shocking conclusion.
