After his death, Ray is offered three lives, each designed out of his choices, to find happiness.

Exotic, evocative and haunting, the tale of Ray Cordozaâ€™s three lives will make you ponder the choices that you make in your own life towards the pursuit of happiness. The book is a celebration of the beauty of this wonderful universe and our lives as human beings. It falls into the genre of spiritual fiction - a format in which a fictional narrative is interlaced with philosophical and spiritual concepts. It could also (easily) be categorized as inspirational, self-help and motivational, depending on the perspective of the reader. 3 Lives is a product of inspired passion which aims to present eastern and western spiritual concepts in a manner that demonstrates the one-ness of everything in this world that we find ourselves in. That we all share the same fears, desires and aspirations. And, that we all have the same questions. That we share, at a fundamentally spiritual level, a deep and abiding desire to find and hold onto happiness.  Whether you're looking to be inspired or to comprehend the seemingly incomprehensible pain and disappointments that come our way in life, this short novella is bound to leave a deep and lasting impression on you.  Happy journeys!
