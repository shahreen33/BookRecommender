"Friends with benefits, stepbrother with benefits, what's the difference?"----- Rule #1 â€“ It's only supposed to last for a week...----- Ethan is a cocky, arrogant jerk. He's always been that way. Why do girls trip over their own feet just to be with him? I don't know! I'll never understand it. Don't they realize he's just going to ditch them after a couple of weeks? Yes, he can be nice when he wants to be. It's true that he's ridiculously attractive, too. It's not like I want to stare at him when he walks around shirtless, but it's hard not to notice someone like him. He's got that bad boy smile that makes you want to... Did I mention he's my stepbrother? Ick. What? You think I'm falling for him? Nope! It's impossible.
