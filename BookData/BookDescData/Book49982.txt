DARK NEIGHBORHOODS is the first novel in a trilogy called the DARK JOURNEYS TRILOGY.  Dr. Harper Paget is a mythologist and paranormal researcher living in Atlanta who maintains ties to McAbee University in McAbee, IL. Floyd and Emma Hardin, as well as scholarship student Lina Wibosono from Indonesia, live in McAbee where the Hardins work as university instructors/farmers. Harper's wife is murdered in San Diego, CA, and later his penpal lover Mira is murdered in China by creatures that seem to be lamiae from ancient Greece.  These creatures are able to appear throughout time and history by traveling between dimensions. The lamiae, who now are manifesting themselves as Indonesian creatures called kuntilanak, have found their way to the US to prevent Harper's research about them and to end his life just as they destroyed many of his ancestors who battled against them for centuries. He must deal with these seemingly indestructible entities not only with the help of his friends but with the aid of psychic rune reader Adonio and Lina who eventually becomes an instructor herself. Harper also gains assistance from his dead wife's specter, his own grandmother's spirit, and phone calls received in the middle of the night supposedly from his deceased overseas lover. This is a multidimensional paranormal tale where the living meet the dead and where no one knows who is whom.
