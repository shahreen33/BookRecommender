"A big-hearted and clear-eyed story of life’s biggest choices: who to love and how best to love them…Compulsively readable and oh so worth the read." —Heather Harpham, author of Happiness: The Crooked Little Road to Semi-Ever After    
  YOU ARE INVITED…
   To the wedding of Elizabeth and Hank. But the bride and groom are beside the point. Because, on this hot Atlanta afternoon, the people of the hour are the wedding’s (adoring, envious, resentful, hilarious) guests.   Among them, Carla, Elizabeth’s quick-witted, ugly duckling childhood best friend turned Hollywood film scout with a jaundiced view on life (and especially on weddings); Elizabeth’s great-aunt Rachel, who is navigating a no-man’s-land between cultures and identities; Elizabeth’s wheelchair-bound grandfather Albert, who considers his legacy as a man in the boardroom, but mostly in the bedroom; and Annette, the mother of the bride, reminded now of her youthful indiscretions in love.   Tender and bitingly funny, We Are Gathered pulls you in and carries you through a (dysfunctional, loving, witty, unforgettable) world and family; it is a not-to-be-missed debut from a “writer to watch” (Caroline Leavitt).
