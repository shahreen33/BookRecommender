Injured in the woods. Taken in by 4 hunky mountain men. They had one simple rule. I broke it anyway.  Why’d I do it? Because I'm a nosy brat. I had to know what they were doing on Savage Mountain. Why were they hiding there?  And when I found, out, I was sorry I’d snooped. Because these weren’t the nicest of people. Although they sure freaked nice. That made it hard to leave. Well, their tying me to the bed made it hard to leave, too.  Sharing a cabin with 4 brawny mountain men? Yeah, it was as about as hot and dirty as you’d expect it to be.  This naughty, over-the-top romance includes 4 hulking mountain men with checkered pasts and doubtful futures, claiming the one woman they can’t live without.
