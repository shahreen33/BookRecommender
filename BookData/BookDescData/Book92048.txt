Clarice Bean needs a science project or she's in BIG trouble. Her brother Kurt just wants to save the planet. And now they're both up a tree."Sometimes I think gravity is a pity," says Clarice Bean, who is learning all about planet Earth in school. When Mrs. Wilberton assigns a project called The Environment, Clarice’s ever-active brain leaps to the holes in the sky caused by her sister’s hairspray, and to the nature safari that’s in her brother’s bedroom. But when she learns that a big tree right on Navarino Street is about to be chopped to pieces, Clarice has no choice but to join her quirky family up in the tree’s branches, eat spaghetti, and save the day.In a welcome new installment in the Clarice Bean escapades, Lauren Child makes a clear case for ecoaction - and gives the cause of saving the planet a hilarious new spin.
