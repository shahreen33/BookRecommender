There is much written, rumored, told, and retold about Marilyn Monroe, but the most unusual and remarkable fact about her is this: In person as well as in her films, she appeared to be outright luminous―enveloped by a glow, like a firefly in the dark. But exquisite as it can be, luminosity can be a kind of camouflage. It can hide the truth underneath.Through the fictional framework of Marilyn’s therapy sessions and relationship with New York City based psychoanalyst Darcy Dale, psychoanalyst and women's biographer Alma Bond captures just what lay beneath Marilyn’s radiance and spell, drawing readers into a fascinating and tragic portrait of Norma Jean Baker, the real life woman behind the American legend. In her very own raw voice, Marilyn shares the untold experiences of her orphan childhood, youth, and adulthood, dominated by ill-fated relationships with men, that could not be mended by stardom and fame and that inevitably led to tragedy.And yet, the Marilyn that emerges in Bond's story is not a victim, but a woman far ahead of her time. Her natural embodiment of female sexuality helped bring about the Cultural Revolution of the 60's. Smashing "the glass ceiling" Marilyn was the first woman to challenge a major studio (20th Century-Fox) by single-handedly establishing her own motion picture company (Marilyn Monroe Productions). She was a true original, who operated on her own ideas.In Marilyn Monroe: On the Couch, Dr. Alma Bond sees Marilyn Monroe, inside and out. What emerges is an intimate understanding of one of the most beloved and celebrated icons in film and sexual history.
