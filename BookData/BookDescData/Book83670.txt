I don’t even know her name, but I swear I’ll find her and claim her as mine.  Ten seconds.  That’s how long it took for me to decide that this early-morning diner waitress was going to be the next lucky girl to hop onto my princely d*ck. Yeah, I was hungover as f*ck and still wearing last night’s tuxedo, but that’s never exactly been a problem.  Most of the time I don’t even have to ask. His Royal Hardness has a reputation that precedes the rest of me, though not by much -- and girls from all over the kingdom and just dying for a ride.  Not her.  This girl runs away, and I’m left standing there like an *sshole. Now all I’ve got is the memory of her perfect body, luscious lips, and devious smile -- but not her name.  To make matters worse, my father is insisting that I settle down and stop embarrassing him, so he issues an ultimatum: find a wife, or else.  I know exactly who I want.  But first I have to find her.  Finding His Princess is a very steamy, cheesy, and over-the-top Cinderella story that’ll melt your kindle and your heart!
