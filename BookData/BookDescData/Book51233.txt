No one knows me--not the true me shaped by my sordid past. I cover the scars on my soul as well as I hide the ones on my skin.I'm living proof that only the strongest survive on these streets. But I paid a heavy price for my survival.Now I'm ready to move on, to forget my past. In my dreams, I do it with Matt. I've had my eye on him ever since he joined Cooper Construction. Like me, he keeps his true self hidden, locked inside a shy and silent shell.Somehow, I break through. Touch the untouchable. But when love strips us both naked, the truths we reveal may end up tearing us apart.
