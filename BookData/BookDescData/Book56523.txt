Nothing angers a bully more than holding a mirror to who they are.The truth is out, the battle lines drawn. What started as a fight between city and country, escalated into a battle of good versus evil—those with a conscience against those whose greed grows stronger.Turn a blind eye to the sins or leave.I’ve made my choice, and now I intend to ruin the tyrants who stayed.But first, I need to get my brother back.
