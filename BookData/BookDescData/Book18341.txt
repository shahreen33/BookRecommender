Tanzy Hightower is not crazy. At least, that’s what she tells herself.

Crazy sounds like the woman on the radio claiming there’s a whole separate world existing parallel to our own. Still, Tanzy can’t deny the tingle of recognition she feels each time she sees her mother standing at the kitchen window, or hears the panic in the woman’s voice coming through the speakers of her father’s truck.Tanzy intends to follow her father’s footsteps into the professional horse world.
