When Nathan Grey leaves his home to go to a job interview, he encounters an attractive young woman who is much more than she seems. Through an interesting twist, Nathan becomes involved in something that seemed like it would have been impossible just a few short hours ago, and finds that he is, for better or worse, stuck in a situation with Samantha Fisher that could very well be the death of both of them. Sam and Nathanâ€™s journey leads them to some interesting places and to some friends with very questionable skills. This book is a CIA thriller that never makes the mistake of taking itself too seriously.
