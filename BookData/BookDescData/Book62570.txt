We ended up living better than I ever would have imagined.Since then I have not only quit my day job but I have built up sufficient writing income to become a single stay-at-home mother to my youngest child. This feat would not have been possible without the frugality of shoestring living.We live well on about $500 a month - and know how to live on even LESS!Over the years I have shared my secrets with others who have fallen on hard times.
