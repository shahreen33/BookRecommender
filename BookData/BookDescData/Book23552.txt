The success of a piece of communication has always been dependent on the connection between content, form, audience and context â€“ what the message is, who it's aimed at, what it looks like, and how and where it's communicated. In recent years the balance between these elements has shifted.This book bridges the gap between education and emerging practices to provide students and practitioners with the information they need to understand the new skillsets required to succeed in this changing communication environment. Organized into themes of brand, experience, conversation, participation, navigation, advocacy and critique, it explores the core ideas shaping contemporary practice. Alongside case studies of game changing projects, it uses analysis of historical context and interviews with key thinkers and practitioners to provide a relevant and contemporary guide to the creative employment landscape.
