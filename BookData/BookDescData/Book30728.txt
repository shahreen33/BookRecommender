Our journey through life begins new each morning. The totality of these days, one day at a time, is our life experience. It is different for each of us. There are, however, many similarities in our personal experiences. We each experience joy, grief, exuberance, humiliation, optimism, doubt, genius, foolishness, and of course, courage, and fear. We each are so similar in so many different ways it is hard to not see how connected we all are. My hope is to convey my feelings on my experiences so you know you are not alone in your journey each new morning to the next. This new book regards many such experiences in your day's journey that are similar to mine. I hope you find some resonance and solace through events during my life's journey Until Today.
