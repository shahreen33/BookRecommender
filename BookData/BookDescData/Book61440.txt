A friend who idolizes him, yet beats up the biggest bullies and gets the girl.Life is complicated for Kei Kurono. So far, he's had to deal with sleeping next to a sad but excessively cute and endowed girl who asked to be his "pet"; the fact that he's apparently really a fax copy of himself -- the real version having died in the first volume and falling out of the sky after being dropped by some sort of alien eagle.Hiroya Oku created a crazy-popular manga and anime with Gantz, and Dark Horse Comics is more than happy to bring you what might be Japan's weirdest and sexiest sci-fi series ever.Each volume comes shrink-wrapped and carries an 18+ content advisory.
