Hikaru Shindo is like any sixth-grader in Japan: a pretty normal school boy with a two-tone head of hair and a penchant for antics. One day, he finds an old bloodstained GO board in his grandfather's attic-and that's when things get really interesting. Trapped inside the GO board is Fujiwara-no-Sai, the ghost of an ancient GO master who taught the strategically complex board game to the Emperor of Japan many centuries ago. In one fateful moment, Sai becomes a part of Hikaru's consciousness and together, through thick and thin, they make an unstoppable GO-playing team. Will they be able to defeat GO players who have dedicated their lives to the game? Will Sai achieve the "Divine Move" so he'll finally be able to rest in peace? Begin your journey with Hikaru and Sai in this first volume of HIKARU NO GO.
