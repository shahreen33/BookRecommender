Some beautifully hopeful and full of tomorrow's promises.I’ve had many moments in my lifetime, moments that changed me, challenged me. Moments that scared me and engulfed me. However, the biggest ones—the most heartbreaking and breathtaking ones—all included him.I was ten years old when I lost my voice. A piece of me was stolen away, and the only person who could truly hear my silence was Brooks Griffin. He was the light during my dark days, the promise of tomorrow, until tragedy found him. Tragedy that eventually drowned him in a sea of memories.This is the story of a boy and girl who loved each other, but didn’t love themselves. A story of life and death. Of love and broken promises.Of moments.(Book Three in the Elements Series. Complete Standalone. Coming Fall 2016.)
