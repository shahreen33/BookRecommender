This book profiles ten young activists who are taking on the key issues of our time. These young people from across the globe are raising awareness about what matters to them most. An eleven-year-old boy in Texas kneels with his football teammates during the national anthem to protest racial injustice. A thirteen-year-old girl from the Tla'amin First Nation in British Columbia speaks at the United Nations to raise awareness of water pollution. These activists don't let their youth stop them from being heard on issues ranging from racism and cyberbullying to gun violence and animal protection.
