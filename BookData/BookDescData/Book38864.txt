Love. Passion. Obsession.  There was no way to distinguish one from the other in my life. Nothing in this world could destroy a bond as fierce as ours.  Or so I believed…  Because life interfered. Impulsive decisions, reaped unyielding consequences. Fate had a way of making you question your sanity. Loyalties were blurred. Priorities, poisoned. And destiny… destiny dispelled all our beliefs.  In the end love was just too consuming.  Tragic even.  Without a doubt, love... crossed many unfathomable lines.
