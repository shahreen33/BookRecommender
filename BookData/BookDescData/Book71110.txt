Bennett James  Everyone thinks I'm just a young, thrill seeking sass mouth who accidentally stumbled upon my status in the command by being the alpha-mate's best friend. The truth is, I'm a lot more mature than people give me credit for. Including my mate. From the time I was young, while all the other little boys were dreaming of being warriors and fighting for their leap, all I ever dreamed about is meeting my mate and living happily ever after. But my first meeting with my mate didn't go to plan, and he rejected me. Now, living the life everyone else wanted and didn't think I deserved, I couldn't enjoy it or anything else, because I was walking around as only half a person.  Thompsyn Lane  I'm old and grumpy and a bit of a bastard. I'm worried about bringing such a young mate into my life of near seclusion and I react badly to finding out he is only twenty. I regret my behavior immediately, but I'm still not sure I have anything to offer a gorgeous, funny, full of life person like my mate. When I start stalking him like a complete creep, I have to admit to myself that I made a huge mistake. But am I going to be too late to repair the damage I've caused? Maybe using an ability that nobody knows about to track down his missing best friend will be my chance to redeem myself as more than just a grumpy old bear.
