SOMETIMES BEING ALONE IS BETTER…The world has crumbled and the dead walk the earth, but all is not lost, yet. A group of survivors seek salvation at an abandoned pier where the dead can’t get them.But the dead are not the only threat.The people on the pier are not the only group of survivors. There are others out there: bigger, nastier groups. And one just turned up right on the doorstep…The world may have changed, but people haven’t.
