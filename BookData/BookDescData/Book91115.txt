 Flowers, favours, and a cake with a body in it… what a way to start a wedding!   Diana already regrets saying yes to her neighbour’s ridiculous wedding flower demands, but when she discovers a body in the middle of the triple-tier centrepiece… it’s really taking the cake!  The cause of death is found to be murder.  Diana suspects that one of her neighbours may be the killer.  And she already knows that some of them are keeping skeletons in their closets.  Sometimes literally.  Murder would send most people running for the hills, but Diana has a blossoming business to think about.  She needs to get to the bottom of her neighbourhood’s dark past, or her new floriculture business could suffer a blight!  You’ll love this funny British cozy series with its floral inspiration, because everyone loves a fierce female sleuth with a nose for a mystery.  Get it now.
