The darkness almost killed me once…I survived. I survived my ex.I survived myself. I pushed through.Now I have to learn how to live again.I thought learning to fight would help me be stronger. I never expected someone like Max to teach me.Someone who makes me want with just one look.… This time I’ll fight with everything I have. I fight.I teach others to fight.I wasn't looking for anything special. Until I met Her.She wants me to teach her how to fight.After one look I think she just might be the biggest fight of my life.The fight for her heart. Her trust.A fight I have no intention of losing.
