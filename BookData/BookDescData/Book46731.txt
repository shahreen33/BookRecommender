Are Olivia's romantic fantasies about to come true?Lately, Olivia Davidson has felt lonely. Sweet Valley has a major lack of funky, artistic people like herself. So she's kept busy chatting with cool, imaginative guys in Internet chat rooms. One guy in particular could be her perfect match-he's sweet, sincere, and a poet. Olivia doesn't want to admit it, but she might be falling in love with a guy she's never met! Ken Matthews only uses his Internet account to check football scores and stat. But when he accidentally links it to an artists' chat room, he meets an amazing girl who challenges the creative side he never knew he had. And speaking of challenges, she wants to meet him in person! What will happen when she finds out that he's really a football jock and not the poet he's been pretending to be?
