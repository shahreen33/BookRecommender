As the creator of Peanuts, the world's most widely read comic strip, Charles Schulz (1922-2000) touched the hearts and funny bones of millions of people, with his work appearing in more than two thousand newspapers around the world and translated into twenty-one languages. Through such lovable characters as Charlie Brown and Snoopy (not to mention the rest of the Peanuts gang), Schulz created, in the words of Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau, "the uncontested gold standard for comics, " and paved the road for future cartoonists. The Peanuts Treasury is a fitting testimony to Charles Schulz's enduring legacy and will stand for years to come as a loving tribute to one of the most influential cartoonists of all time.
