Mason Thompson hates motorbike racing. It’s stupid, pointless, and dangerous. The glorified man-children who partake in this idiocy are even worse. None more so than Liam Ryan. Liam Ryan is cocky, and he has every reason to be. There’s not a person on the track—or off it—who can get the better of him. He’ll be damned if drop-dead gorgeous paramedic Mason Thompson is the first. But when events and overzealous bloggers seek to force them even further apart, will they risk everything to be together? Will they break ground and realise sometimes the greatest risk results in the ultimate reward?
