Most people would probably be embarrassed to land themselves back in their hometown and working at a pizzeria after an ugly divorce.  Not me.  It’s home, and I have one last shot to make Wren Daniels see me as more than just her brother’s best friend.  When the opportunity to show her what’s been right in front of her this whole time presents itself, I take it, holding nothing back this time.  Wren thinks we’re pretending, but there’s nothing fake about the way I feel.  After all, she’s always had…a pizza my heart.
