Meet Nik Prince, Oscar-winning actor-turned-director. He's bent on transforming a worldwide bestseller into a blockbuster movie, and he must track down the reclusive author of the book. But stubborn Jinx Nixon is in his way... Jinx knows the identity of the writer though she's not about to reveal it! But Nik is as strong-willed as she is and that, combined with his good looks, arrogance and ruthlessness means she will have to fight very hard to control the attraction she feels towards him - and to keep her secret!
