An extended edition off of the best-selling poetry book, Uncaged Wallflower. This edition has over 110 new poems and over 50 images. Uncaged Wallflower is for those who feel trapped in the thoughts their minds produce, unable to express them with the rest of the world out of fear of critique or disagreement. For the people who need an extra dose of positivity in their day and inspiration to follow their dreams. This is not a poetry book for you to read and relate to in a sorrow filled way. It is for you to read and say yes, I can be better, and I will.
