There were rules in the cash-for-beauty game. The money held the power. The beauty followed the rules and jumped through the hoops.THE BRIDEI knew what everyone would think if they knew the truth about my marriage. They'd be shocked and appalled. And rightly so. I was a young, modern, independent woman, and I'd done the unthinkable. I'd sold my virginity to a spoiled, rich boy. To a stranger who didn’t love me. And yes, I'd done it all for money.THE GROOMMy bride was as gorgeous as she was unwelcome. As desirable as she was unwanted. I wanted nothing to do with her, but that didn’t seem to matter exactly the second she got close enough to touch. I wanted her to hate me more than she loved the millions she’d sold herself for. I wanted to spurn her, but unfortunately, I wanted to fuck her more.ARRANGED is a standalone erotic romance.
