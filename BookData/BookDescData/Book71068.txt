Hollyster RomanArguing with Cowen over video chats it one of my absolute favorite things to do. And though we've never met, I've found that calling him to yell at him about the way he treats my people is the highlight of my week. But the man really does need a partner, and his boss insists it's someone from my department, so after several failed attempts at placing another agent with him, I take on the daunting task myself.Who knew fighting with Cowen in person rather than video chat would be even moreâ€¦ stimulating? When the boys from Purdy need our help to find out who all is on the side of the evil bastard Heath, we quickly realize just how well we work together. And we discover some other things too.Cowen MaxwellHaving Hollyster in my house, taking over my space and being a general pain in my ass should be the torture. What's torture is realizing my little obsession with him is quickly turning into more. When the delphinium keeping me from catching his scent falls off in the middle of the night, it is suddenly very clear why I can't look at him without wanting. Why the idea of him leaving my house makes my stomach churn. Why the idea of using him as bait to get inside the bunker where Heath is keeping his new collection of chosen makes me so damn angry and utterly terrified. But will Hollyster be able to accept a cranky old man with a bad attitude as the man he spends forever with?Warning: Mpreg elements! Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses::
