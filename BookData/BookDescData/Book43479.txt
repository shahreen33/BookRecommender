Two complete novels in one volume of the adventures of the mysterious masked crime fighter known as "The Spider," hunted by the underworld and the police alike. In one, the Spider battles an army of giant robots that has New York City under siege--a storyline so fraught with action and peril, that the very creators of Superman had borrowed it for one of the Man of Steel's comic strip adventures. It also was the inspiration for the major motion picture, "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow." In the second novel, the spider battles a criminal mastermind who threatens the entire northeast with thousands of poison-fanged vampire bats unless his terms are met. Can even the Spider--hunted by the law as never before after faked evidence has branded him as the master of the killer bats--unmask the identity of the Vampire King before thousands die horribly?
