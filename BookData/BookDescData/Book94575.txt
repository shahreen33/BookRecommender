They make their first stop at a central oasis of food and drink called the Monks' Table. Mary Helen overhears a woman saying to the man with her, "I am surprised someone hasn't killed you already." But Eileen assures her that it's only a way of speaking, and Mary Helen is relieved---until the next night, when she finds the same man in the pub's ladies' room, murdered.Mary Helen's reputation for sleuthing follows her across the Atlantic, and the Irish police warn her not to get involved. She has every intention of leaving this case in the hands of the authorities, but sometimes Fate will just not listen to reason.Fans of this delightful nun, a detective in spite of herself, will be certain to enjoy accompanying her on this latest trip, the eleventh entry in this continuingly popular series.
