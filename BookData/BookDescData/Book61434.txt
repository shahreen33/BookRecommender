A man haunted by his past. A woman who will do anything to get what she wants. A whole lot of pain and trouble down the road for one of them.  Everybody’s got it in for maverick PI Evan Buckley. It’s enough to drive him crazy with his head full of lies and half-truths, treachery and torture at every turn—now he finds himself the prime suspect in the latest murder. It looks like somebody with a hidden agenda set him up.  Meanwhile, the dead man’s brother is out of jail and somebody told him Evan’s his man if it’s Old Testament style vengeance he’s after. He’s an eye-for-an-eye sort of guy with a homemade garrote and a line in gallows humor, but nobody’s laughing when he gets his piano wire around Evan’s neck.  A Time To Kill is the gripping second part in James Harper’s thriller trilogy, Dixie Killer Blues. With characters you’ll grow to love and edge-of-your-seat action it’s easy to see why it’s been described as "Pulp Fiction" meets "No Country For Old Men".
