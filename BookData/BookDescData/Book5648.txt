From USA Today Bestselling Author K Webster, comes a new MM standalone novel!  I’m used to being in charge. In the courtroom. In life. In the bedroom. But then I met him.  He brings me literally to my knees.  Handsome. Charismatic. Sexy as hell. He’s everything I desperately crave to possess.  I’m burning to get him beneath me just to have a taste. Turns out, though, one taste isn’t enough. And he’s starved for me too.  Two alphas fighting for dominance. He thrives on control and I can’t give it up.  A battle of wills. The bedroom is the battlefield and our hearts are on the line.
