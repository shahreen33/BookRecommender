Before Viet Nam, before the Beatles, before love-ins and flower power, there was 1963. Against a backdrop that Boomers will appreciate and Millennials will not envy, The Good Liar is an emotionally charged tale of love, betrayal, and heartbreaking disappointment. It’s a life-changing year for Cassie Taylor, a beautiful, over-protected seventeen-year-old with a non-existent social life. In order to fulfill her lifelong dreams of becoming a Hollywood star, Cassie must first get a job so she can escape her controlling and abusive father. Cassie bides her time until graduation, and prays. When Sam Gordon comes along professing his love, it seems Cassie’s prayers are answered. But sometimes, prayers are not answered in the way that we expect.
