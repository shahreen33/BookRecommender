From International Bestselling author, Dr. Rebecca Sharp...
Small-town girl. America’s Sweetheart. The biggest popstar in the world.It began with one guy and then the next. Until my reputation preceded me. Yes, I dated them - all of them. Yes, I also broke up with them.. All of them.Was it too much? The world said yes. Too many, too quickly.And my star began to flicker.The world knew nothing about my life and yet, their judgement weighed on me like stone.My reputation was falling faster than a shooting star and the only way to save it was with the boy who never wanted me.Zach Parker was a singer, songwriter, and sexy as sin. To him, I was just the neighbor’s little sister. A pest that had grown into a famous annoyance.Zach Parker wanted nothing to do with me. But he could be tempted - with a stepping stone to fame, that is.The plan was simple: Childhood Sweethearts Fall in Love on US Tour.The plan was to let them see what they wanted to see: our ‘romance’ blossom right in front of their eyes.A romance that Zach had made painfully clear to me years ago would never exist.I’m told that it was the only thing that could repair my image.So, every night I’ll stand on that stage and give Zach my heart piece by piece, note by note.We’ll give them a show they’ll never forget - and a love story that I may not survive.
  Because who cares that in order to put my reputation back together, I’ll have to tear my heart apart?
