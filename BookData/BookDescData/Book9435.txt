Martin is a 24 year old guy who falls in love with a 38 year old woman. He has to grow so fast emotionally that he feels like he just got hit by a speeding bus. Not only is Frances fourteen years Martin's senior, but she's all about putting Zen into relationship, which involves every guy's worst nightmare: talking about your feelings, being conscious of your thoughts and above all, unabashed, honest communication at all times. Martin has no idea what he is getting himself into and the sharp learning curve that's required of him especially when he's thinking sex but she's thinking Zen.WARNING: This book contains irony, tongue-in-cheek sarcasm and heavy doses of wit. Not suitable for readers expecting a traditional rom-com where the male character is a billionaire or some other fantasy variation of an alpha male. In fact, when it comes to love, the main character, Martin, has been described as a bumbling idiot... so please be warned.
