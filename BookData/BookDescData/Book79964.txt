Is Bastounis still an addict? Who is following him and why? Is he researching his final, much-anticipated novel? Who are the people he’s meeting along the way? And how far will one young man ultimately go in the name of experience?A Collar for Cerberus is a story about time, life, pleasure and the decisions we make.
