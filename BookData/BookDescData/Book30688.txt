When 88-year old Maggie McFarland is found shot to death on the grounds of the burned-down Artemis Hotel in the small Upstate New York fishing village of Roscoe, the only clue is a .45 caliber, World War II, shell casing. There are no apparent motives, no suspects, and no other clues, making this one of the most baffling cases of Matt's career as Chief of Police. Confounding matters is a battle over a proposed wind turbine farm that threatens to not only endanger the financial future of the town, but to set local residents one against another as well. Broken Promises is the latest in the Matt Davis Mystery Series, and as usual, the answer to the conundrum lies both in the present and in the past. Broken Promises is the fourth Matt Davis Mystery, and is scheduled for release on May 1, 2013 in both paperback and Kindle editions.
