Time snakes between alternate universes. Ever watchful, an alien intelligence survives on Mars, waiting to be found by spacefarers from Earth. The alien’s ultimate goal is to send human astronauts back in time, where they will alter the past and thwart the extinction of the dinosaurs. A race of intelligent dinosaurs, resembling the alien’s extinct species, subsequently evolves to rule the world. But a human female astronaut, through a strange twist of fate, survives the change in the space-time continuum. After finding herself in a dinosaurian body, she must race against time – and the formidable alien – to restore the universe to its rightful course. Book One of the Dinosaurian Time Travel Series.Dragon Dawn takes the intriguing plot device of time travel and uses cutting edge science to produce a new spin on the evolution of intelligence. The subject matter blends fields of study the author, Deborah O’Neill Cordes, loves in equal measure; she holds a bachelor’s degree in zoology and a master’s degree in history. She offers her readers a window into exotic worlds: lushly beautiful, often terrifying – and wholly compelling.
