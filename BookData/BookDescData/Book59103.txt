Alternate cover edition here."This new world weighs a yatto-gram. ""But everything is trial-size; tread-on-me-tiny or blurred-out-offocus huge. There are leaves that have grown as big as cities, and there are birds that nest in cockleshells. On the white sand there are long-toed claw prints deep as nightmares, and there are rock pools in hand-hollows finned by invisible fish" . . .Mankind has rendered its planet unlivable and is beginning to colonize a new blue planet. Our heroine Billie Crusoe's flight to the future is also a return to the distant past--"Everything is imprinted forever with what once was." What begins as a witty, satirical futurist adventure deepens into a dazzling exploration of our relationship to environment, to power and technology, and to what defines us as humans.For over twenty years Jeanette Winterson has consistently been one of our most brilliant writers. Lyrical, visionary, by turns funny and devastating, "The Stone Gods" is fiction at its most provocative.
