Note to self: don’t sleep with the gorgeous, tattooed, motorcycle-driving hottie after a friend’s train wreck of a bachelorette party. Especially not when he looks at you like he wants to devour you.Especially not when he’s a little younger looking than you.Especially not when it turns out he’s your newest student.…Oops.Ethan Scott is the kind of man your mother warns you about. Reckless, cocky af, damaged, beautiful, of course, and completely irresistible. And if that weren’t a long enough laundry list of reasons to stay away?…He’s also eight years my junior, and my student at the private high school where I teach art.Winchester Academy’s newest bad boy student—my student—is utterly off limits.

Something about him makes me say yes instead of no.Something about him has me aching for more, no matter the consequences.…This might be a problem.
