Emily was a cop's daughter, and I was the boy from the wrong side of the tracks. At eighteen, our affair was wild and completely secret. Until she left town for college and a better life, and I hit the road to nowhere.Eight years later, we're both back in town. My father is in prison; she's selflessly helping her sister. We should be farther apart than we've ever been. But I've never been able to resist temptation, especially when that temptation is Emily.I shouldn't go near her. But I do.She shouldn't say yes. But she does.Our chemistry is hotter than ever, but she’s hiding something from me. Just like I’m hiding something from her. It’s hard to tell whose secrets are more dangerous, until it all goes to hell.I can save her - and she can save me. But we’ll have to break the rules.We're from different worlds. We don't belong together.But in the end, Emily and I are going to have to get dirty.
