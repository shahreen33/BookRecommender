LIGHTSPEED is an online science fiction and fantasy magazine. In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF--and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales.  This month Deji Bryce Olukotun serves up a complicated story of morality, justice and interstellar cannibalism in "Between the Dark and the Dark." In her new SF tale "The Harvest of a Half-Known Life", G.V. Anderson creates a post-apocalyptic world where knowledge is precious, but so is your hair and skin. We also have SF reprints by Ken Liu ("An Advanced Reader's Picture Book of Comparative Cognition") and Yoon Ha Lee ("Warhosts").  Isabel Ca√±as knits fantasy and romance in "The Weight of a Thousand Needles," and Caspian Gray's "Unpublished Gay Cancer Survivor Memoir" adds magic to an unpromising millenial's life. Our fantasy reprints are from the legendary Karen Joy Fowler ("The Last Worders") and Ellen Kushner ("When Two Swordsmen Meet").  All that, and of course we also have our usual assortment of author spotlights, along with our book and media review columns. We'll also have an interview with debut novelist--and frequent LIGHTSPEED contributor--Cadwell Turnbull.  Our ebook readers will enjoy an ebook-exclusive reprint of the novella "Dust to Dust," by Tochi Onyebuchi. We also have a pair of excerpts this month: one from Bryan Camp's new novel GATHER THE FORTUNES, and one from Peter Cawdron's book REENTRY.
