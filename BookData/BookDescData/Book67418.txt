That means she will not choose between her men. This series is not for those under the age of 18 because it contains sensitive content. Please see the foreword for specific triggers. They are located in sections that are listed so anyone who wishes to do so can skip said section without getting lost. There is also a warning by Everly herself just before the break. This book does contain steamy scenes as well as battles.
