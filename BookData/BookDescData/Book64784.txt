One woman's tragic struggle against abuse. The controversial story that captured the conscience of a nation.Published for the first time in one volume, here is the riveting account of Jane Hurshman's courageous fight against domestic violence, first chronicled in the books Life with Billy and Life After Billy. Brian Vallée tells of the horrifying physical, verbal, and depraved sexual abuse Jane Hurshman suffered at the hands of her violent husband, Billy Stafford. He recounts Jane's frustrating attempts to seek help from law enforcement officials who considered her abuse a "family matter." And he tells of the desperate act of a woman finally forced to take the law into her own hands. Here, too, is the lengthy and painful legal battle that shocked, divided, and ultimately enlightened a nation about the pervasive but hidden issue of domestic violence. Finally, Vallée brings us the true story behind the heartbreaking mystery of Jane's own violent death a decade later. Yet on these pages it is Jane's indomitable spirit and courage as a leading spokeswoman and advocate in the ongoing struggle against domestic violence that shine through. Long after Jane's utimely death, this is her legacy.
