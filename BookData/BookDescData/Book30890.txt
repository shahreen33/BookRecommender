"Ian Ridpath and Wil Tirion — two consummate professionals in the field — have teamed up to produce an exemplary text with first-rate illustrations to inspire the beginning sky-gazer. I heartily recommend this text." — Neil English, Astronomy Now magazineA user-friendly companion for stargazers of all ages, this classic beginner's guide describes all the main sights of the night sky. The newly updated book contains a chapter for each month, describing prominent stars, constellations, star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies. Readers will discover when to watch meteor showers, when eclipses will occur, and how to follow the movements of the four brightest planets (Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn).Most of the sights are visible to the naked eye, and all can be seen with binoculars or a small telescope. Sections on observing the Moon and the planets include 50 easy-to-use maps that introduce the skies of the Northern Hemisphere and a comprehensive guide to observing the Moon. "The star maps are first quality … I find them to be a pleasure to look at and use. If you have a young person or friend you would like to share your love of astronomy with, get them a pair of binoculars and this book and you'll have a stargazing friend for life." — Mike Simonsen, Slacker Astronomy
