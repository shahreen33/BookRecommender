I go by many names: Playboy, Hustler, Villain. They call me a sadistic a**hole because I rob from the poor and cheat on the weak. Do I ever regret the choices I’ve made? All the damn time. But it’s too late to turn back, and too late to start over… I’ve never even considered giving it all up for anyone or anything before. Never had a reason or motivation to change. Until I met her. Callista Rayner. Heiress. Goddess. Need-her-ass-up-on-my-mattress. My last chance at redemption. Problem was, I couldn’t afford to fall for her, because I didn’t want to ruin her. I didn’t want to destroy her, like the others that came before. Too bad I had no choice. Too bad she was my pawn and I had to use her. Too bad, too bad, too bad.  NOTE: This is a full-length, standalone dark romance/romantic suspense that contains sensitive subject matter.
