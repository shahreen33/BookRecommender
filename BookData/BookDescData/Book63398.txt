Werewolves meet the Wild West in this captivating new shifter romance series from T. S. Joyce.  Kristina Yeaton is running from her past as a working girl at a Chicago brothel. Determined to start fresh in the wilds of Colorado, she answers an advertisement in the paper for a wife. So what if she doesn’t fit the description Luke Dawson wants in a woman? She aims to survive the hell that’s coming for her, and for that, she’ll need a strapping man who isn’t afraid to get his hands a little bloody.  Kristina expects a hideous husband with a bad attitude to match. What she finds in Colorado Springs is crude talking, sexy as hell, commitment phobic, Luke. Sure, his eyes are a strange color, and the snarl in his throat can be off-putting, but as she gets to know more about him, she falls head over high-backed heels for the growly stranger. If she can get him to the circuit preacher before he learns her secrets, she just might have a shot at staying alive.  Werewolf, Luke Dawson, is struggling with dark secrets of his own when Kristina barrels onto his homestead. No doubt she’s hiding something big, but she’s also stirring up feelings he’s never felt before. His wolf is more dangerous to her than she knows though, and he’ll have to work to keep her safe, even from himself.  And as it turns out, he’s not the only one hunting her.
