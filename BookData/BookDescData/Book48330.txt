From Wall Street Journal &amp; USA Today Bestseller Vivian Wood comes a taboo tale of love, lust, and longing.I loved her once, a long time ago. Effie goddamn White, the raven-haired, pouty-lipped temptress.Hell, I was f*cking obsessed with her. Her touch, her smell, her taste… I couldn’t get enough.And she shattered my cold, hardened heart into a million pieces.I’ll never let that happen again. Ever. I know better.My brother Thorne waited in the wings. When I left, he pounced. Now I’m back, and Effie’s on Thorne’s arm, wearing Thorne’s ring. But she’s looking at me. And when we are trapped together, she’s undressing me with those baby blue eyes. Touching me. Tormenting me. That thing that I said would never happen twice?F*ck, she’s doing it to me again. And I love the way it feels, almost as much as she does...
