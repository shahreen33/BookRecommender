Being labelled a player never stopped me from being successful with women. Until I met Truly Harbury.Truly was the first girl who ever turned me down.The first female friend I ever had.And she might just be the first woman I ever fall in love with.When an emergency means she needs my help running her family’s charity, I’m happy to introduce her to the glitz and glamour of the London business world—taking her to dinners, coaching her through speeches, zipping up the sexy evening gown I helped her pick out.The more time we spend together, the more I want to convince her I’m not a man to avoid, that we’re not as unsuited as she believes.She sees herself as the book-reading, science-loving introvert while I’m the dangerous, outgoing, charmer.She thinks I love parties and people whereas she prefers pajamas and a takeaway.What she doesn’t realize is that I like everything about her–the way her smile lights up a room, how her curves light up my imagination, and especially the way her lips taste when coated with tequila.She’s the first woman I ever fell in love with. I just need to know if she could ever love me too.
