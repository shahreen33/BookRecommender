After years of abuse, Sundry is rescued and brought into a world she didn’t know existed; a world that is both enticing and dangerous. Not only does she find out vampires, were’s, fairies, and others exist in a world called Alt, but she happens to be one herself, and has an Ability to prove it.  After being rescued from her kidnappers, she finds out that she has multiple personalities—literally. There are remnants of Sundry out in the world living their lives separately from her. Now it’s up to Sundry and her sponsor—and sex-friend—Jordan, to locate and reunite them with Sundry. There has never been an Alt like Sundry, and no one knows what to expect when she reunites with her remnants.  Sundry has never been able to live in the human world. Can she survive in the Alt world?
