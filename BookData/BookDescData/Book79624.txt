One of the most influential works of this century, The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays is a crucial exposition of existentialist thought. Influenced by works such as Don Juan and the novels of Kafka, these essays begin with a meditation on suicide; the question of living or not living in a universe devoid of order or meaning. With lyric eloquence, Albert Camus brilliantly posits a way out of despair, reaffirming the value of personal existence, and the possibility of life lived with dignity and authenticity.Contents:[Preface / Albert Camus] --Myth of Sisyphus --Absurd reasoning : Absurdity and suicide ; Absurd walls ; Philosophical suicide ; Absurd freedom --Absurd man : Don Juanism ; Drama ; Conquest --Absurd creation : Philosophy and fiction ; Kirilov ; Ephemeral creation --Myth of Sisyphus --Appendix : Hope and the absurd in the work of Franz Kafka --Summer in Algiers --Minotaur, or the stop in Oran --Helen's exile --Return to Tipasa --Artist and his time.
