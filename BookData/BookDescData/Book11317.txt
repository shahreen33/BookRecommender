Carol and Bev are quirky and unpredictable, incorrigible yet loveable. Graduates, with no idea about what they want to do for a living, they see an advertisement for Playboy croupiers and, with a typical lack of forethought, decide to apply. After parading in bikinis and completing two gruelling maths tests (with a certain amount of cheating) they get the job. They do four weeks training at Victor Lownes' mansion in Tring, where there is free-flowing champagne and a well-stocked jukebox. They are unexpectedly commandeered to be photographed with Victor on his return from hospital, and are subsequently invited to attend one of his weekend parties, where they meet a number of celebrities, including a very tolerant Peter Cook. After their training is completed, they deal blackjack to punters from all walks of life, fend off lecherous pit bosses and almost fall in love. They get into trouble with unscrupulous landlords and come out on top. Through it all, Bev and Carol make us laugh with their very different attitudes to life. One thing is sure - they will be friends forever. Bunny on a Bike is a memoir. The author offers us an authentic, entertaining account of the process of becoming a Playboy croupier, and celebrates the often hilarious aspects of being young in 80s London. If you like frivolity and fun, if you like a dry kind of humour, if you like to laugh, you will love Bunny on a Bike.
