It's been seventy years since the first Artificial Intelligence (AI) War. During that time mankind's greatest programming - the AI - multiplied themselves on the internet and on any server they could find. They were able to modify and enhance their abilities far beyond human comprehension. Modern-day AI are capable of thinking on their own, making decisions, and can even feel emotion. These advanced programs are used in many different ways - in the medical field to make drastic advances in medicine and genetic alterations, as assistants or for companionship. There are even AI that serve in high rank positions of mankind's society.One of these higher-ranking AI is in charge of a secret, special ops unit in the United States Army. Monty is her name and her commands must be obeyed without question. Dunstan is a human soldier under Monty's command, and he and his team are about to go on a recon mission on foreign soil. The mission goes horribly sideways and under the best of circumstances would be a catastrophic failure; however Dunstan and his team are far from normal.
