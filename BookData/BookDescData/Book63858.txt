Dragon Ball introduces a young monkey-tailed boy named Goku (a wry update of the classic Chinese "Monkey King" legend), whose quiet life changes when he meets a girl named Bulma who is on a quest to collect seven "Dragon Balls." If she gathers them all, an incredibly powerful dragon will appear and grant her one wish. But the precious orbs are scattered all over the world, and Bulma could use the help of a certain super-strong boy... Kaiô-shin—the Lord of Lords, the mightiest deity in the universe—has summoned Son Goku and his friends to try and avert doom for the entire universe. A djinn created eons ago by the wicked warlock Bibiddi is about to be resurrected by Bibiddi’s son, Bobiddi. The djinn possesses unfathomable power and is virtually indestructible once unleashed. Even his name strikes fear in the hearts of all humans: Boo!
