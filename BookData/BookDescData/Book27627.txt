Lovebites &amp; Razorlines is a compendium of thirteen unique nightmares. From the darkest parts of New York City to subterranean dreamscapes and clubs hidden away from the public, J. Daniel Stone's hypnotic prose guides you through the aberrant jungle of life’s seedy half. Inside we meet artists starving for attention, hungry shadows; we fall prey to disease, become entranced by psychedelic encounters and learn from introspection far beyond anyone's years. Lyrical philosophies plague the mind of a young pregnant woman not willing to have the baby. A young man longs to discover death in hopes to locate the mother that never loved him. Music is the key to putting a soul back in dead things. A couple must come to terms with recent HIV infection. A pair of artists feed off one another’s talents in order to understand the supernatural. A transsexual longs for the ultimate transformation.J. Daniel Stone's characters question reality, challenge norms and break down conventional barriers. They live on the fringe and are unapologetic about it. They destroy familiar tropes through poetry and painting, music and photography.Lovebites &amp; Razorlines is an anthem for the depraved and forgotten.
