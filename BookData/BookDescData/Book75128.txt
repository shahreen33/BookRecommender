When the world ended, there was the Eighty. Eighty people given the chance for survival. Given the chance to board a revamped space shuttle programmed to find them a new place to live. Somewhere to start over after an asteroid had destroyed the entire human race. Now, after a five-hundred-year "nap," the Eighty have landed---but not everyone survived the trip. And some of those who did aren't quite right. Actually, there are a lot of things that aren't quite right---especially about the place the Eighty land. Half the terrain looks as if it's been made of bright, crazy brush-strokes, the other is like a haunting black-and-white photograph. Jobs, 2Face, Mo'Steel, and the others don't know if they're on another planet. If they're dreaming. Or if they are alive at all. But if they are alive, can they survive on this strange, new world...?
