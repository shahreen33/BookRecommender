No one can be trusted in this unrelenting thriller—pure Ludlum, with friends no less dangerous than foes. Anderson Harp’s William Parker series starts here! It is 2010 and North Korea is starving its people to pay for its newest high-tech weapons system. The rogue nation has invested all its resources into Peter Nampo, a talented scientist who is developing missile technology capable of eliminating its enemies’ satellites in space and delivering a nuclear payload into the heart of the United States. Marine recon veteran and small-town prosecutor William Parker is recruited by a dark-ops taskforce run by the CIA and Pentagon. His mission? Infiltrate the Hermit Kingdom and find Nampo’s top-secret location. As Parker trains for, then launches, his extraordinary operation, he knows his chances of survival are low. But he has no idea he’s about to become part of a mission much more dangerous than the one he set out on. “Want to see what the military’s really like?
