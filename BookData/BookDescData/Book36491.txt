Dear Isaiah,Eight months ago, you were just a soldier about to be deployed and I was just a waitress, sneaking you free pancakes and hoping you wouldn’t notice that my gaze was lingering a little too long. But you did notice. We spent a “week of Saturdays” together before you left, and we said goodbye on day eight, exchanging addresses at the last minute. I saved every letter you ever sent, your words quickly becoming my religion. But you went radio silent on me months ago, and then you had the audacity to walk into my diner yesterday and act like you’d never seen me in your life. To think … I almost loved you and your beautifully complicated soul. Almost.Whatever your reason is—I hope it’s a good one. Maritza the WaitressPS – I hate you, and this time … I mean it.
