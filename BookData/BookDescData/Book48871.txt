John Gilmore's close friendship with James Dean began in New York when both were struggling unknowns and continued until Dean's untimely death. In "Live Fast -- Die Young," he tells the story of their relationship, including their sexual encounters with men, women, and each other. Through letters, diaries, tape-recorded conversations with Dean, and remembrances by those closest to him such as Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, Sal Mineo, Eartha Kitt, Natalie Wood, and Sammy Davis, Jr., Gilmore constructs a seldom-seen portrait of the star.
