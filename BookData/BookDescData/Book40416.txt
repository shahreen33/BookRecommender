From the crisp frosts of autumn into the secret snows of winter, the exuberant renewal of spring, and the shimmering warmth of summer, Gather Up, Gather In presents a child's-eye view of the seasons as they unfold. The spare, evocative prose-poem is perfectly complemented by luminous illustrations of the passing year. Full color.
