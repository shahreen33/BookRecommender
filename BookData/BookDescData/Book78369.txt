Family is number one; whether they are blood related or patched in.At thirteen-years-old, the bastard son of an asshole who wanted me to fail, I learned that lesson.Thanks to one man.Liam Walker raised me, taught me how to be an adult, and loved the hell out of my mother, me, and my sisters. He funneled my anger into productiveness when teenage me lost the love of his life. Because of him, I knew how to love her when she came back. His dedication to me and my sisters was the example I needed when my twins were born.Tracing his footsteps may not have been my birthright, but him turning over the president patch to me is what I’ve waited for since I was thirteen. Calm, cool, and collected – that’s how he ran The Heaven Hill MC – and it’s how I’ve run it too.Until now.Ambushed on our own streets. Fighting an enemy we didn’t know we had. Innocent people hurt all because of a misguided sense of entitlement.The difference between me and Liam? I have anger I’ve held back, kept my emotions under control for half my life, been the loving man I’m supposed to be, but for this piece of shit who threatened us? I’m about to unleash something he’s never seen before.My fury.
