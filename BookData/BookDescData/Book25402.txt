This lavishly photographed book captures the beauty and mystery of Monument Valley, the Navajo Nation's Tribal Park. The Valley's distinctive rock forms-the backdrop of numerous Hollywood westerns-have come to represent a quintessential Old West Landscape. An ancient people settled here ten centuries ago. Today, Navajo residents live in harmony with this challenging land. Interpretive text outlining the natural and human history of the region accompanies carefully chosen contemporary and historic photographs.
