Ruby Oliver is 15 and has a shrink. She knows it’s unusual, but give her a break—she’s had a rough 10 days. In the past 10 days she: lost her boyfriend (#13 on the list),  lost her best friend (Kim),  lost all her other friends (Nora, Cricket),  did something suspicious with a boy (#10),  did something advanced with a boy (#15),  had an argument with a boy (#14),  drank her first beer (someone handed it to her),  got caught by her mom (ag!),  had a panic attack (scary), lost a lacrosse game (she’s the goalie),  failed a math test (she’ll make it up),  hurt Meghan’s feelings (even though they aren’t really friends),  became a social outcast (no one to sit with at lunch) and had graffiti written about her in the girls’ bathroom (who knows what was in the boys’!?!). But don’t worry—Ruby lives to tell the tale. And make more lists.
