What would you do if you woke one morning and found almost everyone you knew dead? Your spouse, significant other, children, parents, siblings, neighbors? What if, when you went out from your neighborhood, you found out almost everyone, everywhere was dead?Most of us don’t have a clue how to survive if stranded in a wilderness, let alone try to survive when most of those we meet may try to kill us. For Bill Arthur, this was the reality he woke up to one September morning.In “The Morning Star”, we follow Bill Arthur on his quest to survive in a lawless land and lay the foundation for a new world where his fellow survivors and nature are all too often against him. We follow him on his journey to find a place to call home, follow him as he runs across three people with whom he shares his dream and who are willing to throw their lot in with him and make his dream theirs.“The Morning Star” is a post-apocalyptic tale of what is possible if we only dare to dream.
