A minister who believes Jesus never lived. Murder by means of hari kari. An internet brothel empire. The Cool, Grey City of Love. What does it all mean?  That’s what private detective Justinia Wright and Harry, her brother and sidekick, have to find out. To do so, they have to get the prime suspect off the hook and that puts Tina in the crosshairs of her friend and lover, Lieutenant Cal Swenson of Homicide.  In the cold and wintry land of Minnesota Nice, Tina and Harry once again cross paths with those who don’t play nice. Those who’d rather see you dead than at the church lutefisk supper.  But Jesus Never Wept is the third book in CW Hawes’s Justinia Wright, Private Investigator Mysteries series. Fans of Sharon McCone, Kinsey Milhone, VI Warshawski, and Nero Wolfe will love this whodunit where nothing is as it seems and love does not conquer all.  Once again the game is afoot.
