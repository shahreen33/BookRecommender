Since the invention of radio broadcast humans had become noisy. Luckily for the citizens of Earth a benevolent species of alien, known as Bopecans, had been the first to hear the noise. Once they arrived the Bopecans explained that others were out there, they too would be coming and not all of them would be as well intentioned as the Bopecans. Humans needed to be ready. They helped the human race establish an agency to police the solar system and pursue fugitives of it. This agency became known as Star Marshals. Now, nearly forty years after their inception, vague messages have arrived from a mysterious source. These cryptic messages indicate a potentially monumental threat to our solar system. A pair of marshals are dispatched to the moons of Jupiter to investigate.  Star marshals Todd Jordan and Simon Cain have been best friends since college. Now, a first time father to a six month old baby girl, Simon is heading out on his first assignment back after paternity leave. After much soul searching, Simon has decided that this will be his last Off Earth Assignment (O.E.A). What he is uncertain of is how his best friend and partner Todd will take the news.
