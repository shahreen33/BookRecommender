Living Well, Spending Less is Ruth Soukup's first book, following her wildly successful blog of the same name. She gives her readers even more of what they love about the blog: lots of creative, helpful ideas and advice for moms on a budget along with stories from her own journey to discovering what the Good Life is really all about.
