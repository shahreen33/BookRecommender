Waking up in hell was not Del Bellator’s idea of a good time. She’d rather be back on earth, killing demons and hunting down magical treasure for her shop, Ancient Magic. Turns out that escaping hell is easy—it’s staying out that’s hard. Del’s death magic defies the laws of the supernatural world. Worse—she doesn’t know how to control it. If others learn what she is, it’s guaranteed persecution by the Order of the Magica. And Del already has a deadly and forbidden secret—she shares a soul with a dragon. Things get sticky when Roarke Fallon, Warden of the Underworld, shows up on her doorstep wanting to drag her back to hell. He’s a one of a kind shifter—the most powerful she’s ever met—and he’s set his sights on her. Helping him catch an escaped demon gives her an opportunity to win her freedom, but only if she teams up with Roarke. She’ll have to use her forbidden magic to get the job done. And that is a recipe for discovery… and disaster. Magic Undying features a kick butt heroine, a powerful hero, and otherworldly adventure.
