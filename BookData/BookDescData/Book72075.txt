The Sky is Falling! The year 2061 marks the return of Halley's Comet and the 50th anniversary of the Awakening--do you celebrate or run for cover? Each day brings a new surprise. Will you transform into a genetic changeling or fall prey to a doomsday cult? Will you be in Denver when the dragon runs amok or in Japan when the Ring of Fire deals death to the Empire?

It details a new dragon, new spirits, and new genetic expressions that can affect your character. Year of the Comet is intended for gamemasters and players of all experience levels.
