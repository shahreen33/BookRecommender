Fresh out of college and headed straight for my dream job, I didn’t think things could get any better.Then I met my dream man. In an instant, my happy ever after had begun.The life I’d stumbled into was beautiful, and the man I loved was perfect. But perfection comes at a cost, and I’d slumbered through all the alarms. Then I met my nightmare. The man whose bright eyes held untamed darkness. The man who disarmed me with his peculiar behavior. The man whose cold, merciless hands shook me awake. In an instant, questions started to dismantle my happy ever after.But whoever said the truth would set you free was wrong.It wasn’t going to repair the cracks in my naive heart. It wasn’t going to caress my face with comforting hands and reassure me it was all just a dream.No, the truth shoved me down a rabbit hole, and I landed in the lair of a real-life monster.
