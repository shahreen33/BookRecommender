Sally Jensen--once a famous astronaut--thought her days in space were over. She was wrong.The object entered our solar system, slowed down off the rings of Saturn, and began a steady approach towards Earth. No one knows what its purpose is. It has made no attempt at communication and has ignored all of NASA's transmissions.Having forsaken manned flight, the space programs of the world scramble to enlist forcefully-retired NASA legend Sally Jensen--the only person with the first-hand operational knowledge needed to execute a mission to make contact.With no time to spare she must lead a crew with no experience farther than mankind has ever traveled, to a visitor whose intentions are far from clear...and who, with each passing day, gets closer to home.
