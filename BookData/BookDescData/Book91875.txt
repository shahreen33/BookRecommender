'Have you sold your soul to the devil?' asked the boy. 'Everybody has sold their soul to the devil,' sighed Christmas. 'That's why you can't get a decent bloody price.'Harry Christmas has it all: grief, debt, gout, red trousers. Running away to Caracas might seem like a good idea but mischief is a greedy companion. Escape turns to tragedy and love becomes shames as Christmas finds himself the agent of far greater havoc....A comic novel that is as funny as it is heart-breaking, Jasper Gibson's debut marks the arrival of a bold new voice in British fiction.
