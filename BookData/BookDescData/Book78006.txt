First came The Unseen University Challenge, the first Discworld quizbook, which left a trail of exploded minds from London to Ankh-Morpork. Now The Wyrdest Link takes trivia to bizarre new heights, with hundreds more Discworld posers about Terry Pratchett's far-out fantasy world—questions in the merciless tradition of the Star Chamber and the Spanish Inquisition. As before, the quizbook—presented with offbeat twists and linking themes—is varied with trick questions, outrageous mind-bogglers, and the occasional near-impossible conundrum to suit Discworld fans of all levels.
