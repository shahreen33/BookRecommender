You knew him as the Punisher. Frank Castle made a deal with the devil that made him the Ghost Rider. A deal with Galactus made him cosmic. And a deal with Thanos made him...dead?! Not to worry, Castle doesn't die easy. He's coming back - and he's got a plan to make the universe a better place! It all starts with an idea so simple he cannot believe no one has ever done it before. But as with all things worth doing, it's not going to be easy. And things soon get truly weird - as Castle takes on space sharks, faces down the future Guardians of the Galaxy - and runs into Galactus during a bar fight! It's Frank...er, the Punish...um, Cosmic Ghost Rider in the craziest caper he's ever had to deal with!COLLECTING: COSMIC GHOST RIDER 1-5
