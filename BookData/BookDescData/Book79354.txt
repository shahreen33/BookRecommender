Poetry. African American Studies. These harrowing poems make montage, make mirrors, make elegiac biopic, make "a dope ass trailer with a hundred black children/ smiling into the camera &amp; the last shot is the wide mouth of a pistol." That's no spoiler alert, but rather, Smith's way saying &amp; laying it beautifully bare. A way of desensitizing the reader from his own defenses each time this long, black movie repeats."
