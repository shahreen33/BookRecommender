Over 250 years have passed since the events of the Dark Winter brought down the structures of society and government in a nightmare of chaos and anarchy. Trinidad Shepherd considers himself a fairly average "caver", having lived his entire life in Cave System Echo, one of several vast underground cities scattered throughout the desert. When a freak archery accident injures the leader of his patrol, Trin is tasked with leading the four person group on their nightly route. But his leader?s injury does more than earn Trin an unwanted promotion; it delays his patrol, making them late to the coordinated ambush designed to wipe them out. After a series of massive explosions rock the desert night, Trin and his crew rush back to Echo Cave, finding their home in ruins, their family and friends murdered. Realizing they are the last remnant of Echo, the four friends must embark on a perilous journey to learn the identity and motives of the mysterious attackers - a journey that will take them far away from all they have ever known. Along the way they will learn the terrible secret behind the true purpose of the cave systems. Outmatched in every way, and aided by a secret order dating back to the last days of Past World, the Echo crew must summon all of their strength and courage as they confront a power-hungry tyrant intent on using the secret of the caves to enslave not only the inhabitants of the cave systems, but the entire world.Echo's Remnant, the first book in the four part Echo Chronicles series, follows the Echo crew - Trin, the leader; Cipher, the tech; Creed, the fighter; and Dalton, the novice - as they leave the wreckage of their homes behind, learn to rely on one another for survival, and search for a way to fight back against the far superior force that has wrecked their lives and destroyed everything they loved.
