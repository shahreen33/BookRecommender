Once in custody, Carly agrees to a meeting with a female reporter, Vanessa St John. Carly insists she tells the whole story in her words. She talks about the dog and the box, but where are the dog and box now? Vanessa St John appears to have her own agenda as the tension builds in both of the women seated opposite each other.
