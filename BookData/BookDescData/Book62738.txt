She was just a kid when she found me lying injured beside the road and saved my life. I promised her I’d return if she ever needed me. Twelve years later, I answer the phone and hear her voice: a biker gang’s about to sell her to the highest bidder. I tear the place apart and we roar off on my Harley...but the kid I remember has grown up into a woman I can’t resist, with long red hair and curves that don’t quit. And now she thinks I’m a goddamn hero.Every time we ride and her body presses against mine, I just want to rip her dress right off. Neither of us can resist...but for her sake, I can’t let her get close. She claims there’s still good in me but she doesn’t know how much blood I’ve got on my hands. Now the gang who took her want her back and they’re willing to destroy my whole MC to get her. But it’s too late. I’ve fallen for her. And I’m never letting her go.Standalone bad boy romantic suspense with HEA, no cheating.
