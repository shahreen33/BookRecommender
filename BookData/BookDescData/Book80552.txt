Theresa Cheung in an expert in the field of angels and divine healing. This, her latest collection of amazing true stories, focuses on the physical and emotional help people have experienced from unexplained or ethereal sources at times when they have been at their most vulnerable. With chapters such as 'Manifest a Miracle' and 'An Angel at My Bedside', the book tells of remarkable incidents where angels have appeared in hospital wards, at difficult births, during near-death experiences, and when someone actually dies, easing their journey from the corporeal to the spirit world. The common thread running through all these miraculous stories of healing from the inside out is that every angelic encounter provided the recipient with a strength, courage and a power they never knew they had.
