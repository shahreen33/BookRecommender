Superstar writer Cullen Bunn (Harrow County, Uncanny X-Men) and artist Sergio Davila (Red Sonja, Swords of Sorrow) kick off a brand new story adaptation in their highly praised Conan run:  The Devil in Iron! Conan and his people parley with the fierce lord Jehungir Agha, who brings along a beautiful woman, Octavia. As part of a plot to end the barbarian's life, she lures him out to the once-deserted island of Xapur. There, Jehungir's murderous plans fall apart--the city has been resurrected, and with it, a creature of nightmares! Will Conan escape with his life?
