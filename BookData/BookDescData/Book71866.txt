Malala was born in 1997 in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. Her short lifetime has encompassed devastating changes in her country as it has been transformed from a once peaceful land to a hotbed of Islamic extremism. The Taliban have said Malala, who now lives in Birmingham, England, will be killed if she returns home. But she says she has been given a second life that she intends to use for the good of the people and her dream that all girls everywhere deserve an education.
