The Heller brothers are all heading home for the holidays in their short break in the hockey season. It should be a great family reunion since three of the four brothers are bringing their new girlfriends. But Jase and Remi just got the results of an important DNA test, and neither of them is in a mood to celebrate. Tag and Kyla also just got some surprising news that has them at odds, and Nicoleâ€™s nervous about meeting the whole family when she and Logan have been together such a short time. Instead of peace and joy, this holiday is full of angst, worry and tension...is love really enough to overcome all obstacles?
