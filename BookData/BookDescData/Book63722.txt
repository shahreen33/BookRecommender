For the first time ever in the world of fly fishing, a classic work has been updated into a fully illustrated, modern format. This new volume of The Dry Fly and Fast Water The Dry Fly and Fast Water established George La Branche conservationist, angler, naturalist as a man ahead of his time. In this landmark work his instructions on reading the water and presentation (explaining such techniques as the bounce cast, line control, and 'creating a hatch'), and his descriptions of rise forms and how to read them are all as fresh today as they were more than eighty years ago. In fact, his discussion of fishing a dry fly on fast water heresy when he wrote it has not been improved upon in the modern literature. Any angler who reads this book whether rank novice or seasoned expert and applies La Branche's wisdom will catch more fish on the dry fly.
