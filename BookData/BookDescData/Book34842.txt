“Dogzilla rises from a volcano to break up the First Annual Mousopolis Barbecue Cook-Off, and scatter the Big Cheese’s troops with her fearsome doggy breath--but the threat of a bath sends her scurrying back to her mountain. Illustrations are painted in bright acrylics around cleverly trimmed and placed photographs of Pilkey’s pet mice, cat, and corgi, for a wonderfully silly look, appropriately accompanied by a pun-laden text.”--School Library Journal
