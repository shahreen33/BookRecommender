An Amish girl, a baby who lost his mother and a billionaire in the West. Will they be a family?  Elisabeth Schwartz is a devoted daughter and sister to her Amish family. She is a strong girl with a deep sense of responsibility. So when her only sister, Deborah, is banned from the community for becoming involved with and marrying a man from town, she is torn between her duty to her family and her faith and her love for her sister.  She cannot keep herself from visiting her sister whenever she goes into town, not letting her family know that she is seeing Deborah. On one visit, Deborah announces she is pregnant. Now Elisabeth feels a stronger sense of duty to help her sister, whose husband, Stephen, is a traveling salesman and frequently leaves town.  Stephen is out of town on business when Deborah goes into labor. Elisabeth is there for her sister but Deborah has complications and makes the ultimate sacrifice for her child, leaving Elisabeth to decide what to do next.  In a split second decision, Elisabeth travels to the West to find Stephen and finds herself entrenched in a new adventure, as a mail-order-bride for a wealthy, charming ex-gold miner.  Will she ever find Stephen? And if she does, will she want to give baby Andrew to him after bonding with the child and falling in love with her future husband? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain for Elisabeth. It’s all about Andrew.  NOTE: This book includes 5 bonus stories.
