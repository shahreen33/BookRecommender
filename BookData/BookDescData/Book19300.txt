Itas not unusual for me to be sitting at the computer crying as I put all my emotions and thoughts into every single one of my poems. As a former firefighter and correctional officer, my experiences helping the sheriffas department and now a security officer, I felt as if everything was caving in and building up at one time or another. I returned to poetry after years of barely writing as my way of letting go of all my problems, pain and worries. Poetry, once starting as a hobby, became my escape from my career choices keeping work experiences away from my family. Poetry also became my emotional outlet dealing with everyday life as an Army wife and now as a single mother. I hope you enjoy this collection of poems that I have gathered here as you walk with me through my experiences, thoughts, pain and joys.
