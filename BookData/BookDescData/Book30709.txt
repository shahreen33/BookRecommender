A lifetime of learning; a journey of teaching Al Mazza grew up in 1940s Brooklyn, exploring a world confined to the beaches of Coney Island and the streets of his neighborhood. From the observation deck of Idlewild Airport he watched the drama of planes coming from and going to unknown destinations. He would often dream of being on one of those planes.His ticket arrived for foreign travel in 1979 when he was selected to escort students to Israel. Together, they traveled to the cradle of three great religions and explored the complexities of the Middle East. Mr. Mazza ultimately crisscrossed the globe with the best and brightest of New York City public school youth. His travels with them opened new worlds to his students. Partnerships with national and community organizations and local government resulted in the growth of student exchanges through the 1980s under his Young Diplomats Program. New York's Sister-City relationships with Tokyo, Beijing, Madrid and Cairo added to the diversity of the exchange offerings. In addition to travels to the Far East, the interests of high-profile funding sources led to excursions to Eastern and Western Europe, Africa and the Soviet Union as memories were built that shaped the thoughts of the future for his "Young Diplomats."More than a memoir, "A Teacher Grows In Brooklyn," is a tool kit for teachers who want to focus on global education activities for their students. Amid the pages of colorful tales, the author includes fundraising strategies, tips on the handling of student emergencies, and ways of dealing with cultural activities and foods strange to New York City youth. Readers are invited to use this book to plan their own journeys and take new adventures into the lives of their own students.
