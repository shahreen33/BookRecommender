Psychic Tennyson Grimm was kicked out of his house and disowned by his religious parents when he came out to them as gay and psychic. The last thing Tennyson’s father said before the teenager boarded a Greyhound bus to Boston was that his son was dead to him. Flash forward thirteen years later, Tennyson couldn’t have been more surprised when he woke to find the newly dead spirit of his father sitting on the end of his bed. David Grimm had one request of his estranged son. Go to Kansas and reunite with his mother.Cold Case Detective Ronan O’Mara was all for this family reunion. Still recovering from injuries suffered during his last criminal investigation, he figures they’ll fly to Kansas, bury Tennyson’s father, and the hatchet with Kaye Grimm, then come back to Boston in time to plan their upcoming wedding.When the Union Chapel Sheriff comes to Tennyson and Ronan with a years-old cold case he’d like them to look into, the Boston-based duo can’t turn down taking a peek at the case file. Tennyson is easily able to figure out whodunit, but the sheriff is leery to believe in his gift, bringing old prejudices back to life, and leaving Ronan to hunt for physical evidence the killer left behind.Will Ronan be able to solve the cold case and help Tennyson resolve the decade-old feud with his mother? Or will the tornado, with its sights set on the tiny town of Union Chapel, Kansas, make the other questions moot?
