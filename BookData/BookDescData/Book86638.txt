Chef Chloe, the first vegan winner of Cupcake Wars, brings her signature creativity and fun to the best part of every meal: Dessert! CHEF CHLOE’S first all-dessert cookbook, Chloe’s Vegan Desserts, will satisfy your sweet tooth from morning to night with more than 100 recipes for cakes and cupcakes, ice cream and doughnuts and pies—oh my! And you just will not believe these delicious dishes are vegan. You can start the day with New York–Style Crumb Cake, light and zesty Lemon Poppy Seed Muffins, luscious Chocolate Babka, or decadent Tiramisu Pancakes (topped with a dollop of cool Coconut Whipped Cream). Here, too, are more than a dozen inventive, innovative, irresistible cupcake recipes, including Chloe’s Cupcake Wars’ Award-Winning Chocolate Orange Cupcakes with Candied Orange Peel, saffron- and cardamom-spiced Bollywood Cupcakes, and rich and boozy Chocolate Beer Cupcakes with Irish Whiskey Buttercream. Chloe’s got you covered for the holidays with her Easy Apple Pie and Absolutely Perfect Pumpkin Pie, Holiday Trifle, Nuts for Hot Cocoa, and Pumpkin Spice Latte. She re-creates classic desserts and treats from Chocolate Chip Cookies to Classic Crème Brûlée, and veganizes store-bought favorites with her Oreo-style Chloe O’s, Pumpkin Whoopie Pies, Animal Cookies, and Black-and-White Cookies—which are better (and healthier) than what you’ll find at the grocery store. Chloe also serves up brand-new triumphs like her dreamy Lemon Olive-Oil Cake, Rosemary Ice Cream with Blueberry Sauce, Coconut Cream Pie, Chocolate Cream Pie, Coconut Sorbet with Cashew Brittle, and good-to-the-last-drop milkshakes. Who can possibly resist? Go ahead and lick that spoon—there are no worries when you bake vegan! With gorgeous color photography, clever tips, and a comprehensive section on vegan baking basics to get you started, Chloe’s Vegan Desserts will be your new vegan dessert bible.
