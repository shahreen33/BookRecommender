 
  Ruthless commander. Cunning thief. Deadly blademaster.
   Narra is a second generation thief raised in the Guild by her iron-fisted father. Growing up, she dreamed his death would free her, but when he shows up dead in the wreckage of a train destroyed by the Revolution, the happiest day of her life is ruined by one word: traitor.  Her father is accused of betraying the only thing she thought he ever really loved; the Thieves Guild. To prove his innocence, and remove the stain from her name, Narra will go to darker places than she ever thought possible and be forced to work with people she doesn’t dare trust.  If she fails, she’ll lose more than her sanity or her life.  She’ll lose the Guild.  Set in a steampunk world on the cusp of civil war, Queen of Thieves introduces a dark tale where family lies, magic might be real, and thieves fall for revolutionary princesses.
