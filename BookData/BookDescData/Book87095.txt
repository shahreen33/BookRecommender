Many and strange are the tales that are told of the deeds and adventures of Noggin the Nog. These are the stuff of sagas, already celebrated in story and song. Of the Nogs themselves, of how these people spent their days, little has been set down. To this aspect of Nogiology this book is a small contribution, an in-depth study of their simple, happy, ridiculous way of life.
