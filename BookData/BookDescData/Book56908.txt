Kakapo is crazy about karate. No student at her dojo tries harder or practices more. She loves the blocks, the strikes, the stances. And she especially loves the super-fast kicks: the running kicks, the jumping kicks, the side kicks ... but no amount of practice can help her conquer the elusive flying kick. You see, kakapos can't fly. Despite this, Kakapo works hard on everything else to perfect her skills. She has earned every belt from yellow to green to blue to red. And now it's time for the most difficult karate challenge of all: the black belt test. Kakapo is ready. After all, she has practiced as much as any bird could and mastered all the moves. Except that one, of course. But surely the senseis won't ask her to do a flying kick. Will they?Loredana Cunti's adorable Kakapo discovers (with a little help from a kind teacher!) that sometimes seeing a problem from a different perspective can help you solve it. It's a wonderful model for children facing obstacles in their own lives, and a great example of a growth mindset. It aligns with social studies lessons on self-awareness and personal development. Award-winning cartoonist Stacy Curtis's illustrations of a kakapo doing karate are hilarious and full of energy, and just might inspire some new students of karate (or other martial arts). The art was reviewed by a karate expert to ensure the moves are accurately portrayed. This playful and funny picture book is perfect for storytime. It also makes a great choice for character education lessons on self-discipline and perseverance.
