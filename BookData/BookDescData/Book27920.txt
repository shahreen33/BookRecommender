She wanted a one-night stand...and then he moved in next door.Paige It was only supposed to be a single night. Nothing more than an easy, completely hot, mind blowing evening with my best friend's surrogate brother. Except my once-safe one-night stand no longer lives a thousand miles away. Adam's back in town...and living directly across the hall. Relegating our crazy chemistry to a single night was a lot easier when he wasn't my neighbor. When he didn't strut around the apartment building every day, taunting me with his should-be-illegal body. And being with him again isn't a possibility. Because Adam wants forever, and all I'm interested in is right now.Adam Having Paige once wasn't enough. Hell, having her five times that night wasn't enough, either. It only made me hungrier for her. She doesn't want more than a quick lay, but I'm in it for the long haul with her. So I'll play by her rules and be her friend, while giving her what she needs when she needs it. But I'm not above using every tool in my arsenal to make her come around and show her what she really wants is right in front of her.Full length contemporary romance that may be read as a stand alone featuring a one-night stand turned to more between a strong-willed, smart-lipped heroine and the hot as sin, alpha hero she can't get enough of.
