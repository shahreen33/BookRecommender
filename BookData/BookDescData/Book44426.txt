"This is not a school musical, this is millions of people seeing you, recognizing you, criticizing you. This is "it." Public person -- the good, the bad, and the ugly. Are you ready?"When fifteen-year-old Wonder Blake is plucked from her job at the Dairy Queen and given the chance to become a teen idol, it seems like a dream come true -- even if it wasn't her dream, but her older sister Lucky's. Lucky was on her way to becoming a pop star when she died, and Wonder and her family are still trying to recover from their loss. Offered a recording contract, Wonder jumps at the chance to escape from a dead-end town, her fractured family, and worst of all, high school. Suddenly she has it all: a hot new look, a chart-busting hit single, a tour opening for superstar Kayla. But stardom isn't all glamour -- it's also lots of work. And maybe what Wonder really wants is as simple as a guy who likes her for herself.With spark and humor Rachel Cohn captures the struggles and glories of an ordinary teenage girl's climb to celebrity. As Wonder rises through the pop-princess star-making machine, she also learns the price -- and that maybe being an ordinary teenage girl isn't so bad after all.
