Bailey Rossum was living out a bad country song.  After being stood up and having her pickup truck break down, Bailey found herself walking barefoot in a ball gown down a back road. And when her sexier-than-sin ex rides up on his steel horse Bon Jovi style to rescue her, she knows she has to accept his help even if it means breaking her heart all over again.  Josh Scott had no interest in being anyone’s hero.  After finding the only woman he’d ever loved stranded on the side of the road, Josh knew that he had to do the right thing. And when his headlight shone on long silky, blonde hair, huge doe eyes, and the most perfect set of lips ever created he knew his already shattered heart was in serious trouble.  To live in the present, Josh and Bailey have to face their past. If they do they just might have a future… and it all starts with just one night.
