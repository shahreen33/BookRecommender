Steven and Laura Thompson have the ideal marriage, and the birth of Annie only strengthens their bond. Life is perfect, as if they have forever, until everything changes in an instant with one man's careless decision - to drive while intoxicated - and the resulting accident leaves Laura a widow. Now a single mother, Laura struggles to move on with her life but two years later, an unimaginable tragedy strikes again. While shoveling her elderly neighbor's snowy walk, a careening car slides into her on an icy patch on the street, and leaves Laura with no memory of either Steven or Annie! Laura grapples to make sense of the missing pieces of her past, living in the present with a daughter she can't remember, a friend she doesn't know but must learn to trust, and a future filled with uncertainties. A beautiful memory box, handcrafted by her elderly neighbor and given to her at Christmas, is filled with precious mementos in the hopes she will one day remember. As Laura instinctively fights for survival, her eventual surrender to a God of love brings hope, healing and a new wholeness to her shattered life. "And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love." 1 Corinthians 13:13 - NIV
