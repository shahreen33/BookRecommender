The "Suffering &amp; Sovereignty" First 5 Experience Guide serves as your companion book to each First 5 study. Use it as your physical (or digital) study companion as you dig deeper into God's Word with us every day on the First 5 app."Suffering &amp; Sovereignty" is a 12-week study.Why does God allow bad things to happen? Maybe your marriage is falling apart even though you did "all the right things.” Maybe your parent is sick and not getting better or your child is being bullied. Every time you turn around it seems like tragedy is staring you right in the face, waiting to invade your life or the lives of the ones you love. As we study Job, Ecclesiastes and Lamentations, you may not find an answer to what you’re going through. But you will find hope — hope in a sovereign God who has a purpose and is in control of everything … even when it hurts.
