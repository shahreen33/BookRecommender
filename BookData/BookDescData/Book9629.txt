In the City of Gornstock, on the planet Twearth, Private Investigator Jocelyn Cornwallis and his employee, Frankie, were enjoying a quiet pint down their local when life suddenly became interesting; they met Rose.....and then they got a case. There’s been a murder at an accountant’s office, and Cornwallis has to find the perpetrator but at the same time the secret police have got an eye on proceedings so maybe things aren’t quite as they seem. Then there’s the Universal Collider, a device for seeing things that happen in other universes, and a cat with attitude named Fluffy; put into that mix Sergeant MacGillicudy, a policeman who tags along and whose nemesis is Sergeant Grinde, a government that evolved through Morris Dancers, and Gerald who ‘ain’t really there’, then what you get when you stir it all up is the Banker’s Draft.
