Timothy S. Lane and Paul David Tripp skillfully help individuals and small groups identify the deeper issues that keep relationships less than they are designed to be. They give practical direction on how to resolve conflicts, have difficult conversations, grant forgiveness, overlook weaknesses, celebrate strengths, and grow casual relationships into deep friendships. Based on principles from the book, Relationships: A Mess Worth Making, this new addition to CCEFs curriculum series focuses on the basic character qualities that can only be formed by knowing and applying the gospel of grace.
