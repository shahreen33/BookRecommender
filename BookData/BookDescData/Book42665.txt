Mice whirling in the moonlight, having a party on Halloween night, are threatened by an approaching cat until they come up with an ingenious trick to scare him off. "Simple sentences and lots of onomatopoeia make the text as appealing as the energetic watercolors-and-pen artwork. A fun read for Halloween story hours." -- Booklist
