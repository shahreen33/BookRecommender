 This is book 2 of a 6 book murder mystery series. The books cannot standalone, so please be warned that you'd need to read all 6 to get the full story. Each book will release the last Thurs of the month! The town in the story is fictional, so the coordinates on the cover do NOT correlate to the murder locations. Hope you love the story.
