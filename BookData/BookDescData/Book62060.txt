Penelope Spheeris' The Decline of Western Civilization was perceived as shocking and outrageous at the time of its original release in 1981. Parts II and III were no less extraordinary and unprecedented. Today, museums and educational institutions around the world present them as historically significant works of art. Featuring some of the most influential and innovative musicians and groups of all time—Germs, Black Flag, X, Fear, Circle Jerks, Alice Cooper, Lemme, Poison and members of Aerosmith and KISS—these riveting, unflinching, hard-core films adeptly captured the spirit of a major cultural phenomenon.Now for the first time, all three films are available in one deluxe box set. They have been restored in high definition, preserving the spirit of the rebellious times in which they were filmed. This is an immersive tour of some of the most revolutionary filmmaking and music of our time.
