Top Tip: Don’t put out an online ad offering your services as a fake date. Someone will take you up on it.And it won’t just be for one night.And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how I ended up being Mason Jackson’s fake girlfriend.He didn’t even want me to be. No—his sister was solely responsible for me being his date for his ten-year high school reunion.Now, she’s responsible for telling his parents our relationship is real.We have no choice. We have to act like this isn’t all a mistake, like it’s not all fake, like we’re totally, completely, utterly, head-over-heels in love with each other.Simple, right?Wrong.
