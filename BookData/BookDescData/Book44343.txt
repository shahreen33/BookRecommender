Taking big risks has always been Archer Brook’s way of life. It’s what has to be done in order to get what you want, and he knows that better than anyone. Archer may have been born into a life of wealth and privilege, but he’s proven time and time again that his success is a result of his own true grit and determination. The savvy businessman is an experienced player in the game of life, always knowing when to ante up or when to cash out.Love, on the other hand, is a game he’d rather not play. He’s loved and lost before and it’s not something he wants to ever experience again. Life has never been easy for Katy Vaughn. The preacher’s daughter turned small town rebel has seen her fair share of heartbreak, and she’s tired. Katy is done with men who have no idea what they want or how to treat a woman. She wants a real man. One who can give her everything she’s ever dreamed of. One who will give her everything she needs. Archer wants to be that man for her but there’s one condition. He refuses to give her his heart. Temptation is sweet, but surrendering to it could cost him more than he ever bargained for.
