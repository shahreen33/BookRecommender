GrantI’m in control at all times.Commanding the family business, I need to be strong. Make decisions that keep my family wealthy. I need to protect them. That’s my role as the oldest. People listen, and follow when I speak; my personality demands it.Until I meet her …Her life is about to change directions. I want her here with me, I need her… but instead I’ll push her away. Because her happiness means more than what I feel.Walking away takes every piece of control I have.ZaraDancing is my life, my every breath.Living my life-long dream is so close I can taste it. A new beginning, time for change. They told me to give up – not a chance.I’m determined and strong-willed. Nobody stands in my way or tells me what to do. Until I meet him…His look steals my breath. He controls me with every touch. Being with him will change my direction, but being without him makes life simply unbearable.Choosing means I lose one forever, and I’m not sure I’ll survive that.
