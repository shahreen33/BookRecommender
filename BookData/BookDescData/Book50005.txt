Murder. Betrayals. Romance. Pianist Alexei Georg harbors a dark secret and a lie. He finds an old sonata in a 19th-century Russian sea chest. The night Alexei performs this handsome music in concert, a creature of darkness appears in the audience, in the aisle, and on the stage with him. This is no ghost. This menacing presence haunts Alexei relentlessly. From Boston's music society to the White Sea in Russia to Mt. Greylock. When Alexei’s wife Carole Anne, a prima ballerina, is murdered, Alexei flees Boston and the suspicion of the crime. His affair with the steamy and delicious Lia Marrs adds to the motive. Secluded on Mt. Greylock, Alexei is driven to compose a whale symphony to save his music career. But Alexei cannot flee the unstoppable sonata that he has delivered into this world. Alone on Mt. Greylock, he must find a way to halt the dark force within his music or become prisoner to its phantasmagoric power in an ever-expanding abyss. If you don’t believe that music has transformative powers within the supernatural realm, just ask violinists Paganini or Tartini about their deals with the devil for their virtuosity.Murder, lies, betrayal, romance--and the flickering phantasmagoria."If you're looking for an imaginative, sophisticated read, you've found it.
