A divine comedy!Reads R to L (Japanese Style), for audiences T. Nanami Momozono is alone and homeless after her dad skips town to evade his gambling debts and the debt collectors kick her out of her apartment.

But it turns out that his place is a shrine, and Nanami has unwittingly taken over his job as a local deity! Mizuki loves living at the shrine with Nanami, but he hates that he has to stay behind when she goes to school. He hates even more that Tomoe gets to go with her. But Mizuki isn’t used to the human world, so Nanami thinks it’s safer if he just stays put. Can Mizuki become a master of the mundane, or will his secret foray into town end in disaster?!
