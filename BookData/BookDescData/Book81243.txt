Once again, sinister things are afoot in Apalachicola, FL, and one of them is an actual foot.When a local fisherman finds a man’s foot in his net, it sets off a chain of events that no one can anticipate. Lt. Maggie Redmond soon discovers that the foot belongs to the friend of another recently dead guy, Gregory Boudreaux, the man she never told anyone about. Gregory’s death was thought to be a suicide. That seems less likely, now that his best friend Sport’s foot has shown up out of the blue, as it were. When it starts looking like town villain Bennett Boudreaux might be responsible for eliminating Sport, things begin to get a little weird. Especially since Maggie’s started to take a liking to Bennett. She’s also taken a real liking to her boss, Sheriff Wyatt Hamilton, but both her relationship to Bennett and her secret connection to the dead men threaten hers and Wyatt’s relationship. Is Bennett protecting or avenging Maggie for some reason, or does he have something altogether different on his mind? About the Forgotten Coast Florida Series:The first four books of the series, Low Tide, Riptide, What Washes Up, and Landfall, lay the foundation for the entire series. There are subplots resolved in each book, but there is also an overarching plot that is not resolved until Landfall, so they should be read in sequence.Subsequent books in the series will be both longer and stand alone novels that can be read in any sequence.
