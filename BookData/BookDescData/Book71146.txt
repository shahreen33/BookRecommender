this is the story i want in your hands,these are the words i want you to keep,the words i want to be yours as much as they are mine.this is my heart, my soul.this is what i want you to know:that you are seen and loved,known.that you don’t have to carry what doesn’t belong to you:the pain, the shame, the tears.that the sun will rise tomorrow,and hope along with it.
