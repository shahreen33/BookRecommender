Yet this has been her fate since she was six, when her warlock mother brought her to Eudae. Now an adult, she's about to discover her true power—and how far others are willing to go to take it away.As part of a Coven mission, Adam Tyrell rescues Claire from her enslavement—and finds himself immediately taken with the beautiful witch. But this charming playboy soon learns that it's easier to steal Claire from demons than win her heart, for her life as a servant has ravaged her spirit. But Adam's determination to protect her from the warlocks who want to harness her magick for evil begins to weaken Claire's resistance—and in the heat of danger they find themselves surrendering to the lure of their deepest desires.
