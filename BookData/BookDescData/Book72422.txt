Alessio…  Cold. Ruthless. Killer. I am respected and feared by all.  I wasn’t put on this earth to love or be loved. I was put here to wipe out every last member of the damn Abandonato mafia, to pay them back for my mother’s death.  When I find a strange girl hiding, beaten, under my bed, I don’t let her live out of compassion. She’s a trinket, my plaything.  Ayla…  I thought Alessio was only one more man who wanted to use me, hurt me, and throw me away. I don’t know what it is to trust anymore. I can’t find my heart under the pain.  Alessio found it. He touched it, and brought it alive again.  But if he discovers just how dangerous I am to him…I’ll lose my life.
