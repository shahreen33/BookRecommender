  This land-locked country in southern Africa is a choice destination for wildlife photography and for travel in a less ‘pressured’ manner than are the norm in other parts of the continent. Through higher costs and important logistical restraints, the authorities have made clear that they wish to limit the flow of foreign visitors in order that their environmental heritage is looked after in the best possible way. The book outlines the best place to visit to experience the notable wildlife and beautiful landscapes, together with practical tourist information and photographic advice.
