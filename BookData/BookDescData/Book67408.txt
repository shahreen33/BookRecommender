The stunning conclusion of Her Immortal Harem, Book One!  I was called on by the gods to complete six tasks, a job with only two potential outcomes: Save the world, or…not. The entire human race rests on my shoulders, and I’ve got to admit, I’m not exactly stoked about it. So far, I’ve been handling it pretty well. Using my street smarts and my skills as a con artist to complete the tasks…barely. But things are getting trickier by the day and there is one god in particular who is dead set on me failing. Not to mention, I’ve got this cadre of dead-sexy demigods who are supposed to help me, but are distracting as hell. The clock is ticking, and time is running out. I hope I have what it takes to get the job done, because the alternative? Sucks, big time.
