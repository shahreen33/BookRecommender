The Genesee Valley is in chaos. Strangers drive panel vans through the countryside at weird hours of the night. A new batch of drugs is on the street, endangering students. The local salt mine collapses due to illegal mining practices. Gas fires burn in water wells. Watering holes turn to brine. Crops are dying. Tempers are short. Forest fires threaten. To top it off, the new mine lies directly over ancient Indian burial grounds, bringing anguish to local tribes and inciting riots at the mine site.  As if that weren’t enough, Gus LeGarde’s country church is hit by a rogue tornado, revealing the bones of a missing parishioner and devastating the dead man’s wife. Days later, heroin is found in Gus’s elderly minister’s bloodstream after his car crashes into a tree in the dead of night.  When Gus is thrown into the middle of the madness, he knows life has finally gone berserk in East Goodland, New York.  Join Gus as he’s lured into a bizarre network of underground tunnels to expose the most shocking discovery ever to rock the Genesee Valley.
