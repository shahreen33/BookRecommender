Sexy firefighter, Colton Drake, has everything going for him. From a prize-winning smile to a washboard set of abs, all mixed together with a playful sense of humor. He wasn’t the type to have one-night stands, but he knew he wouldn’t have trouble finding them. So why was he having such a terrible time finding someone to spend his life with?  Well, until he meets the man that changes everything.  Mason Bleu, a fire investigator, is moving back to Los Angeles after getting a job offer he couldn’t refuse. Even though the city held some terribly painful memories, Mason thinks everything will be fine. It felt like a second shot.  Then, his entire world is rocked the moment his eyes land on Colton’s. Their connection is immediate and that terrifies Mason. To top things off, he’s thrown into a case involving a serial arsonist terrorizing the community.  Colton and Mason are on a path that could end either in paradise or in a nightmare. Things only heat up further when the arsonist sets his sights on one of them.  Can they make it through the fire or will they be turned to ashes? ___________________________ FIRE FLOW is a hot and steamy, gay romance novel with no cliffhangers.
