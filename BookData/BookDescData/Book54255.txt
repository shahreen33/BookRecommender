As the baby of his family, Reid Holmes has happily played the role of the Charming, Irresponsible One. But as his 30th birthday approaches, Reid wonders whether he should be doing more with his life than working as a plumber for Holmes Construction. Now he has the chance to shed his carefree playboy image and go into business for himself, but is leaving his cousin’s construction company a sign of growing up, or the ultimate show of disloyalty? And with the arrival of Holmes Construction’s gorgeous new site coordinator, Reid isn’t sure now is the best time to jump ship.  When her father is forced to close the family’s longtime handyman business, Brooklyn LeBlanc sees her chance to break free of the job she’s been stuck in since age 15 and finally pursue her dream of writing comics. But responsibilities—and her secret role in the demise of her family’s business—forces Brooklyn to again put the career she truly desires on the back burner. At least her new job at Holmes Construction comes with a hot plumber she can spend the day fantasizing about. But what happens when her harmless workplace crush awakens feelings that aren’t so innocent?
