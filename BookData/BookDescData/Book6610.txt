"Spunky English girl overcomes impossible odds and outsmarts heathen villains."That’s the headline when Zoe Lexham returns to England. After twelve years in the exotic east, she’s shockingly adept in the sensual arts. She knows everything a young lady shouldn't and nothing she ought to know. She’s a walking scandal, with no hope of a future...unless someone can civilize her.Lucien de Grey, the Duke of Marchmont, is no knight in shining armor. He's sarcastic, cynical, easily bored, and dangerous to women. He charms, seduces, and leaves them—with parting gifts of expensive jewelry to dry their tears. But good looks and charm, combined with money and rank, make him welcome everywhere. The most popular bachelor in the Beau Monde can easily save Zoe’s risque reputation...if the wayward beauty doesn't lead him into temptation, and a passion that could ruin them both.
