My name is Gawain Vincent—one of twelve assassins of the Cavalieri Della Morte.Steadfast to those I claim as my brothers in arms.An experienced fighter when ordered into battle.I’m an admirer of women in any amount or position.A lover full of stamina and exceptional skills.But that is about to change.Because of her. Because of Megan.She’s scared, battered, and damaged. Rescued from circumstances beyond horrifying.The blonde girl with piercing blue eyes who I can’t refuse.Her future survival seems destined to destroy my family.
