I fell in love with two men. I thought being with them both—at the same time—would be complicated.But it was easy. It was perfect.One of them was twice my age.The other was the boy I grew up with.Both of them were so very different, but they gave me exactly what I wanted, exactly what I needed.Ryker was a bad boy with looks that had my panties dropping from day one. He knew exactly where to touch me to make me cry out for more.He was also my best friend.Jareth was older, refined and experienced. He knew how to make me beg for more with just a dominant look.He was also my boss.Although they were possessive and jealous where I was concerned, they accepted I was in a relationship with both of them.Ryker and Jareth only demanded one thing from me ... to only be with them.But had the time come for me to choose one?How wrong would it be to keep them both?*blurb unedited/not finalized.
