In a lonely corner of Canada, the quiet town of Killhorn Falls seems like the perfect place for Old Man Logan to retreat to and make peace with his new life in the present-day Marvel Universe. But there's never any escape for the man who was once Wolverine. When Lady Deathstrike and her Reavers come for him, can Logan protect the people of Killhorn Falls — and the only thing in the present that he hopes will survive to meet him in the future? This is the X-Man at his most fundamental: his back to the wall — and survival riding only on his wits, his determination and his Adamantium claws! It's the ultimate cage match, and everything Old Man Logan cares about is on the line!Collecting: Old Man Logan 5-8, Uncanny X-Men 205
