In THE VOICE OF KNOWLEDGE, Miguel Ruiz reminds us of a profound and simple truth: The only way to end our emotional suffering and restore our joy I living is to stop believing in lies - mainly about ourselves. Based on ancient Toltec wisdom, this breakthrough book shows us how to recover our faith in the truth and return to our own common sense.Ruiz changes the way we perceive ourselves, and the way we perceive other people. Then he opens the door to a reality that we once perceived when we were one and two years old - a reality of truth, love, and joy.
