Consider: on the night before a dangerous mission, a Royal Air Force pilot believes he sees the face of a fellow crewman turn into a skull. The next day the same crewman is killed. Coincidence? You be the judge. But remember, each of the tales in this book are absolutely true. Fully illustrated with black and white art. Original.
