Since West Chester Story Slam launched in 2010, over five hundred stories have been told live on stage in front of rowdy audiences at local bars. Stories are told with no notes and no props, just a storyteller standing at a mic, revealing themselves through their personal tales.Selected stories include: Eli Silberman's tale of a television commercial shoot gone horribly wrong. Luke Stromberg documents his life in crime and Luanne Sims tells about her worst day as an adult diaper salesperson. Read about Terry Heyman's short-lived fling with an Oscar-winning actor, Kyle Hudson's brush with legendary movie icon Bill Murray, and Carole Mallory's late night search for the grave of Pablo Picasso. Learn about Queen Elizabeth's corgis, raising pigs, and high level miscommunication at the world's largest home shopping network.These forty stories are sometimes funny, other times poignant. Whether you've attended the West Chester Story Slam live, listened to the podcast, or are coming across the stories for the first time, we hope you'll enjoy this anthology of remarkable personal tales.
