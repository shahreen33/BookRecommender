From USA Today Bestselling Author M. RobinsonI once read that every warrior hoped an honorable death would find him. I always went looking for mine, but not even the Reaper wanted me.I was trained to kill. I was trained to not ask why. To take orders and just march in line. Hooah motherfucker. Life or death.Ride or die.And I’m not only talking about the military. I’m talking about the life that led me on the road to nowhere.My life.I fought for my brothers. I fought for my family. I fought for my country. And I fought for her…Never realizing I might die for them too.
