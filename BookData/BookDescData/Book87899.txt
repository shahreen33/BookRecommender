Hailey moves to a new city, leaving her past behind and starting a new life. All she wants is to forget about her cheating ex and be happy. The last thing she expects is to fall for a local bad boy with an even worse reputation, no matter how handsome he is and how he can't stop undressing her with his eyes...TROUBLEMAKER is the prequel to my novel CAVEMAN, but it is also a standalone short story. Previously published with the title EXPOSED (in the We Wish you a Naughty Christmas anthology).
