For the first time in his life, Wes Ahern has encountered something—someone—he can’t fix. Not with his hands, his words, not even with his love.  His head tells him Abby had to get out of Colorado to heal from the nightmare that nearly took her from him. To mend her wounded body, piece her broken spirit back together, and find out who she is behind the mask she felt forced to wear.  His first instinct was always to protect her. Still is. But as he faces his own pain, an agonizing realization dawns: that while he needs her more than his next breath, the best place for her may not be with him. Because while he always had her back, the secrets they kept—even from each other—have the power to destroy them.  When their paths cross again, will their souls still recognize each other?  Note: Back to You is the conclusion of the Chaotic Love Duet. Often dark and sometimes jarring, this book also contains references to childhood trauma, kidnapping, and PTSD.
