A creative genius, Walt Disney's films and characters brought love and laughter to children everywhere and inspired the great Disney theme parks. Now Marc Eliot presents the dark side of Walt Disney, revealing his 25 year association with J. Edgar Hoover's FBI as an informant, rooting out Communists, subversives and Jews. His phobic behaviour is also examined in detail, as is his obsessive hand-washing, heavy drinking, sexual inadequacies, anti-Semitism and paranoia about having been adopted. Marc Eliot shows how these psycho-sexual conflicts drove Walt to despair and how they found expression in his animated characters.
