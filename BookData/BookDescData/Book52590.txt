  Magnolia had it all, the boyfriend, the happy life, security in her surroundings. But when a split-second decision alters everything she's ever known she finds herself on the run determined to avenge her boyfriend by any means necessary. Day after day she puts one foot in front of the other. Hollow. Lifeless. Haunted. Loving him was like basking in the sun on a summer day. Living without him is like slowly burning to death. 
  
  Torture.
  
  
  
    
      
    
  
  
    
      From cliché to risqué to mind-blowing. The events of Mag's story led her to one thing...her objective.
