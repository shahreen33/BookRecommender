**Note: This is the COLOR edition of this book.**We must understand the problem in order to visualize and actualize the solution.How did the US voluntarily arrive at the doorstep of its own demise? is homemade manmade Handmaid's Tale, where falsehoods and transparently mean-spirited claptrap trump facts and common decency--subverting naï¿½ve yet positive innocence into a malignant supremacist and myopic nationalistic agenda that is now in aming the planet's already rising temperature of self-harm? All this to cloak the true aspirations of the identi ed malevolent Oligarchs, who no longer lie quietly waiting.The first book in this trilogy (Math v. Myth) exposed the blatant myths that now overshadow reality. The second book (Who is Jeb!!!) uncovered the horrible histories of the Bush dynasty--revealing how America, beginning with the JFK assassination, began its descent from being a force for good, to now having zero moral authority. Allies hold us in contempt; enemies nurture us.We must understand the problem in order to visualize and actualize the solution. Since I fear the solution is unlikely to be enacted organically, we must prepare to seek a ballot-box-inspired intervention from a higher power--we must seek deliverance from our own collective folly, not from the heavens but from our own homegrown saviors, whom we created in the image of own inescapable delusions.
