A kiss could bond you, taint you, claim you. If you let it, it could own you. A kiss from a stranger was highly unlikely. A kiss from a man who hid himself from me, yet slowly tormented me, was unlike any other kiss. It was the kiss of death. It was my hands in cuffs chained to his waist. And only he could set me free. How could I be so blind? How could I have let a man that was delicious as sin take a grip on me? No matter how hard I tried to pull, those cuffs stayed glued to him as the wall that stood between us. I had to smash that wall, I had to see the truth. Even if we collide. Even if heâ€™s my own savage collision. I have to be set free.   Part one of the Savage Love Duet. Part Two Releasing May 29th.
