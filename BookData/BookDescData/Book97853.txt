Three years into a five-year marriage of convenience, Jenn finds herself wanting something she never thought she'd want from her laid-back, ex-military husband. Sex--as a much-needed release of tension from her high-stress job. But weekly sex with Nick, despite their careful parameters, is likely to get messy eventually. Ever since her father walked out on her as a child, Jenn knows never to assume the people she loves will stick around, so she's not about to trust Nick with her heart. She vows to stay strong, no matter how much intimacy develops between them in bed. But what starts as a tension-reliever soon becomes so much more, until it threatens both their practical arrangement and the heart Jenn has worked so hard to keep safe.
