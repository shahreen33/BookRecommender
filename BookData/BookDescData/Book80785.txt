Out in the cold...Elizabeth Wakefield's good friend, Sarah Thomas, is miserable. Her father is spending most of his time with his fiancee, Annie--a woman Sarah doesn't like at all. She thinks Annie is just after her father's money, but doesn't know how to prove it without sounding like a jealous brat. Some of Sarah's friends begin to notice the change in her, and when Elizabeth asks her what's wrong, Sarah just starts to cry. She desperately wants to tell Elizabeth the truth, but Annie has made her swear never to talk to anyone about her. If Annie is really as awful as Sarah thinks, can Elizabeth help her to come forward with the truth before it's too late?
