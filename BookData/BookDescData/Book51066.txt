For generations, the natives of Harrisport have watched wealthy summer families descend on their Cape Cod town and inhabit the massive cottages along the town's best stretches of beachfront. But when rich southerner Tucker Moss breaks the heart of local girl Edie Wright in the summer of 1962, an enduring war is started between the two families that lasts for generations.As Edie's youngest child, Lexi Wright should have known better than to fall in love with a Moss, but at nineteen, she falls hard for Tucker's son, Hudson — only to find herself jilted a few years later when Hudson breaks off their engagement to marry his high school sweetheart. Now, fifteen years later, Lexi has just returned home, secretly nursing a broken heart after another failed romance. But when Hudson’s younger brother, Cooper, arrives unexpectedly to reclaim the Moss cottage after his father’s death, an unlikely attraction forms between the two, and Lexi finds herself torn once again between passion and family loyalty. And then, renovations at the Moss guest house reveal a forty-five year-old declaration of love carved into a piece of framing — a truth that will force two women and the men who love them to confront the treacherous waters of their pasts.
