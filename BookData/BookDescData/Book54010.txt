   The Yahi, a Native American tribe, lived peacefully in California for hundreds of years--until they were violently wiped out by the invading white man in the late 1800s. Only a few bold Yahi escaped into hiding, among them the man who became known as Ishi, and this is the story of how they survived over the course of 40 years of hiding.    Soon, one by one, the last of the Yahi died--until Ishi was left alone, the sole survivor of a proud people. When Ishi stumbled into a small California mining town, the world learned his true story for the first time. This is the incredible story of the last hunter of the Yahi tribe, and how he brought to "civilization" all the courage, faith and strength of the Yahi Way of Life.
