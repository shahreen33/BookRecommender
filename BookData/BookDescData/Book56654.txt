LukeI play the field, responsibility is not my thing.My humor pulls the chicks and annoys my family most days. It’s my defence to being treated as the stupid younger brother. Working the family business is wearing thin, so maybe it’s time for change. It turns out it’s not the kind of change I’m expecting.Who is Zoe and why is she so familiar, yet so new? This strong, independent woman is driving me crazy. Working together means I can’t avoid her, not that I want to.There is something she is hiding, a past that haunts us both. Secrets can tear you apart.Can we manage a forbidden romance, or will the hiding become too hard?ZoeThat night, a lifetime ago, changed my world.Sleeping my way through men stopped me from remembering. I had the control, I made the choice. It gave me strength to move forward, to forget my past secrets.New job, new direction. Until he walks in, making me freeze and unable to breathe. What’s worse is that he’s my boss. This can’t happen, my lost love, here in my new life.I can’t hide forever. My past will catch up with me, secrets always do. A chance encounter not once but twice.Should I just keep hiding, or is it time to bury my past once and for all?
