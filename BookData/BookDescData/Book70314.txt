-Had Ronald Brown not discovered his father's old diaries, nothing much would've change in his life. He would've become a professional golfer, won a few trophies, and lived on a caddie fee for the rest of his life. But he did, and his life changed forever.- The journals of the early forties motivate him to travel across the continent to search for his roots in India. There he is faced with a cruel dilemma: celebrate the discovery of a long-lost sibling, or mourn the demise of a newfound love. Torn between his mind and his heart, he returns home, only to face false accusations and ensuing violence. Miserable, he returns once again to India to the love of his life. Does he live happily-ever-after . . . or is destined to suffer more?
