Petra and Cade meet at Isaac and Amy’s wedding and their mutual attraction is instantaneous. Neither of them wants a relationship, plus they live on opposite sides of the world.  As they both have a few days left before they must fly off to their normal lives, surely a holiday fling couldn’t harm? Maybe a few nights burning up the sheets is just what they need. No strings sex to get it out of their system before they both walk away with nothing but a fond memory.  Someone’s bound to get hurt when past events influence their futures. Invisible barriers are quickly erected to protect them against history repeating itself.  Unfortunately, the best laid plans can go wrong, especially when the law of attraction is stronger. Can they resist the pull when weakened defences are tested, and barricades begin to crumble?  Book 3 in the Reed and Rice Series. Book 1 &amp; 2 available to download now.  +18 contains sexual scenes, bad language, laughs and a possible WTF moment.
