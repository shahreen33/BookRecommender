ASIN moved from less recent edition hereWhen even the laws of physics let you down, the absurd, the ludicrous and the frankly impossible may be all you have leftDr Newton Barlow has everything a scientist could desire – a glittering career in the lab and on television, a beautiful family, and best of all, the opportunity to promote his rock-solid certainty that supernatural and religious beliefs are nothing but complete and utter hokum.But the ever-rational TV skeptic is about to take a tumble. Mired in accusations of fraud, incompetence and malpractice, Barlow is cast out of the scientific establishment and ejected from the family home.Then, after three wine-sodden years, Barlow is approached by his equally skeptical mentor, Dr Alex Sixsmith, with an extraordinary proposition. It may be an offer that Newton cannot refuse, but there’s one tiny problem:Sixsmith is dead.
