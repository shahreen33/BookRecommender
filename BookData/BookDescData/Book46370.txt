Meeting God in Mark explores the essential meaning and purpose of Mark's Gospel for beginners who may be curious about the Gospels and want to learn more, as well as for those who've read the Gospel many times before and want to see it in a fresh light.This beautifully written book by beloved Anglican Rowan Williams, former Archbishop of Canterbury, is packed with illuminating spiritual insights, and the focus on the Passion narrative makes this ideal as a Lenten devotional or study resource. Each of the three chapters includes questions for reflection. The end of the book includes a reading guide, reflection, and prayer for each of the seven weeks of Lent.
