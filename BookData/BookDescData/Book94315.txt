Betrayed. Hunted. On the run.   Irtha Vimbi and her brother have once again been forced from the safety of civilization in order to find acceptance elsewhere.  Now their only salvation may lie in the Nation of Madness, a land ruled by lunatics and shadow.  To reach it they must outrun a group of trained killers across the Deep, an expansive jungle where no man goes for fear of the strange magic that lurks inside and the creatures who call it home.  With the help of a dangerous group of outcasts, they must navigate the treacherous landscape and not only escape their enemies, but defeat their own demons to finally find their freedom.  The Nation of Madness is the second and last book in the Welkin Duology, a series set in Chilongua, a unique fantasy world inspired by the abundant life and terrors found in the jungle.
