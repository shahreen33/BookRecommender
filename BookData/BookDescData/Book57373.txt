What causes people to continually relive what they most want to forget, and what treatments could help restore them to a life with purpose and joy? Here, Dr. Bessel van der Kolk offers a new paradigm for effectively treating traumatic stress. Neither talking nor drug therapies have proven entirely satisfactory.
