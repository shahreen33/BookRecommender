An immense search ensues, but the twelve who plotted it all get away.After two years, all efforts by the local and federal police agencies have been in vain.

The sabbatical is merely a ruse, however, as her real job is to track the infamous twelve.

Soon, the surviving fugitives realize what she is up to, and a race to kill or be killed ensues. Full of exhilarating twists and surprisingly resonant, A Small Town will sweep readers along on Leah's quest for vengeance.
