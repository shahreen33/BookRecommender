**STILL is the conclusion of Grip &amp; Bristol's emotional journey. You must read FLOW, available for FREE, and GRIP before beginning STILL.**I'll be there.Through thick and thin.Ride or die.You can count on me.The promises people make. The vows we take. Assumptions of the heart.Emotion tells us how we feel, but life... life has a way of plunging us in boiling water, burning away our illusions, testing our faith, trying our convictions. Love floating is a butterfly, but love tested is an anchor.For Grip and BristolLove started at the top of the worldOn a Ferris wheel under the starsBut when that love is tested, will they fly or fall?
