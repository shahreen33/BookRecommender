  Welcome to Spellbound, where paranormal is the new normal.
  Thanks to Daniel's efforts as the director of tourism, the World Market is visiting Spellbound, giving residents of the formerly cursed town the chance to purchase merchandise they didn't know existed. When a bad-tempered werecougar ends up dead at the market, the fortune teller that predicted her death is the main suspect. As usual, though, Emma has another opinion on the matter and is determined to clear the suspect's name and keep Spellbound tourism from becoming another casualty.  With a new healer in town, seismic contractions, and a promise to recite Gareth's poem during the first annual poetry slam, Emma is teetering on the brink of an epic meltdown. Will she manage to identify the real culprit and safely deliver the baby or will the conniving killer bring a whole new meaning to the term labor pain?
