Enid Daniels  I tell all my deepest secrets to a tiger shifter I have never seen in human form, who I've named Roarsen. Somehow, though he never speaks, for obvious reasons, he has the ability to make me laugh and feel comfortable, even with telling him the hard truths about my life. I spend every night for months sitting on that back porch, snuggling my tiger friend and talking for hours. I have this fantasy that someday, I'll finally be ready for him to shift and the chemistry will be out of this world. We'll fall in love and I'll have a partner that knows everything about me and still accepts and loves me. Too bad Decker has to ruin everything by being the man I can't stop craving, who just happens to also be a great guy. But I can't tell someone like Decker the things I've had to do in my past. He'd never understand.  Decker Reed  It was an accident! I never meant to deceive my mate. I simply followed my tiger nose to the beautiful man sitting on my brother's back porch and became the confidant to a person in need of an ear that he thought might not judge him. And I don't judge him. I want nothing more than to hold him in my arms and tell him how amazing I find him. Too bad he won't let me shift yet, so I can show him how happy I am to have him as a mate, no matter what his past looks like.  As with all my books, this is pretty freaking fluffy. Not much angst at all, no cheating and definitely a happy ending! Meant to be a light hearted read to make you laughâ€¦ or at least smile.  Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses::
