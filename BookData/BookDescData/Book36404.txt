  
    The Red Plains are hot.
  
  
  
    But my fae king?

So, we kind of got captured by a warlike clan of Vundi warriors. Sounds bad, right? But they treat us as guests, and I’m coming to like them despite the ongoing threat of me being shipped off to the king beyond the mountain. I still endeavour to reach the winter kingdom and find a way back home… until the Vundi high priestess reveals that I may have more ties to the fae world than I ever imagined. On top of that, Leander knows just what buttons to press to get me naked, in a tub, and panting for him. My resolve is failing on all fronts. But, worse than that, I discover danger is even closer than I realised...
