  'Everything moves more slowly when I walk, the world seems softer . . .'
From the bestselling author of Silence comes an illuminating exploration of the joy of walking. From those perilous first steps to great expeditions, from walking to work to walking to the North Pole, Erling Kagge explains that he who walks lives longer, and better.
  'After having put my shoes on and let my thoughts wander, I am sure of one thing - to put one foot in front of the other is one of the most important things we do.'
'Erling Kagge is a philosophical adventurer - or perhaps an adventurous philosopher' - New York Times'Drawing on the experiences of Kagge's extraordinary life in wild places, this is a book of great concentration' - Robert Macfarlane, on Silence
