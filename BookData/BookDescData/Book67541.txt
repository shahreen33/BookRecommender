Do I want to spend my summer with my vicious classmates at Bloodstone University—better known as Villain Academy? No, thank you. But I've got to find a way to tackle my enemies before they try to destroy me again, and the trail to potential answers starts there.I've had it with taking the high road, though. Come at me, and you'd better believe I'll hit you back just as hard. Maybe that'll mean I have to tap into my dark magic instincts more than I'd ever have planned to, but I'm not letting one more person I care about get hurt.That also means I've got to steer clear of the one guy I completely trust, or I might ruin his life too. With two of the other scions vying for my attention and the last shifting his campaign against me in an unexpected way, I've got my hands full as it is. I can't say whether I'll survive everything this summer has in store. All I know for sure is it's going to be a hot one.*Sinister Wizardry is the third book in a university-age paranormal academy series. Expect magical villainy, a tough heroine who bends to no one’s will, a dollop of steam, and a slow-burn enemies-to-lovers reverse harem romance where there'll be no choosing required.*
