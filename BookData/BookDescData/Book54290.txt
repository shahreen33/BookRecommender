After a rejection from a long-time crush throws him off his game, Brandon Jensen decides that maybe it's time to start a new one, with the beautiful Nadia Clark on his team.She's just right for what he has in mind. Quiet and laid back, while still being undeniably energetic and appealing. But there's a reason behind Nadia's reserved nature. She's starting over, and while something casual with Brandon seems like a nice distraction... it's just that. A distraction.Neither of them went into this thing — whatever it is — looking for the type of unspoken connection that they find. Nadia is just trying to a build a life, and Brandon isn't interested in chasing a commitment...until it starts to slip away.
