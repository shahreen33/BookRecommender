From USA Today bestselling author W Winters comes an emotionally captivating and thrilling, romantic suspense.  He holds a power over me like no one else ever could.  Maybe it’s because my heart begs to beat in time with his. Maybe it’s because my body bows to his and his alone. Maybe it’s because he thought he loved me before he even laid eyes on me.  He thought wrong, it wasn’t me he thought he loved, and nothing has made me suffer like that little secret has. He thought I belonged to him, but he was wrong. It was never supposed to be me.  Our memories are deceiving, but I know what I want now. What I need more than anything. I won’t rest until he’s as much mine as I am his. It’s always been him.
