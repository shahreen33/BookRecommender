Heaven Sent gets a hell of new keyboardist with a name to match. Heller Witting is an amazing musician and proves to be the answer to a sound that the band was missing. With lavender hair and big violet eyes, he captivates Brent Rose from the start, and not just with his music. Brent knows better than to get involved with a member of the band. That just invites trouble and that’s the last thing he wants for Heaven Sent. So he’ll just keep the attraction to himself. Doesn’t matter anyway. Hell couldn’t possibly want him. After all, Brent’s not gorgeous and flashy like the other members of the band. When Hell makes his interest in Brent all too obvious, Brent is unprepared and unable to stay away. Fine, if they just keep it at sex, everything will be all right.[Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: homoerotic sex practices.]
