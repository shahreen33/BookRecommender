Narcotics-cop-turned-bodyguard Mitchell Graves finds himself assigned to protect James Russo, a billionaire senator's son and mayoral hopeful. Russo's advisor and campaign manager, Alice Hartman, has no love for Mitchell. But she knows the young cop -- and his unwavering, inexplicable dedication to Russo -- will be useful... Especially since Russo likes booze too much, likes sex too much, and isn't into waiting for a decorous time to engage in either one.Despite Hartman's warnings, the assignment borders on boring for Mitchell, even as the unspoken attraction between bodyguard and billionaire heats up. A slave to his sex drive and true to his nature, Russo takes matters into his own hands -- pushing Mitchell to his limits with an office encounter -- and putting his bodyguard into more danger than the young police officer ever saw on the streets.Savor a sophisticated slow burn, plus more political intrigue and dirty talk than an episode of "Meet the Press," in HARD STOP.
