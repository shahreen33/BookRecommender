On October 16, 2013, 437 students, 52 teachers, and 24 additional staff from Bay Point Preparatory High School in suburban Milwaukee, WI vanished without a trace, finding themselves countless light years away in the middle of an ancient, primordial wilderness. In the wake of the election, the results have turned the students against their new-found allies. And as Karen learns more about the Aboriginal people and their control over the power of the Woods, she must chose between her friends and her destiny. Created and written by James Tynion IV (BATMAN ETERNAL), illustrated by Michael Dialynas (AMALA’S BLADE), and colored by Josan Gonzalez, “Movie Night” collects the critically acclaimed fourth arc of the best-selling series.
