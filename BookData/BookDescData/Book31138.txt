On a beautiful summer day, five friends embarked on what was supposed to be an adventurous ten-mile hike to a hidden bridge built in the middle of a mountain that not very many people knew of. What was supposed to be a beautiful, enjoyable and relaxing weekend, becomes more than they bargained for as they will experience horrors that until now have only been dreamt of. Trapped in the middle of nowhere can these five friends make it back to safety or will the monsters of the mountains chase and pick them off one by one. Who will live? Who will die?
