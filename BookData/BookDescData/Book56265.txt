An alternate title/cover edition can be found here.Last Christmas Ella’s heart was broken.  She had been with sophisticated banker Robbie Newton for six years when they suddenly broke up on New Year’s Eve.  Robbie had left her heartbroken and hurt with nothing but a note explaining he had taken a job in Chicago.  This Christmas Ella is determined to bury her past and start afresh.  She focuses on her career as an artist and organises her debut exhibition in a swanky London gallery.  While shopping for her best friend, Libby Crosley, who is hosting her infamous Christmas party that evening, Ella bumps into a mysterious man in the supermarket.  After a series of awkward run-ins and chance meetings with this stranger, Fergus Lamb, Ella feels the pangs of love again.  Fergus is nothing like any man Ella’s ever dated.  He’s a quirky, smart, bold, and spontaneous war photographer who looks like James Dean.  Just as Ella’s luck is changing, Robbie shows up unannounced at the opening night of her exhibition.  Ella is faced with a choice when Robbie finally offers her what she always wanted…  Who will Ella choose? Her suave and successful ex-boyfriend who she finds so irresistible? Or the exciting new stranger who has just waltzed into her life?  Will this Christmas be a fresh start? Or will she be dragged back to the memories of Last Christmas?  ‘Last Christmas’ is a heart-warming, witty and modern take on the classic love triangle story – the perfect romance to curl up to the fire with.
