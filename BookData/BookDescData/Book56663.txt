They call me a God, Demon, Monster,Depends on which side of me they've faced.I'm cold, with an insatiable thirst for blood, lust, and money.If you've got my attention,You're either next on my list, or about to slip into my sheets.I'm Arthur Calthorpe, leader of the Tabella Della Morte.I don't trust, I own.I don't love, I desire.I don't ask, I take.And I want Gaia.The silver-haired tyrant is a ruthless criminal,The first time I saw him was in my mother's bed,But the monster has set his sights on me.He's relentless, and he's found my achilles heel.When he offers me a bargain, I'm hard-pressed to refuse.What lengths am I willing to go to be free of him, and how far will he go to stop me.The trouble is those eyes and the fact that I want to know the story behind them.
