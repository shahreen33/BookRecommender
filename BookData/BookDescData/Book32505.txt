This is a book about ordinary people who took an opportunity to be creative, to be innovative, and to maximize their potential. Chip Wilson’s part in this story comes from the learnings of thousands of mistakes. He set the culture, business model, quality platform, people development program and then got out of the way. Lululemon’s exponential growth, culture, and brand strength has few peers and it is because of those who employees who choose to be great. This book is also about missed opportunity – five years of missed opportunity. Chip was playing to win, while the directors of the company he founded were playing not to lose.
