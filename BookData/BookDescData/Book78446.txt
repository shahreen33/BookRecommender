It took one night with her to know she was my forever.It took one minute for me to climb out of bed and drive away from her.It’s taken me three years to confess that leaving her behind was the biggest mistake of my life.I won’t stop until she knows what she means to me. I’ll convince her to listen to her heart.It took one night for all of my dreams to come true.It took one morning, waking up alone, for those same dreams to come crashing down around me.It’s taken me three years to confess that night changed me forever. He says this time is different, but how do I open my heart up to a man who’s already ripped it to shreds?
