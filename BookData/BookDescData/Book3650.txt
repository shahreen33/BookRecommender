'Sounds of War, ' is a historical fiction of lost battles for the Al Anbar Province during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Richly rot with lambasted situations, follow Thomas Edington's gritty journey as it teeters on the edge of the surrealism. Always landing in hot water, his life is altered when he is forced to navigate down a precarious path of unspoken truths all while a barbaric war rages around him. The war's twilight reflects a rainbow of dark hues bathed in blood soaked colors of altruism, and if it were not for the gruesome realities of war, the 'Sounds of War, ' would be a fantastic comedy. Entertainingly witty, the story line easily unfolds like a Hollywood block buster. "A modern day Iliad."

I'm not much into war stories but I was mesmerized with Thomas Ferreolus's not so normal fiction, 'SOUNDS OF WAR, ' had me hooked from the get go." S. Churchill - Author
