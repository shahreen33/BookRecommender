Reads R to L (Japanese Style). Taming a Beast was never this dangerous! Leo Aoi looks like a crazy animal with wild eyes--and no one at his new high school will go near him!

In reality, Leo isn't as frightening as he appears, but Yuiko finds out that he goes berserk whenever he sees blood! Will Yuiko be able to get through to Leo during these violent fits? Or will Leo's ferocious side eventually devour her?
