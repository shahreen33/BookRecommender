Rough Riders series, Book 1
  One lucky woman … three sexy cowboys … she’s in for the ride of her life!
During summer break, wannabe wild woman Channing Kinkaid is offered the chance to shed her inhibitions and horse around on the road with a real chaps-and-spurs wearing rodeo cowboy. From the moment Colby McKay - bull rider, saddle bronc buster and calf roper - sets his lust-filled eyes on the sweet and fiery Channing, he knows she’s up to the challenge of being his personal buckle bunny. But he also demands that his rodeo travelling partners, Trevor and Edgard are allowed to join in their no-holds-barred sexcapades. Although Channing secretly longed to be the sole focus of more than one man’s passions, all is not as it seems with the sexy trio. Colby’s demand for her complete submission behind closed doors tests her wilful nature, and his sweet-talking ways burrow into her heart. Will Colby have to break out the bull-ropes and piggin’ string to convince this headstrong filly that the road to true love doesn’t have to be as elusive as that championship belt buckle?
