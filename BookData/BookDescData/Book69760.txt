Olivia has one goal upon returning to London: Find Lord Langley and seduce him. It was no secret that her stepsister was a miserable excuse for a human being and the secrets shrouding her demise only added confirmation that even in death---she wasn't worthy of the handsome Lord. According to rumors, Lord Langley is after revenge, but she's after something far more dangerous. His heart. One masquerade aligns their paths in ways neither of them could have imagined. Will he succumb to the fair beauty? Or forever allow his heart to be entrenched by the beastly claws of her dead sister?
