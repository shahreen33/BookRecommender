My name is Darcy Anderson, and I am cursed with a dark power: Whenever my life is in danger, something inside me summons elemental fire to protect me. I cannot control this.One night, I was attacked in my home. The fire ... it raged out of control. I survived the inferno, but my house burned to the ground - with my parents inside.I was at a loss to explain to the courts what happened, and so they sent me to prison for ten years for manslaughter.Now I'm out on parole, and all I want is to return to my home town and rebuild my life; but the man who attacked me is back to finish the job he started.I can sense the power in me growing. If I can't control it, it will control me and destroy everything - and everyone - I love.
