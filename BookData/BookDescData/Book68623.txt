In the turbulent years between the wars, nothing in Berlin is quite what it seems.Not for Emmeline, a wayward young artist freewheeling wildly through the city in search of meaning. Not for Julius, an eminent art connoisseur who finds it easier to love paintings than people. And most definitely not for Frank, a Jewish lawyer who must find a way to protect his family and his principles as the Nazis begin their rise to power.But the greatest enigma of them all is Matthias, the mercurial art dealer who connects them all. Charming and ambitious, he will provoke a scandal that turns all of their lives upside down.Inspired by true events, this brilliant, humane novel peels back the cherished illusions that sustain us to reveal the truths beneath.A book about beauty and justice, vanity and self-delusion, it asks: do we see only what we want to see? Even in the full light of the sun?
