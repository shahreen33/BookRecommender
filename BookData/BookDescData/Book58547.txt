Life’s a kiln and we all start off with clay. Every encounter, every hardship lays a brick in the foundation of our very being, and through pure grit, we slowly build up the powerful structure we will one day become. In this anthology, you will find a variety of poetry and short stories from five different writers and a glimpse into their own trials-by-fire. Whether it’s family, relationships, day-to-day life, or a story that just needs to be told, it’s a crucial piece to their framework and worth sharing with the world.
