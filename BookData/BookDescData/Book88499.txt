After being laid off from his job as a newspaper reporter in a coastal Florida town, Dexter Vega meets a wealthy retiree who hires him to find his daughter who is supposed to be attending the local college. When Vega visits his client to inform him that his daughter is in Mexico, he discovers the man has been murdered. And Vega's prints are all over the murder weapon. As the police build a case against him, Vega flies to Mexico City to locate his client's daughter, hoping she will help him find the murderer and thus clear his name. But when he finds the woman, she tells him a very different story--nothing is as it seems. Beaten by thugs and ordered to leave Mexico, Vega returns home to find himself immersed in a web of blackmail, greed, and revenge. Still pursued by the cops, but now a target of evil predators.
