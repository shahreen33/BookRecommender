Grace loves a woman. Annie loves a man. Violet isn't quite sure. But you'll love them all...Grace has what one might call a 'full and interesting life' which is code for not married and has no kids. Her life is the envy of her friends, who assume she doesn't want that kind of commitment. But all this time she has been waiting in secret for a love that will take her breath away, like the way a wave in a rough sea knocks you over...When Grace meets a beautiful woman at a party, she falls suddenly and desperately in love. At the same party, lawyer Annie finds the man of her dreams - the only man she's ever met whose table manners are up to her mother's standards. And across the city, Violet, who is mostly afraid of everything, is making another discovery of her own: that for the first time in her life she has fallen for another girl.A Love Story for Bewildered Girls is a hilarious and heart-warming tale of female friendship and first love in all its guises â€“ a novel to remind us that whatever we think our happy ending should be, life can have other, sometimes far better, plans.
