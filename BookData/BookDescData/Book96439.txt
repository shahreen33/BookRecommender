Greyson McCarty is hiding big secrets and doing his best to stay invisible in the Red Havoc Crew. By his own choice, he is at the very bottom of the crew, but when he enlists the help of a shifter matchmaking service to find a mate, the one he’s given makes it hard for him to hide what he really is. Genevieve is smart, and funny, and the most interesting woman he’s ever met. Too bad she’s not a panther, and the wrath of her people could mean the end for Greyson and his C-Team crew of misfit shifters.  Genevieve Taylor is desperate to find a place that makes sense to her. On the run from her last crew, she needs to find a man who is big and bad enough to keep her safe, and she’ll use any means necessary—even a shifter matchmaking service. Falling for Greyson would be a bonus, so when she meets him and there is an instant spark between them, she can’t help but hope she’s found her match. But there’s more than meets the eye with the quiet panther shifter, and she’s beginning to suspect he’s not as reserved as he seems. Maybe that’s a good thing though, because she’s being hunted by a ghost from her past, and now it’s not just her life at stake.   Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. Intended for mature audiences.
