When the Dog looks inside a hole in the wall, he spies another dog! Dog can't wait to tell Warthog, Lion and Elephant the news. But when his friends look in the hole for themselves, none of them find the dog. In fact, they each see something different! An argument ensues. Each animal is sure the others are wrong, because everyone can't be right . . . can they? After a little reflection, readers will be delighted to discover that the hole in the wall is not a hole at all but a mirror. At the end of the day, friendship and harmony prevail. Hans Wilhelm has created a humorous interpretation of Mark Twain's A Fable.
