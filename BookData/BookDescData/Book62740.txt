Librarian's Note: Alternate-cover edition for ASIN B01CYT8S3KWhen my sister is diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia, there’s only one way to raise the half a million dollars I need to save her: use my skills with plants to grow marijuana. But I’m a botany geek, not a drug lord. I need help. I need the scariest guy on the block: Sean O’Harra, the muscled, sledge hammer-wielding badass even the dealers fear. He says that he destroys everything he touches...so why can’t I stop thinking about his big hands all over my body? As the summer heat rises, I’ll have to juggle my normal life and my new life as a criminal while cops, dealers and gangs threaten us on all sides...but the hardest thing of all might be keeping Sean and me apart. I’m a good girl...but I think he’s about to turn me really, really bad.
