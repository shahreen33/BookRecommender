THE BRAND GAP is the first book to present a unified theory of brand-building. Whereas most books on branding are weighted toward either a strategic or creative approach, this book shows how both ways of thinking can unite to produce a "charismatic brand"--a brand that customers feel is essential to their lives. In an entertaining two-hour read you'll learn:- the new definition of brand- the five essential disciplines of brand-building- how branding is changing the dynamics of competition- the three most powerful questions to ask about any brand- why collaboration is the key to brand-building- how design determines a customer's experience- how to test brand concepts quickly and cheaply- the importance of managing brands from the inside- 220-word brand glossaryFrom the back cover: Not since McLuhan's THE MEDIUM IS THE MESSAGE has a book compressed so many ideas into so few pages. Using the visual language of the boardroom, Neumeier presents the first unified theory of branding--a set of five disciplines to help companies bridge the gap between brand strategy and customer experience. Those with a grasp of branding will be inspired by the new perspectives they find here, and those who would like to understand it better will suddenly "get it." This deceptively simple book offers everyone in the company access to "the most powerful business tool since the spreadsheet."
