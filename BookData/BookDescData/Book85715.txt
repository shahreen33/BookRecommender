“I Do.” My name is Whitney Wheeler and I’ve dreamed of saying those two words since I was ten years old. My dream is finally coming true. Fate, however, has other plans. My perfectly planned life hits a snag eight days before our wedding. I walk in on my fiancé on the couch with someone who isn’t me. Trying to “blow off” that visual, without thinking I accept an invitation to take a road trip with the boy who broke my teenage heart. Lucas DeCosta is all man, and surprise surprise—a male stripper. Beyond his movie-star good looks, his oh so sexy dance moves, and those big brown eyes, I find a kind heart and the overall goodness of the boy who still sets my heart on fire. Each time he looks at me, I feel it. Zing.Zang. Electricity. It.  When life hands you lemons . . . take a shot of tequila and hand fate the keys to your life. Because, sometimes the best thing to say is “I Don’t” before you can ever say “I Do.”
