When given the choice to kill or die,It’s a no-fucking-brainer.When given the choice to obey or not,Things get gray.But given the choice,To kill or save the one who saved you?Now you’ve got my attention.And killers don’t work wellWith a conscious around to fuck things up.So, you know…Hope for the best, but expect the worst.Because I’m still fucking Junco.And I’m still at war with everyone.Well-trained soldier or genetically engineered monster? Junco Coot can’t even remember her trip off Earth; she was too busy being morphed into her new avian body. But reality hits her hard when she wakes up to find her new life is not what she expected. Not even close. Tier is on trial for treason, the avian president wants her dead, her new military team is hostile, her body is being taken over by an illicit AI, and her only friend is a ten-year old throwaway boy.In most places the avian Fledge ritual would be nothing more than mass murder, but here in the capital city of Amelia, it’s called growing up. Junco has two choices: fight to the death to prove her worth, or get sent back to Earth in the hands of her enemies.In a foreign culture and surrounded by people she can’t trust or count on, Junco must find a way to save herself and Tier without losing her immortal soul in the process.
