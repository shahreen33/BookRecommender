After a bestselling first novel, Valentine Adams and Eden Chase have teamed up again and this time the story is hot, smart and ready for primetime. Madeline, a twenty-something is trained pastry chef from the southeast who has started anew. She has taken a job in the library of August Halsted College in Halsted’s Ferry, NY. Recently divorced from an abusive husband, she figured it was time for a life change. Little did she realize just how much of a change she had in store … The most remarkable and revealing thing would not be what he said but the way he said it, in absolutely perfect, unaccented English.“But you must understand that I can only share some of this with you. I am bound by an oath. I am Dmitri Vavilov and I grew up in Odesa in the Ukraine and I am here to steal several paintings from the Worthington Gallery. I cannot allow anyone to be able to trace my whereabouts. I needed a place to stay, a safe house if you will. I saw you and … I could see lonely written all over … And you were so pretty. I wanted to meet you.” Dmitri sat, his eyes never wavering from her face. “I’m eating up everything you’re feeding me. Oh, I’ll bet you enjoyed it, laughing inside at the simple, naïve southern girl, so ‘lonely’, so ... pathetic! Now here I am in the middle of a criminal activity ...” 	Unmoved, the Russian only nodded and said simply, “You have little choice in the matter. You are after all, my prisoner.”
