"The right way is the one where we end up together...And to do that, we need to survive this."  A brilliant, obsessive mind is the heart of Sebastian Seaver’s genius.

When Drew loses control one reckless, drunken evening and his true feelings for Bas are revealed, he tries desperately to contain the damage and keep their friendship on track, even as decades of lies and half-truths seek to tear them apart.
