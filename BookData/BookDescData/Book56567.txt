One man’s wife is another’s obsession.We had a love I thought could never be broken. But I was wrong. We weren’t as strong as our vows once promised.Dark secrets and vicious lies, they tore us apart.They cut too deep, leaving open wounds.Pain is something that should never come from the man you love. Forgiveness, understanding, tenderness, yes. But never pain.But the fact remains. He is my husband and I am his wife. Perhaps he should have remembered that a year ago when he committed his first sin against our marriage. And perhaps then, I wouldn’t have fallen for the devil.A devil who had me in his sights from the very beginning.A devil who swore to never let me go.
