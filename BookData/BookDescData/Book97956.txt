Greg Salinger was just your typical merc for hire - killing those he deemed "foolish" for money. But that life is behind him now. Today, he's a psychiatrist, trying to help others. But now S.H.I.E.L.D. wants him to try to rehabilitate super villains. The catch? If these "patients" don't make enough progress, they're dead! Sounds like a job for Foolkiller! But when he finds himself alone with an arsenal of weapons against an army of skinhead Red Skull sympathizers, he'll be asking questions about his own career choices! Who's the fool now, Salinger?COLLECTING: FOOLKILLER 1-5
