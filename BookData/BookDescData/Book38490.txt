The story “Town of Cats” is excerpted from three-part novel, “1Q84”. In the book, Tengo is one of two main characters who pass between two distinct worlds, one of which has supernatural elements. But this story deals mainly with the real world —and the relationship between a boy and the man who raises him. Was this portrait of Tengo’s background —the disappearance of his mother, the difficult relationship with his father— part of your conception of the book and the character from the beginning?
