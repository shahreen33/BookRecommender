Finn has never been on a cruise ship before, much less stowed away on one. He's never impersonated a fairy tale character, sought lost treasure or gotten to know his real dad. Annual visits to family in Germany are normally highlighted by skateboarding, playing soccer with cousins, and getting spoiled by his grandparents. But all that is about to change when a mysterious foreigner hands Finn his father's diary. He and best friend Burrito embark on the pursuit of his previously unknown inheritance -- a fortune in Nazi Gold.
