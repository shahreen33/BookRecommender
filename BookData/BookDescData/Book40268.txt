Liz Prince, author of the world's cutest relationship comic, "Will You Still Love Me If I Wet the Bed?," returns with a new comic about being - gasp! - SINGLE. Finally bringing her popular webcomic to printed form, Alone Forever explores the joys of flying solo, free to focus on what really matters: comics, punk rock, and cute boys with beards. Drawn in Liz Prince's ultra-charming style, filled with self-deprecation and cats, there's something for everyone to relate to in this celebration of self-reliance in the age of OkCupid.
