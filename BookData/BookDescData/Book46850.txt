Cecilia Robin--Cece to her friends--is a simple fourth-grade schoolteacher who has fallen in with a splinter group of the Resistance. Never in her life would she have expected to be chosen to assassinate Zo'or, head of the Taelon synod. And never in her life would she actually do it.Her refusal leads her away from the Resistance and to the protection of Augur, whom she puts in a terrible position. Now he--the ultimate loner, the guy whose credo is "I'm out for nobody but myself"--has to risk his cover, his life, and worst of all, possibly, the loss of some income, to save his favorite teacher from both the Taelons and the Resistance.Can Augur save Cece without crippling the Resistance and destroying humanity's hope for the future? Maybe, and maybe not. But for sure, he's really going to mess up his social life!
