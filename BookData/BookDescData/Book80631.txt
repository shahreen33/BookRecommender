It’s Book Fair Day, when every class gets to visit the book sale in the library. Dewey Booker can’t wait! He LOVES reading—more than bubblegum, baseball cards, and bike riding. In fact, when Dewey’s nose isn’t stuck in a book, he’s dreaming about adding new books to his collection. But Mrs. Shepherd’s class isn’t scheduled to go to the fair until the end of the day. Not wanting to miss all the good offerings, Dewey tries every which way to get into the fair early. Mrs. Shepherd always catches him, though. . . .Will he make it before all the best books are taken?
