MM Non-Shifter Mpreg Romance. I never learned how to swim.   Fear had ruled over most of my life from fear of the water to my choice of alpha. Now that I’d left him, it was time to face all the facets of life. What I hadn’t expected was that my swimming teacher, the lifeguard at a local kids’ club would not only be the teacher I needed, but more. Harris might just prove to be the anchor I needed in life.   When I saw Luca, knees wobbling by the pool, I knew something more than a fear of water plagued this omega. My protective instinct kicked in full-time. I needed to know him, keep him safe, share my life with him—and not just in the pool.  The Alpha’s Lifeguard-Kissed Omega is a sweet with knotty heat mm mpreg romance. It is Book 6 of the Alpha Kissed series but can be read as a standalone.
