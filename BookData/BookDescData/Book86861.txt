 And she lived happily ever after...or...maybe not.  Morgan’s new status among the Fae has made it impossible for the witches to ignore the danger she may become to them. They declare war, and now it’s up to Morgan and her Fae army to keep humanity safe.  Grayson may have settled in as Alpha, but females are clamoring for the position of alpha female, and at least one is willing to risk the dishonor of being an assassin, putting true love to the test as he’s forced to choose between tradition and the women he can’t let go of.  The Fae princess and badass witch is fighting on two fronts, and unless she taps into some serious magic, or some powerful allies, the knife in the dark might end the fight for freedom before it’s begun. In the end, everyone will risk losing something irreplaceable, and it’s up to Morgan and Grayson to ensure that the loss doesn’t outweigh the reward.
