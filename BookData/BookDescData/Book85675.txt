One woman. Two rock stars. A threesome that will change everything…  Photographer Amber Malone sucks at love. She’s been dumped, duped and dated more a-holes than any girl should ever have to.  Then she meets rock star Dylan Cope, drummer for the mega-successful rock band Dirty; gorgeous, charming and all-around nice guy. For once, the stars seem to be aligning in Amber’s favor.  There’s only one problem.  Dylan’s rock star best friend, Ashley Player, is not a nice guy. He’s broken, bitter, protective of Dylan—and wants Amber gone.  It’s almost enough to send her packing…  But when Amber and her camera inadvertently catch Ash kissing Dylan, she finds herself sucked head-over-heels into a world of secrets, lust and heartache… and a three-way relationship that will change everything she thought she knew about love.  Dirty Like Dylan is the fourth full-length novel in the Dirty series—a rockstar romance series about the members of the rock band Dirty and the women and men who love them.  Novels in the Dirty series are interconnected standalones, each with an HEA; other books (novella/story collection) are not HEA, but are essential pieces of the overall story arcs. (There are ongoing storylines that develop throughout the series; reading them in order is not crucial but is HIGHLY recommended.)
