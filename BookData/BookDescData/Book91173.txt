A stolen Christmas present brings together two strangers who long for hearth and home at the holidays.

A lost &amp; found ad is posted for the Christmas knife’s safe return, bringing scammers crawling out of the woodwork who only want the reward. That is, until Clayton gets a call from a man named Kyle, who says he just wants to return the knife and sheath to Clayton, and he doesn’t want the reward.  Is it just another scam or can Clayton trust him? Clayton takes a risk and heads to Kyle’s house to pick up the Christmas knife. Over the phone, Kyle’s voice becomes Clayton’s only beacon as he makes his way through a whiteout blizzard.  After a long drive across the prairies during a raging, pre-Christmas winter storm, will Clayton find more than what he is looking for?
