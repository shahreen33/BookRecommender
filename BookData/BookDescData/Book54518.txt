Acid Dreams is the complete social history of LSD &amp; the counterculture it helped to define in the sixties. Martin A. Lee &amp; Bruce Shlain's exhaustively researched &amp; astonishing account--part of it gleaned from secret government files-- tells how the CIA became obsessed with LSD as an espionage weapon during the early 1950s &amp; launched a massive covert research program, in which countless unwitting citizens were used as guinea pigs. Though the CIA was intent on keeping the drug to itself, it ultimately couldn't prevent it from spreading into the popular culture. Here LSD had a profound impact &amp; helped spawn a political &amp; social upheaval that changed the face of America. From the clandestine operations of the government to the escapades of Timothy Leary, Abbie Hoffman, Ken Kesey &amp; his Merry Pranksters, Allen Ginsberg &amp; many others, Acid Dreams provides an important &amp; entertaining account that goes to the heart of a turbulent period in our history.
