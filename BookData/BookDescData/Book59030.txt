John Muir writes his first memoir about his life in Scotland as a boy in a strict and brutal religious family. A glimpse into Scottish country culture is seen through his eyes and his early love of nature is evident. Then the family moves to America and into the backwoods of Wisconsin to help settle the area for farming along with many other Scotch and Irish farmers. His life there growing up and the brutality of homesteading on wilderness under his cruel father is an education. Ready to leave home he invents incredible timepieces and a thermometer among other things and makes his was to the U. of Wisconsin. The American culture in Wisconsin is supportive of him and the story he tells is like another country compared to these times of patents and rivalries and thefts.
