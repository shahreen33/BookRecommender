New look, a hard cover version for Der Mond!Stylish, delicate, and consistently edgy, Der Mond collects the color illustrations of Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, perhaps the most acclaimed manga and anime artist of all time. The book includes 74 pages of paintings and designs devoted to Neon Genesis Evangelion, plus another 50 pages from The Wings of Honneamise, Nadia--The Secret of Blue Water, Blue Uru, and other works--including Sadamoto's cover to Eric Clapton's 1998 album, Pilgrim.
