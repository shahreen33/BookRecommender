Romilly Winter is no ordinary heroine, just a reluctant one.She has a gift. She can see the future. But can she see far enough? The world in which she lives is under attack – the dead are rising, and evil follows her at every turn.Will she be able to save herself – and the world?”From the Diary of Romilly Winter, October 14th."I’ve had two years to prepare for this. In that time, I have never told a soul. Of course, my Nan knew. She’d bequeathed me the mirror, after all. Now, maybe tonight, tomorrow, in a few days, the event that I don’t want to happen with all my heart, will come to pass. I’m not ready. I know I’m not ready, and yet, it will happen nonetheless.Nan had this thing in her possession for nearly seventy years. She had told me I simply had to be at Rosewinter, prior to my sixteenth birthday no matter what objections my parents raised. She said I was ‘special’, and was the only one equipped to deal with what was coming.The problem is, I don’t feel special, I just feel…different, and in all probability, that isn't going to be good enough.In just two days time, I will be sixteen years old, and if anything my Nan said is remotely true, I will be lucky to survive that long…."AUTHOR NOTES: Not for the very youngest of readers.---Recommended for ages 15 and over.
