 He's the most beautiful monster she's ever seen Emmy Atler is desperate for a job so she can help her grandfather with his increasing medical bills. She even applies to be a maid for Jason Belmont, recluse writer, who's known more for the murder of his cheating wife and her lover than his popular thrillers. He may have gotten off on a technicality, but everyone knows he's guilty. Just because he's quiet and awkward doesn't mean he's actually innocent. Just because he treats Emmy with warmth and respect doesn't mean he's not capable of killing her with his bare hands - especially considering the fact that he lives in a secluded cabin in the woods of Lake Tahoe. Emmy can scream and no one would hear. Now, with her grandfather's health on the line and the risk of debt closing in, Emmy must do her job and ignore her growing attraction for her employer - especially if she wants to avoid risking her life for a man both brooding and fatal.
