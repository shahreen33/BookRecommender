How much would you sacrifice to learn the truth?  Supernatural abilities are revealed. A sacrifice is made. A hero is born.  Naz Andersen's life is quickly becoming complicated. After losing his best friend to suspicious circumstances, he turns his attention to ruthless gang leader Roffio Styles and the Incubus Apostles.  But to get answers, he must summon the world within once more. With his sister Meri's help, he begins to understand his strange experiences are actually telekinesis and telepathy at play--gifts from his forgotten father.  When Naz gets too close to the truth and tragedy strikes again, he must unleash his newfound abilities to wield his own unique brand of justice. Will his appetite to avenge his friend's murder lead to his destruction or his destiny?
