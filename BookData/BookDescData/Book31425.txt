Valentine’s Inc. Need a date? Want to impress your boss or maybe your ex? Looking for the love of your life? Give us a call for all your dating needs!  Dakota~ Working for Valentine’s Inc. isn’t exactly my favorite job in the world, but it’s not bad either. I need the extra cash, anyway, so it’s kinda perfect. The real problem is that I never expected to meet someone I actually like, and now that I’m fake dating him for a whole weekend, it’s hard to separate the job from my feelings. Especially when Poe looks at me like he really cares.  Poe~ My sister’s getting married, and all of our friends are on my case about having a date for the wedding. Unfortunately, I think I have the not-dateable gene, so I come up empty. And when I find out my ex is going to be there, I contact Valentine’s Inc. in desperation. I had no idea they were going to send someone as perfect as Dakota. Too bad he’s only pretending to like me because I think I want to date him—for real.  Dakota and Poe need to navigate through their feelings and figure out if they can find true love together or if everything they feel for one another is simply just for show.
