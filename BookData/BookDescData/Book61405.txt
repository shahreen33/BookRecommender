In the 1970s, 
  Jack "King" Kirby
 was hard at work at DC Comics on mind-bending epics including THE NEW GODS, THE FOREVER PEOPLE, OMAC, and THE DEMON. At the same time, Kirby also created a series of stories that drew on his own experiences in World War II. Starring DC war heroes including Captain Storm, Johnny Cloud, Gunner and Sarge, this volume features inventive stories in which The Losers stop a German attack using a strategy found in a comic book, German and American athletes who faced each other at the 1936 Berlin Olympics meet again on the field of combat, and much more.
