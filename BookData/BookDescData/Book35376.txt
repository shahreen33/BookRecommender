A bestselling first collection of humorous and insightful essays by a luminary of the women's liberation movementThese essays from Gloria Steinem's first three decades of work offer a portrait of a woman who was not only one of the savviest leaders of the women's liberation movement, but also a profoundly humane thinker with a wide-ranging intellect and irresistible wit. In "If Men Could Menstruate," Steinem engages readers in a flight of imagination as incisive as it is hilarious. She offers first-person journalism in her underground expos"e" "I Was a Playboy Bunny," provides heartbreaking memoir in the story of her mother's struggles in "Ruth's Song," and stakes important positions in feminist theory in "Erotica vs. Pornography." This is Steinem at her most provocative--and most compassionate.
