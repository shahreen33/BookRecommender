A land of death and shadow where only the strongest survive. Yet that is where Caim must go to follow the mystery at the heart of his life. Armed only with his knives and his companions, he plunges into a world of eternal night where the sun is never seen and every hand is turned against him.

He must face the Shadow's Master. With this novel, Jon Sprunk brings his action-packed trilogy to an epic conclusion.
