Benkyo Tamaoki updates a Vietnam War-era anime story to present-day Japan. The immortal Saya returns -- still clad in her trademark sailor suit and armed with an ancient Samurai sword -- to continue her holy war against the vampiric Chiropterans. Like Buffy the Vampire Slayer in tone but with graphic violence, this book is recommended for mature readers.
