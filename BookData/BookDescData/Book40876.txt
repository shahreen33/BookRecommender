"Everyone knows a rancher in possession of a large spread needs a wife."  Lacy Williams is a USA Today bestselling author of the acclaimed Wyoming Legacy and Cowboy Fairytales series.  About Cowboy Pride:  First impressions count.  Liza Bennett has two missions in life: keep the family’s shop afloat, and ensure her shy sister finds love. Sparks fly when she meets rancher Rob Darcy at a town dance, but when she overhears him insult her, she vows to put the man out of her mind. Rob Darcy is instantly attracted to the vivacious Liza but a lack of social graces and the promise he’s keeping ruin his chances of winning her.  Once jilted, Janie Bennett is appropriately gun-shy of falling in love again. But she doesn't seem to be able to help herself when she meets charming Nathan Bingley. Bingley desperately wants a wife and family of his own. Can he trust that Janie returns his feelings?  When Janie is injured in a spring storm, she and Liza are sequestered on Nathan’s ranch. Hearts and emotions get tangled, but will first impressions prove true, or false?  
  Cowboy Pride is a Wild West version of Pride and Prejudice with dual love stories.
