'A worthy successor to '1984' and 'Brave New World'' - PLAYBOY What would I do for eternal life? Discoveries made within our lifetime will allow people to remain young forever. There is no more death. Our children will never die. Welcome to a world inhabited by people who are perfectly healthy, beautiful and eternally young. Every utopia has its shadowy backstreets.

Someone has to make people forget their animal instincts and live in a fitting way for immortals. Maybe that someone is me? The utopia "FUTU.RE" is the first novel after five years' silence from Dmitry Glukhovksy, author of the cult novel "METRO 2033." The author's books have been translated into dozens of foreign languages, selling in millions of copies, and have been adapted for the big screen in Hollywood - but none of them will grip you like "FUTU.RE"
