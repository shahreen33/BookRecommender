PRESSED ON ALL SIDES by a seemingly omnipotent being called the Rhetor and chased by desperados, the protagonists of The Whirlwind in the Thorn Tree are led across the desert to confront their mysterious antagonist by the Outlaw King himself, the wizened gunslinger Normand Kaliburn.  When one of their own is captured and taken beyond the Wildlands to the heart of the Antargata K-Setra, our heroes will learn the true origins of Ed Brigham's fantasy world... and that incredible revelation will shatter everything they thought they knew about the secret world of Destin.  Inspired by the wainscot and portal classics he grew up with, S. A. Hunt's The Outlaw King series is a visionary epic that will dive into the metaphysical center of what it means to create...and what it means to destroy. Join our protagonists as they go from modern-day Earth to the sands of an exotic parallel world, where a climactic battle will take place on the shores of consciousness...and challenge the rules of the written word itself.
