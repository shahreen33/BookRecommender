The Sweetest Temptation. . . Davis Strong has no business lusting after the new director of the Youth Center his aunt has hired. But who can resist a woman named Candy? He wants to make love to her luscious lips, caress her smooth and creamy skin, and savor her mocha-colored body. Only then will he get the dessert he's been waiting for--a taste of her sweet, hot center. . . Sinfully Delicious. . . It isn't fair that one man should consume her thoughts the way Davis Strong does. But no man does it for her like this one. At night, alone in her bed, Candy dreams about her lover, lying beneath his rock hard body, naked and exposed, begging him to touch her, to taste her, to fill her. It's the ultimate sexual fantasy and Candy's ready for the real thing. . . "A scrumptious page turner. . .a must-read author!" --Jaid Black
