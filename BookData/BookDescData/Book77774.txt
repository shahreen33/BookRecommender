Group Chat spans genres from sci-fi to slice-of-life; from westerns to witchy shenanigans to coming-of-age stories. These comics —feeling good about your body after a mastectomy, two friends supporting each other through the creation of a trans fashion line, learning to appreciate your best friend's chucklehead boyfriend, and others—were carefully chosen for their humor, heart, and beauty from a wide range of up-and-coming creators."A warm and lovely collection, brimming with up-and-coming talent" - Kelly Sue DeConnick, Pretty Deadly &amp; Bitch Planet"A delightful collection of the cutest possible takes about an overlooked but powerful force. The unhesitatingly relatable stories in Group Chat are sure to remind you of a friendship you hold dear." - Kim Hoang, Love Love Hill"Group Chat is like a silhouette slowly revealing itself as a best friend you haven't spoken to in entirely too long. Fix that, if you don't have the courage yet, Group Chat has just the spell to cast." - Adam Smith, Long Walk to ValhallaCover by Victoria Grace Elliot
