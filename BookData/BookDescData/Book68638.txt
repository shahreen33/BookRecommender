The heart of the Trojan War belongs to the women. Mothers and daughters; wives and war prizes, whisper to us across time... ...remember our songs alongside the mighty men of myth.  As the Age of Heroes wanes, the gods gamble more fiercely with mortals’ lives than they ever have before. Women must rely on their inner strength and cunning to survive the wars men wage for gold and glory.  Clytemnestra of Mycenae struggles for control of her life after Agamemnon ruthlessly rips it apart. Leda of Sparta survives a brutal assault by Zeus, shouldering a terrible secret in silence. Penelope raises Ithaka’s sole heir alone, praying for Odysseus’ swift return. Thetis, the sea nymph, despairs of her son’s destiny and resorts to forbidden magic to save him. Hecuba of Troy mourns the loss of her second son to a dark prophesy. And Shavash of Pedasus prepares her daughter to marry the greatest warrior who ever lived.  In a world where love leads to war and duty leads to destruction, the iron hearts of heroines will conquer all.  Sing, Muse, sing their song of sacrifice...
