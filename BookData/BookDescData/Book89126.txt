    “Oh, sweetheart. I beg to differ.”
  
Aiden is a hell hound, and he is on fire. For fifty agonizing years, he’s burned for his anamchara- his fated mate - and his untouchable best friend...Branna is a púca - vile and monstrous in her natural form - or so she’s been told. Aiden is the only fae in fifteen hundred years who’s convinced her she might have something beautiful to offer.But a curse laid down by another man - centuries before Aiden drew first breath - has kept them apart!
  
    So now, after fifty years of this torture, it’s time for drastic measures...
  
If Aiden can’t change the past, he’ll save Branna’s future - even if he can’t be a part of it!
  
    Sometimes a hell hound is worth more dead than alive!
