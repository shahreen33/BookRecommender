 You Don’t Choose The Academy. The Academy Chooses You.   Being accepted into an elite school of magic, monsters, and assassins was not my idea of higher education. But here I am, fighting my way through the Culling Trials to claim my right to be taught.  As if the gauntlet-type physical and mental tests aren’t enough, people are going missing.  People that are my friends.  In a dangerous world where no one is as they seem, the golden rule is simple: Trust no one. They think we should just look out for ourselves. That we should leave the fallen behind and ask no questions.  They clearly think we’re idiots. I got this far by trusting my instincts, and I’m not going to back down now.  Those kids won’t be left to die.  Not on my watch.  Shadowspell Academy Book 1 and Shadowspell Academy Book 2 end with a cliffhanger  Book 3 will release June 11, 2019
