Enjoy this sweet romance by best-selling author, Taylor Hart. Logan Slade, quarterback for the Los Angelos Wave, likes being the center of the press, likes having his movie star fiancée vlog about their crazy life, and likes letting everyone on his team know he’s the top dog. When he takes a hit during a practice scrimmage that puts him in a coma, he never would have expected to wake up and not remember the last eight years of his life.  The tenacious and recently divorced, Paris Ford, couldn’t believe her high school sweetheart would utter her name on national television right before going into a coma. They’d been over a long time and even though her event planning company works for him, she doesn’t want or need him in her life. Too bad he shows up at her grandfather’s old cabin—the one she’s hiding out in--and too bad he kisses her. Good thing she slaps him and tells him to go away.  Logan’s never been good at taking no for an answer and after spending a night in the boat house, he finally convinces her—with a bit of blackmail—to help him remember his life. After all, he still loves her and should be married to her. He needs answers and she’s the only one who can give them to him.  When the trip down memory lane becomes more complicated then either of them could have expected, they have to make a choice—let go of the past or try one last ‘hail mary.’
