A high-society wedding planner, a hunky best man, and an enchanted elevator… who can resist An Irish Flirtation?  Jillian Baxter has worked hard to build her event planning business, and this wedding is proof that she’s made it. The problem? The bride redefines bridezilla. After months of work, Jillian now has three weeks to move a huge society wedding from New York to an Irish castle. Luckily, Castle Tullamore Hotel is available. Although… it’s a bit odd. When Jillian arrives and meets the groom’s brother, Fin, it’s almost like magic steps in. She knows bridezilla would never stand for fraternization, but despite doing her best to keep her distance, Jillian finds herself unable to resist Fin… especially in that damn elevator!  Author’s Note: This is a revamped, substantially longer version of an earlier book, and is available as part of the Emerald Isle Enchantment boxed set.
