Are your students engaged and motivated to read and write but hesitant during math instruction? Do you want your students to be as excited about math as they are about literacy? This unique resource explores how best practices for teaching reading and writing can help you become a better math teacher. Drawing on the work of such educators as Richard Allington, Carl Anderson, Marilyn Burns, Cathy Fosnot, Stephanie Harvey, Heidi Hayes Jacobs, Ellin Keene, and Diane Snowball, the author describes strategies that work in teaching literacy and how to successfully implement them in the math class.
