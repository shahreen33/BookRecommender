In this second new LUCIFER edition, the Lightbringer is hard at work on a New Creation outside the bounds of any authority but his own, complete with a new pair of inhabitants for a new Garden of Eden. But as he tries his hand at universe building, back on Earth (and in Hell) schemes and betrayals continue to grow. And in the tale NIRVANA, a beautiful angel with an ancient score to settle puts out a contract on Lucifer Morningstar. But can the Devil really die? Collects LUCIFER #14-28 and LUCIFER: NIRVANA.
