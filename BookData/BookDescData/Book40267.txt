Long out of print, Jeff Lemire's Xeric-Award-winning LOST DOGS now returns in a newly remastered edition, soaked with blood and ink. This 104-page mythic yarn follows a family man who's larger than life... but even he may not be powerful enough to prevent the loss of everything he's ever known.Bold, brutal, and emotionally raw, LOST DOGS represents an acclaimed storyteller's first professional work -- an early exhibition of the gifts that have made his ESSEX COUNTY and SWEET TOOTH so phenomenally popular. -- A full-color 104-page graphic novel, 6.5" x 9"
