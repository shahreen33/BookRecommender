Molly has everything she needs: a German Shepherd named Dolly and a plot of land to live out her dream life. Despite what the handsome — but slightly uptight — new neighbor may think, she’s perfectly within her rights to operate her canine day care business as she pleases. House-flipper Daniel has big plans for his newly-acquired property, and those plans do not include butting up against a quirky — but adorable — lady who seems to have more dogs than she can handle. This enemies-to-lovers story has a hard-working alpha male and a feisty, independent heroine whose story is full of furry friends, danger, surprises, and plenty of panty-melting heat. Get ready to fall in lust and then in love with Molly and Daniel!  Due to graphic sexual content, this book is appropriate for adults ages 18 and over, please!
