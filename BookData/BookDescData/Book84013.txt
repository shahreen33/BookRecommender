The Eleventh Edition of this popular casebook provides a framework for studying both the essential and the cutting-edge issues of civil procedure while incorporating problems that test doctrinal understanding, foster case reading skills, and encourage a sense of litigation strategy. New Supreme Court cases have been integrated that impact personal jurisdiction (McIntyre, Goodyear), subject-matter jurisdiction (Grable, Gunn), pleading (Twombly, Iqbal), joinder (Pimentel), class actions (Dukes), and other important topics, including statutory changes such as the Jurisdiction Clarification Act. The casebook covers all of the major topics that a professor might wish to teach in a first-year course, and can easily be adapted for courses of one- or two-semesters, of different credit hours, and with varied practical or theoretical emphases. A supplement includes all updated Federal Rules, the pleadings in Twombly and Iqbal, a model case file, state materials, and other important teaching tools.
