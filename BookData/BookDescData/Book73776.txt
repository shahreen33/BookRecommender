“Keep your eyes open, Gnaeus, and don’t fall asleep. You’ve just made your enemy more powerful than yourself.”  79 BCE. Gnaeus Pompey, recently returned to Rome in triumph, has almost singlehandedly brought the civil war to a standstill. As the memory of Gaius Marius begins to slowly fade, another war has begun to rage within Rome's own streets and far to the west.  Hailed as Great by his own loyal soldiers, Pompey's elders still have their doubts. With his age and Rome's elite politicians working against him, will he follow the course set for him or continue to carve a path of significance by his own means?  Spanning two continents and the violent sea between them, Triumphator is the second book in Robert Allen Johnson's awe inspiring MAGNUS trilogy.
