Alison Freeman met Keene Marshall because of a dare she wholeheartedly regrets accepting. As her family's corporate lawyer, Alison discards the idea of love as quickly as she negotiates contracts. Brutally. She realizes she's been a fool over Keeneâ€”who is now intimately embedded in her family. It only adds to the enormity of emotions churning inside about her life. Keene Marshall is arrogant enough to know his time with Alison left a lasting impression. He has yet to determine what place she's going to hold in his life, but he knows there will be one. They burn too hot for there not to be. Having closed himself off from his humanity for so long, finding Alison again presents its own set of challenges. Keene struggles with everything from his family to the walls Alison persistently builds between them. And he can't handle the emotions that come with being denied what he wants. Alison's wary of Keene. Something is holding her back, except every time his lips touch hers, she's flung into the race of her life for the one thing she claims she never wanted to win.***Although set in the same world as Free to Dream, this is a standalone, contemporary romance with dark and suspenseful undertones***
