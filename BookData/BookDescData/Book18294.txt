Unknown is in prison for fraud. Ambiguous is in prison for murder. And Stud is in prison for, well, no one really knows for sure. To pass the time, the prisoners tell stories to each other. They do this to avoid going insane. The facts and fictions often get misconstrued with each inmate attempting to one up each other so that his story is the most dynamic of them all. Whether the story is about stalking, pedophiles or throat chlamydia, each tale plays some role in the healing process. When each prisoner bails the water from his toilet bowl the result is a communication system through the drainpipes. Nobody really knows who is telling the story, if the story is true and what the story actually means. The one certain is Unknown, the unofficial leader of this band of degenerates, who convinces each inmate to accept his action because the crime resulted in much needed legislation such as Amber Alert. But, as time progresses, even Unknown begins to question his stories. The ending will shock and surprise you; it will make you feel sorry for these prisoners.
