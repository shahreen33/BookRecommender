I began to think that perhaps the time had comeforme to turn my paws to a book of my own .... one that tells myown tale ..... How I was rescued from a fate too grisly tocontemplate,to become constant companion to a man who is not onlyone of the worlds greatest spiritual leaders and a Nobel PeacePrize laureate, but who is also a dab hand with the canopener.

In her exotic new home, theDalai Lamas cat encounters Hollywood stars, Buddhist masters,Ivy-league professors, famous philanthropists, and a host of otherpeople who come visiting His Holiness. Each encounter offers afresh insight into finding happiness and meaning in the midst ofalife of busy-ness and challenge.
