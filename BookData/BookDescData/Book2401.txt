There's no doubt about it, the Cure Hotel situated on the outskirts of Manhattan is one of the most run down establishments in the whole of America. This is a hotel that not only boasts dampness, poor decoration and lighting, but also welcomes the most sinister type of overnight guest. Shady loners, men with prostitutes, bosses and their assistants - It all takes place under this roof, where although fornicating in this manner is frowned upon in the hotel industry, a blind eye is always turned at the Cure.This is receptionist Christina's story, just seven days before the grand re-opening of the newly refurbished building â€“ In the single week it took an innocent act of voyeurism to turn the place into the murderous hell hole it was always destined to become. A gripping thriller, with a horrifying twist, where the dark sexual past of this tarnished building, can't be fixed by the new owner, who simply hasn't got the Cure in his blood.
