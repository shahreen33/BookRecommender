On August 31st 1977, normal life ended for the harper family - Mum (divorced) and her two sons and two daughters. It began with a bang on the walls of their modest two-storey council house in a quiet corner of Enfield. The banging went on. A chest of drawers came in and searched the house. So did the police. A chair moved in front of a police constable...Guy Lyon Playfair was involved with the Enfield Poltergeist case - the most exhaustively investigated and varied poltergeist case in the annals of psychical research. He lives in London.
