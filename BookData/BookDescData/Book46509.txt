Contains two stories: Napoleonder, and The Napoleon of the People. First published in 1902. To the anthropologist and the student of human nature the stories are extremely valuable as self-revelations of national character; and even to the historian and the biographer they have some interest as evidences of the profoundly deep impression made by Napoleon's personality upon two great peoples - the Russians and the French.The Napoleon of the People was originally published in 1833 in The Country Doctor (Le Medicin de Campagne). It is a story told by Goguelat, an ex-soldier who served under Napoleon to a bunch of peasants.
