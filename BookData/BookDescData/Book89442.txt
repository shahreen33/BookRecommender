A Jessica Christ short story.  Beaches be crazy.  Fifteen-year-old Jessica McCloud is taking her first trip to the gulf coast. With her mother behind the wheel, the two set out to visit Grandma McCloud, who neither has seen in eleven years, at her condo on the beach. Would it be too much if Jessica hoped for a relaxing vacation despite God's incessant footnotes, her mother's inability to let the past be the past, and a healthy fear of wearing a bikini in public? Probably so, but she's going to give it a shot anyway. This story takes place between The Beginning and And It Was Good. Reading The Beginning prior to this story is highly suggested.   From the author: All author royalties from this short story will be donated to charities helping with Hurricane Harvey relief efforts (charities will vary month-to-month based upon needs of victims).
