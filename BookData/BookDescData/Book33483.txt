This second standalone graphic novel based on the film series is a new adventure that takes place shortly after the events in How to Train Your Dragon 2, during the period in which Hiccup is desperately trying to fill his father's role as the chief of Berk. Created with the help of the film's writer, director, and producer, Dean DeBlois, it bridges the gap between the second and third films.Hiccup, Toothless, and the rest of the dragon riders encounter two deadly yet mysteriously linked threats: One is an island consumed by Dragonvine, an uncontrollable force of nature that's poisonous to humans and deadly to dragons. The other is an all-new, all-terrifying dragon species--the web-spitting Silkspanners!
