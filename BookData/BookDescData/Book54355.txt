Aaron She was supposed to remain in the past. A past I worked long and hard to forget. I run a multi-billion dollar company. I am at the top of my game. I didn’t have time for petty memories and silly indulgences like love. Making deals and taking names in the boardroom were what fueled me. But one night everything came flooding back. There she was, just like she was waiting for me. Oh, she was pissed, upon seeing me, but that wouldn’t keep me from touching her, or taking what has always belonged to me. When our worlds collided again, soon after, I discovered another secret she’d been keeping from me. Now, I’m not willing to let her walk away.  Patience I didn’t walk away. I was pushed away by his secrets. I wasn’t sticking around to find out his reasons either. I left the city I grew up in to keep my distance from him after his final act of betrayal. I fought every day not to think of him. It was hard, but I managed to make a life for myself. But one trip for a work conference and I was putty in his arms again. Whatever, it was just one night. I could go on with my life as I had been. That is, until a call came that beckoned me back home. Another run in with Aaron, this time leading him to discover my secret, and now I’m forced to make an impossible decision. Be his, or else.
