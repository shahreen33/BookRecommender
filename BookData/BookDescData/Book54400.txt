What’s done in the dark…  Murderer is a title she never expected to wear. Friend? Sure. Boss? Hell yes. But murderer? Never. If only she hadn’t threatened exactly that, just before someone winds up dead, and her fingerprints are all over the murder weapon. Always comes to light…  All he wanted was to live a quiet life, without all the danger and darkness of his past. Those plans are blown when he’s accused of a crime he has nothing to do with, leaving him with a hard decision… remain in the shadows, or do what he can to help a friend?  When other crimes start stacking up – the handiwork of an anonymous suspect with an unknown vendetta, they’ll discover something that flips their worlds upside down…  A murder accusation may be the least of their worries.
