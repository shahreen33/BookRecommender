Caught between desire and a promise…Seth Compton knew from the first that his boss’s daughter was all wrong for him. She was too feisty, too damned independent and, at seven years his junior, too damned young. When she comes home with a college diploma and fiancé on her arm, though, he can’t quite remember all the reasons he held her at arm’s length. It’s not just his jeans-tightening reaction to her all-grown-up curves. Something doesn’t feel right about her impending marriage, and he won’t rest until he’s stopped her from making the biggest mistake of her life. The morning after her wild bachelorette party, Jody expected a hangover. The surprise? Waking up tied to a bed with sexy-as-sin Seth. He’s got some wild idea about proving they belong together, but she’s not buying it. Besides, she has a promise to keep that’s too close to her heart to risk, especially not with a man who, until now, made his disinterest plain. No one ever said Seth backed down from a challenge. She’s going to make him work for it? No problem. Luckily for him, he has plenty of rope…
