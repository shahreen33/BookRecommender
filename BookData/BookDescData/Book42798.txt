On a dark winter's night, a poor beggar arrives in town and wanders from house to house seeking food and shelter. But the townspeople--who don't think they have anything to give--prove tobe as cold as wheather. Even the caretaker in the synagogue turns him away. Undaunted, the beggar removes five bone buttons from his threadbare coat and announces that he can make a delicious soup--enough to feed the whole town--with just one more button.
