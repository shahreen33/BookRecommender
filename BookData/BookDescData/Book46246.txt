This much-needed book makes the latest research in autism accessible to practitioners and parents. The contributors, leading practitioners representing a wide range of those fields whose members work with people with autism, show how knowledge gained through clinical practice, parenting experience and academic research can be brought together to meet the individual needs of a child with an autism spectrum condition. By tackling key issues - such as diagnosis and treatment, education, language development, family relationships and social experiences - and exploring the needs of both professionals and family members, the authors demonstrate how cutting-edge research can be used to help the individual child.
