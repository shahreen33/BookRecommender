It's a scary-good new direction for the Emerald Archer in this, the first volume from acclaimed horror novelist Benjamin Percy (Red Moon, The Dead Lands)!Oliver Queen is back in Seattle and he's not only got to keep the city safe, he's also got to look out for his half-sister Emiko, who's now under his guardianship. But balancing the life of a superhero and a family man is hard when horrifying threats like the mysterious Night Birds are snatching people out of the sky at random. Green Arrow must find out whether the Night Birds are indeed monsters from above, or if there's something even bigger and even more terrifying behind their sudden appearance in the Emerald City.Collecting: Green Arrow 41-44, Annual 1, Sneak Peek
