Beasts roar! Beasts destroy! But not Maurice.This frightfully unbeastly tale about staying true to yourself is for everyone who’s just a little bit different.   With his melodious voice, fondness for kale, and unfailing politeness, Maurice isn’t quite like other beasts. So his concerned Mama and Papa send their ridiculously photogenic beastie to the Abominable Academy for Brutish Beasts to learn how to behave badly. Will Maurice master growling, scowling, snarling, and howling? Or will he prove that being different is a good thing after all?
