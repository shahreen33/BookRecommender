 
  Some stories can kill...
  Italian director Nicolo Funelli's lost film comes alive when the maven of the macabre is released after twenty years of VHS imprisonment. New hire Annie Watkins's pre-emptive obituaries at Live @ 5 New Orleans News seem to be killing off famous people. A used delivery van causes Katie and Gavin's lives to take an unimaginable wrong turn into very dark territory. A teen orphan with a unique ability is held captive in a secret government lab, forced to submit to their whims. Vacationers become a grotesque part of the Easter festivities in a small English town.  These are just a handful of the 16 dark tales that await you in Video Nasties. Tune in, sit back, and turn up the terror. But don't touch that dialâ€¦ it just might kill you.
