The pack is coming out of the shadows—but some of its shifters don’t know how to live anywhere else.  Fallon grew up on the street. She’s a survivor, and her skills kept her pack alive in the darkest of times. Now the sun is coming out, and she has no idea how to be a bird who lives in the light. She’ll do anything to help her baby pack get there, though.  Even if it means returning the shinies she stole from a polar bear.  “Unique and joyous fantasy as no one else writes it.” ~ Amazon reviewer
