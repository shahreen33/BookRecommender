At the Academy of the Gods, winner takes all and the games are about to begin.  The name’s Kore, daughter of Demeter, crown goddess of spring, but you can call me Kory.  Along with my invitation to attend the elite Olympus Academy where all the top deities send their brats for training, comes the news that I’m betrothed to Hades, tall, dark and brooding god of the underworld.  I’d much rather be Queen Bee of my girl gang back home, slinging Panaceas to spoiled rich Olympians, but I have three years to enjoy my life before I’m ruling the denizens of hell at Hades’ side and I refuse to waste it making him look good.  Turns out, my betrothed has a gang of his own. The Triad, made up of Hades, Loki and Fenrir, rules the school and they expect me to bow down like everyone else.  Sure, Janus. Cue eyeroll.  The three of them share everything, and when I humiliate Hades my first night at the Academy by making the tiniest immortal faux pas, their lust turns to cruelty and they start to edge in on my side hustle, but that’s fine with me. Four can play at that game.  This is the first book in the Academy of the Gods series, a Paranormal Bully Academy Romance retelling of Hades and Persephone. Slow burn, all characters are 18+.
