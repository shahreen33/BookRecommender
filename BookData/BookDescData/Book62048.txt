Pricing drives three of the most important elements of firm success: revenue and profits, customer behavior, and firm image. This book provides an introduction to the basic principles for thinking clearly about pricing. Unlike other marketing books on pricing, the authors use a more analytic approach and relate ideas to the basic principles of microeconomics. Rakesh Vohra and Lakshman Krishnamurthi also cover three areas in greater depth and provide more insight than may be gleaned from existing books: 1) the use of auctions, 2) price discrimination, and 3) pricing in a competitive environment.This book presumes a familiarity with what is typically covered in the quantitative core of a major MBA program. It requires the willingness to pursue logical arguments, some mathematical, to their conclusion. The reward for the effort is a clear understanding of the factors to consider in setting price, the conditions under which different pricing methods are optimal, and how to set prices under competition.
