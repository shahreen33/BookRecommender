Warren, Nathan, Sloan and the rest of the Soul Summoner crew are back in book 7 of the Soul Summoner series.  Warren Parish is literally about to go to hell and back to protect his daughter, but first he must save her from an even closer danger—Heaven.   The Council of angels has decreed Iliana must be brought to Eden to be made a seraph—an angel frozen as a child. And though it means Warren can finally be with her, she will never grow up. She will never access her power. And she will never have the life he sacrificed everything to give her.  Time is running out. He has until her first birthday to bring her to Eden. If not, the guardians will be sent for her, and he will be stripped of his birthright as the Archangel and lose his daughter forever.
