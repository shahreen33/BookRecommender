In honor of national poetry month, during the month of April, poets across the globe participate in an activity called "30 for 30." It involves writing 1 poem for every day of the month. In 2015, Rudy Francisco decided to take on the challenge. After the task was completed, he published the poems in the form of a chapbook and chose to call it "No Gravity."
