"In 'Steamboat Gothic' Mrs. Keyes tells not only the story of the great Louisiana plantations, but of the river which contributed so largely to their prosperity, their prestige and their splendor. Plantations and the river, and the loves and lives of the men and women who peopled them come alive in a superb novel which is all the more truly a great contribution to Americana because it is a great love story."
