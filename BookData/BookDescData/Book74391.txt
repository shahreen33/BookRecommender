Meet Eric. He is a seventeen-year-old loner who finds joy in the colour black. In Eric's life, bullying and suicidal thoughts are washed down with a daily dose of over the counter medication. He doesn’t want to die, but can’t stand life at home with his overweight, abusive mother, and drunk and disorderly stepfather - who has a passion for applying bruises - for a moment longer. Thankfully his brother, Ethel, will be home in 16 days to rescue him from Grey Hills – the town with a population of around a thousand. He can’t wait to eat popcorn and view the car accident footage the two of them recorded to watch on replay each Friday night. Eric notices the unusual things in life; metal rods that help shape an umbrella, and a small stain on the bedroom carpet fibres just to name a couple. He doesn't like folding washing but does enjoy the random gold coin that appears mysteriously each morning. Eric knows his individualism doesn't exactly make him popular among the town’s people, but has never really understood their hatred towards him. That is until he is introduced to a unique character that may understand his unfortunate existence more than he does. A Beautiful Black is a dark, poetic, misunderstood story that will leave your heart fluttering and cheeks blushing into the early hours of the morning. A book for the different people in this world. A book for the people who don’t have the luxury of calling someone a friend. A book to change the way you look at the world and the people living in it.
