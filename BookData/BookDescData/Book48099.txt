Told from the perspective of a remora named Fishmael, who is traveling with his mentor, a wise and beautiful marlin known as the "Old Fish, " "Blue Road to Atlantis" intertwines a spiritual parable with Hemingway's classic The Old Man and the Sea. The result is a lighthearted yet moving allegory about leading a more fulfilling life. By setting forth the idea that the quest for a higher vision and the acceptance of life's currents brings true peace and happiness, this contemporary tale becomes a profound meditation that is as entertaining as it is transformational.
