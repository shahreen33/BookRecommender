Healer Merys Thranion has been trained to fight disease and wage war against ignorance. Her training comes to the ultimate test when she is captured by slave traders in a neighboring country and brought to the estate of Lord Shaine. Her task is to heal the brooding lord's injured daughter...but that is only the first of her trials. As the deadly plague raises its head again and threatens to wipe out everyone on Lord Shaine's estate, Merys must summon all her skills to protect those she has come to care for...including the man who has become much more to her than simply her master.
