Greed. Jealousy. Lust.   It all started with a bloody palm and a promise. Words beneath the moonlight that I thought would keep us together. Forever.   Deceit. Betrayal. Vengeance.   I didn’t see it coming. I didn’t think you had it in you. But what was supposed to bury me—break me—simply remade me as something new. Something hellbent on ruining you, my love.   *This book is a complete stand-alone based on the classic The Count of Monte Christo*
