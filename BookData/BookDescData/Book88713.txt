This is the inspirational story of life as a nurse during the 1970s at Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital. Susan Macqueen was 12 years old when she accompanied her mother to see her friend Ms. Fairweather, the matron at the local nursing home, and from that day on she knew she wanted to be a nurse. A few years later, despite being told that her grades weren't good enough, Susan was accepted on the three-year nurses training course at Addenbooke's hospital in Cambridge. It wasn't long before Susan knew she wanted to work with children and set her sights on a job at Great Ormond Street. Thirty-five years later, on her third attempt, Susan has finally retired from that iconic hospital and is enjoying a more leisurely pace of life. Hope, despair, laughter, and tears, Susan's stories move the reader through the incredible stories that she was faced with on an every day basis.
