It's been a few months since the end of our first series, THE PRIVATE EYE and Brian, Marcos and Muntsa are back and proud to present the first issue of their newest effort, BARRIER! This unconventional drama about violence, language and illegal immigration is planned as a 5 part story. We hope you'll like it enough to help us get there!As usual you can pick up this oversized 52 page comic-book for whatever price you want to pay at www.panelsyndicate.com.
