CRUDE. ARROGANT. A**HOLE.No doubt about it, Sebastian ‘Oz’ Osborne is the university’s most celebrated student athlete—and possibly the biggest douchebag. A walking, talking cliché, he has a filthy mouth, a fantastic body, and doesn’t give a sh*t about what you or anyone else thinks. SMART. CLASSY. CONSERVATIVE.Make no mistake, Jameson Clarke may be the university’s most diligent student—but she is no prude. Spending most of her time in the hallowed halls of the library, James is wary of pervs, jocks, and douchebags—and Oz Osborne is all three.She’s smart, sarcastic—and not what he expected.  …EVERY DOUCHBAG HAS HIS WEAKNESS.He wants to be friends.He wants to spend time with her.He wants to drive her crazy.He wants…Her.
