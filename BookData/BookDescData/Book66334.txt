Ethan hasn't been assigned to guard a client since crossing paths with the Las Vegas mafia, so he's eager to take on the talk of the city: the Slot Bandit. Rob Rexum is a man on the win streak of a lifetime. He needs a bodyguard to keep away the hordes of people who are desperate for a touch of his luck or a charitable handout. But he also wants Ethan to play his boyfriend in a strange ploy to get revenge on his ex-wife. Maxmillian Poole doesn't like it and suspects there's something more to Rexum's story. But with Ethan pressuring him to work, Max relents, and immediately wishes he didn't when issues of wealth and infidelity threaten to drive a wedge between him and Ethan.
