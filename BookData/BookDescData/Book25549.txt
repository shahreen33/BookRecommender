Letters Between Us is a powerful story of search for self, identity, of losing a friend and finding her in a deeper sense, and through her, making discoveries and gaining insights. Overman grips you with intimate, startling details so that you can't stop reading until you have reached the last page.  Nahid Rachlin, author, Persian Girls and Jumping Over Fire  Linda Overman's Letters Between Us is a clever, intricate, powerful novel, a tale of girls gone wild amidst the sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll of the Sixties and of the women they become. The story of Katharine and Laura-electrified with the possibilities of youth, grounded in the accommodations of adulthood, charged with the irony and tragedy-would be hard to forget even if simply told. But Overman is an artist, brave and skilled enough to put the pen in her characters' hands and let them write their own story of hope and disappointment, passion and desire. That makes Letters unforgettable. David Bradley, author, South Street and The Chaneysville Incident  Cutting edge. A rarity. In an era of male "buddy" sagas, a story of a deeply tender relationship between two women-only one of which is a survivor-in a time and place hard to navigate: late 20th century America. Their strong voices, both tough and tender, gutsy and sweet, compel us to listen. Read this book.
