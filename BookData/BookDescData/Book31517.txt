Sometimes the shortest distance between ruin and restoration, between lies and truth, is the long way.  Damon Fitzpatrick’s life is in ruins. Vilified as the pilot responsible for the plane crash that killed Levi and Charlotte Seaver, Damon lost everything – his reputation, his livelihood, his family, and his future. And Damon knows exactly who to blame - none other than powerful Senator Emmett Shaw, the criminal mastermind behind the crash. No matter how long it takes, Damon is determined to get justice, and to get his life back.  Cain Shaw is the poster child for success. As the young, rich, handsome son of a picture-perfect family and the face of his father’s conservative political campaign, he has a bright future ahead of him. But the senator has been hiding secrets that threaten to crack that flawless facade - secrets he’s killed to protect. Cain is determined to make sure no one else gets hurt, even if it means keeping his own long-held secret.  When Damon’s quest for justice goes awry, Cain becomes the older man's unlikely savior, and the two are thrown together in a hunt for evidence that will free them both. But as the road gets longer, the stakes get higher, and the danger that stalks them draws closer, they must find the strength to trust one another... because the one complication they can’t outrun is each other.
