  It can be a little scary to be small in a big city, but this child has some good advice for a very special friend in need.
When you're small in the city, people don't see you, and loud sounds can scare you, and knowing what to do is sometimes hard. But this little kid knows what it's like, and knows the neighborhood. That makes for some pretty good advice for an even smaller friend.Like, alleys can be good shortcuts, but some are too dark.Or, there are lots of good hiding places in the city, like under a mulberry bush or up a walnut tree.And, if the city is too loud and scary, a small one can always just go back home, where it's safe and quiet.In his first author-illustrated picture book, Sydney Smith tells a contemplative, quiet story from the perspective of a child.
