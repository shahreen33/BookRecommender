TRAUMA HAS A WAY OF LEAVING ITS MARK.It took years to do it, but I can finally look in a mirrorand see more than just the scars.If only that were true for the rest of the world.The whispers, the stares, the pity, they’re familiar now.Except his eyes don’t linger, his demeanor never changes.Maybe that’s why I trust himand take the leap to move in with a virtual stranger.A stranger who might be more scarred than I am.YET NOT ALL SCARS ARE LEFT ON THE SURFACE.The day I got a spot at Sailor’s Grave Tattoo Parlor, I had everything.A roof over my head, an honest living, a few friends.The times when I went without no longer factored.Until she comes into my life.Until I offer her a place to stay.Until she draws me in with that blinding light inside her,and almost makes me forgetto keep the past in the dark where it belongs.
