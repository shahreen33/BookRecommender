 
  We had the hottest hookup ever. And now, she’s having my baby.
   I’m a carefree single guy.  A successful race car driver who enjoys hitting the track—hard.  I don’t do commitments.  Hell, I rarely even do repeats.  Until I spent the night with a gorgeous, funny woman who rocked my world.  No names. No identifying details. Just lots and lots of pleasure.  Until we meet up again at my older brother’s wedding. And guess what, she’s my brand new sister-in-law, Rylee Ford.  And apparently, now she hates me.  Oh, and she’s also pregnant. Surprise, I’m the daddy.  I’m so screwed.  Author’s note: Gage doesn’t start out as a single father... but it sure doesn’t take long for implantation to occur. Pit Stop: Baby is a standalone romantic comedy with a HEA ending and no cliffhanger.
