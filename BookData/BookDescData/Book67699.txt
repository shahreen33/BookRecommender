The conclusion of The Dirty Sweet Duet, begun in Sweet Liar.Dylan Locke knows that pining over the young ingenue Audrey Lind is pointless. He can't offer her what she wants. He definitely can't give her what she needs. Thank goodness she's half a world away, and he doesn't have to deal with his attraction head on.But fate has other plans for him, and when Audrey once again lands in his path, it's only too easy to fall back into their easy rhythm. And then their easy banter. And of course, each other's arms.He tells himself nothing has changed. She still wants forever, and he still thinks tomorrow is long enough. But watching her search isn't as easy as he thought it would be, and now Dylan must figure out if he's really the love Scrooge he professes to be or if he's been Fate's willing victim all along.
