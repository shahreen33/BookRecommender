Ever since Sage walked into church the first Sunday I was delivering my sermon, I knew I was in trouble. When I laid eyes on her, I was hooked. It is forbidden. I shouldn’t WANT her. But I do. I can’t deny it.  My mind is no longer on my sermons. Every moment I spend working on the good, righteous topics I’d like to teach my congregation, all I can think of is teaching Sage how to take all of me.  I need to stay strong. I need to keep my distance. But there’s no way I can resist when she offers herself to me. Even though I’m a priest, I’m a hot-blooded man after all.  *  When I stepped into confession, I knew what I was going to do. I’d planned it for weeks. What I didn’t count on was what happened after.  I’m a bad girl. I’ve always been a bad influence. The naughty girl of the group. But this time, I’m taking it a step further. I’m tempting a man of the cloth. A man with a collar. He’s committed. Married. Taken.  But this time my competition is not another woman.  No.  This time, I want to steal a man from God. Surely that would send me straight to hell. Do I care? Once I’ve felt his touch… not a damn bit!  *This is a very short read! Due to scenes of an adult nature, this is for 18+ ONLY. Taboo novella!
