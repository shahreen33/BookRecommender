They started out as a bunch of immigrant kids from Vietnam who hung out together, yet they evolved into Born to Kill, a savage gang of killers and thugs. The explosive story follows these brutal and heartless criminal terrorists as they penetrate and ravage the close-knit community of Chinatown, and the daring police work that was eventually able to bring them down.
