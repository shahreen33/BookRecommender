I'm entering the endgame.Even as I gain new allies, new gear, and greater understanding of Albertus' true plans, the odds are growing more extreme.Whom can I trust? What is the AI Albertus Magnus trying to accomplish? What happened to archmagus Jeramy, and why is Guthorios massing an undead army so vast that it stretches from horizon to horizon?Any sane player would quit. Any reasonable person would admit defeat.But I've got no choice.I'm going to see this battle through to its bitter end. I'm going to unearth the secrets behind Euphoria Online - or die trying.
