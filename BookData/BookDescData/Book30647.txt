When Lori Sullivan wakes in the hospital with no memories, her first response is panic. Then psychiatrist Dr. Mark Greene shows up in her room, top of the rotation for emergency patients. Mark seems familiar somehow, though he doesn’t seem to know her.  Mark is instantly drawn to this new patient with the strange, beautiful eyes. She’s vulnerable and lost, and he finds himself caught in the position of wanting more than a professional relationship with Lori.  Neither one can see what a relationship between the two of them will lead to, for them or for the planet.
