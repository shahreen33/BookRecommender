“She knelt before me on the shed floor and tugged gently, then harder until finally it came. I moaned with pleasure. Now for the other boot ...” Colin Grey’s life was happy and simple, until the day everything changed — the day his wife read THAT book. Suddenly, he was thrust head-first into a dark, illicit world of pleasure and pain. This is the story of one man’s struggle against a tide of tempestuous, erotic desire and of the greatest love of all: the love between a man and his shed.  WARNING: 'Fifty Sheds of Grey' contains fifty graphic shed-based images.
