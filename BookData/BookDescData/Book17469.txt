Catori has all the odds stacked against her: a loner with mismatched eyes who hates school and just about everybody who goes there. Her ability to see things nobody else does makes her an oddball at school. She accidently boards the wrong bus to school one morning and is transported to a strange parallel world. There’s no way back for her; the bus she boarded doesn't do return trips and she has to figure out her own way back. She discovers that the evil forces over-running this parallel world are tracking her down and have no intention of letting her go home alive. Trusting strangers doesn't come easy to her, but her only hope of escaping her hunters is to follow Miren, a girl she encounters in the public restrooms. They manage to reach a secluded wood where Catori meets up with Otsoa, the only boy who has ever made her feel like she was worthy of love. She must fight another intense battle – she must choose between her loyalty to her friend Miren and her infatuation for Otsoa, the handsome, would-be rock star. The evil forces have zeroed in on them and Catori must fight for her life. What chance does a lone fifteen-year-old girl have to confront those powerful forces? Does she bow to their evil scheme of taking over planet Earth or does she fight them to her last breath?
