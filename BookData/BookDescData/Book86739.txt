Following the global success of blockbuster movie Kingsman: The Golden Circle (starring Channing Tatum and Colin Firth) we launch the sequel to the hit comic-book series by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons. Kingsman: The Red Diamond is a brand new Eggsy adventure as he follows in his mentor's footsteps, but still rough-around-the-edges for a Kingsman agent. In this awesome six-issue volume he embarks on a rescue mission to save Prince Philip and unravel an international terror plot, in a story that starts where James Bond draws the line. Rob Williams (Suicide Squad) and Simon Fraser take the helm for this stunning six-issue mini-series.
