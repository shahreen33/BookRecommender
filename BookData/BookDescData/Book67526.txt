I thought that the hardest thing I would have to face this year would be Trial Month.  Gods, I was naïve.  My name is Luna Moon. Don’t ask me what I am, because complicated doesn’t even begin to cut it. I recently found out that everything I knew to be true has been a lie.  Including who I am.  The goddesses and their chosen Guardians have been keeping a secret, and in the wrong hands, this secret would plunge our worlds into chaos.  We are the only thing that stands in the way of the realms’ greatest evil escaping his eternal prison.  Scratch that, I’M the only thing standing in his way.  Themis’ scales have tipped.  Nobody is safe.  Nothing is as it seems.  No one can be trusted.  ***Author Note*** The Last Vessel is the first book in The Chronicles of Luna Moon series. This will not be your ordinary love story, for they are not your typical heroes. The Last Vessel is a medium-burn reverse harem intended for readers 18 years and over. It contains strong language, violence, and adult themes.  The series also contains overbearing, overprotective, Alpha males who will try anything to keep Luna safe...  I did say ‘try’, right?
