Students love math games and puzzles, but how much are they really learning from the experience? Too often, math games are thought of as just a fun activity or enrichment opportunity. Well Played shows you how to make games and puzzles an integral learning component that provides teachers with unique access to student thinking.   The twenty-five games and puzzles in Well Played, which have all been field-tested in diverse classrooms, contain: •         explanations of the mathematical importance of each game or puzzle and how it supports student learning; •         variations for each game or puzzle to address a range of learning levels and styles; •         clear step-by-step directions; and •         classroom vignettes that model how best to introduce the featured game or puzzle.     The book also includes a separate chapter with suggestions for how to effectively manage games and puzzles in diverse classrooms; reproducibles that provide directions, game boards, game cards, and puzzles; assessment ideas; and suggestions for online games, puzzles, and apps.  Well Played will help you tap the power of games and puzzles to engage students in sustained and productive mathematical thinking.
