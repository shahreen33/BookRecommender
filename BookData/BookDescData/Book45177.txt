Wynn family bonds bend but never break. . . .  “Kelly Jamieson is an auto-buy for me.”—Carly Phillips JP Wynn: I admit, I’ve made some bad choices—on and off the ice. Now all I want to do is show my team I can control my emotions while I’m playing and redeem myself with my family, especially with my brother, Théo. I hate that I hurt him and I’m determined to stay out of trouble.  But the hot bridesmaid at Théo’s wedding is tempting me into another bad decision. A little flirting and a hook up with Taylor seem harmless . . . until Manny Martinez jumps me on the dance floor and starts beating the crap out of me. 
  And just like that I add one more bad decision to my résumé.
   Taylor Hart: I always thought hockey players were hot. Now I think they’re crazy. Manny broke my heart when he got traded to another team and left without even a goodbye. Then he showed up at my best friend’s wedding. All I wanted to do was show Manny that I was over him. And the groom’s sexy brother, JP, seemed more than willing to be my distraction. But after the way everything went down, I want nothing to do with any of them.  Easier said than done. Especially when Lacey’s new brother-in-law is always around. . . . 
  And I keep thinking about the wedding night, when we snuck away to his room for the best sex of my life.
