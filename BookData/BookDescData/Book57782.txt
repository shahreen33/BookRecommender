Multimedia artist Charles Glaubitz delivers his first graphic novel, a work of mythical, pictorial, illustrative, and cosmological components, while combining elements of myth, religion, and spirituality with comics, hermetic ideas, alchemy and science. Light travels through space and brings a prophecy of the awakening of the Crystal Sigil. At the same time, the secret society of Illuminati steals from the four elements to create a new fifth element that has the power to become any object of desire. The ensuing epic battle pits the warrior-like Starseed Children — who are the end result of the evolution of revolution within our system of genetics, philosophy, science, and art — against the Illuminati and their masters, the Annunaki, and the coming of the black darkness.
