Beneath the bloody waters of Crystal Lake, an immortal evil wakes and begins a new cycle of violence. Six months after the events of FREDDY VS. JASON VS. ASH, a power-hungry government bureaucrat unleashes the denizens of the Necronomicon - including the banished spirit of the Springwood Slasher, Freddy Krueger.  The covert government group called Project Black Book is unleashing creatures of mass destruction in its bid to gain control over the Necronomicon. And as the survivors of Freddy and Jason's murder sprees congregate, the short-lived reunion is shattered by the violent arrival of Jason Voorhees. But when a mysterious stranger arrives to aid in the battle, Jason must confront the one man who has not only survived his murderous rampages but has also "killed him" in the past.
