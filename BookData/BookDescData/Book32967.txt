They call me the #DirtyGentleman. My reputation precedes me.I’m forward on the ice and in the bedroomWith a filthy mouth and impressive moves. I always get the job done.I have my future all planned out:Get laid often.Graduate.Land the job of my dreams.Sounds easy. Right?It was until Delaney Dixon burst into my life.Eyes as warm as melted chocolate. A sexy smile. And a pair of Double-Ds that sends men to their knees in gratitude.She’s broken, hiding from a secret past, and refuses to let me in. But just like my game, I never quit.  She gave me one night. But I want forever.
