I have lost everything. My purpose. My love. My soul. Death knocks on my door, I want to answer, but every time I reach for the handle--the promise I made her, brings me back. So I breathe. I live. I hate. And I allow the anger to boil beneath the surface of a perfectly indifferent facade. I am broken, I dont want to be fixed. One last trip to New York, one last chance to redeem a lost part of the mafia family. The Empire is crumbling and it's my job to fix it, my job to mend the pieces that were scattered over thirty years ago. The only issue is, the only way to fix, is to do something I swore I'd never do again. An arranged marriage. Only this time. I won't fall. Or so help me God, I'll kill her myself. My name is Sergio Abandanoto, you think you know my pain, my suffering, my anger, my hate--you have no idea. I am the mafia. I am the darkness. Blood in. No out.
