In this slim volume of poems, Caroline Hagood offers a surreal journey through the fever dream of creativity, exploring what it means to grow up as a woman and poet sensitive to the point of being skinless, walking the line between inspiration and madness daily. Starting from early childhood and moving forward, these poems address gender and trauma, sex and bathroom humor, the misbehaving mind, relationships, and more. A poetâ€™s attempt to transcend suffering through writing, Lunatic Speaks is by turns funny, sad, and, joyous.
