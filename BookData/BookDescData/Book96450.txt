**Don’t miss this riveting final installment to T. S. Joyce’s bestselling Boarlander Bears series.**  Clinton Fuller has been burned by love, but that doesn’t stop him from thinking of his first mate and what could’ve been. And when she blows into town, with no memory of him or what happened to her, he does his best to stop history from repeating itself. He’s harboring a curse—his bear—and he isn’t right for anyone anymore, especially not some fragile human with a bright future and a legitimate shot at happiness. He can’t drag her through the mud with him again, but Alyssa isn’t taking no for an answer. And now, his dominant, broken animal is putting her in more danger than she’s ever been. He can’t get her out of his head, and now he’ll have to convince her to run if she wants to survive what broke them apart all those years ago.  Alyssa Dunleavy is having dreams of a boy who saved her once, but when she lays eyes on Clinton, nothing makes sense anymore. Half of her life has been erased from her memories, and now the stories surrounding her accident are clashing with what she sees. But as she gets to know the standoffish Crazy Clinton of the Boarlanders, it becomes obvious he isn’t the sweet boy from her dreams at all, but a half-crazed monster grizzly shifter who is working through some major life changes. Even though he makes it clear she should stay far away from him for safety’s sake, she can’t help but be drawn to his animal magnetism. And now she’s falling head-over-heels for a stranger keeping a mountain of secrets…or maybe he’s no stranger at all.   Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. Intended for mature audiences.
