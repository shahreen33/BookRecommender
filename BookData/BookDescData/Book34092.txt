When the past meets the present…  King George County, Virginia has it’s share of crime, but it’s generally a good place to live and raise a family. So when a string of violent murders sweeps through the county, J.J. Graves and her husband, Sheriff Jack Lawson, are left scratching their heads.  It’s soon discovered all the victims have a connection—Malachi Graves—J.J.’s father. The world thinks he’s dead, but J.J. knows that’s just another one of his lies.  The problem is the killer might not be her father, but someone staging the crimes to set up Malachi for murder. Which means she and Jack aren’t the only people who know he’s alive.  Guilty or Innocent…it’s time to bring Malachi Graves down once and for all.
