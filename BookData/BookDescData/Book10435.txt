Josephine (Joe for short) and Eric, the EMT crew of Echo 17 have been best friends since they were eight years old. They've been through a lot together over the years, but nothing like what they're about to experience.As the only man in Joe's life it's Eric's job to be there for her and take care of her even while he drives her crazy, especially if he's driving her crazy. There's nothing he wouldn't do for her and when things go south he decides that maybe it's time that Joe moved on, but could he?
