In her comic, scathing essay, "Men Explain Things to Me," Rebecca Solnit took on what often goes wrong in conversations between men and women. She wrote about men who wrongly assume they know things and wrongly assume women don't, about why this arises, and how this aspect of the gender wars works, airing some of her own hilariously awful encounters.She ends on a serious note--because the ultimate problem is the silencing of women who have something to say, including those saying things like, "He's trying to kill me!"This updated edition of the book feature that now-classic essay as well as Solnit's recent essay on the remarkable feminist conversation that arose in the wake of the 2014 Isla Vista killings.
