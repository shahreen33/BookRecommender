‘A is for Apple. A bad apple.’Jack has spent most of his life in juvenile institutions; he's about to be released with a new name, new job, and a new life. At 24, he is utterly innocent of the world, yet guilty of a monstrous childhood crime. To his new friends, he is a good guy with occasional flashes of unexpected violence. To his girlfriend, he is strangely naive and unreachable. To his case worker, he’s a victim of the system and of media-driven hysteria. And to himself, Jack is on permanent trial: he struggles to start from scratch, forget the past, become someone else.At a time when the privacy of the individual is under threat from all sides, BOY A raises fundamental questions about the morality of the media.WINNER OF THE WORLD BOOK DAY - BOOKS TO TALK ABOUT PRIZE 2008WINNER OF THE JOHN LLEWELLYN RHYS PRIZE 2005WINNER OF THE WAVERTON GOOD READ PRIZE 2005
