I’m Eddie Collins, a CSI.Ever had that feeling of being watched but when you turn around no one’s there?I have. It was raining, and I was working a murder scene around midnight when that prickle ran up my spine. If I’d listened to that feeling, if I’d thought back to my past, maybe I could have prevented the terror that was to come.Back at the office, I found a death threat on my desk.I had no idea who sent it or why they wanted to kill me.But I was about to find out.
