Evelyn Notte's had sixteen years to make Elysium her home, but not by choice: she only survived her husband's betrayal by fusing with the ley line beneath the asylum's foundation. Now rumor has it Adam is back to his old tricks, and if Adam's alive maybe there's still a chance for the newborn daughter he stole from Evelyn so many years ago.The only way out of Elysium is the Nightmare buried at its core. Waking him means reigniting a long-stalled war and giving up what little is left of her humanity, but Evelyn's not going to lose her daughter again - and she's sure as hell not going to let Adam walk away a second time.
