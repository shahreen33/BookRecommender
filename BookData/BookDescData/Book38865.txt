I won’t stop until I’m buried deep inside the succulent new-in-town brunette.After being warned about my past, she does her best to steer clear, but I’m about to show her that underneath it all, I’m a guy with a heart of gold and a cock of steel.My name is Hayden Oliver, and this is my story.SCREWED is standalone romantic comedy by New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today bestselling author Kendall Ryan.
