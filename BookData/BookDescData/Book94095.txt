Ben and Bear do everything together. After breakfast, they play hide-and-seek and do tricks to make each other laugh. At night, Ben tells Bear a bedtime story and Bear snuggles with Ben until he falls asleep.	The youngest readers will relate to the loving bond between a little boy and his favorite stuffed animal and how this sweet friendship makes each day special, from morning till night.
