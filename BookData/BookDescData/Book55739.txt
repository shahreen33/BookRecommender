"I've had his address and phone number all this time. I kept track of him.”  Those were the words my mother had said as she handed me the piece of paper that would change my life forever. The one that held my father’s name and address--the same father I’d always been told had died when I was a baby.  Even though my entire life until now, I’ve survived by being tightly-focused and in control, as soon as I learned my father was alive, I made a snap decision. I knew there was only one thing I could do: climb in the car and drive to meet him. The world’s most high-stakes road trip!  What I didn’t know at the time was that things wouldn’t go as planned. My car would break down. Then, the sexiest man I’d ever seen would pull his motorcycle over to rescue me, and I’d be captivated by his eyes and his shoulders, by his strength and calm capability...and that’s when the real adventure would begin.  I’ve survived up until now by insisting on stability, but surviving's not enough for me anymore. With everything on the line, can I learn to truly live by Embracing Reckless?  Stand-alone Someday series romance, complete with HEA--and plenty of heat and heart along the way!
