Our benevolent kindness would lead them to sanity. At first I believed him, but it was not long before I learned of unspeakable acts committed on those lost souls.”—For Their Own GoodAdam’s loyalty to Dr. McFarland is tested by the plight of four female patients committed to the asylum as a result their families’ selfish interests.
