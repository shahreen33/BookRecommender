He's wrong for me in every way.  I'm a fox. He's a wolf. He works with my dad. I'm a college senior. And did I mention he's thirteen years older than me?  With my gun at his door, I saw something I wasn't supposed to see.  I can't shake the feeling that he's fighting something alone, that he needs someone.   I didn't stop to think how much I need him.   
  Falling for the Wolf is a prequel to the upcoming novel, Wolf's Bane, a reverse harem romance and Book 1 in the Shifted Mates trilogy.
