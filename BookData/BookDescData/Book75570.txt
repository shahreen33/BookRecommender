One golden boy... Judd Jackson had it all—star football player with a college scholarship, perfect family, tons of friends, and a beautiful girlfriend. He was the most popular guy in town … until a family secret burned it all to the ground. Now, he’s the object of scorn and ridicule, and the only thing he has left is his scholarship and counting down the days until he can leave town. One goal-oriented girl... Sunny Blackfox was alone in the world, but she had big plans and big dreams to keep her occupied. She didn’t have time for anyone in her life. That was, until she came to the rescue of the boy she always had a thing for. They have everything going against them, but maybe, if they are lucky, they will make it out of town after graduation together ... or maybe never.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06W5QVRKB/...
