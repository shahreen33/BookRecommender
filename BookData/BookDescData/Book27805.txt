Heâ€™s been the star quarterback at the University of Florida for three years in a row and now he was facing bright NFL prospects. All he needed to do was stay focused on the game and come out a winner. Things get harder when Sean starts being stalked by a crazy fan and finds their advances only getting bolder and more threatening.  Connor Hawk works as a bodyguard for an exclusive agency in Los Angeles. He lives life day to day, protecting celebrities and politicians for a paycheck and then finding a random guy to ease the pressure over a night. He resigned himself to living a lonely life caring only about his work. That all changes when he gets flown to Gainesville for an assignment that alters his future in the blink of an eye.  When Connor and Sean meet, their chemistry is undeniable. Both of the men must come to terms with feelings they thought they were never destined to have. Meanwhile, the stalker becomes more persistent and ends up doing something unimaginable.
