When the body of a man closely connected to the founder of Castle's Bluff turns up dead, clutching the notorious dead man's poker hand, Cori must battle ancient vampire politics to bring the killer to justice. Cover-ups no longer cut it in her town, and she's determined to bring order, even if it means defying orders straight from her pack alpha and the leader of the vampire community.  While she puts herself directly on everybody's burn list, a mysterious man shows up, claiming to be her roommate's long-lost brother. Trust isn't one of her strengths and she's determined to get to the truth before her best friend's heart is broken - and her bank account drained.  To top it off, her powers as a witch are growing faster than she can keep up, even with her foxy medium, Chaos, there to guide her.  With Alex by her side, she rushed head first straight into a tangle of magic, politics, and family discourse, but can she balance it all and find the answers before she loses her job and her standing in both her community and her pack?
