Daisy Diamond is a big television star, and she's finally going home. After ten long years away. Back to the gorgeous seaside resort of Port Pol in sunny Cornwall.  But she's not home five minutes before she realises the mistake she's made. Because her childhood sweetheart Nick Old - affectionately known as 'Devil' in Port Pol - is still living there, running the local bookshop, and has no intention of letting her forget what they once felt for each other.  Daisy is no longer the dewy-eyed romantic of her school days, though. And she's not afraid to show Nick how much she's grown up. Even if it means bending her heart out of shape a little ...  Another 'Oddest Little Shop' romantic comedy novella from the quirky pen of popular author Beth Good.
