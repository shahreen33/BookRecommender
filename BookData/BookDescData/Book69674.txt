What a difference a day can make.  Mia Caruso grew up under the roof of a tyrant. Her father was an enforcer for the DeLuca crime family who ruled his home with the same brutality that his job required, her mother was the silent trophy he'd always wanted and Mia was only ever in the way. She'd endured the abuse for years, her only solace was the hope that one day she would be free from his iron fists. Just shy of her eighteenth birthday and four months away from a fresh start at college, he showed up and turned her world upside down.  Carlo DeLuca was at the top of his game, master of his own universe, he ran the most successful organized crime syndicate on the west coast. He'd worked his ass off to build his empire after his father had nearly bled it dry, and he wouldn't allow anything to threaten that. Carlo ruled with a cold indifference that terrified even the most brutal of men, and today was no exception, he had a rat to dispose of.  But when he looked into a of pair amber eyes and saw a fire that rivaled his own, he knew nothing would be the same again.
