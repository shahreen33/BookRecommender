 Karma’s alive and well in Apalachicola, Florida, and there are several people who are about to meet it face to face.   When more than a dozen bodies wash up on the beach on St. George Island, the residents of Apalach are outraged, and none more so than investigator Maggie Redmond and Sheriff Wyatt Hamilton. It’s time for the greedy to answer for the lives of innocents.  Meanwhile, a man is found tied to a burning boat in the middle of the bay, and Maggie’s instincts tell her Bennett Boudreaux is behind it. But if he is, Maggie has to decide whether she really wants him punished, or if justice has already been served.   Vengeance is afoot in Apalachicola, and everyone is in its path.    About the Forgotten Coast Florida Series:  The first four books of the series, 
   Low Tide, Riptide, What Washes Up, and Landfall,
 lay the foundation for the entire series. There are subplots resolved in each book, but there is also an overarching plot that is not resolved until Landfall, so they should be read in sequence.  Subsequent books in the series will be both longer and be stand alone novels that can be read any sequence.
