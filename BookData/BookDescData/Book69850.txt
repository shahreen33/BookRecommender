How far would you go to protect your family?Randolph Tiefenthaler leads a normal life. He has an attractive, intelligent wife, and two children, enjoys modest success as an architect, and has just moved into a beautiful old building in a respectable part of Berlin. Life seems perfect — until he meets the man living in the apartment downstairs.Dieter Tiberius is friendly at first, if a little odd, but his behaviour quickly becomes distressing when erotic letters addressed to Randolph’s wife are discovered on their doorstep. As Dieter’s campaign of harassment intensifies, Randolph struggles with his own uncertainty — pondering fundamental questions about masculinity, violence, and the rule of law — and his reliability is slowly but irrevocably called into doubt. The result is an unsettling meditation on middle-class privilege reminiscent of sophisticated works of psychological suspense such as Herman Koch’s The Dinner and Lionel Shriver’s We Need to Talk About Kevin.
