'A phenomenal cast of characters and some real laugh out loud moments. Brilliant!' Heidi SwainRomantic comedy as its finest from an author who is quickly gaining acclaim; perfect for fans of Mhairi Macfarlane and Lindsey Kelk. Jess, a 29-year-old Londoner with a Kate Beckett fringe and a tendency for dramatics, gets taken on a surprise trip by her long-term boyfriend, Pete, to attend her best friend’s last minute wedding in South Africa. Jess imagines sun, sand, wine and safaris. And returning to London with an ethically mined diamond on her left hand...   But this holiday isn’t set to be quite the fairy tale Jess has planned... and suddenly she finds her world tilting on its axis. And things are only set to get worse when Jess returns home…  Catherine Bennetto is back with her trademark wit and an equally hilarious cast of characters who will have you rooting for them from the first page. Praise for Catherine Bennetto:  ‘This superb debut is a romcom at its very best and the perfect book to chase away the winter blues. I haven’t fallen so in love with a bunch of characters in a long while. Loved it'
