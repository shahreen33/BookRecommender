The end of a curse is the beginning of a magical love. Celtic language expert Haley OBrien is thrilled when she gets the chance to translate a scroll written in Ogham, an ancient Celtic text used in magic and divination. While translating the text, she unwittingly frees Conall macCormacs Fae soul from a millennia-old curse that kept him imprisoned in a human body, lifetime after lifetime. The end of the curse is just the beginning of the magic for Haley and the ridiculously sexy Conall. He takes her into the world of his people, the Daoine Sidhe, where she begins to learn of her own Fae heritage, carve out a new path for herself, and embrace her new-found power. But their happiness is marred by Ninane, the jealous Fae who cursed Conall a thousand years ago. She will stop at nothing to have him for her own, including the murder of Haleys family. Determined to bring Ninane to justice, Haley must ask Conall to undergo the ultimate test of loveto stand aside and let her fight her own battles.
