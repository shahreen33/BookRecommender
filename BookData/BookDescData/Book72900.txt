 Three things about Justin Roberts: 1. He’s a bully. 2. Our relationship is toxic. 3. He’s the only one who knows my secret. A year ago, I woke in the morgue with a note in my hand telling me that I’m a vampire. I need blood or I’ll start killing people. Lucky for me, Justin has been sneaking into my bedroom and feeding me blood for a year, and the only price I have to pay for it is putting up with his cruel snipes and my unwanted feelings for him. I just can’t figure out why he keeps coming back. But all that changes when I’m offered a full-ride scholarship to Justin’s mysterious school, the elite Blackburn Academy, where I might finally learn about vampires. About myself. All I have to do is pass the grueling entrance trials, and the scholarship will be mine. Problem is, Justin doesn’t want me anywhere near his elite school and rich friends. He’s vowed to sabotage me. Justin may have been feeding me blood for a year, but he doesn’t know who he’s up against. But, Blackburn Academy is more than it seems. I’ll be facing more than what Justin Roberts alone can dish out. Will competing in the trials be the new beginning I’m hoping for, or will it end my undead existence?Previously published under the title A Bite at the Cherry.
