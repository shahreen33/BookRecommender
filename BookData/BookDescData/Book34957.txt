Hello Diary,Sorry, it’s been a while since I have been able to write.As you know, my dad is a modern-day Noah, always working on building his ark, trying to save folks and getting my brother and I ready for the impending end of days – whatever that means.One thing I did learn (the hard way), is that going through an apocalyptic event doesn't mean the end of the world.There was nothing in his prepper manuals that could prepare us for what actually happened.I had nothing to prepare me for Jaeden and Lachlan. Heck, I don’t know of any girl that would have been prepared for those two.There was nothing to prepare any of us for the things that go bump in the night, or the creatures who have been hiding in the background that emerged when civilization collapsed.No, an apocalyptic event is just a set-up for things in our world to be shaken AND stirred.What will come out of this mess, remains to be seen.I’ll give more details soon, gotta go…~Emma*Reader Advisory* This is a paranormal urban fantasy with strong themes of violence and sexual situations that are only suitable for readers over the age of 18.
