Blinded by anger, the man who had sworn to protect me, shot me in a fit of rage when I was only sixteen years old.  He thought he killed me. But my job wasn’t finished yet.  My days are spent as President of the Heavens Guardians MC. Nights are spent searching for the scum of the earth.  Rapists, Murderers, Pedophiles. They all answer to me.  I thought I’d seen it all. Thought my heart couldn’t be any darker. Thought I knew exactly how far I was willing to go.  Then a battered and broken woman was found behind our clubhouse, and I realized, I’ve never had a clue about the monster that lurks within.  They may call me Priest, but I’d sell my soul to the devil before I let anything take her away from me.
