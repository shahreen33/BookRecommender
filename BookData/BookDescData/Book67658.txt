The son of an icon. He was a legend. Rock royalty.A man I never met.But I’m measured against him in every aspect of my life.The only time I feel like me … the real me … is when I’m onstage with my band. But the more we grow in popularity, the more people compare me to him.I’m not him. And I never will be. If only everyone could figure that out for themselves.I need a break from it all. Then, a confrontation has me jumping in my car, putting LA in my rearview mirror. And a stupid mistake ends up with my car on the side of the road. And straight into the path of a girl who is the exact opposite of everyone else in my life. She’s like everything I used to know.And she has no clue who I am.Even if she did, I don’t think she’d care.She thinks I’m cavalier. I think she’s intriguing. And hot. Let’s not forget hot.I’m stuck in this town overnight while my car is being fixed. But I’m thinking I’m gonna stick around a bit longer.I’m Storm Slater, lead guitarist in Slater Raze and the only child of the late, great Jonny Creed. But, here, right now … I’m nobody. Just a regular guy. I’m liking it a whole lot. And I’m liking her even more.
