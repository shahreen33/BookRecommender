As the daughter of Dracula, you would think I’d be born the perfect monster.  You couldn’t be more wrong.  As far as monsters go, I’m a screw up—if I’m not tripping over my own feet, I’m accidentally murdering someone (it’s a real issue, guys).  Left with no choice, Dad decides to send me to Prodigium—otherwise known as Monster Academy—to train me on how to be a better monster.  When bodies turn up on campus, I’m the prime suspect (not that I can blame them. I’ll be pretty suspicious too if bodies drained of blood show up right after Dracula’s daughter arrives).  With the help of my mortal-nemesis Vin, Van Helsing’s son  Frankie, Frankenstein’s son  Mason, Medusa’s son  And Jack (sometimes Hux), Dr. Jekyll’s son  I might have a chance of uncovering the truth.  If I’m not murdered first.  The struggles of being a vampire, am I right?  This is a horror comedy reverse harem with some dark elements. After all, you can’t have a bunch of monsters without some darkness. This is book one of a series.
