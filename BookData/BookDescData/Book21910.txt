A priest sleeps with a parishioner…a boy loses faith in his father…a little girl ruins her cousin’s marriage…a man is imprisoned with Frog Woman…a married woman knows she’s a slut.These twenty-two stories of love, lies, loss and betrayal explore the fragile boundary between truth and fiction. Confessions: Fact or Fiction? invites the reader to decide which stories are “true” and which are not.
