Pride goeth before "his" fall.A "Cougar Falls" StoryDean Chastell has a reputation for being a troublemaker and something of a lady's man. It's not his fault he's attractive, funny and hell on wheels between the sheets...or that his pranks often leave his victims smarting. But not even he deserves to get saddled with Stacey Bermin for his sins. There's no denying the woman is gorgeous. She's sexy as hell and aggravating in the extreme. She's also prideful, pampered, calls him "hillbilly" and needs a swift kiss...err, "kick," in the pants.And she's in grave danger.He never thought they'd manage to spend a few hours, much less a few days, alone without going for each other's throats, but when trouble comes calling, Dean finds he'll do anything to keep her safe. She's not nearly as cold as she seems. In fact, the princess brings out the prince in him he never knew existed. And he'll move heaven and earth to keep her safe, out of danger...and in his arms, no matter the cost.Warning: A trickster cat finally meets his match in a proud feline used to getting her way. Hunters, hijinks and danger abound as the pride comes together for one heck of a battle.
