A sparkling first novel by Natalie Krinsky, the witty, provocative sex columnist for the Yale Daily News.Chloe Carrington is a typical Yale student, except that along with toiling through the usual grind of coursework, she pens a notorious and much-dished-over sex column for the campus newspaper. This touch of fame has wrought havoc on her social and love life, turning it literally into an open book. Chloe doesn't help matters much; she likes to share and can't resist divulging the gory details of her most recent date (or lack thereof) in her column, baring her soul for all to see. Like her friends, she dreams of hooking up with Mr. Right, at least for a little while - but that proves even more arduous than participating in Yale's notorious "shopping" session (a two-week period in which students are encouraged to take as many classes as possible, in order to decide what courses to enroll in for that semester). As Chloe probes the campus hot spots, we get a peek at just what goes on behind the Ivy League's dormitory doors - from drinking at Toad's to "Exotic Erotic" (Yale's answer to a Hugh Hefner-style Playboy party, complete with coeds in skimpy bikinis). Teeming with exuberance and late-night shenanigans, Natalie Krinsky's novel is filled with humor and candor about typical college situations both inside and outside the dorm room.
