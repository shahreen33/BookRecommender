A conversation I was never supposed to hear.A bargain I had no right to make.A promise I couldn’t break, no matter the consequences.It cost me what I love most.Her.I know Eden thinks it’s all my fault.And it is.But it’s hers, too. Because she ran, vanished, before I had a chance to explain.Before I had a chance to tell her the one thing that could’ve saved us.Now she’s back and I’m determined to make up for all the years we lost.Determined to win back the woman who’s always been mine...Consequences be damned.
