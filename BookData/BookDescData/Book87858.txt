The Vetrov name comes with expectation.My role in this world is simple: do as Father asks and live my life how he planned it. My future is already written: run the empire.Old Values. Old Rule. Old Money.Until her.Everything I do lacks purpose.Everything I do is empty.Women. Money. Power. It meant nothing.Until her.When the Volkov rose showed up at my home a disgraced package, hand-delivered by a Vasiliev prince, I began paving my own path. I vowed to make her bloom once more.She consumed me. Her. Her. Her.But you can’t love a rose and expect not to be damaged by her thorns.She cut me too deep.And I bled out. My soul fled. All that’s left is a cold, calculating monster. I am Veniamin. Volcanic. Victorious. Valiant. Vetrov. When you enter my world to play games, prepare to lose.In the end, I always find the thorn in my side, and I pluck it right out.
