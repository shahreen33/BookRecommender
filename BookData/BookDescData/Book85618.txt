Tonight, Again marks Clive Barker's first collection since The Books of Blood over 25 years ago. It contains more than thirty primarily erotic short stories and vignettes (most of them previously unpublished), along with explicit illustrations by the author in his signature style. As an exploration of extremes, in lush prose and evocative images, Tonight, Again is not to be missed by the author's many fans.Table of Contents:Tonight, AgainI Love YouCraw: a FableAfraidMovedI Imagine YouIf the Pen is the PenisTouch the RodMarthaTitThe FreaksCrueltyDollieThe CollectionWhat May Not Be ShownTwo Views from a WindowMen in the Aisles of SupermarketsA BlessingUnrequitedInside Out (Wasteland)Another GenesisI Have My ArtWhistling in the DarkThe Common FleshAuroraMr. Fred Coady Professes His Undying Love for His Little SylviaThe Phone CallThe MultitudeA Monster Lies in WaitAn Incident at the NunneryThe Genius of Denny DanTonight, Again will be printed on 80# Finch, in two colors.Lettered: 26 signed copies, bound in leather, and housed in a custom traycase.Limited: 224 signed numbered copies, bound in a three piece cloth case, housed in a custom slipcaseTrade: 1000 cloth bound hardcover copiesExpected publication: early 2016
