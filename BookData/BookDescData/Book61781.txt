I poisoned her coworkers, so she injected me with a lethal dose of unrequited love.In the past we had it all.Or at least, we seemed to.Then I let her down.We both made mistakes.We fell apart.But no matter the years that passed us by,I never forgot about her.So when my brother falls headfirst into trouble, I know who to call on.I know she will help me.Even if she wishes I would disappear from her life.Even if she hates me.But I won’t give up this time without a fight.I will do everything in my power to win her back.There might be some stumbles along the way…Like an accidental poisoning for example.But I won’t let that stop me.Through gunfire and car chases,I will make sure she knows she can rely on me.We’re in this together,Forever and always.Who cares if things don’t get off to a great start?What does it matter that her coworkers think I’m dangerous?Is almost killing them worth throwing away what we have?Then again, as some people say: there is nothing quite like love at first … crime.
