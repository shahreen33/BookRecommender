Since its last revision in 1997, dozens of new treatments and philosophies about ADD and ADHD have met with storms of controversy and great media attention. Dr. Lynn Weiss cuts through the noise and gets down to the point in a human, caring, and professional way. People turn to the Weiss library for a breath of fresh air on the ADD turmoil. Is it an allergy? A chemical imbalance? A genetic thing? Lynn's answer: "Who cares?" The new edition not only touches on and dispels the most recent clinical findings, it also emphasizes the bigger perspective, focusing on the humanitarian, economic, empowerment, and diversity issues facing all of us on the ADD continuum today.
