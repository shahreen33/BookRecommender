Some love affairs aren’t meant for the public eye. Some love affairs won’t survive the fallout.  Calliope das Dores is not the perfect rebound, even if her name means "muse". She is not who I should be running to. But I want her anyway.  She keeps telling me my squeaky-clean image can’t handle the scandal, but this want between us is not black and white, and it never will be.  I don’t care that she’s my uncle’s wife—or that she shares my last name. After finding my girlfriend in bed with my uncle at the end of my worldwide tour, the truth is clear: Calliope and I are the only family we both have left now.  In the beginning, after flying to the Ozarks to tell her of our partners’ sins, I tell myself it’s just so she won’t hear it from someone who would lie to her. But my manager and best friend say I’ve wanted her since I was a kid, and now, finally, she is allowed to want me back.  She says we can get over them with each other—even if it’s in secret, for a summer—but I have to promise her I won’t fall in love. It’s not part of the plan. The details in our past deny us of any future we could have had.  What starts out as a rebound for both of us eventually consumes me. But the flames don’t reach her.  My muse is consumed, too. But not with me.
