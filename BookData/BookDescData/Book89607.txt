Shane Galanter is ready to put down roots after years of searching. But is he making the right choice? Or is there a woman somewhere who remembers a love that hasn't faded with time? Lauren Gibbs is a successful international war correspondent who gave up on happily-ever-after years ago-when it was ripped away from her. So why is life so empty? Emily Anderson is a college freshman raised by her grandparents, about to take her first internship as a journalist. But before she can move ahead, she discovers a love story whose tragic ending came with her birth. As a result, she is drawn to look back and search out the mother she's never met, and the father she never knew. With hallmark tenderness and power, Karen Kingsbury weaves a tapestry of life, loss, love, faith-and the miracle of resurrection.
