Luck is no lady… in fact, she can be a downright bitch.Bailey: Let’s get one thing straight. I am not your typical girl. Sure, I’ve got all the parts, but I’ve been a stubborn, irreverent tomboy since the womb. Which makes it particularly ironic that my heart is so damn girlie. It falls in love at the drop of a hat and leaves me to deal with the aftermath. But no more! If Jake Beckett thinks spending one night together gives him some claim on me, he’s got another thing coming—even if the mere thought of that night leaves me panting like a damn Labrador. I’m not about to open the door and let Jake in, but that choice may be taken from both our hands.Jake: Coming home was supposed to be my shot at redemption. Instead, I’m finding myself chasing after an irresistible blonde whose mercurial behavior could give Jekyll and Hyde a run for their money. I’ve got too much on my plate to get tied up in knots over a girl who wants nothing to do with me. But Bailey Murphy may hold the key to my redemption, and I’m not giving up on either without a fight. “Irish” might play with a poker face, but I’m about to call her bluff … and I hope like hell I’ve got luck on my side. If you enjoy the lightheartedness of Kristen Proby and the witty sex appeal of Kendall Ryan, you'll love The Lucky One.Grab your copy of The Lucky One and enjoy all the feels tonight!This product is a republication of the 2017 version of THE LUCKY ONE.
