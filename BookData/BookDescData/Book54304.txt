Note: This is a re-release.  Ethan Stewart likes to get what he wants. Intelligent, attractive, and successful, he doesn't care about straddling the line between refined physician and well-educated sailor. Coming from a background filled with violence and poverty, he still manages to work his way from medical school to eventually owning his own medical practice. As far as Ethan is concerned, he has everything heâ€™s ever asked for.  But when Alexandra Miller comes into the picture, the attraction is instant. Uncontrolled. She is everything Ethan loves in a woman, even the things she tries so hard to hide. She's a woman whose background includes having the President of the United States in her social circle, but he doesn't plan to be intimidated. What Ethan wants, Ethan gets. And, after a passionate, unexpected night in her office, now that he's tasted her, he realizes he can never go back to not having her as part of his life.
