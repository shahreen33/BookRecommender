Aric Winters has a full and happy life, including a magical wife who can’t stay out of a trouble and an eight-year-old daughter who is following in her footsteps. Despite that, he’s content. That is until things come to a head in his professional and personal lives and things threaten to careen out of control. As a shifter, Aric has certain responsibilities in the wolf hierarchy. His father makes that clear when he brings a bigwig for a visit and expects Aric to entertain him. Unfortunately for Aric, his daughter Sami is out of school for the day so he has to take her along for the ride. Sami is special, of course. She’s more than a wolf thanks to her mother’s mage background. That power is put on display when a member of the wolf council goes missing and Sami is expected to track him through the woods. Instead of finding a living wolf, though, Aric finds a dead one … and it’s not the one he’s looking for. What follows is a race against the clock to find a murderer and keep his family safe. Is Aric up to the task? He’s the top wolf on the job, and he’s about to find out.  Note: This is a 30,000-word short in the Covenant College world.
