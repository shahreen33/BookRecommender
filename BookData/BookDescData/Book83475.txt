A book of 366 mantras or affirmations to raise and encourage the self-esteem and self-belief of children (plus adults), told through the eyes of young siblings Hao Finley Lee and Sabine Yi Lee. Written in the form of a journal and calendar, there is a mantra for each day of the month. For each mantra that Hao and Sabine want to focus on for their own personal growth, they share that with other fellow "philomaths" or knowledge-seekers through an illustration that describes for them that mantra. For them it's to: SAY it. BELIEVE it. BECOME it. MANIFEST it.
