Colter Shaw is an itinerate "reward-seeker," traveling the country to help police solve crimes and private citizens locate missing persons. When he learns of a reward for a missing college student in Silicon Valley, he takes the job. The investigation quickly thrusts him into the dark heart of Silicon Valley and the cutthroat billion-dollar video gaming industry--and then a second kidnapping happens...and this victim turns up dead.
