The story of Bonnie N. Collide, a roller-girl, and the adventures she has at a humdrum day job. Bonnieâ€™s inability to separate her vibrant roller derby life from her normal working life means she gets to gleefully crash from one aspect of her life into another, seamlessly, and using the same amount of gusto. Oh, and one of her coworkers is a werewolf named Herb.
