When a 30-year-old neurotic Swede moves into a filthy apartment — he gets the shock of a lifetime: his roommate is a carrot.  Not the kind you shred and put in a salad with peppers and onions. No, but a real life, living, human carrot — the saggy kind.  As his own depression spirals out of control, he starts hating his roommate for being everything he’s becoming. Lazy. Ugly. Broke. A human vegetable.  Dishes build up in the kitchen. The bathroom looks like a garbage dump. And the mailbox? Doesn’t even have his name on it! And the cherry on top of the cake is that his roommate will not, under any circumstances whatsoever, take out the garbage.  This bothers him to no end and he develops elaborate plans to force his roommate to act. He fills up the garbage bag with smelly things and goes for “mini-vacations” to his ex’s house.  When even this fails he snaps — his roommate is about to become the last ingredient in a giant batch of carrot soup.  THE CARROT MAN is an existential comedy in the vein of Dostoyevsky's NOTES FROM UNDERGROUND and Salinger’s THE CATCHER IN THE RYE.  WARNING: This story contains offensive language, premises and jokes.
