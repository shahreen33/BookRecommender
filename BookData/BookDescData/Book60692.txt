Book one of the Standing Room Only Stables series   Lynn Welling grew up with a love of horses. As a child, her days consisted of sitting on her bedroom floor with shoelaces tied around her toes acting as reins. For hours she would pretend she was riding a Park horse at U.S. Nationals, trotting the victory lap with a blanket of roses draped on his neck. Now, as a young adult, that dream is one step closer to becoming a reality.  When Lynn lands a job as a stable hand at an Arabian horse farm, she starts to wonder if she got in over her head. The only riding she has ever done was on the neighbor’s retired Quarter horse as a kid, and it was just the basics. Now, she is in charge of caring for over 20 horses, and she’s beginning to second guess her decision.  Just as she’s learning the ropes, Lynn catches the eye of Doug, the head trainer, and he starts to wonder if she is the junior rider he’s been looking for. He introduces her to a tiny bay gelding, named Rumble, and Lynn has to decide if she wants to take on the daunting challenge of learning to ride him.  While sorting things out, and forming a relationship with Rumble, things aren’t exactly falling into place. The resident star rider, Zoey, is quick to crush any plans that Lynn may have; shoving her, and her dreams, out the door before she gets too comfortable.  Will Lynn find the strength and determination to ride Rumble in the ring this season? Or, will she leave her dreams behind, crushed into the arena dirt by pounding hooves?      Take time to check out C. L. Heckman's other books on her amazon author page.
