In the library of a country house, Vivian writes an article about the importance of lying until he is interrupted by Cyril, who tries to tempt him away. Instead the two men are plunged into a discussion about art, nature, literature, and imagination. Set in the form of a witty dialogue between two speakers, this is an in-depth exploration of the relationship between life and art, as well as an examination of the work of such writers as Shakespeare and Balzac.
