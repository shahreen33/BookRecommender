Imagine being able to connect everything you do in life with God's dream of shalom. Imagine all God's people seeing their family responsibilities, work, and community involvement as ministry. Imagine congregations that equip and empower people for ministry--not just in the church, but in all they do. Imagine leaders and members finding a renewed sense of joy, purpose, and vitality as they give themselves away for the sake of the Gospel. Dwight DuBois not only imagines these life-giving outcomes in fresh and powerful ways, he shows readers how to create an environment that equips everyday saints to connect their faith with all of life. Based on the real life struggles of pastors and members, The Scattering lays bare our preoccupation with the health of the institution and offers powerful new language for the church as being both gathered and scattered. This language breaks down unhelpful stereotypes, and provides readers with hopeful and rewarding ways to interpret who we are and what we do as the church of Jesus Christ. ""In these times of change in the culture, anxiety in the church, and the temptation to turn inward on our life inside the walls of the church building, the author Dwight DuBois helps us reclaim our role as support staff to God's people in their daily lives. This book is a welcome invitation to refocus our attention, that we might help unleash the power of our congregations beyond our walls as God's people live faithfully in all of the places they are called to be during the week."" --Janice Kibler, Pastor, Grace Lutheran Church, Boulder, Colorado Dwight L. DuBois is a parish pastor, congregational renewal professional, and instructor at Wartburg Theological Seminary in Dubuque, Iowa. In recent years he has worked extensively on making the connection between faith and life, in congregations, with college students, and at the seminary level.
