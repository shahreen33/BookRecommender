What drives a man to become a killer?When Dr. Meredith Bowen gets the opportunity to interview Duane Tolloch, a man convicted of committing multiple murders between 1965 and 1967, all she can think about is the needed boost this assignment will give to her career. A seasoned psychiatrist, she is no stranger to the darker regions of the human mind, but as Tolloch relates his tale of a "town curse" and a cycle of abuse that goes back before he was even born, his story shakes Meredith's preconceived notions about the nature of the human psyche, as well as her faith in science, to the core. Was Tolloch simply a man who chose the wrong path, or did his abusive childhood create the monster he grew up to be? Or could the theory of the town curse actually be true?
