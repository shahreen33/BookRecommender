"Unexplained Fevers plucks the familiar fairy tale heroines and drops them into alternate landscapes. Unlocking them from the old stories is a way to 'rescue the other half of [their] souls.' And so Sleeping Beauty arrives at the emergency room, Red Riding Hood reaches the car dealership, and Rapunzel goes wandering in the desert - their journeys, re-imagined in this inventive collection of poems, produce other dangers, betrayals and nightmares, but also bring forth great surprise and wonder." —Rigoberto González, author of Black Blossoms Unexplained Fevers, the third full-length poetry collection from Jeannine Hall Gailey, is due for release in Spring 2013 from New Binary Press.
