He'll do whatever it takes to get her against the boardsâ€¦Sidelined by a potentially career-ending injury, the only thing hockey player Ryan Douglas should be thinking about is recovery. But after sharing a near death experience and a night of passion with a spunky brunette, the only thing on his mind is five and a half feet of sexy sarcasm.

Dumped by text--again. Determined to eighty-six illusions of romance and prove she's more than just a good-time girl, the last thing she needs is a pushy, arrogant hockey player testing her resolve.
