Wine is great, but having it delivered right to your house is awesome, at least until it kills you.  When one local woman dies, Hunter writes it off as a tragic allergic reaction, but when another dies the same way, he realizes they may have shared more than just a monthly wine membership.  Meanwhile, Shelby and Noelle struggle to master their newfound magical abilities and Raeann has troubles of her own.  Join Noelle and crew - both living and post-life - for some fresh chaos, magic, and humor in this next full-length witchy adventure. This is book 7 in the Witches of Keyhole Lake Mystery series.
