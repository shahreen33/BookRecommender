Mafia Versus Witchcraft! "With such consummate skill," wrote the New York Times, "has Mr. Merritt told his story in Burn Witch Burn that one is almost ready to believe that such things can be, even in this twentieth century of ours." Not available in paperback, here is the fabled novel of an eminent physician who agrees to work along side one of the city's most notorious gangsters to put an end to a strange and mysterious series of deaths that have claimed a child, a millionaire, one of the don's men and the doctor's nurse. Investigation leads the pair to the uncanny Madame Mandilip, proprietress of a most unusual doll shop, and her apparently mute and terrified daughter. Soon the Mafia don lies on the verge of death and the doctor finds himself the victim of strange hallucinations--or are they? From page to page the nightmare figure of Madame Mandilip grows more horrible and deadly until she spreads like a menacing shadow across the lives of the doctor and his friends. Long out of print, this novel, which inspired the legendary 1930s horror film, Devil Doll with Lionel Barymore, is considered one of the supreme masterpieces of dark fantasy. "There is no individual writing today," wrote Donald A. Wollheim, author of Mimic, "that can torture his reader by way of the suspense element as much as Merritt and know at which point to stop; to save him perhaps for future tortures." Or, as the New York Times said, "You'll find here a collection of horrors that really horrify, most skillfully blended into a tale of mounting hellishness, the whole flavored with that peculiar quality that Merritt readers know about."
