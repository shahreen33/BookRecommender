An Mpreg Romance An unexpected reunion offers an Alpha and Omega a second chance…  Ten years ago, omega Alex Cary's fiancé broke his heart and left him with nothing. He's got a good career as a home chef, but he's lost his ability to trust.  Alpha Sol Delaney loved Alex more than oxygen, but he was dependent on his father's money. When his father demanded he break things off with the foster kid from the Bronx, Sol had no choice.  Ten years later, a freshly divorced Sol has returned to New York with his young son in tow. He wants Alex back, but it's not that easy: Sol's ex-husband and his mother in law are trying to drag Sol back, and there's no length to which they won't go.  This intense 85,000-word omegaverse romance is overflowing with passion, drama, and of course, clothes-ripping sex. Hot and descriptive bedroom action makes this gay paranormal mpreg romance suitable for adults only!
