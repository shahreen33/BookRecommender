Teen angel, Persephone, is the only one in all of Heaven who can't sing. In fact, her name literally means "Voice of Destruction." So diving down one of Heaven's portals, straight into singer Taylor Hamilton's bedroom, seems like a good idea at the time. Maybe, just maybe, he can help. Plus, he is sooo cute!While it can be fun swooning over a mortal, it can also be frustrating. Angels aren't supposed to fall for mortals. Then there's Taylor's guardian angel, who is ready to sabotage the budding romance at every turn. Will Persephone learn to sing before Heaven calls her back? And, most importantly, can love prevail for an angel who has fallen head over halo for a mortal?
