Kissing a complete stranger shouldn’t be a life altering experience, but with him it was. One look into his mischievous hazel eyes and our lips were colliding without a second thought.  Now, months later, not only do I know his name, we’ve also become friends. Good friends. The kind of friends that kiss and cuddle together, all night long. The kind of friends that fantasize about being horizontal or vertical...and very much naked.  I’d never been attracted to the football playing jocks, but Nick’s different. When he’s not being a professional flirt, he’s undeniably sweet and funny. For every excuse my mind comes up with to keep my distance, my body finds two reasons to give him a chance.  Can he make the final drive into my heart or will I keep him in the friend zone?  DRIVE is a full length standalone novel.
