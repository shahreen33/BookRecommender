She found her!  Jess saw Roxanne in one of her visions. Ben was wrong and the odd-ball sisters-in-law, believe it or not, were right—Roxanne wasn’t dead!  But where Jess saw her she could never come home from. She was as good as dead to Ben, because Roxanne couldn’t be his wife again, ever. If only Jess could find a way to make him understand, but he wouldn’t even listen to her.  Amber, Ben’s 4 year old autistic daughter was in trouble. Her development regressed drastically and Jess hoped it wouldn’t be permanent. Trying to take the child away from the influence of her aunts, she found that she couldn’t leave the house. She, and Amber, were trapped at Weltevreden.  Was this what Ether, the old housekeeper, meant on the day Jess arrived when she told her Jess would never leave again? The sisters wanted to do her in, but she was trapped and at their mercy?  And then Ether decided that she was living her final day, and that there was one more thing she had to do. Can a person do that? Can when decide when it was time to die? And what was the last thing she had to do? And after she was gone…  Would the sisters’ plan for Ben and Amber finally be revealed?
