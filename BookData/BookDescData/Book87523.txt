In the course of one days time, Princess Genevieve Cheval discovers that her ears are starting to point, that she is really the daughter of an Elven Princess that died giving birth to her and that she has inherited the only weapon that can kill the evil beast overtaking the forbidden forest…which also happens to be the step-brother she never knew she had.	Drawn into the forbidden forest by a mysterious dream, Genevieve is led to Queen Bellaserena of the Pegasaurs by two young elven brothers. She discovers the Queen is with foal and due at any moment. Delivering the young one, Genevieve saves the life of the Queen and her son with the weapon she’d inherited from her dead mother. Bellaserena informs Genevieve that the young Princess is destined to a power and a life greater than she’d ever imagined. Now, not only seeking her elven family of origin, she finds out that she is an integral part of the Prophecy as told in the ancient Dragon Book of Lore. Embroiled in battle to save the forest and her elven kinsmen from the bloodvine, she soon discovers there is an ancient evil set to destroy her and the man she loves, King Leto Sargovia. Aware that this is a battle to the death, she is ready to commit to any action that will allow the Prophecy to manifest.
