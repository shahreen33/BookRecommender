The Cape Doctor is a feminist, gender-bending portrayal of Dr. James M. Barry (1795-1865), a flamboyant, brilliant, Irish physician who rose to the rank of Inspector General of military hospitals in the British colonies—only to be discovered after death to have been a woman all along. Born in Cork, Margaret Ann Bulkley dressed as James to enter medical school in 1809 and later the army, institutions from which women were barred. The Cape Doctor recounts the doctor’s rise from unlikely heroine to one of the most celebrated and scandalous figures of the time, a time that looks—in its technological discoveries, revolutionary fervor, battle over women’s and human rights, its religious intolerance and social unrest—remarkably like our own. Now, when interest in women’s rights, gender fluidity, and medical justice are high, the novel is especially timely.
