"I can give you exactly what you're asking for, Janie, and I can give it to you all night long."  Their first kiss is impulsive, fun, a little wicked--everything Jane Elliot isn't looking for in a man--but desperately needs. Their second kiss is slow, deliberate, an instant connection--everything Austin Sinclair never had with a woman--and doesn't want.Jane isn't the easy conquest Austin's used to. She's a stubborn-as-hell bookworm who's more interested in studying than dating. She needs a little--no--a lot of fun in her life, and Austin's just the guy who can give it to her. Too bad she thinks love should be easy. Too bad Austin knows it isn't. Everybody told her to stay away from the heartbreaker, but Jane knows there's more to Austin than full-body contact kisses and bad boy charm. All he ever promised her was a good time and wow, does he ever deliver....A steamy romance sure to get your juices flowing. FOR ADULTS ONLY.
