Juliette Shaw has everything a girl could ask for – a thriving business, a beautiful home, loyal friends, and a gorgeous fiancé – but she doesn’t remember any of it.  After a horrific car accident steals her father’s life and five years of her memory, she is lost in a world she doesn’t recognize and is desperately searching for answers. Nothing feels right and behind each clue from her past are more questions, so she does the only thing she can do – run.  Sawyer Michelson, brother of the Bayou Devils MC, looks intimidating as hell and a smart girl like Juliette knows better than to accept a ride from a stranger but there’s something about his deep blue eyes that puts Juliette at ease and pulls her in. He makes her heart race and the longer she spends with him, the more she discovers the sweet, funny, and loyal man beneath the mask. But even a thousand miles from home, danger seems to find her, leaving Juliette to wonder if it’s just bad luck or if she is in more trouble than she realized.  Can Juliette recover her past and find answers or will she lose more than just her memories this time?
