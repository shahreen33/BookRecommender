When the deal you need isn't the one you want To protect Vega and her son from the demon-vampire Arnaud, I’ve secured spots for them in a powerful safehouse. The price? Pledging my services to the Upholders, a group searching for stolen loved ones.My new teammates are a young minister, a snarky half-fae, a hulking mermaid, and a druid with major control issues. Bonded by said druid’s magic, I couldn’t wriggle out of this deal if I were coated in wizard’s oil.Now we’re hunting demons in a past version of New York City that’s on the bad side of strange. But I can’t stop thinking about Arnaud. He’s too close to the ones I cherish, and growing more lethal by the hour. He’s also gotten his talons on an enchanted item that could undo their protection.I need to fulfill my contract to the Upholders and race home. But dangers here are mounting, verging on biblical. If I don’t crank my magic to eleven and become the leader this team needs, I may never see Vega again… Or hold our future child.Druid Bond is the 7th novel in the 100,000+ selling urban fantasy series.
