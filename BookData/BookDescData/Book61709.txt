Twenty-Five Years. That's how long Odette Peterson called Austin Andrews her best friend. Until he let his mouth ruin it--in more ways than one.Five Minutes. That's all it took for their friendship to fall apart, leaving her heart a little broken and her life a little emptier.One Hour. That's the amount of time she agrees to give him to try and find his way back into her good graces. Not that she thinks for even one minute that it might work.
  It won't, because . . .
Forever. That's what Odette's looking for. Someone to spend her life with; someone who'll see her as more than just one of the guys. And there's not a thing Austin can do to stop her.
  Except maybe tell her that he loves her . . .
