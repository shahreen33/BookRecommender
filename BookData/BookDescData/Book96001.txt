As the long day comes to an end, Mother Sky fills a tub with falling stars and calls, "Bath time for Little Night!" Little Night answers from afar, "Can't come. I am hiding and you have to find me, Mama. Find me now!" Where could Little Night be? Down a rabbit hole? In a blueberry field? Among the stripes of bees? Exquisitely painted and as gentle as Little Night's dress crocheted from clouds, this is a story to treasure.
