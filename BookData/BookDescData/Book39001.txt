When an aging coroner says a wealthy author died of natural causes and sees no need to do an autopsy, the county sheriff calls an old friend, retired homicide detective Cy Dekker, to see if the man was murdered. Cy gets a medical examiner friend to do an autopsy and finds that the man was poisoned and the time of death was probably when that author was at a book fair. Cy and his retired partner Lou look at who might have poisoned the man. Suspects include other authors, the author's brother and sister, and his neighbors.
