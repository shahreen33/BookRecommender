A hilarious illustrated non-fiction book about the worm, perfect for beginning readers. The humorous text and funny illustrations will give it trade appeal, while the non-fiction content is perfect for the institutional market.      The second in a series of humorous books about disgusting creatures, The Worm is a look at the earthworm. It covers such topics as the worm's habitats (sometimes they live inside other animals), its anatomy (its muscle tube is slimy and gross), and its illustrious history (worms have been on earth for 120 million years). Although silly and off-the-wall, The Worm contains real information that will tie in with curriculum.
