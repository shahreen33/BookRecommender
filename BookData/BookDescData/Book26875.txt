THE ELECTRIFYING END TO A STORY TEN YEARS IN THE MAKINGIn this dramatic conclusion, the Legacies, Loric, Earth Garde and even the Mogadorians come together for a final, deadly showdown. After the battle in Switzerland, the Fugitive Six find their loyalties torn, splitting them into two factions. Taylor, Nigel and Kopano join Nine to return to the Academy, but nothing is the same.Fear and resentment of the Human Garde has been growing and the Academy is under siege.The United Nations has decreed that all humans with Legacies must be implanted with inhibitors, a move that will take away their power and their human rights. The team have no choice but to fight back.Fractured and facing capture or annihilation on all sides, they must sacrifice everything in a war that pitches them against the rest of the world.The fate of the Human Garde and the world they knew has never been more uncertain.
