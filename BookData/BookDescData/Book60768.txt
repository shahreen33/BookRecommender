From the #1 bestselling author and former Starbucks CEO, here is a story that is part dramatic memoir, part blueprint of the new responsibilities that leaders and citizens share in America today. The book weaves two parallel narratives to show how experiences from Howard Schultz's troubled childhood--some of which he has never before disclosed--propelled him out of the housing projects and fueled his efforts to build a global brand and redefine the role of a company in society. Ultimately, Schultz reveals the potential we all have to transform communities and uplift lives.
