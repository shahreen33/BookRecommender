Davis ~ Life hasn’t been the same since Conrad and I lost our boyfriend Eric in a tragic accident. We’ve started looking for a third again, but the men we’ve met are wanting a one-time experience. It’s all just fun to them, but this is our lifestyle, and we want another man to love.  Conrad ~ I’m missing our man more than words can say, but that isn’t the only problem. I’d never told my family I was in a triad, so when they came to the funeral and treated Davis like a close friend, without knowing the depth of his sorrow, it gutted me. He deserves better than that. As hopeful as I am we’ll meet someone on this cruise, I’m not sure I’m ready to live honestly.  Shane ~ When my friends convince me to splurge and treat myself for a college graduation present, I wasn’t sure a singles cruise was the way to go. What are the chances that the only two men I’m interested in now that I’m here are looking for a third, or that one of them is my best friend’s older brother? But maybe a few days of living the fantasy won’t hurt anyone.  Fun in the sun is easy, but what happens when three men go back to real life? Lucky for Conrad and Shane, Davis has his eye on the prize and he’s not backing down.  Shipping Our Loves is a 55,000 word standalone novel intended for 18+
