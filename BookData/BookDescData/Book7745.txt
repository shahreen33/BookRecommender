The funny thing about fate—about life, is you never know what the next day holds. Live with no regrets.  Quinn Beckett, Sergeant At Arms for the Kings of Retribution MC knows life is all about what you make of it. He has dedicated years to his club, his family, his community and the members he calls his brothers. For Quinn, he couldn’t imagine life getting much better. Until a chance meeting a couple of years ago with a bright, attractive doctor altered his course in life. She became his only desire—his obsession. Quinn wanted nothing more than to make Emerson his.  To outsiders Emerson Evans had all the things in life you could ever hope for; family, friends and a great career, but what they didn’t know was she wasn’t happy. All her life she chased dreams—dreams that were only partly her own. Being a doctor means everything to her, but she finds herself longing for more out of life. Including wanting a sexy, long-haired biker, who happens to be part of the local MC. The very Club that fate decided was to be a part of her life. She could never have foreseen that giving her heart away and loving a man so fiercely would be the source of strength she would lean on when the unexpected happens.
