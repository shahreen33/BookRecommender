Mrs. Burger, the lunch lady, makes sure she has a good breakfast; Mrs. Sketcher, the art teacher, helps her pick out clothes. Still, Miss Macintosh is anxious. What if she can’t find her class?

That’s when she comes up with an idea to put everyone at ease — including herself.A perfect read-aloud to children who may be anxious about school, this book will get them laughing — and reassure them — as they get ready for the big day.
