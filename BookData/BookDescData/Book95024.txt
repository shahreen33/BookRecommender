Kay Hutchison had it all: a successful career, a beautiful home, and a loving husband. But her life changed forever one annual holiday, and it started with "I’m leaving." Going solo, Kay embarked on a unique journey of self-discovery. From colonic irrigation to cupping and reiki to reflexology, Kay found herself calling psychics, going to healers and tarot card readers, and dabbling in past-life regression, sonic therapy, silent retreats, astrology, shamanic retreats and much, much more. This book is the funny, moving and occasionally harrowing account of one woman’s search for the truth, from the sunshine of Spain to deep inside the psyche of her Scottish childhood. The result is an unusually candid exploration of both the challenges and opportunities of middle age.
