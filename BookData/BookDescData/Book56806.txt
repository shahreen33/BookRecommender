Adalyn Sage. I'm thirty-seven, a mother, a divorcee, and I’m ready to date again. I need a man willing to love me for who I am, despite what size I am. Only finding such a guy is harder than it’s cracked up to be. Afterall, I'm a little clumsy and just a tad outspoken… that is unless I’m in front of a man so good-looking my panties melt. Then I become an absolute weirdo. Case in point: Vice Salvatore. Stunning. Growly. And also my boss. Thank God his a**hole attitude put my racing heart at ease and changed my lust to hate. Nope. I don’t care for him. Won’t. I’ll continue to ignore my ladybits and stay strong. At least for a while.
