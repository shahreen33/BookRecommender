The Sleeper SEALs are former U.S. Navy SEALs recruited by a new CIA counter-terror division to handle solo dark ops missions to combat terrorism on U.S. soil.  Garrett Mann is burned out. Eight years as a Navy SEAL can do that to a man – especially when he’s been on one too many missions where he has lost too many of his buddies. At thirty-five, he has been fortunate not to be the next Navy SEAL with his name on the wall. Still, he can’t refuse a former commander who enlists him for one last assignment on a secret project.  Doctor Haley Kingston skills will keep her alive, but only one man can save her after she is kidnapped from the hospital where she is working. Haley’s code of ethics as a doctor leaves her little choice but to help the injured leader of a terrorist group. Unfortunately, those ethics won’t be able to save her, or thousands of others, should the terrorist leader live.  Haley will have to trust the last man on earth that she wants to see – the one that broke her heart. Garrett has his own problems. He will have to face his worse nightmares – see the one he loves in danger and realize that his dog tags may be the next ones given to her. Garrett will be pitted against foes determined to stop him at any cost. Can he save the woman he has always been afraid to love before she is executed? Or will his nightmares come true, and this mission will turn out to be his last?  Each book in this multi-author branded series is a standalone novel and the series does not have to be read in order.
