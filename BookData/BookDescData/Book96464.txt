The fae world isn’t fueled by magic. It’s fueled by fear.  The Hopeless realm isn’t at all what Zakara expected it to be. And neither is she. The powers of the Eminence are hard to harness and she needs them now more than ever.  Survival of the human world suddenly depends on her.  But more dangers lurk in the realm than they realize.  This is book three of a reverse harem series. Recommended for readers 18 and over.
