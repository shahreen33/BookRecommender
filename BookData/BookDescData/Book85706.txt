 
  
    Sometimes the most beautiful souls are the most broken.
  
 
  
    Protect.
  
From the minute I met her, I wanted to offer my protection.
  Desire.
I wanted her to be mine but didn’t have anything of value to offer. Just my jaded heart, broken soul, and undying love.
  
    Sacrifice.
  
I gave up my pride, my hostility, and my heart to make her happy. 
  
    Justice.
  
Fuck the consequences, I would’ve given up anything, even my life, to keep her safe.
  
    Tragic.
  
Both our lives were soaked in tragedy from day one.
  
    Reckless.
  
I ignored the people who warned me he was dead inside.
  
    Truth.
  
Everyone said he was bad, violent, and would drag me down.They were wrong. He was as broken as I was.
  
    Strength.
  
Together, we’d heal our hearts and stitch together our souls.
