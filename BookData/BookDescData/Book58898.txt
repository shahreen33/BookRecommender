Chuck is addicted to drugs, some too new for a name -- weird, experimental drugs that mangle the fabric of his reality. The solution to all his drug problems is more drugs, each one more chaotic than the last. He's wearing out his welcome at his job raising dwarf whales to sell to the tech geeks of San Francisco, and he's burning all his bridges in the party scene. When a new substance called Black Hole shows up on the streets, it offers a promise unlike any other: this drug never runs out. For a while, it's the perfect drug. But when Chuck wakes up from a blackout as a suspect in the murder of his boss, he needs time to sort out what happened. The bad news: time no longer seems to be in chronological order.
