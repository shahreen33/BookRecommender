 We canâ€™t help what we feel. His quick wit and sharp tongue have gotten playboy Jayden Deus into and out of plenty of sticky situations. Grieving his disapproving father and suddenly in charge of a huge company, a threat to his life comes out of the blue. Jayden's a fighter, but this is going to be the kind of battle that takes fists, not words.  Lucas Neal used to be a Navy SEAL, but he quit to take care of his sister and her little girl. These days he's in the bodyguard business, and his new client is the guy whose company jacked up the cost of his niece's meds. Frankly he thinks Deus deserves the bullet, but it's Lucas' job to make sure the hit never lands.  Worse, they recognize each other from a bar hookup the night Jayden's life changed forever. Unable to stand the memory, but unable to put it aside, they struggle to keep it professional as they're forced to work side by side. Like it or not, Lucas' mission is to protect this mouthy nerd. The best way to do that is to figure out who wants him dead - and try not to lose his heart along the way.  Defiant is a standalone, steamy, kinky romance about two men who have every reason to hate each other as they fight for their HEA. It features a belligerent geek, a rocky working relationship, and all kinds of makeshift restraints.
