As Christina's eighteenth birthday approaches, she finds herself struggling in recovery. Facing Filip's recurring depression and Miriam's increasing presence in her father's life, she attempts to take reigns over what she can control - food.  It is thus that she starts eating less and less, again opening the door to her eating disorder. But can she get her life back on track a second time, and why is it so difficult to accept the help she is given?  "Red Ribbons" is a heart-wrenching tale of acceptance and denial, love and loss, mental illness and the road to recovery.
