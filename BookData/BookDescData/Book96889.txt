One moment, one ordinary day changed my life and led me to my forever. Three guys tried to kidnap me. One man saved me. I was beyond scared. Being blind, I was already terrified of my every move, the unknown frightening. His name is Torch. Once he decided I was his, he didn't let me go. Torch became everything to me: my protector, my safe haven, my husband, lover, and most of all, the father to my babies. He made me see that I didn't have to be afraid of my every step, because he would always be there to catch me before I fell. Torch is the Vice President of the Devils Souls MC. The men are violent and scary, but I learned to trust them, because above everything else, their women are protected. They became my family. My only family.
