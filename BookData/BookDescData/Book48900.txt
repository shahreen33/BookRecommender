In the only account of Elvis’s early life authorized by Graceland, Gene Smith, Presley’s first cousin, reveals the child and man who became "The King of Rock &amp; Roll.” Smith gives compelling insights into the humble beginnings of the man who would become one of the greatest legends in American history. From the time they were born through the first ten meteoric years of Elvis’s career, the author and the "King” were blood brothers and sharers of a secret language. Smith gently shows Elvis’s vulnerabilities and humility despite worldwide fame and adulation. Entrancing and at times achingly nostalgic, Smith recreates the complex mosaic of a man who was loved by many and known by only a few.
