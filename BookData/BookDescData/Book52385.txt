Being the Letters written by John Graham, Head of the House of Graham &amp; Company, Pork-Packers in Chicago, familiarly known on ’Change as “Old Gorgon Graham,” to his Son, Pierrepont, facetiously known to his intimates as 'Piggy.'  George Horace Lorimer was an American journalist and author best known as the editor of The Saturday Evening Post. During his editorial reign, the Post rose from a circulation of several thousand to over a million. He is credited with promoting or discovering a large number of American writers like Jack London.  Lorimer’s Letters From A Self-Made Merchant To His Son is a timeless collection of Gilded Age aphorisms from a rich man - a prosperous pork-packer in Chicago to his son, Pierrepont, whom he ‘affectionately’ calls ‘Piggy.’ The writing is subtle and brilliant.  ‘One of the under-rated masterpieces of American satire.’  *Includes image gallery. *Special low price.
