Growing up mostly human in a Lycan pack has been hard for Shay. Shunned and distrusted by most, she wouldn’t have survived without the support of her foster family and alpha. She’s had a longtime secret crush on Trayis, her alpha’s VampLycan half-brother. Shay thinks he’s hot and finds the courage to approach Trayis during one of his infrequent visits. She’s hoping for just one night of ecstasy before she spends her life alone, unwanted.  Trayis is stunned when he realizes the sweet, timid Shay is interested in bedding him. He’s also furious when some pack women attempt to humiliate her in front of him. He’s more than happy to pick her over one of them. She might not be his type but it’s just sex. He’s up for that. What he doesn’t plan on is how she makes him feel.  So much for a simple vacation and a one-night stand.
