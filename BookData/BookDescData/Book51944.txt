This uniquely shaped board book celebrates the cycle of the year with a tree that blossoms in spring, bears fruit in summer, sheds its leaves in fall, and cradles snow in winter. Young readers follow the passage of seasons in a succession of spreads, each filled with simple text and intriguing lift-the-flaps that reveal the many creatures—from owls to bumblebees—who all find shelter in the tree's boughs.
