While Yuri attends to the prisoners taken by the Dark Prince's armies, hoping they can rise up and fight again, Prince Kail and his brother, Zannazana, journey into enemy territory. If they misstep, the consequences will be great-for both the future of the Hittite empire and Yuri and Kail's relationship.
