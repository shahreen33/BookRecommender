Ever had to wake up and go to a dead-end job? The clerks of America’s fourth most-trusted cellular carrier feel your pain. This Jog Mobile location just outside of Pittsburgh employs the lovable underachiever Devin, under-employed MBA Elena, privileged heiress Parker, sarcastic high schooler Rey, former journalist Jerry, and their oblivious dude-bro manager, Christian. (Before you ask: No, they can’t put that new smartphone aside for you, it’s against company policy.) Share in the misadventures, from break-room pranks to midnight phone launches gone awry; from awkward crushes to nightmare customers. Who will make it to assistant manager? Who will make it out of this town? Who knows―these barely-minimum-wage drones are just trying to survive to closing time.
