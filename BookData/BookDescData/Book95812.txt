“If ever I am gifted the opportunity to betray you, I’ll take it.If life hands me the chance to destroy you, I will.Today. Tomorrow. Ten years from now.I will always seek revenge.And you will never stop looking over your shoulder.”Ten years ago, I crushed Damiano De Luca’s heart,vowing false promises I never delivered.The revenge? Didn’t happen.The destruction? As if I could.Betrayal? Not. A. Chance.We were 18 when I left, taking my secrets with me.Now at 28, there’s no trace of the jaded mafia prince with the protective streak.He’s crueler. Colder. More calculated than ever.And he’s glaring at me from a funeral pew,looking at me and my wedding ring like we should be the ones buried six feet under.The war is back on, but I’m not that teenaged girl anymore.This time, there will be blood.And it won’t be mine.
