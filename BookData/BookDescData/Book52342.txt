A tough-as-nails businesswoman. An arrogant Navy SEAL. A power struggle with no end in sight.Some people hook-up at weddings. Others break a hotel room bed (and a table, and a desk, and some complimentary bathrobe belts) and discover they've been surviving on bargain basement orgasms their entire lives.The last one? Yeah. That's all me.She's driven and demanding...I wasn't always a bitch. There's a dirty little trick to succeeding in business: the sweet and innocent rarely survive. I fought my way up from nothing, and I don't bend for anyone.Until Will Halsted ties me to a headboard and makes me his...for now.One wild, filthy night turns into another, and then...we can't stop. Each time we're together is more addictive than the last, but it's nothing more than a sexy escape from reality.Or is it?He's never walked away from a challenge...I wasn't always a warrior but now it's in my bones and blood. That's what years spent in the Special Forces does to a man. My entire life is classified: where I've been, what I've seen, what I've done, and there's no mission too dangerous.Until I realize that falling for Shannon Walsh is like trying to swim against a riptide. She's going to tear me up and toss me to the shore, and I'll love every minute of it.Every time I'm down range, I want her counting the hours until I'm back. Waiting for me. She's done it before; she'll do it again.Or will she?They're wrong for each other in every possible way...Or are they?
