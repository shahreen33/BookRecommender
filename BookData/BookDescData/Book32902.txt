It took only four months to bring the angels to their knees…  With a virus ravaging the fallen angels on earth, mankind’s symbol of love and hope is at risk of extinction.  Centuries ago, a group of angelic warriors known as The Fallen risked everything to save themselves and carve a future for their kind. Hope slips away as The Fallen and their kin are cut down by an ancient menace, La Morte Nera—and no one saw it coming.  Only one immortal can save them, and only one mortal can stand in his way…  When Nephilim warrior Killian St. James sets out on a quest to find a cure, he and his blade-brothers discover nineteen-year-old Aubrey Carter—a human with a past as dark as it is mysterious—cowering in an abandoned house in the heart of Memphis, Tennessee.  The corrupted races are chasing her, and Killian is determined to find out why…  But neither he nor Aubrey are prepared for their attraction to one another, or for the frightening truths lurking in the shadows. The painful childhood memories Aubrey has buried hold precious answers. Answers that threaten to tear Killian's world apart.  With her life hanging in the balance, Killian must choose between the future of The Fallen, and the human girl he's pledged to protect.  Demons are rising, and this time they plan to win the war for dominion once and for all.
