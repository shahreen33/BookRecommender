The exciting prequel to Terry Goodkind's much-loved, highly successful Sword of Truth series--complete with a specially commissioned author's introduction and exclusive full-page illustrations by artist Keith Parkinson! Goodkind's fervent admirers have sent all his books in this landmark fantasy series soaring to the top of the best-seller lists...and the Debt of Bones will surely continue tradition. Pre-dating Wizard's First Rule, and featuring one of the fans' favorite characters (First Wizard Zedd), this epochal tale gives fresh insight to that later story. It begins as a young woman arrives at Aydrindril to petition for help in the war against D'Hara and the vicious rule of Panis Rahl. Little does the First Wizard, much less the woman herself, realize an act from her past will force him into a cataclysmic duel of magic with Panis Rahl himself.
