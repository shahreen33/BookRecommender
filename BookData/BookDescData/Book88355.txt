The Hunt for the Golem is a mini-campaign for Frostgrave: Fantasy Wargames in the Frozen City. Over the course of three scenarios, the wizards and their warbands will learn about the Granite Golem, a unique monster rampaging through the ruins. They will then go on the hunt for the Golem, first to study it, then in an effort to capture or destroy it. They will also have a chance to find some unique new treasures.
