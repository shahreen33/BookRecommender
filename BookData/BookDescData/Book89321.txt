Only a conman can save the world.  For a millennium, the Dragonstone atop a vibrant port city’s pyramid has prevented the Orc Gods from returning to the world and re-enslaving mankind.  Now, with the authorities and crime families teetering on the brink of war, only Cassius Larusso can recruit a team to keep the Dragonstone out of evil hands. A descendant of the Diviner who first banished the Orc Gods, he might be convinced to act— as long as it fills his coffers with gold, his stomach with delicious food, and his bed with a different type of delicacy.  Unfortunately, his choice of companions is limited to the poor souls who come seeking his sometimes fraudulent divinations:  A half-elf spy tracking an assassin. A sorceress searching for a traitor. A paladin pursuing his forbidden love.  If he can trick coax them into putting aside their own agendas and taking up his own, Cassius might be able to stave off a war, secure his city, and write his own destiny. If not, what begins as a back-alley battle may bring about the downfall of humanity.  In a game of deceptions, which side will you fight for?
