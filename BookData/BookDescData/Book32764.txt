The great state of Texas is a land of opportunity. For outlaws. And horse thieves. And cattle rustlers. Not to mention, bank robbers, train robbers, and anything-that-ain't nailed down robbers. The state's governor, Richard B. Hubbard, is at the end of his rope. He wants to clean up Texas once and for all--and he's desperate enough to try something crazy: hire a man who can do what the Texas Rangers can't. A man not tied down by a wife or children. Or Rules. Who's not afraid to go outside the law. Who will protect the good people of Texas at any cost--and put the blast on anyone who gets in his way... He needs a man like Cullen McCabe, a small town sheriff.
