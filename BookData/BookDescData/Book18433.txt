Years have passed since the Vagrant journeyed to the Shining City, Vesper in arm and Gammaâ€™s sword in hand.Since then the world has changed. Vesper, following the footsteps of her father, journeyed to the breach and closed the tear between worlds, protecting the last of humanity, but also trapping the infernal horde and all those that fell to its corruptions: willing or otherwise.In this new age it is Vesper who leads the charge towards unity and peace, with seemingly nothing standing between the world and a bright new future.That is until eyes open.And The Seven awakes.
