Plum wants a pet. Plum's dad wants NO pets. But Plum never takes no for an answer. So she gets the only pet she can: a pet dad. He loves playtime, tummy rubs, and scratches behind the ears. But he won't sit or fetch or chase. How will Plum train her perfect pet? Hilariously relatable and with ultra-cute art, Pet Dad is perfect for kids who love or want pets--or who already have the perfect parents to make up for it.
