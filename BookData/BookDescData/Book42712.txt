HUMPTY-DUMPTY was a smooth, round little chap, with a winning smile, and a great golden heart in his broad breast. Only one thing troubled Humpty, and that was, that he might fall and crack his thin, white skin; he wished to be hard, all the way through, for he felt his heart wabble when he walked, or ran about, so off he went to the Black Hen for advice. This Hen was kind and wise, so she was just the one, for him to go to with his trouble.
