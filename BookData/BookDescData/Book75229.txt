Bounce a ball right off your hands. Bounce it off your toes. Try to bounce a beach ball on the tip of your nose! Doreen Cronin and Scott Menchin, who had toddlers all over America jiggling with Wiggle, invite them now to hop, leap, pounce, and bounce to their hearts' content (though not on couches!). Because, after all, it's better to have bounced and bumped than never to have bounced at all.
