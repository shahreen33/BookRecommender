Grim Reaper Academy is a prison, and my father is the jailor. Since he’s been appointed Headmaster, he’s been changing all the rules. There’s a curfew now, students are not allowed to gather in groups, and all connections with the outside have been cut. And don’t think that because I’m his daughter, the rules don’t apply to me. On the contrary, he’s even more of a tyrant. He’s forbidden me from seeing my lovers, GC and Paz. He says he’ll find me a match worthy of my name. Unfortunately for him, I am my father’s daughter. I do not break. I don’t even bend. And just to piss him off, I won’t only keep dating GC and Paz, but I might even adopt Sariel and Francis, too. ***Author's Note: This is book 3 in the Grim Reaper Academy series, intended for mature audiences. Please be advised that it may contain situations that are triggering to some, profanity (way more than in my previous books!), and a lot of steam.
