Max and the other members of the Flock -- six kids who share her remarkable ability -- have been asked to aid a group of environmental scientists studying the causes of global warming. The expedition seems like a perfect combination of adventure, activism -- and escaping government forces who watch the Flock like a hawk.But even in Antarctica, trapped in the harshest weather on our planet, Maximum Ride is an irresistible target in constant danger.
