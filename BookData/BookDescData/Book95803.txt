MackenzieWhen I first met Ryland Bennett, I was a blubbering mess.When I quite literally ran into him the second time, he took me to the ER.When we had seen each other the third time, that was our moment. The one that changed both of our lives.The last 6 years have been the most difficult, and lonely, of my life. Moving to Charleston to help open a bakery that my best friend Talia had started, was the only thing keeping me going after tragedy had struck. Then I met Ryland, and I don’t think falling in love had ever been easier. But as quickly as we fell in love, the end was dangling in front of us. A clock counting down. Both of us staring down the barrel of a gun, unsure if it was loaded, with a finger on the trigger.I had to learn quickly that if you want something bad enough, you have to fight for it.RylandMoments. Life is all collective moments in time that define you. And I’ve gone through several in my life that have changed me. Some for the worse, some for the better.Mackenzie was a better. Actually, she was the best moment ever brought into my life. Just like every one of my moments with her have been. These are the ones I find myself hanging onto with every fiber of my soul now.Because the good things in life are taken away sooner than you think.
