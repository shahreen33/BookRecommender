Clarice Bean is in for a spell of trouble -- and shares a lesson about kindness -- in this hilarious sequel to the New York Times bestseller.Clarice Bean seems to be in nonstop trouble these days, almost as much as Karl Wrenbury, who is the naughtiest boy at school. If only she could be more like her favorite book character, Ruby Redfort, girl detective, who is very good at getting out of trouble. The problem is, Mrs. Wilberton is planning a spelling bee, and just thinking about it gives Clarice a stomachache. But when Karl Wrenbury has a family problem and gets into really big trouble, Clarice does something utterly unexpected, altruistically proving Ruby Redfort's maxim "Never let a good pal down." The superbly talented Lauren Child presents a fast-paced, full-length adventure full of wacky wit, visual appeal, and a surprisingly heartwarming twist sure to reel in the most reluctant reader.
