The Forever Trilogy hasn't ended yet...now it's time for Connor &amp; Ellery's son to tell his story... I’d like to introduce myself. My name is Collin Black, and I’m the future CEO of Black Enterprises. At twenty-two years old, I’m living the American dream, or at least my version of it. I’m rich, fit, sexy, and no matter where I go, women are always throwing themselves at me. I love to party, and when I do, it can sometimes lead to trouble. Women. What can I say? One woman broke my heart which led me to close myself off so it could never happen again. I’ve become one of New York’s most eligible bachelors and bad boy. I leave a trail of broken hearts wherever I go. Until her. This is my journey of going through the ups and downs of life as I climb the corporate ladder, heal a broken heart, and discover that there’s more life than what I thought. She. Changed. Everything.
