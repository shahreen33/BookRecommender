Created by the incalculably ancient Iconians, whose transcendent technology is quantum levels beyond that of the Federation and its allies, the Gateways offer instantaneous transport across unimaginable distances. Throughout the known galaxy, from Deep Space Nine(TM) to the New Frontier, from the Delta Quadrant to the bridge of the "Starship Enterprise(TM)," the sudden reactivation of the Gateways has destabilized interstellar relations between planets and cultures previously separated by countless light-years. Starfleet's finest have coped with the crisis as best they can, but circumstances have forced several valiant commanders to leap through separate Gateways into the unknown. Captain James T. Kirk of the original "Starship Enterprise"Captain Jean-Luc Picard of "Star Trek: The Next Generation(R)"Colonel Kira Nerys of "Deep Space Nine"Captain Kathryn Janeway of the "U.S.S. Voyager(TM) "Captains Calhoun and Shelby of "Star Trek: New Frontier"Commander Nick Keller of the "U.S.S.
