Lucia Marcello is the good girl—or she used to be. The youngest mafia principessa of her family, she's not the one who falls for the man from the wrong side of the tracks, and she certainly shouldn't have run across the country with him.  She'll leave everything behind for him …  Renzo Zulla is the bad guy—society and life labeled him that way. The only person left to take care of his siblings, he couldn't afford the distraction of falling in love with a rich girl far beyond his league, and he definitely shouldn't have her riding shotgun as he runs for his life.  He doesn't want her anywhere else …  Love keeps them together. Fear keeps them running. Chaos follows them everywhere they go.  How long can they keep moving before someone finally catches up?  The cost of love is always high. Never harbor it blindly.  Note: Harbor is book two in a three-book trilogy following the same couple.
