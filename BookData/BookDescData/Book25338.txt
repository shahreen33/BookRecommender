 Fatbrain Review  Most experienced designers agree: though HTML offers unlimited opportunities to present information, it is a lousy place to learn design techniques, and all too often publishers let HTML limitations dictate pages that are ugly, boring and difficult to use. Don't be boxed in by HTML -- set your creativity free by learning basic design principles to use in creating innovative Web pages. This is the book recommended to teach even the visually-impaired the basics of layout and design, and it's drawn rave reviews from the Webmasters who frequent Web publishing newsgroups. One reader said "Most Web page design books just teach you various tricks and never teach you how to think and see. Robin's book talks about the basic principles which are equally applicable in We! b pages." Learn how to organize information effectively, the best typefaces to drive home your page's message, which colors and backgrounds are best for your needs and other basics of design, invaluable background for anyone hoping to create distinctive pages on the Web. If your design eye could use some refining, The Non-Designer's Design Book is the book you need.
