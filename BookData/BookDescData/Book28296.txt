#1 New York Times bestselling author and Bram Stoker nominee Kami Garcia (Beautiful Creatures, Dangerous Creatures, Unbreakable &amp; Unmarked) blends magic, dark fantasy, and the paranormal in a story with shades of The Night Circus. Magic isn’t always as harmless as it seems. Illana grew up travelling with the carnival—a dark word of freak shows, corruption, and paranormal hoaxes. Now at seventeen, she longs for a normal life with friends and high school, romance and boyfriends—a life far from crystal balls, con artists, and the misfits she encounters as a fortune-teller. Everything changes the night Illana realizes her predictions are coming true.
