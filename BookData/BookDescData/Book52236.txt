Don’t tell anyone, but Jen is one of my favourite people.(Machines aren’t supposed to have favourites. Don’t ask me how this has happened.)Jen is sad. Aiden wants her to be happy. Simple? Except that Jen is a thirty-something woman whose boyfriend has just left her and Aiden is a very complicated, very expensive piece of software. Aiden has calculated that Jen needs a man in her life foroptimum wellbeing. And with the whole of the internet at his disposal, he doesn’t have to look far to find a perfect specimen and engineer a meeting. But what, exactly, makes human beingshappy? And can a very-artificially-intelligent machine discover emotional intelligence in time to fix Jen’s life?
