  What happens when a good girl and a bad boy fake an engagement?
My best friend's sister and I have a history that we'd rather keep secret.So when we make up a lie to get a loan, I should have seen the writing on the wall. Now, she's my fake fiancée, which means we'll be spending more time together.And Clarissa wants more than just free drinks.Good thing I'm the guy who can give her what she wants.As long as her brother doesn't find out what we're up to.It was just a teeny tiny lie we told the loan officer."Together? Yes, we're together."Now, Clarissa and I have to play like we're engaged.Pretending to be my fiancée is a huge favor. Given my notoriety, the bank won't loan to me unless I have a partner. Clarissa's putting her good girl reputation on the line for me, and I can't let her down.She claims it's because of a sacrifice I made for her, years ago, but I don't like delving into the past. Clarissa's got her own requirements for holding up her end of the bargain.She's heard about my 'special ability,' and not the fact that I make the best Martini in town.So we make an agreement: No feelings involved.Which, with her, turns into really hot benefits.Did I mention this was during our very public, very fake engagement?This is about to wrong in all the ways it can go wrong.Luckily, I know a guy who makes a hell of a stiff cocktail.I have a feeling I'm going to need one before this roller coaster ride is over.
