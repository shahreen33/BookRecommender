Life hasn’t been kind to me.  Combined with the world ending, storms ravaging the coast, and zombie-like creatures attacking, I’m not able to catch a break.  But this time? The world took it too far.  Separated from two of my men and grieving a third, I will stop at nothing to make our fractured team whole again.  New threats are lurking around every corner, and a new question arises: who will survive?  Sometimes we hide from our monsters...  ...and sometimes we hunt them down.   This is the final book of the Together We Fall series and features a reverse harem, whychoose romance. This means the MC will not have to choose between her love interests. You must have read the first three books in this series before this one. Be prepared for a word-vomiting MC and the men who love her.
