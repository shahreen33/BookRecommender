Award-winning author Michael Pickford brings us a delightful new series about a teen lawyer with Holmes-like powers of observation.  Samuel Hickson moved from Chicago to Tennessee to attend college. He sought a new roommate after suffering through living with three party animals.  Samuel’s neighbor introduced him to a strange young man named Zeblon Jack. Zeblon was a child prodigy who by the age of 18 had completed law school and passed the bar. He was also a loose cannon with no qualms about breaking the law to bring out the truth.  On their first meeting, Zeblon recited the details of Samuel’s morning with precise accuracy by simply noticing a few minor details about Samuel’s appearance.  Samuel learned about the murder of his Hebrew professor. He also learned the police had arrested one of his good friends for the murder. Zeblon got involved and led the straight-laced Samuel into risky and exciting adventures as they worked together to solve the crime.  THE CASE OF THE DEATH BOOK is a fun and challenging mystery for all ages!
