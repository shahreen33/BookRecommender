The call of the sea had always been deafening for Mitchell Tate, which is why Kaimte, a small coastal town in West Africa, was the perfect place for him. Brilliant surf conditions conjured up by the South Atlantic Ocean was the drawcard, and the laid-back lifestyle suited him to a tee. But even paradise has a dark side. When fellow Australian Shiloh Jenson arrives in town, his eyes are opened to a much seedier side of village life. Shiloh has a hidden agenda, and whether he likes it or not, Mitchell is along for the ride. Can be read as a standalone.
