My life is in a tail-spin and I’m about ready to crash.  I’ve cut Matt Connover out of my life… well, at least out of my bedroom… but I still have to deal with him at work. I have Lorraine intent on raining hell and destruction down upon me, which at least provides a nice diversion from my miserable feelings over Matt.  About the only good thing that has happened to me lately? Cal Carson asked me out… and I accepted.  Matt’s not going to like that. Not one little bit. But that’s not my problem now, is it?
