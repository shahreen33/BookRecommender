Elizabeth is furious when a girl new to the sixth form becomes head girl over the obvious choice, her friend Emma. The new head girl, Kerry, is a young actress, and Elizabeth is convinced that all the seniors have been swayed by her acting skills, both on screen and at school.

Kerry is cleverer than Elizabeth thinks, and somehow she just manages to make the Naughtiest Girl look like a troublemaker...
