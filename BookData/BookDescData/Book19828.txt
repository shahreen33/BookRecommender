Unlike many travel books, PAUL AND KIKI’S GUIDE TO VACATIONING IN ITALY is written in a very personal narrative style with over 100 beautiful pictures in this Black & White Edition that will help you go through the steps of planning your own itinerary to Italy to your favorite “must see” destinations, along with tips on how to make the most out of your vacation traveling time. And you are given enough information and tips to make up your own unique travel plans or you can just sit back, relax and replicate Paul and Kiki’s easy-to-follow vacation plans in this book. Paul and Kiki take you on an Italian vacation through Rome, Tivoli, Naples, Florence, and Pisa. This guide has included all the information you need on where to stay and eat, how to get around, where to shop, where to go and what to see. They also include where not to go (which is very important as you will see when you read this book) and information on what to do and who to contact in case of emergencies. And being seasoned world travelers who have taken a number of guests with them on several trips, they understand the information and important tips that are needed by those people who are not highly familiar with traveling to Italy. Paul and Kiki give you information that you do not want to miss on some of the best deals to look for that will save you money in food and other expenses while on your vacation.
