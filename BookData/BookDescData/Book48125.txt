In their own words, the incarcerated, the formerly incarcerated, and those who love them in this moving anthology explore the complex realities of marriages and relationships lived in the long shadow of prison. Defying the frightening myths and stereotypes to which the media and society have reduced them, the people in this collection eloquently tell their own stories and speak their own truths.
