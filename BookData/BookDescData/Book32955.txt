Everything you've heard about modeling is true, and you haven't heard the half of it. It's glamorous. It's sexy. And yes, the line between work and reality often blurs. We're not just prototypes of perfection. Models have feelings and desires, too. We may be genetically gifted, but we're still human. I'm only human. Yes, an extraordinary specimen that earns more in a day than most make in a year, but this eight pack didn't create itself. I spend hours working on this body. The good looks just come natural. *Winks* Thanks, Mom and Dad. I'm Danny Weston, Supermodel. But one path was traded for another when I chose this career. Ten years later, I would trade my career to have it back. To have her back. Reese Carmichael is the one woman I would give it all up for, and the only one I can't have. Yet.
