A compassionate, humorous story of faith, betrayal, and coming of age on the sawdust trail. Only three when her mother became tent revivalist David Terrell's organist, Donna was soon part of the hugely popular evangelist's inner circle. At seventeen, she left the ministry for good. Holy Ghost Girl brings to life miracles, exorcisms, and face-offs with the Ku Klux Klan--and that's just what went on under the tent. As Terrell's fame grew in the 1960s and '70s, the caravan of broken-down cars that made up his ministry evolved into fleets of Mercedes. The glories of the Word mixed with betrayals of the flesh, and Donna's mom bore Terrell's children in one of his secret households. Thousands of followers headed to cult-like communities to await the end of the world. Jesus didn't show, but the IRS did, and the prophet-healer went to prison. This memoir bypasses easy judgment to articulate a rich world in which the mystery of faith and human frailty share surprising and humorous coexistence.
