Triton: I took care of my sister the best I could after our parents died. I wasn’t the best big brother. I had my club to think about and dealing with a teenager wasn’t high on my list of things to do. Neither was that little surfer girl. She was mouthy and full of passion, something I wanted. But with all good things, it had to come to an end. She had bigger plans for her life and I wasn’t one to keep her tied down. Or was I?Saylor:  I had a plan for my life. I wanted to surf. I was good at it. Life had other plans for me though. Plans I wasn’t sure I wanted. Triton came into my world and ripped apart like a hurricane but he was always there for me. Now that I have the chance to further my career, I have to decide if I want to take it and leave him behind. Or do I stay with the one that cares about me?
