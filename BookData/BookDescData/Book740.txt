Rylee and Colton's ride continues...One moment. Six years ago.The night she made the world around me so much more than just a blur. Now it's the catalyst that threatens to tear us apart.Our happily was supposed to be ever after. So why do I feel like it's slipping through my fingers?How can one moment, when our world seemed so right, resurface and cause our perfect life to spiral out of control?I can't lose her.She's my checkered flag.
