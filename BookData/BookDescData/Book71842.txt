Someone at Project Blue was keeping a secret. A secret they thought they could contain. They thought wrong. Now, with 99 percent of the country's population dead or dying, the viral strain developed at project Blue--dubbed "Captain Trips"--has brought about the end of the world. For the survivors--including Nick Andros, Larry Underwood, Frannie Goldsmith and Stu Redman--this ending is a nightmare that's just begun. And for Randall Flagg, this is an American Nightmare come true, as his macabre vision of the future continues to unfold. Based on the popular apocalyptic novel by celebrated author Stephen King, The Stand: American Nightmares brings together the award-winning writing of Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (HBO's Big Love) and the gritty visuals of artists Mike Perkins (Captain America) and Laura Martin (Astonishing X-Men).
