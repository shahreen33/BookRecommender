 When the cop... Tough-as-nails detective Bonni Connolly is on a girls' Vegas getaway with her college friends, when she hits the jackpot. Taking advantage of her gift from Lady Luck, Bonni upgrades their trip for a once-in-a-lifetime experience in luxury and glamour. Seizing the opportunity to break out from her normal (formal) cop style, she splurges on a slinky designer dress and a VIP booth in an exclusive club. That's when she sees him, and Bonni decides there's another once-in-a-lifetime thing she wants to have: a vacation fling. 
  Meets the gambler...
Professional poker player Quinn Bryant is in town for one of the largest tournaments of the year and (as always) he plans to win. Determined to start off his vacation by getting lucky, he heads to his favorite club, where he spots Bonni across the dance floor. Fortune smiles on him when Bonni picks up the cards he puts down. However, what starts as a Vegas hook-up soon turns into something more, as Bonni learns to see the man behind the poker face. 
  The stakes have never been higher.
Even though Bonni's trip has an end date and there is another tournament calling Quinn's name, their strong connection overcomes their difference and they start to wonder if what happens in Vegas doesn't have to stay there.
