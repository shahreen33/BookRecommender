In Worlds of Gender ten prominent scholars consider the research on gender and archaeology that has been conducted around the world. The authors discuss the archaeological evidence for gender distinctions from Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Australia, Europe, Mesoamerica, North America, and South America. Although some regions of the world have only been studied sporadically, this volume brings together the totality of the evidence to make it possible to compare sexual roles and identities from far-flung cultures of vastly different time periods. Worlds of Gender is an excellent resource for comparative cultural studies and gender studies, as well as a useful examination of how gender roles affect social structures.
