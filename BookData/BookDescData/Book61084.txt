A May-to-December MMM Romance. What's the perfect recipe for an emotional MMM romance?  One autistic coffee shop owner, one morose mug maker, and a mostly cheerful police detective.  Fie Morogh Russell goes off to war with a broken heart and returns with a shattered spirit. He hermits away in Bideford, Devon, making mugs, with his service dog, Haggard, for company. Post-traumatic stress turns every memory into a minefield, and life is dismal with one or two rare exceptions.  Davet Heuse drags his younger brother to Bideford for a new start. Both autistic, the two siblings have fought hard to enjoy freedom by the seaside. While Davet runs a coffee shop from his tiny house, his brother pursues his dream at university.  Detective Sidney Little has transitioned from military service to the police force easily. His unrequited crushes and his estranged father are the only points of frustration in his life. He hasn't quite figured out how to deal with either problem.  When a tragic accident brings Davet's world crashing down around him, can Fie and Sid help him through the pain of loss?  
  In this May-December romance with a twist, three men struggle through one obstacle after the other to somehow find themselves in love on the other side.
