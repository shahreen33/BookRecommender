Being twenty-something isn’t as cut and dry as it once was. For many, the early twenties is a time of tumultuous upheaval: unpaid internships, tiny apartments filled with roommates, and worries about what the future holds. For others, this is a time of stagnancy: of waiting and hoping and hometowns, and wondering what the hell college degrees are good for anyway. Instead of first jobs, first marriages, and first homes, millennials have been faced with greater stresses and challenges than any other generation—yet, in the process of navigating a fast-changing world, they have been publicly maligned again and again.SONGS OF MY SELFIE: An Anthology of Millennial Stories celebrates the millennial through the works of up-and-coming fiction writers, all under the age of twenty-six. This collection features seventeen short stories by millennial writers about actual millennial issues, exposing this generation's true ambitions and frustrations, humor and heartbreak, despair and joie de vivre. With fresh new voices and edgy prose, these compelling stories offer a cross-section of vibrant millennial characters: unemployed grads deep in debt, expectant mothers on the cusp of adulthood, online relationship addicts, and millennials at war with their families' expectations—even while stuck living at home. Here are the strong and the weak, the self-aware and those who reject reality—all carefully crafted to buck the common perception of the millennial. And yet, with a knowing wink, each story is accompanied by a selfie of its author.Forget what the media says—SONGS OF MY SELFIE reveals what it really means to be twenty-something today.Stories include: The Most Laid-back Guy Ever by Suzanne HermanBecoming John Doe by Stephanie BramsonSmall Bump by Mina E.
