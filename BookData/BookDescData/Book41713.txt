Someone is drugging the fairest of them all and leaving them in the dark corners of the forests surrounding Port Mackenzie. The violent acts shroud the harbour town in mystery and fear. In a town where doors are left unlocked and everyone knows everyone else, Aimee James, the unlikeliest of them all, finds herself the next target. But as the stakes get higher and her body gets weaker, Aimee discovers there are worse things than dying. There is something called cursed.  This is the YA version of The Devil's Roses.
