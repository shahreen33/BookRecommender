The warm, hilarious story of the Gavin and Stacey cocreator and starAs far back as he can remember James Corden has only ever wanted to be in one place: in front of an audience, doing something to make them cry, shout, scream, or giggle uncontrollably—but it wasn't that easy getting there. Growing up, his dad would drive him up and down to London for auditions, sometimes three or four times a week, only to be met with constant rejections. Even the teenage distractions of girls, forming his own pop group, attempted (and failed) shoplifting, or the endless detentions he'd get from exasperated teachers didn't put him off. He knew where he wanted to be and he'd keep on trying until he got there, and here is the story of how he did it. From his time as one of the founding players of his school's first ever rugby team to nationwide fame as the loveably loud Smithy in the award-winning Gavin and Stacey, this is a tenderly—and very funnily—told story of what it’s like to try, try, and try again and get there in the end.
