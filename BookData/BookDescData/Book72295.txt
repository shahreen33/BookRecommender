Citizen Kane. Casablanca. Troll 2. Does one of these titles feel as though it doesn't belong with the other two as a monument of cinematic achievement? Or have you developed the sophisticated taste and keen eye that allows you to appreciate when a movie really is so bad, it's good, giving you the confidence and conviction to assert why Troll 2 truly is a movie for the ages? These questions are at the heart of So Bad, It's Good, Edward Scimia's fun and informative new guide to the ever-expanding catalogue of egregiously flawed, yet oddly endearing, B-movies.Watching bad movies can be surprisingly fun, if you choose the right films. In fact, after reading the profiles of more than fifty movies included in the book, you might just decide to have a "bad movie night" of your own. For those who love the barbed humor and wry perspective of shows like Mystery Science Theater 3000, So Bad, It's Good is an indispensable compendium that will thrill those intrepid film buffs who like to laugh at the worst cinema has to offer. Spanning decades and genres, So Bad, It's Good naturally explores inadvertent classics, such as Ed Wood?s Plan 9 From Outer Space, while equally gleaning more recent selections.Writing with an entertaining and engaging flair and drawing on a profound personal affection for bad movies, Edward Scimia lovingly pokes fun at these milestones of misguided cinematic ambition, while also documenting the sincere and earnest efforts that went into their creation. The result is a comprehensively researched and carefully curated guide to the best of the worst in movies full of ludicrous scenarios, implausible plot twists, and abysmally awkward dialogue. So Bad, It's Good also features a foreword by Allison Pregler of the web series "Obscurus Lupa Presents."
