Ryn finally has a name, and a chance at life now that Daros has been taken to the dungeons. Or at least she did until he escaped. Not knowing whether to be scared or filled with rage, Ryn sets her guards out to find him.  As much as she wants to help, Ryn must be the Queen her people needs. Or try to be. There's much she needs to do, but she sees Daros everywhere, hunting her. No one can seem to catch Daros, despite her spotting him, and his ruthlessness knows no bounds. When the unthinkable happens, Ryn must face her fears or lose all she's gained.
