*** A Steamy Regency Romance*** Miss Amanda Waters knew full well that a rake should not be trusted. But when a severely wounded Lord Warwick crashed through her front door, bleeding, and asking her to keep his secret. What choice did she have?  Heaven help her if anyone learned she was nursing a British Lord back to health in her upstairs bedroom. Her friends would disown her and most of the ton would think her a fool. But when she discovers Lord Warwick’s true mission, she has no choice but to help.  Lord Warwick never expected to need the help of someone like Miss Waters. But his mission was too important. England’s very survival rested in the balance.  The fact that it might cost him his heart was immaterial. Somethings cannot be denied.
