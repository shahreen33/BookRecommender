They say that love happens when you least expect it. Meet the star of this story, Hunter "Rush" Cambridge: Heartthrob, somewhat of a local celebrity, and hugely guarded of those he loves. Rush has never been in love. Lust is more his thing. In fact, he's all business. The former athlete and current bar owner is solely focused on getting his new mega club up and running. But then Alika Collins comes crashing into his life-literally. Alika has flown from Las Vegas, to the Bay Area to meet up with someone that she met online. Only when she arrives, things quickly go south and Alika realizes that she has made the biggest mistake of her life. But did she? Sometimes bad things occur so that better things can replace them... After Alika manages to escape her situation, she finds refuge in the backseat of Rush's car. Everything moves quickly from that point as she is insinuated into his world. Although Rush is preparing for the opening of his new club, he is compelled to be a source of help to her, in the process. But while Rush is helping to sort out pieces of Alika's life, he's got a few problems of his own. There are forces conspiring to take down everything that he has worked so hard for, and he's not having it. Will Rush emerge unscathed once the truth comes out? Will there be love at the end for him and Alika, or is he just the person who happened to come along when she needed a friend the most?
