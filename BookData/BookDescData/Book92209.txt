3 hrs 28 minsCan a New York cop and a teacher find love in the city at Christmas?It's been far too long since Christian Matthews has seen Daniel Bailey. In fact, the last time they met, Chris was a senior in college and he was the TA tasked with helping Daniel who was a way too confident freshman.Seven years down the road, Chris is licking his wounds after being asked to leave the private school where he was teaching. He has no job, no money, and has to rely on his friend, Amelia, for the job and a room to live in. He needs a freaking Christmas miracle to make this season anything other than a total loss.Then Daniel comes back into his life, and suddenly everything seems possible. Not only is Daniel still the man Christian wants more than anything, but this time Chris may well actually tell Daniel how he feels.
