Juliet Evans has always been a bit of a loner, but the last few years have been particularly shrouded in isolation and silence. Apart from her daily work at the local diner, her life is spent inside the walls of her tiny apartment, just trying to survive…until the one day that U.S. Army Private Tim Collins walks into the diner and takes a seat at one of her tables. By the time the day is over her life has been changed forever. Private Collins is just a few hours away from being deployed for the first time, to a particularly violent conflict. To say he’s nervous would be an understatement. In his last day stateside all he wants is a little bit of normal. What he finds is the kind heart and sweet spirit of Juliet Collins. She is by his side until the last possible moment, the moment when he asks her to write him while he’s away, promising to do the same in return. Though Juliet is afraid to believe his promises, he holds true to them. Letter after letter after letter passes between the two of them…until one day the letters from Tim stop completely, leaving Juliet broken and grieving for the love she had found but would never truly have.
