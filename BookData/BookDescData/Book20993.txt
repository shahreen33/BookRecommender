Whoever said money couldn't buy happiness has never starved a day in their lives.My name is Aria Valencia, a third year classical music student at the University, and I was down to my last dollar. Some nights, I seriously considered stripping at the Skin Bar just to make ends meet, but the thought of my dad's spirit--God rest his soul--scowling at me while I shoved my breasts into some pervert's face was enough to turn me off the idea completely.And then one night, chance came knocking on my door under the guise of the Midnight Society, a secret cabal comprised of the most wealthy and influential souls this side of the Universe. Their leader was a man named Shadow, who was equally enigmatic as he was gorgeous and, for some mystifying reason, had his dark brooding eyes focused on me.Seduced by the promises of fame and fortune in exchange for a seemingly innocent request, I soon found myself drawn into a provocative world filled with both vast riches and unending lies and it didn't take long for me to realize what being a part of the Midnight Society actually entailed: shiny things, hot sex, and dead bodies.There's a dark side to every love story, and this one was mine.***Additional info: This is book one of a series entitled: The Midnight Society.ON SALE @ AMAZON UNTIL JANUARY 1st, 2014http://www.amazon.com/Semblance-Midni...
