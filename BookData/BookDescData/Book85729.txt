“Judge me all you want. I apologize for nothing. She may have been my father’s wife, but I saw her first.”LeviTwenty years of pure torture. Twenty years of watching the only woman that I’ve ever come close to loving married to someone else. Twenty years of pleading with her to change her mind. Of being jerked around, frustrated, and confused.Now he’s gone, and the question is, was it ever real? Or was it just the thrill of the chase?NatalieTwenty years of pain. Of watching the choices of my youth destroy everyone I love.Of being so near to what I crave, but fighting temptation with everything I have.One act of selfish weakness tore apart so many lives, and I won’t ever allow that to happen again.No matter how many sacrifices I've had to make, I have only one regret . . .Him.
