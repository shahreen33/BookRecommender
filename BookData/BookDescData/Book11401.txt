Create your own Dork Diary! A special, interactive addition to the New York Times bestselling series.I’ve been writing in my diary since the start of the school year, and I almost always take it wherever I go—but OMG!—of course, one morning I just could not find it ANYWHERE! Eek! I looked for it EVERYWHERE, writing down anywhere I thought it could maybe be . . . . losing your diary is the WORST!! Then I decided that until I find it, I totally HAD to put together a list of important diary-keeping lessons to remember in case of missing diary emergencies like this one.This diary is full of tips from me on fun things to write about in your diary, with space for you to write and draw your own entries. Meanwhile, my BFFs Chloe and Zoey, my ANNOYING little sister Brianna, my crush Brandon (sighhh), and mean girl MacKenzie are all involved in the search for my real diary, with plenty of adventures along the way!
