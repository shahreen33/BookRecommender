Tucked safely away from the world on their peninsula, the three 'Veld kingdoms--Estveld, Ostveld, and Norveld--have little to do with the rest of the world, instead focusing their efforts on fighting amongst themselves. But the world hasn't forgotten about them, and the Cheil Empire has turned its armies their way.The three 'Velds ally together, but even their combined might is not enough to prevent their eventual defeat. The kings are forced to surrender, but the terms for Estveld and Ostveld appear suspiciously lenient; each kingdom maintains its independence, so long as the royal bloodline continues unbroken. The only catch seems to be that the Cheil Emperor is allowed to choose each generation's bride.Prince Cavan of Ostveld is unhappy with the terms because he fears he won't be allowed to marry the princess to whom he was betrothed. Prince Gair of Estveld is disgruntled because he never intended to marry at all. But the surrender is already signed, and the princes are left with no choice but to travel to the capital of the Cheil Empire where they will learn who--or what--the Emperor has in store for them.
