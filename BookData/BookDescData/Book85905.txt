The loyalty that binds me to the biker gang I've been in my whole life isn’t loyalty at all. It’s fatigue. Exhaustion from the game I've played for so many years. I've had fictitious freedom for five years but I knew eventually they'd be back. I was expecting it after all. What I wasn't expecting was Ramsey. She was supposed to come in and out of my life, quickly like a fast-moving storm. But against her own plans, she’s been thrust into my world. The only problem is, the freedom I need is solely based on knowing the game. And she just changed it. I don't fully know Jimmy Stenson and I don't entirely understand him but I want him. Against every fiber of sense in my brain, and every morsel of caution in my heart. I do. He's a single dad- with the world's cutest kids. He's my boss. He's my enemy....and after a strange kind of agreement; my friend. He's going to ruin me if I don't get free of him. Too bad the skeleton's in his closet had the same idea. Biker gang...Motorcycle Club...The Brass...none of it mattered when it all ended with me tied to a chair, begging for mercy from a demon in a leather cut.
