London at night has always been seen as a lawless orgy of depravity and pestilence. But is it now as bland and unthreatening as any new town? Sukhdev Sandhu journeys across the city to find out whether the London night really has been rendered neutral by street lighting and CCTV cameras. His nocturnal forays see him prospecting in the London night with the people who drive its pulse, from the avian police to security guards, urban fox hunters and exorcists. He wades through the sewers, hangs out with pirate DJs, and accompanies the marine patrol looking for midnight corpses. Beautifully written, Night Haunts seeks to reclaim the mystery and romance of the cityâ€”to revitalize the great myth of London for a new century.
