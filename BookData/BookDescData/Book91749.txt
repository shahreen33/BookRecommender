Poetry. "This wise, playful, polyvalent masterwork reflects a singular, patient, astutely observant, pertinacious man's lifelong commitment to participating, justly and compassionately, in the world as he has found it around him. Collom's vision is of a natural complex that is extravagantly complicated and deliriously infinite."--Lyn Hejinian"SECOND NATURE reads like an early morning look at a wild alpine meadow with critters large and small popping up and back down--birds flitting and cruising, never still--easy to lose the thread. Bigger than we thought. Dawn. Collom has always been a leader."--Gary Snyder
