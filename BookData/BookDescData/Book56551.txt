One night of complete surrender is all it takes.  Gareth Harris is Manchester United’s reclusive star defender. He has control over all aspects of his life. But a lifetime of supporting his siblings and filling in for an emotionally absent father has taken its toll.  Sloan Montgomery is a clothing stylist whose world was turned upside down when she found herself pregnant and moving to Manchester with a man who was never supposed to be her forever. Now recently divorced and struggling with shared custody of her daughter, control is a fleeting concept for this American living in England.  Both Gareth and Sloan are in need of a release.  A moment in time where they can forget about their pasts and family pressures...and just...  ...surrender.  No one could predict what happens when both of their defences are down.  Surrender is part one of the Final Harris Brother Duet and concludes with Dominate. This duet reads great on it's own, but to maximize enjoyment, check out the first three brothers’ books in Challenge, Endurance, and Keeper
