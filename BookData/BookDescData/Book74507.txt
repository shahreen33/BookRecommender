A bar in Liverpool, January 2nd 2000: Kelly and Victor, both coming down from the recent global party, meet, and some time later that night they are in her bed. The story of Kelly and Victor progresses, through two mirror-image narratives—a story of the growth and spiralling intensity of a sexual obsession, traced to its inevitable, devastating conclusion. Set against a backdrop of urban despair, spiritual absence and a world swamped with pornography, this is a novel about yearning for union, for purity, and for magic and mystery in a world that denies them all.
