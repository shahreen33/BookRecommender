Blinky Bill, the mischievous little koala, has been a favourite with children since his first appearance in 1933. His shenanigans at Miss Pym′s shop and in Farmer Smifkins′s veggie patch quickly earned him a devoted following.Blinky Bill Grows Up and Blinky Bill and Nutsy followed in 1935 and 1938, and the three stories were first combined in an omnibus edition in 1939. As with Snugglepot and Cuddlepie and The Magic Pudding, the original illustrations have been re-scanned, creating a stunning version of this well-loved omnibus classic.
