There are rules to life that one just obeys in order in her attempt to stay on the right path. For example: 1. You don’t wear dirty panties out of the house. You just never know who’s going to see them. 2. A lady must always have chocolate at the ready—just in case the world as she knows it comes to an end. 3. You don’t egg on a drunk woman who’s pissed off at life.  Why, you ask? Because they start bar fights, that’s why. Casten Red, the unofficial enforcer of The Uncertain Saints MC, wasn’t necessarily trying to urge her into doing anything illegal, and he definitely wasn’t trying to get her into a fight with a group of men who were all twice her size. No, he only intended to give her the confidence to stand up for herself, just a little nudge in the right direction. How the hell was he supposed to know she’d go all Chuck Norris on them and put three of them in the hospital with concussions? He should’ve followed his gut instinct and turned around that first moment he saw her in the bar, but Casten has never liked following the rules. Why the hell would he start now?
