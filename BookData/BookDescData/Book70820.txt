'It's near-impossible to chose a favourite character in Alex Milway's utterly charming Hotel Flamingo; a marvellous menagerie, where the chef is a pig, the handyman a giraffe and where cockroaches are welcome paying guests ... a tale of co-operation, ingenuity and fun, all brought to life in Milway's pitch-perfect words and pictures. Funny though it is - and it's certainly that - it's also truly heartwarming and uplifting. I'd love to book a room there myself.'
