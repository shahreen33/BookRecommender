Whether you are planning to visit a city, a region or a country, DK's foolproof 'Eyewitness' approach makes learning about a place a pleasure in itself. All the traditional guidebook subject matter is covered-descriptions of sights, opening times, hotels, restaurants, shopping, entertainment, phrase books etc- but, with the help of specially commissioned illustrations and maps, DK makes essential information easy to access and quick to absorb. No other guides explain the history of a place as clearly in words and pictures. DK Eyewitness Travel Guides-the best guides ever created. Argentina's vibrant, wonderfully idiosyncratic capital, Buenos Aires, is the third largest city in Latin America, yet it is a resolutely human kind of place. Famous for its tango, football and European-style architecture, it also holds hidden gems, including picturesque cobbled neighborhoods, sophisticated shopping and some of the best and most varied cuisine in the whole continent. Cinemas and art galleries, jazz clubs and theatres, atmospheric caf√©s and antiques markets abound, while exercising or just lazing around in beautifully landscaped parks filled with subtropical vegetation are part of the dynamic yet laid-back porte-o lifestyle.
