In The Devil’s Crescent, hardened bounty hunter Diego Montoya descends upon a small Texas village in the midst of a cloudburst and boldly plunges into the life of beautiful, small time cattle rancher, Maggie MacNaughton. Diego is a man haunted by a past filled with death and disappointment, a nobleman fleeing from the dictates of his demanding father and an arranged marriage.When a U.S. Marshall asks Diego to infiltrate a gun runner’s operation, Diego reluctantly agrees, shadowing the powerful land baron, Morgan Lansing. Morgan’s efforts play into the hands of a group of Mexican nationalists, who quickly claim the land vacated by the terrified settlers until only one parcel stands in the way of their march toward the border -- the one occupied by Maggie MacNaughton. Diego and Maggie match wits and wills as the danger mounts. Only their reliance upon each other has the power to save them from a swift and certain death.
