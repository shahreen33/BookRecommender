Melt-in-the-mouth Red Velvet Cake; delicate Fondant Fancies; delicious Fig and Rosemary Pizza. For many celiacs or people allergic or intolerant to gluten and/or dairy, making any of these seems far too difficult. But best-selling author and leading expert in the thriving “free-from” community, Grace Cheetham, shows how easy it is to work with gluten-free flours and grains, and dairy-free products, to transform their culinary lives. Intolerant to both gluten and dairy, Grace has spent years developing delicious recipes from alternative ingredients to inspire those who follow her popular blog (glutendairyfree.co.uk). And now with every large supermarket stocking a wide range of these gluten- and dairy-free ingredients, it’s never been easier to cook up a feast! From breads and cookies to cakes and desserts, and even baked main meals, Grace’s new book offers so much variety you’ll never feel like you’re missing out again. Soft bread studded with sun-dried tomatoes and fragrant thyme leaves, Carrot and Cardamom Cake with a fluffy lime frosting, or Flatbreads with Spicy Chermoula-glazed Lamb—these are just a few of the dishes you can create. What’s more, all the irresistible recipes take the stress out of baking free-from food.
