Lord Brocktree, the 13th novel in Brian Jacques's exciting Redwall series, brings to life the tale of how the greatest badger lord of all came to save Salamandastron, the mountain home of many heroic creatures. Everybeast will love heroic Lord Brocktree and his amazing adventure. As the story opens, the villainous Ungatt Trunn, a menacing wildcat, has brought his powers to bear on Salamandastron, threatening the peace-loving beasts who live there.Loneliness was everywhere. Hopelessness and an air of foreboding had settled over the western shores, casting their pall over land, sea and the mountain of Salamandastron. Yet nobeast knew the cause of it. But all is not lost. Old Lord Stonepaw, the venerable Badger Ruler, summons the strongest of the strong to take over as lord of the mountain fortress and battle the evil wildcat. Lord Brocktree, far away from the trouble, begins to have visions that beckon him to Salamandastron. He travels there with his companion, a young haremaid named Dotti. But can he raise an army in time to smash Ungatt Trunn's terrifying Blue Hordes? Like all the Redwall books, Lord Brocktree is a rollicking tale of adventure, war, magic, and beastly battles. The animal characters are sometimes brusque and brutal, and there's a strong current of darkness in the stories, as well as no-nonsense death scenes and strong language. But for fans of medieval fantasy adventure with a twist, this unforgettable series continues to satisfy.Ages 9 and older) --Therese Littleton
