This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN B00K4FJVJ2 IT’S THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH . . . Izzy Dalton’s about to strike out. Her new job as the sideline reporter for the Portland Pioneers major league baseball team is problematic on several levels: 1. Baseball is her least-favorite sport. Falling behind golf, tennis, and maybe even curling. 2. What Izzy knows about baseball could fill about three minutes of airtime. 3. Her last experience in front of a camera was in college. Six years ago. 4. The Pioneers’ second baseman has a wicked sense of humor and even wickeder blue eyes. AND A FULL COUNT. . . Jack Bennett couldn’t be more uninterested in a little sideline action. He just wants to show up at the park and win baseball games. Izzy is the one woman he should steer clear of, but she’s also the key to his success–and his heart, too. All Izzy has to do is convince her misogynistic boss she’s competent, learn what the heck an RBI is, and stay away from Jack Bennett. Izzy tells herself it’ll be a snap, but 162 games is longer than she ever imagined and Jack more irresistible than she counted on.
