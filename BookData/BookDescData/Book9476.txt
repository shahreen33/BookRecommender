I have a craving; a dark urge I’m failing to resist despite years of trying to do that very thing.I’ve force myself to hide behind a mask, a perfect manipulation to hide my true self.When I meet Lucia, my wants and inner most desires change. She encourages me to embrace who I truly am, and is willing to do anything and everything I want, giving herself to me to satisfy my most carnal appetite.Then everything in my carefully managed world comes crashing down around me at the hands of a stranger bent on destruction. A moment in time, a loss of control, and the very thing I cherish is nearly taken from me.My fate now lies in her hands and the very thing I crave, may now be the end of me.
