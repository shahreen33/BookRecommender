What if you woke up one day and noticed that everything you ever believed has been a lie? Your mom is not a human, but something way more dangerous. Something that shouldn't exist. And she's not alone. Your sister is deathly sick and she's getting worse day by day. A dangerous predator, a guy who is exceptionally good looking, wants you and has this nonsensical obsession to get you no matter what. A merciless hunt begins and nothing is safe. Not even your hidden dreams...Is your mom strong enough to protect your family? Can she escape her dark past or will it destroy her? Change is about to come and she is willing to do anything to spare her loved ones. Even murder if needed
