As proud as I am to be a Monroe and as much as I love my family, I need to break free from their sometimes-stifling protection. It’s time to find out who I am, apart from being the youngest of this strong, tight-knit family. BrandonI’m a broken man. But I didn't get here completely on my own. I was pushed into this hell I live in. Now, I’m determined to make my greatest enemy and former friend, Michael Monroe, pay.And I know exactly how to do it. I will break him. And I’ll go through her to do it, even if it kills me.***This is technically the final book in the Monroe Family series. Although it can be read as a standalone, I strongly urge you to read Unbreakable and Unbroken (at least) to better connect with this story.
