Book Details: Each and every day, Stella the master storyteller poses the same question to her magic storybook. And each and every day, the book reassures Stella of her incredible storytelling talent. But one faithful day, the magic storybook has a different answer for its powerful owner. And so begins the delightful fractured fairytale of a miffed storytelling enchantress, her winsome competition, Joe Bright, and the delightful seven Genre Dudes, whose unique personalities and penchant for books of all kinds will have readers remembering Joe and the literary genres happily forever after!
