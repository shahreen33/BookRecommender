  Bring on the competition, cheerleader fights, and rebellious repeats. I'm ready to take a stand, prove myself, and save my team once and for all.
After triumphing over another exam-gone-wrong, all we want to do is recover. But it seems that there’s no rest for the witches, because another challenge immediately smacks us in the face. It’s something none of us saw coming, and one thing is for sure: entering Semester Four won't be the same unless the Notorious Four is together once more.I, Brianne Marie Harlow, have to take matters into my own hands if I want to attend my Fourth Semester at Witchling Academy with my four boyfriends. I only have one shot to bring my wayward team member back into the fold, and though I'm confident I can change his mind, I'm worried about the challenges that will surely come if I succeed.Tension is growing, and the dynamic of our team is beginning to morph into something stronger than any of us realize. My relationships with Jax, Connor, Kaito, and Finnick are maturing, and with those changes come experiences I could never imagine happening with any other group of wizards.The Witchling Games are approaching, and our team is facing off against a mixture of cheating seniors and ongoing enemies.

  There’s only one way to find out. Let’s do this, Semester Four.
