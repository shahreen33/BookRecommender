This comprehensive guide to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) offers parents balanced, reassuring, and authoritative information to help them understand and manage this challenging and often misunderstood condition. Based on the American Academy of Pediatrics' own clinical practice guidelines for ADHD and written in clear, accessible language, this book answers the common questions: How is ADHD diagnosed? What are today's best treatment options? and Will my child outgrow ADHD? Accurate, up-to-date findings on evaluation and diagnosis, coexisting conditions, and unproven treatments are provided. Also addressed are behaviors associated with the teenage years and what schools can do to support children with the condition. ADHD management strategies that balance the roles of behavior therapy, medications, and parenting techniques are suggested.
