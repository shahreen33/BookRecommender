They say I am a queen.They say I married a monster. That I did so willingly.They say he cannot die, that he does not age. That together, we rule a ravaged world.They say I used to be one of them, but now I am a traitor. They say many things, all which I cannot remember, but … I fear what they say is true.Then there is what they don’t say, what I see in their eyes—The king terrifies them. He cannot be stopped. And, most worrisome of all …He is coming for me.
