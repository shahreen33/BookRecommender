I can’t stand Tatum from the second she walks into the room. Everything about her puts me on edge—from her small delicate curves to the smile that she refuses to lose. There’s nothing she loves more than to piss me off. She’s infused herself in every part of my life, taking away the silence I crave. I’d walk away if I could. If I hadn’t been shot. If I didn’t need physical therapy. If I could resist her. I only kiss her to shut her up. I didn’t expect it to turn into the hottest moment of my life with our clothes scattered on the floor. The one-time thing turns into something neither of us expects. When my guard drops and secrets are revealed, I’ll do anything to protect Tate. We have enemies lurking around every corner. Will my vow of honor cost me the one thing I can’t live without?
