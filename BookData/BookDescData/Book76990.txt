Children have loved LITTLE GOLDEN BOOKS for over 50 years. They have written their names inside each front cover and pored over the colorful pictures. Parents have shared Golden Moments with their children, reading such classics as The Poky Little Puppy. Thanks to the happy hours spent with the books, many children have developed a lifelong love of reading.Over two billion LITTLE GOLDEN BOOKS have reached the hands of children. We salute the talented authors and artists who create the books - and also the readers, young and old, who have enjoyed the picture books with the famous gold-foil binding.
