“I will always love you, both in this life and the next. I vow to love you, honor you, and stay by your side through haunted houses, dead relatives, and random appearances of red croquet balls.”  Milo is a mild-mannered omega who just wants to save his Sweet Ballz, the candy shop he owns on Main St. in Hollydale. Someday maybe he will find an alpha as awesome as the book boyfriends he reads about in the popular books by his favorite author. But for now, Milo is content to be at home curled up with his favorite romance books.  Rafe is a lonely alpha trying to juggle his writing career while settling into the gorgeous old manor he's just purchased in quaint Hollydale. He just wants to have a home of his own away from the craziness of his rich, socialite family. All Rafe wants is peace and quiet to secretly write his popular romance novels, and to maybe someday find a sweet omega to love like the ones he writes about every night.  Rafe can't explain the odd happenings in his new home, or the strangely sweet little old lady who comes and goes, even when the doors are locked. Is he being gas-lighted or is there more going on? Rafe and Milo could be perfect for each other, if they can first overcome the red croquet balls that life keeps throwing at them.  This is the first book of The Hollydale Omegas series.
