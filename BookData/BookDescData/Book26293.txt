My family was rich with love, but we were broke. So, I was willing to do anything to make sure I created the life I wanted.My best friends and I catapulted to the top of the popularity food chain following V’s Halloween Costume Party freshman year. It was a lot of work keeping up with the social demands of popularity, but the networking opportunities set me up for future success.Because I was willing to do whatever it took to secure my future, when V extended an invitation for me to join, I jumped at the chance. I was willing to lie, cheat, and steal to reap the benefits of the elusive secret society. A V membership meant doors opened and opportunities knocked. There was only one line I said I wasn’t willing to cross. But when it came down to it, I wavered.People always want to know what V stands for. For me, V stands for vicious.What I did was a betrayal.It was disloyal.It was treacherous.It was necessary.I’m not the villain in this story. But what I did was vicious.And that’ll haunt me for the rest of my life.
