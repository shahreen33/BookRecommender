Four are dead in five days, including a young U.S. senator. The methods of execution are varied and horrific, and the messages left behind point to a serial killer obsessed with the United States Constitution and the nation's Founding Fathers.  The FBI assigns its best man to the investigation. But while Special Agent David Yerxa chases those responsible for the murders, his own demons are chasing him.  With the help of his father - semi-retired FBI legend Martin Yerxa - David must wrestle with ghosts, both past and present, in order to untangle the murderer's motives, solve a mystery, and prevent a national catastrophe.  Stretching from the Deep South to New England and featuring a dose of true American history, Founders' Keeper is a tense psychological thriller that pulses from start to finish.
