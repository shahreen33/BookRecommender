Lead me not into temptation…  Easier said than done when your name is Deacon Jacobs and temptation is your drug of choice.  The woman with a broken soul shouldn’t even have registered on his radar, but a wolf wants what a wolf wants.  Sparks fly between the feisty female and the arrogant wolf, but Gemma got caught in the Midnight Pack’s crossfire once before, and now all she wants is to forget.  A familiar enemy re-surfaces but all is not as it seems and the pack closes ranks to face what could be their toughest challenge yet.  The risks are daunting but Deacon will gamble everything, including his life, to ensure Gemma’s safety.
