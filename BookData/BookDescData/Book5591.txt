For Vintago Hawkins, it was just another month. That was until the virus outbreak started. In an attempt to protect his family, he decides to flee north to a place he visited as a child, a fish hatchery. Through his journey he encounters other survivors, an ex-Navy Seal, the remnants of a military company, and other groups of survivors. Vintago will have to decide who gets to stay, and who has to go, because not everyone can be part of a fledgling empire.​What makes Apocalyptic Empire different from most books in the genre is that Vintago Hawkins is not merely a survivor, he aspires to be a leader. He wants to someday forge his own civilization, and he is willing to do whatever it takes to make that goal come true. He faces infected people, looters, raiders, and enemy groups of survivors. Through it all he has a group of people to support him, advise him, and make sure that he is making wise decisions. In the end, the Hatchery Compound is his creation, and he has to make the hard choices in order to protect its residents.﻿"Every empire has a beginning, this one is a fish hatchery."Note: This is an alternate cover for ISBN 1484136322/9781484136324.
