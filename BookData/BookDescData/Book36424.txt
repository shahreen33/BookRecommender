The best thief in the history of the Revived Earth is back, and this time it's personal.  A deadly plague is ravaging the world's population and threatening to kill the only person Jubal Van Zandt cares aboutâ€”himself. If he doesn't find a cure soon, he's dead.  The most promising lead is buried in the ruins of an ancient sunken city stalked by savage predators, cunning parasites, and the twisted souls of long-dead mages. It would take an army to get Jubal inside ... or just one of the most renowned knights in Guild history. The one Jubal betrayed and left for dead eighteen months ago.  First Jubal has to convince her not to kill him. Then he has to convince her to help save him.
