For two long years, Stark Security agent Denise Marshall has been alone, mourning her missing husband. But everything changes on Valentine’s Day when she encounters a mysterious man who seems to understand her deepest desires. Shadows of You is a prequel to Broken With You, the second book in the Stark Security series. While Broken With You can be read without reading this short, you don’t want to miss this steamy prequel!
