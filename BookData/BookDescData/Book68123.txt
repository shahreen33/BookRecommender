Isaline Primrose doesn’t let anyone cut the line at her mom’s bakery, no matter how tall or sexy he his. His custom suit, expensive haircut, and deep brown eyes are making her want things. Very dirty things. It’s totally fine to look even if he is a bossy jerk. But is it okay to have naked fantasies with the commanding business man?  Beast Harte doesn’t do small towns, but Full Moon Bay has something other towns don’t: the perfect building for his deceased father’s long-time dream. When he meets his mate, life should be perfect. It isn’t. Pissing her off was not in his plans, but he wasn’t used to taking orders, only giving them. Now he has his work cut out for him.  Isaline sets up some challenges to see if Beast is the right man for her. What neither knows is other players are at work with their own hidden agendas. Beast guarantees two things—he's getting his mate and his building, and he won’t let anyone get in his way.
