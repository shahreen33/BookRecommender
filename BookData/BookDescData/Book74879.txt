Their second is turning their backs on the lethal danger harnessed inside him. He allows no one inside his head or his heart. Not his team members at Eidolon, not his enemies, not the willing women who warm his bed. Until her.Grace Paxton—Her smile makes men want to unravel the mystery of the beautiful yet elusive woman.
