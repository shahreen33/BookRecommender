Diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Melinda was shocked but still felt that she would be one of the few she'd heard about that would recover within a few years by learning to manage the symptoms and the stress in her life -- and through a positive, hopeful outlook. As she watched with joy the national news broadcast the celebrations of the long-awaited demise of the Berlin Wall, she determined that she would not be walled in by illness.

She enjoyed life too much and there were things to do she still hadn't done! She knew this type of thing happened to other people, but not to her! She would not be a victim of disease! But in spite of her optimistic attitude and everything that sounded helpful that she tried, her physical condition continued to grow worse.
