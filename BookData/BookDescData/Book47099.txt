December 1874  The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are looking forward to a traditional Christmas with plenty of food, alcohol and the odd duel. But then Death meets Elizabeth, a young girl with unusual gifts, who needs their protection.  When other children start going missing throughout London and the Prime Minister himself asks for their help, they have to put down the brandy and mince pies to solve the mystery while – as usual – saving the world from an unspeakable horror.  Four Horsemen is the fourth part in a series of funny urban fantasy novellas that tells the story of Death and his friends protecting humanity from ghosts, zombies, vampires and medium-sized apocalypses.
