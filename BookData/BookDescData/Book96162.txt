"Watch and See is written in a way that's vivid, captivating, and beautiful." - Nikki Storebo
   
Life hasn't been kind to Harper Evans. The small-town gossip about her dead dad and drug-addicted mother has taken its toll. But when her mother is admitted to a long-term rehab facility a few hours away, Harper sees her chance for a fresh start. A shoebox apartment above a Chinese restaurant isn't exactly the escape she dreamed of, but she makes it work. With limited funds and social life, she views her new city through a dusty old pair of binoculars. There's no harm in looking. Just a peek and I'll stop. Harper finds her new pastime quickly turning into a full-fledged obsession. She begins falling for a man she doesn't know--has never met--as she watches him have sex through the window of his apartment. Daydreaming about what it would be like if she were one of his conquests. We all reach a point when watching isn't enough--when we can no longer just be a spectator in our own life. That's when it's supposed to get good, right? When we take control and go after what we want. But what happens when it all blows up in our face and we're left with less than nothing? What then?
