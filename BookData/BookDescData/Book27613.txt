“The ground had opened up and spit out hell and the detritus was Shiloh.”For two days in the year 1862, the bloodiest battle of the American Civil War held theatre in southern Tennessee – a patch of land called Shiloh. Thousands of soldiers on both sides of the conflict lost their lives, and tens of thousands more were badly injured. For twin brothers Henry and William, infantry soldiers in the Confederate Army, the battle held more than the horrors of war, it was a portal to something beyond mankind, where the spilling of blood brings not only death, but eternal damnation.A stunning horror novella from a new Master of the Weird and the Fantastic.For inquires: exoccidente@gmail.com
