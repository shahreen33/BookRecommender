The impulse to collect springs from deep within the human psyche Squirrels gather acorns, rats collect shiny things, but only humans assign meaning to the objects they collect. Detritus is a collection of stories about the impulse to collect, preserve, and display gone horribly wrong. Kate Jonez and S.S. Michaels have assembled a diverse range of exceptionally disturbing stories from authors from around the world. Each of the stories, whether about a collection that is world changing or intensely personal, is sure to linger in readersâ€™ thoughts and make them consider the possibility that malice and evil just might lurk in their own hoard of stuff. Featuring: Kealan Patrick Burke, Jeremy C. Shipp, Mary Borsellino, Brent Michael Kelley, Phil Hickes, L.S. Murphy, Michael R. Colangelo, Neil Davies, Louise Bohmer, Edmund Colell, S.P. Miskowski, Michael Montoure, Lee Widener, Pete Clark, and Opal Edgar
