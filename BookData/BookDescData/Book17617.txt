Karen DeSonne is used to pretending to be something she's not. All her life, she's passed as a normal all-American teenager; with her friends, with her family, and at school. Passing cost her the love of her life. And now that Karen's dead, she's still passing this time, as "alive." Meanwhile, Karen's dead friends have been fingered in a high-profile murder, causing a new round of anti-zombie regulations that have forced nearly all of Oakvale's undead into hiding. Karen soon learns that the "murder" was a hoax, staged by Pete Martinsburg and his bioist zealots. Obtaining enough evidence to expose the fraud and prove her friends' innocence means doing the unthinkable: betraying her love by becoming Pete's girlfriend. Karen's only hope is that the enemy never realizes who she really is because the consequences would be even worse than death.
