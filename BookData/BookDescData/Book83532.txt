A psychic medium once said that if you find a random dime, it is a sign that someone that you have loved and lost is thinking of you.A Dime is a Sign Through TimeIf you find a dime,You will know that I’mSending thoughts of loveThrough the veil of time.Ten cents with a silver shine,A sense sent you to help remindThat someone who left you behindIs always living in your mind.Sending love and vibes,Felt as psychic sighs …The ones that you miss,Send you a kiss …Sherrill S. Cannon’s second book of poetry contains messages written through the years in poetic form that put feelings into words. As a teacher, many of her poems helped counsel troubled teens and friends. There are three sections in the book: Heads, Spinning, and Tails … (Love &amp; Loss: Coin Toss?). The variety of lyrical poetry forms include free verse, blank verse, haiku, and sonnets, while some are just playing with words! Hopefully, this is also a book of healing.
