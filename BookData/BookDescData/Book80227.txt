  Finishing our first year at Witchling Academy brings a wave of new experiences. Now with Semester Three approaching it's time for me to decide what path I want to walk as I enter young adulthood.
I, Brianne Marie Harlow, am now dating the Notorious Four. It's still quite a shock in my mind, but to be surrounded by my supportive family and friends, it's become something life changing for me and my four amazing boyfriends - Jax, Connor, Finnick, and Kaito.With summer break, brings moments of adventure and exploration, as I begin to figure out what I want in this group relationship and deal with my own insecurities. Adding my new familiar to the mix and having two amazing best friends to help me figure out the goods and bads about dating, summer goes by like a breeze.
  Semester Three is where things start getting messy.
When the professors warned us about the change in dynamic with year one to year two, we never would have thought it would escalate to magic battles, car chases, and end us in the middle of a magic crime case.Adding the continuous bullying, old memories, girl jealousy, and issues developing within my own team, we're going to have to stick tightly together or we'll be pulled apart forever.Thankfully, I won't let that happen. If I'd have to be the middle ground to keep my Notorious Four from tearing apart, I'd do it right here and now. All in the name of protecting the people I love.
  Now let's all pray this goes as well as it does in my head.
