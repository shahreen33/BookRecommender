Prowl has been kidnapped. Worse, no one wants him back. What's a meddling weasel of a bot to do? Call in THE WRECKERS of course!Too bad the only one he trusts to rescue him, Springer, has been in a coma ever since the Wreckers' last stand at the prison Garrus-9. Traitors are revealed, secrets come to light, and it may all be more than even the baddest crew of Autobots can handle. It's a Wreckers mission, so it's guaranteed to end badly, and this time the team will never be the same.
