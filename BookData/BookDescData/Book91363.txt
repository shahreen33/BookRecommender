Sometimes the right choice feels like anything but. Tyra Lightbody lives steeped in family, community, and promises made long before she was born.  Her next mission will try to take all that away.  She’s being sent to an experimental-species biome to see why the locals are having bad dreams and throwing beakers at each other. What she discovers will test her loyalties, her courage, and her ability to make the very hardest of decisions in the very darkest of nights.  ~ ~ ~  Meet the Fixers of KarmaCorp. Their job is to work on behalf of greater good in the galaxy. Their challenge is to figure out what that means.  Grower’s Omen is the second book in the Fixers quartet, an offbeat science fiction series in which nothing explodes, nobody is at war, and life gets pretty interesting anyhow. The series starts with Destiny’s Song, and reading them in order is probably a good idea. :)
