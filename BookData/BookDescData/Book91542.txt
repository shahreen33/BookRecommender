SHE TOLD HERSELF THE PAST DIDN’T MATTER. SHE. WAS. WRONG.  Detective Inspector Tracy Collier has a past she’s convinced she can sweep under the carpet. There’s a killer out there, though, who’s out to prove her theory wrong. A body turning up, gutted and dressed to appear homeless, is the killer’s calling card to lure Tracy into a world where she has to face her fears.  It’s uncomfortable, being forced to meet her demons again, and she fights to keep the secrets locked away—but a therapist is determined to pull every single one of them out into the open, and Tracy is compelled to relive her younger years in vivid detail.  Who is killing these people—and why? Who seems to want to bring Tracy to her knees, sending her back to a place she vowed never to return?  And who wants her to admit to all those lies?
