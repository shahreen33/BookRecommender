I'd always watched Drake Andrews and Dane Butler from a distance. My own personal double D's, I'd kept track of them through friends, maintaining my space. I couldn't let them get close, couldn't let them see how much I wanted them. Both of them. Together. Only now they're back. And that unfortunate fantasy? It's returned, bigger and dirtier than ever. Bluebell McKenney was ours since the moment we'd stepping into the group home over a decade ago. Her shy glances couldn't hide the heat in her gaze. To have the kind of future we wanted, the kind that involved all three of us, we had to leave – had to make something of ourselves. But now we're back and ready to claim Bluebell McKenney. Hope she's ready for double the D. Warning: This MMF bisexual ménage is filled with double the entendre, double the alpha and double the you-know-what. Get thee a man (or two) and settle in – this unconditional love story will leave you aching for more.
