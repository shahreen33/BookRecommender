Brian Russell has watched his best friend find love and happiness with a hot young man, and now he wants some of that happiness for himself. While on a job, he meets Rush Weston, the cowboy of his wet dreams in a dark Houston alley. They begin a relationship, having hot phone sex during the week and even hotter dates on Friday nights. Rush has never had a relationship with a man, never gone on dates, never given his heart to anyone, just had anonymous encounters and a string of one-night stands. Both men have found "the one," but Rush won't leave his ranch. Not even for Brian. Brian's only choice is to give up on Rush, or give Rush time and hope he'll be brave enough to admit to everyone that he's gay so they can be together because Brian refuses to go back in the closet. Not even for Rush.
