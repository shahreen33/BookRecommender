Now if you are a grandma, or even if you're not, there are things we should remember and these things mean a lot! Every child is a wonder, every child is a gift. Each one needs care and kindness, every child needs a lift! Bedtime should be loving, bedtime should be sweet. Evenings end with songs and stories, make every child's day complete.
