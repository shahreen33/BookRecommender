A long anticipated break in intelligence puts Stony Man on a rapid-fire mission to halt a massive terrorist attack in America's heartland. Able Team hits the streets of the Venezuelan capital, hunted by political death squads while working to sever Iran's increasingly powerful narco-pipeline to the States. Across the globe in Basra, Phoenix Force gets betrayed and burned in the hellgrounds--targeted, outnumbered and outgunned with men down. But Stony Man has been to hell and back many times before. They don't intend to fail now.
