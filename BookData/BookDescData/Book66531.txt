Four East Germans corresponded for decades with an American teacher, openly sharing about their frustrations, joys, and challenges of living in a communist country. Author David F. Strack kept those personal letters and has now distilled them into a riveting memoir about what life was like behind the Iron Curtain. Read about the lives of Gerhard, Jutta, Jï¿½rgen, and Barbara in their own words, as they share about their jobs, families, and political opinions. Learn how the fall of the Wall and the reuniting of "Ost und West" affected their lives, bringing wonderful freedoms to all of them, yet also economic disappointment to one.LETTERS OVER THE WALL is an enthralling memoir, chronicling four lives over a span of forty years, during a time of political upheaval and great societal change. This third edition contains an additional chapter and translated letter, and photos of the author's East German friends.
