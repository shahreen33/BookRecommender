Can't get enough of Talia and Erik? Want to know about their first meeting? Interested in what happens between the books? Dying for a peek at what's coming in Created? Captivated is a Talented Novella that includes four short stories, two from Talia's point of view, and two from Erik's point of view. The first is a detailed account of what happened the first time Talia and Erik met. The second is all about Erik's trip to visit Talia after she was injured in Talented. The third takes place between Caged & Hunted, and gives you a glimpse at Erik's romantic side. And last, but certainly not least, the fourth story starts off right where Hunted ends. Not recommended for anyone who has not read the first three books, unless you don't mind a lot of spoilers!
