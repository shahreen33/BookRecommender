Whenever you look through a window, you never know what you might see. Peering out, you may find magic in the mundane, beauty in the simplest stone, or something truly extraordinary and unexpected. But what might you see if you turned your gaze within? The soul can be beguilingly blurry, and at times the questions arising from self-reflection can reveal more than their answers. Look deeper. And when your eyes fail, open yourself to new ways of experiencing through your senses and emotionsâ€¦the view may be surprisingly glorious.
