Fine As Frog Hair follows Russ as he sets out to see America and finds something even better in Trey, a true cowboy and all around good folks. Russ and Trey have a wonderful guy next-door quality, taking their romance one step at a time, but when sparks fly it heats up fast, and the two decide to join forces and face the world together. It's a good thing they have each other, because when the going gets tough and Russ gets desperately sick, they'll need all the support they can get. Trey is determined to keep Russ with him, and he's willing to give up everything he owns to do it. Russ doesn't want to be a burden to Trey, and he has a hard time hiding his guilt. He loves Trey a lot, but he's not sure how much he's willing to let Trey do for him. Can he let Trey help him heal? Trey and Russ have it all, from laughter to heartache to the hottest sex West of the Mississippi, all the while proving that while life isn't perfect, it's just fine by them. Fine as frog hair.
