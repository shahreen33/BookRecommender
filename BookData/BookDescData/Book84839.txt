For courses in Introductory Statistics and Research Methods courses using SPSS. Using SPSS guides students through the most basic of SPSS techniques using step-by-step descriptions, presents statistical techniques and instruction on how to conduct statistical analyses, and explains in detail how to avoid all the obstacles common in the study of statistics. The development of easy-to-use statistical software like SPSS has changed the way statistics is being taught and learned. Students can make transformations of variables, create graphs of distributions of variables, and select among statistical analyses all at the click of a button. However, even with these advancements, students sometimes still find statistics to be an arduous task. They continue to be faced with many potential obstacles and they might feel overwhelmed and stressed rather than challenged and excited about the potential for mastering these important skills. Samuel Green and Neil Salkind have written a text to specifically address these issues.
