Everything about Fiona is forbidden. She’s a party girl with dark desires. She’s beautiful, irresponsible, irresistible. She’s my patient. I’m her therapist. I’m past past wanting her. Past possessing her. Past bedding her or protecting her. I’m willing to be self-destructive, negligent, brave, audacious, and stronger than I ever believed possible. She’s blunt force trauma to the heart. And she calls another man Master. **** Sensitive readers should be aware that this book gets a little dark. There's pain with the sex, and one character treats our main character terribly. **** If you've read KICK and/or USE from the Perdition Series, they are in here. The second half of the book is BREAK, which is the end of Fiona Drazen's story. There's a link right in front where you can click to get right to Break.  This book is an entire story, from inception to epilogue. Standalone. End of.
