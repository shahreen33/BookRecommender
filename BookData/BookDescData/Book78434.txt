“What the f*ck have I done?” aren’t the first words you want to hear after a one-night stand. Yet that’s what he gave me.Dallas Barnes is tall, dark, and handsome.He’s also scarred, rough, and broken down by burdens. A single dad. A widower. A lost soul.We found each other in the back of a dark pub.He brought the whiskey.I brought the bad decisions. He called it a mistake. I vowed never to speak to him again. That vow is broken with one test.Two pink lines have turned my life upside down. One night can change everything.
