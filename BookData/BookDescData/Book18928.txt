When do the words "I'm sorry" mean nothing? When his words hurt more than his touch? What happens when leaving is harder than staying? Fear. The lines between right and wrong have become so blurred...accepting who youâ€™ve become is not an option.Shame.Escape is the only way to fight back...finding someone willing to fight with you is something you never saw coming. Hope.But before you can conquer love, you have to battle your past...
