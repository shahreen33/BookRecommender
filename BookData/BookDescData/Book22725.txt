Robin Hudson's life is getting complicated. Her estranged husband's girlfriend is not only younger, prettier, and more successful - she's pregnant. Robin's job - on the trash crew for the prestigious All News Network - is rocky, too. She can't seem to keep from making on-the-air faux pas. Now her loathsome boss wants her to investigate a sperm bank. Her elderly next door neighbor vilifies her and assaults her, under the delusion that she is a call girl. A blackmailer tries to shake her down. And her disdainful cat, Louise Bryant, refuses to eat unless Robin stir fries her food. Just a normal day for a single, urban professional female. Then this spunky and appealing but "slightly rumpled, third string reporter in Rita Hayworth's body" finds herself accused of murder. She thinks her apartment may have been burglarized because it seems tidier than when she left it. Robin wants to trust charming supervising producer Eric Slansky but is afraid that the super-handsome, super-amorous Super Prod may be the murderer.
