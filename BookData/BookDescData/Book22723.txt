Hold on for a rollicking, wickedly fun new mystery series from USA Today bestselling author Rhonda Pollero. Shopping, murder and romance all in one book? What a steal!Meet Finley Anderson Tanner. FAT to her enemies. A West Palm Beach paralegal who hates the gym, still rents her condo, and loves two-hour lunches with her friends.

Especially when a grieving widow is sitting in your office, convinced that her husband's accidental death wasn't. Investigating murder isn't really Finley's bag (that would be Prada, 75% off), but the deeper Finley digs, the stranger things get, and this discount shopper knows slightly irregular when she sees it. Kind of like sexy Liam McGarrity. Everything about the hot, hunky P.I. screams, "Get out while you still have your underwear!"For a girl whose biggest ambition is take-out Moo Shu at 5:01, life is taking some exciting, unpredictable, and decidedly dangerous turns. Someone doesn't like Finley's new work ethic. And if this paralegal wants to bring home the real goods, she'll have to keep from becoming a killer's total knock off...
