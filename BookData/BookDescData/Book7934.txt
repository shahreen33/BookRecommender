They call me a slut. Maybe I am.Sometimes I do things I despise.Sometimes men take without asking.But I have a musical gift, only a year left of high school, and a plan.With one obstacle.Emeric Marceaux doesn’t just take.He seizes my will power and bangs it like a dark note.When he commands me to play, I want to give him everything.I kneel for his punishments, tremble for his touch, and risk it all for our stolen moments.He’s my obsession, my master, my music.And my teacher.
