Designed to be a true alternative to traditional argument texts, Everything's an Argument takes a fresh and friendly approach to the subject by showing students that argument is everywhere. Everything's an Argument with Readings complements this approach with a uniquely broad range of examples -- from essays to billboards to emails to radio programs -- that help students recognize and respond to the arguments all around them. Andrea Lunsford and John Ruszkiewicz's instruction is fresh, elegant, and jargon-free, emphasizing inclusivity (moving beyond simple pro/con positions), humor, and visual argument to make Everything's an Argument immediately accessible. Students like this book because it helps them see and understand that a world of argument already surrounds them; instructors like it because it helps students construct their own arguments about that world.
