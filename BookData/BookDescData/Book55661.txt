Is no longer history Seven miles down, on a top secret dive into the Pacific's deepest trench, Commander Jonas Taylor came face-to-face with the largest and most ferocious predator ever to inhabit the planet - Carcharodon Megalodon, the 60-foot, 70,000-pound prehistoric ancestor of the Great White shark. Jonas escaped with his life - the dive's sole survivor - but his navy career was over, his nightmare encounter written off as a hallucination. But Jonas knows what he saw was real. He's determined to prove that Megalodon still feeds in the ocean's unexplored depths. Now, after seven years of research and study, he finally has his chance to return to the abyss. Diving deeper than ever before, Jonas will face terror like he's never imagined. The Meg is about to surface and, when she does, nothing and no one is going to be safe.Includes MEG: Origins.
