Traveling nurse Mercy Mares accepts a new job posting at a psychiatric facility in a small California town that boasts rest and relaxation for Hollywood starlets and wealthy travelers, but Mother Nature and an elusive murderer have other plans in store for her month long assignment.  Before she's had a chance to settle in, Mercy finds herself accused of a heinous crime and discovers that nearly everyone from members of local law enforcement to Hollywood moguls have every reason to have wanted the victim dead. Now, it will be up to her and an unlikely ally to solve the murder or end up behind bars.  Without her trusty friends and beloved canine companion, Barney, by her side, can Mercy rely on one of her patients to help clear her name or will he make matters worse for her?  Find out what happens in this humorous, slightly irreverent Cozy Medical Mystery!  This is the second book in the "A Mercy Mares Cozy Mystery" Series.
