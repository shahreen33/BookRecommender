Fresh out of prison after serving a three-year sentence, Johnathan Marcello wants to get back to normal business as a mafia capo. The rules set out for him are clear—keep out of trouble, maintain a low profile, and stay stable. But stability is a delicate balance for a man like John, and shaky ground is only a single step away.  A chance encounter with a blue-eyed woman might just change his whole world.  Siena Calabrese’s life revolves around cooking numbers, and scrubbing books clean. After all, a girl is only useful to men in the mafia, if she isn’t totally useless. As long as she does what they want, then she can maintain the illusion of freedom. But illusions are only delusions in the grand scheme of her life, and reality is far more dangerous.  A man with secrets might just be the one thing she didn’t know she needed.  In this life, family is everything. Or, that’s how it should be.  Distrust. Love. Betrayal. Loyalty.  Mix it all together, and it makes for a volatile city.  A war is coming.
