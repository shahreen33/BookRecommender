One day I woke up happier than I could've ever imagined. The sun was shining, the birds singing... I had everything.But life never goes the way we planned. Sometimes, things come from nowhere and knock us off course, leaving us broken and lost. Meeting him gave me a spark of hope, but I won't fall for his promises.***My time in the Marines has taught me to appreciate the little things in life. I served my country proudly, and would do it all over again.Meeting her gave me a new mission, one I accept gladly.I've never failed an assignment, and I won't start now.I'll do whatever it takes to show her the inevitable.
