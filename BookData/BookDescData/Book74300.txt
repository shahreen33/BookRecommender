The anarchic and witty third Emily Brown contains a message for parents about spending quality fun time with children, while little ones will simply enjoy the exuberant storytelling  Emily Brown, Stanley the bunny, and Matilda the elephant are busy going on adventures, but every time they get to a particularly exciting part, ring! ring! goes the Emergency Telephone and it's Matilda's mother on the end worrying that Matilda isn't dressing properly, or eating properly, or almost anything. How can Emily Brown persuade her that sometimes adventures are good? This witty and poignant book is a reminder of the importance of spending quality time with children and allowing them to explore the world around them.
