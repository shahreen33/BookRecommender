A journey to Ecuador’s rainforest, this memoir reflects upon the effects of environmental destruction in that nation while simultaneously recounting the author’s personal experiences as a psychologist and poet. From traditional healing ceremonies performed by Andean and rain forest shamans to the knowledge gained from Shuar and Quecha Indians regarding the degrading impact of oil-company drilling and local forest cutting, this account shares the lessons learned from an inspiring group of people. Step by step, mile by mile, the author and his friends find their way up and over the mountains, across the stone-sung Amazon rivers and further into the jungle, to find a love they had forgotten, a world with which they could return.
