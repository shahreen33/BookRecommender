Emmet Truxes’s cartoons brilliantly poke fun at our modern preoccupations and misfortunes—like New Yorker cartoons for the next generation. Featuring all-too-relatable depictions of millennial milestones and struggles (squeezing into cramped apartments, finding true love on dating apps, nailing the perfect selfie), You Look Better Online is for anyone who’s ever narrowly avoided walking into traffic because they were looking at their smartphone. This book takes a humorous look at how becoming an adult intersects with the entrenchment of technology in our everyday lives; it cleverly and keenly observes and captures a moment in time.
