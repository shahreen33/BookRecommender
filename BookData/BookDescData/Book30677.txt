Meet Vern, an older gentleman disillusioned with where his life has led him. Is there anything that can help him come to grips with it? When his teenage grandson suggests a trip to the small coal mining town where he grew up to revisit the times of his past, at first Vern is hesitant. Will this trip help him break out of his funk? Philip Nork’s This House is a Home is another in his ‘a person never knows when someone will enter their life and broaden their horizons forever’ themed stories.
