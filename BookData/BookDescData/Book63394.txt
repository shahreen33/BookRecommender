Werewolves meet the Wild West in this thrilling final installment of the Wolf Brides trilogy.  Lucianna Whitlock has her entire life planned out for her by men determined to use her as a pawn in high society marriage games. But when she balks against the cruel man who has won her hand, he rips her life apart.  A strapping cowboy, half-feral and fully terrifying, saves her life from her ex-fiancé’s vengeance. When her only hope is to escape to America beside the stranger with the inhuman eyes and that thick, southern drawl, she’ll have to decide whether escaping her old life is worth leaving everything she knows behind.  Gable Dawson has been running as a wolf for over a year, but saving Lucianna is breathing new life into the human form he left behind. To keep her safe, he’ll brave the rough waters of the Atlantic on a merchant ship, and travel back to the home in Colorado Springs he’s been avoiding for years. He’ll need the help of his pack to keep his woman safe. If anyone is worth facing his sordid past for, it’s Lucianna.  And if he can claim his mate and protect her from the reach of the brutal man who’s hunting her, he just might save himself along the way.
