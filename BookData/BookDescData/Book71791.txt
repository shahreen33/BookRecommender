An award-winning author who writes in “a wonderfully original and limber voice” (The New York Times) delivers his most accomplished novel to date—the story of two sisters whose lives are dramatically upended.Alison Donnelly is getting wed again, after a disastrous first marriage. With her two young children, she hopes to pick up the pieces and get her life back together. Her sister Liz, a disillusioned anthropology professor with a chaotic personal life who resides in New York City, has come home to Northern Ireland for the wedding. From there she will go to an island off Papua New Guinea to be the presenter for a BBC show called “The Latest of the Gods,” about a new religious movement led by a cargo cult prophet.But both sisters’ lives are about to go off script. Alison wakes up the day after her wedding to find herself living in a nightmare, discovering—on the front page of the paper—that her new husband has a past neither of them can escape. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, Liz becomes drawn into the world of Belef, the subject of her show, a mysterious, charismatic Melanesian woman whose sway over her followers is creating conflict with local authorities and missionaries.Both Liz and Alison are looking to be reborn, to be cleansed in some way, and the dramatic journeys that they take form the backbone of this compelling novel about trust, intimacy, complicity, religious belief, and the bonds of family life.
