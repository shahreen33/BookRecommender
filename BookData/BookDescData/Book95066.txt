My life used to be so simple. Get in, outsex a pesky incubus and get out with the cash. The vampires changed that. I hate vampires. Firstly, the Demon Child woke and went on a feeding spree. He’s strong, lightning fast and as cute as a button. I fight demons by using my sexual aura, which makes hunting a vamp who looks like a kid totally wrong. Secondly, the new mayor wants the paranormal world exposed. Not only does that cut into my income, it will lead to open warfare. Thirdly, the only ones paying me to hunt the Demon Child are a pair of screwed up vampires: Nic - the motivational speaker, I don’t know whether I want to kill him, screw him or cut off his perfect face and wear it as a mask - and Kisho, who would be the perfect man, if it wasn’t for his vampirism. Oh, and that he’s Nic’s bitch, when I want him to be mine. The mayor wants me on his team, I’m under investigation by the Demon Fighter Council - working for the enemy is strictly forbidden and, for the first time ever, I doubt my ability to get the job done. Could my life get any more complicated? Oh yeah, the Demon Child has a secret that makes him unkillable.Warning: may contain traces of unicorn.
