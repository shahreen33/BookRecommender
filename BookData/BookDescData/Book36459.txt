Vampire. Incubus. Demigod. Weapon.  Matthew has many names, but none as distressing as pet. A slave to incubus High King Malarath, Matthew is tired. Tired of fighting. Tired of losing those he loves. Tired of the torture. And, in his despair, his body begins to decay around him.  The High King, angered that his pet is dying, brings in the one person who might be able to fix Matthew: High Lord General Tarrick.  While all trust Matthew had in the general is gone, maybe there is hope in the situation. All Matthew needs to do is start acting like an incubus and put on a show.
