Interior decorator Valentine Taylor loves three things: her fiancé, her seven-year-old-son and houses with character. Soon after she marries Nathan, a man who hopes to be as good a father as he is husband, he falls down a flight of stairs and injures his head. As Nathan recovers physically, it becomes apparent that he is no longer the same man. He buys her a 1920's Spanish-style dream house, but it's one they cannot afford. He becomes impulsive, unpredictable and sometimes angry. Together they try to repair their once grand home as they struggle to rebuild their relationship. When Val’s husband changes into someone completely different, how long should she wait for her true love to return? What if he never does?
