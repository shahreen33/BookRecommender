MaverickThere's something missing, has been for a while. When my best friend asks me to help out his band when the lead singer quit, I jump at the opportunity. I've never felt a rush like I get when I get on stage and strum my guitar. That is until I see her and everything around me fades. She's the one I wasn't looking for. Now that I've found her there's nothing in this world that will keep me from holding onto her and making her MINE.KinsleyI have no business thinking about the man on stage. I've got a baby at home and an ex I never want to see again. I need to stay focused, but he's the sexiest guy I've ever seen, and he keeps staring at me, making me hope for things I shouldn't. Tell that to my heart that has already given herself away.Holding Onto Kinsley is book one in the Holding On series. This is an insta love romance with a Happily Ever After.
