A Christmas Romance Ever since she was a little girl, Madeline Parker had always dreamed of the day she would walk down the aisle in a beautiful white wedding dress, surrounded by family and friends. Now in her late-twenties and successful in her own right as CEO of Dreams Come True , the day she has been waiting for is fast approaching. Christmas is the day she will marry Scott, her fiancé of five years. Everything has been organised, from the music to the winter flowers chosen to decorate the quaint country church.  But her happiness wasn’t to be. Cruelly jilted at the altar, Madeline is left heartbroken and believing true love is a lie. Since Christmas Day, life hasn’t been the same until a chance encounter with Austin Roarke, an old school acquaintance, reignites the hope in her heart. Will Madeline get the wedding of her dreams, or does fate have another ending in store for her?
