Love can be wholesome,Healthy and pure.It can also be deadly,Of this I am sure.I've experienced many,I've opened my door.Of all the love that I've heldThere's one thing I know,Ain't no one has lovedQuite like me... Jann Doe.EVERY LOVE is a collection of poetry covering my own experiences in love. From abuse, to affair, to healthy commitment, I’ve shared many love lifes… even suicide has played a part. The name ‘Jann Doe’ is to protect myself and my family from my own mistakes and history, given the parts of me that love has touched.
