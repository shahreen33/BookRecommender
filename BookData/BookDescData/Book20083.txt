Gracelyn Baylee Packard got herself away from her dirt-poor Montana roots as soon as she could. Now – although she’s never actually met the man – she works in Texas for billionaire Jonah Flint. When Jonah summons her to inform her it’s her lucky day, because she’s going back with him to her home state as his guide, Gracelyn doesn’t exactly see his proposition in the same light. So what if he needs her to infiltrate the tight community of a small Montana town to save his brother from a pre-nup-less marriage? It’s the last place on earth either one of them would ever go willingly, yet Gracelyn and Jonah discover that in Marietta they just might find exactly what neither one of them was looking for...
