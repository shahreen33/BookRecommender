2038: Rick Razor's mark is seen all over the world, with his innovative Razor Technology owned by the majority of the population. Professor Mike Pilkington sees a disturbing video on his RazorVision glasses and the world turns violently upside down. As almost every human being is wiped out through murder and suicide, Mike helps rebuild society, but his hunger for answers drives him on a collision course with the chilling force behind the apocalypse... 'The Malaise will keep you turning page after page, racing to get to the ending, and all the while hoping the technology giants of today don't throw us into his horror of tomorrow.'
