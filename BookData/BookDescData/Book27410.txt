You've heard of Faust? Well, this is Eric... and there's a difference.Eric is fourteen; he is the Discworld's first-ever demonology hacker.Unfortunately, he's not very good at it.All he wants is his traditional three wishes granted - nothing fancy: to be immortal, to rule the world, and to have the most beautiful woman on the Discworld fall madly in love with hum; all the usual things.But instead of a nice, tractable demon, he raises Rincewind, probably the most incompetent wizard in the universe, and the extremely intractable and hostile travel accessory known simply as the Luggage.With them on his side, Eric's in for a ride through space and time that is bound to make him wish - quite fervently - this time that he'd never been born.
