Naughty Tales of Leather &amp; Latex is a trilogy of laugh out loud adventures by Roxy Katt, a self-proclaimed cultural Bolshevik, who has a unique talent for writing what can best be described as slapstick lesbian fetish humor. Roxyâ€™s heroines often find themselves inadvertently entangled in scenarios featuring leather or latex clad women, embarrassing predicaments, and comical sexual liaisons. You will never think of fetish attire in quite the same way after reading The Space MILF, Rubber Space Academy, and The Problem of Leather.
