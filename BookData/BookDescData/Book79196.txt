A divine comedy!Reads R to L (Japanese Style), for audiences rated teen. Nanami Momozono is alone and homeless after her dad skips town to evade his gambling debts and the debt collectors kick her out of her apartment. So when a man she's just saved from a dog offers her his home, she jumps at the opportunity. But it turns out that his place is a shrine, and Nanami has unwittingly taken over his job as a local deity! Nanami may have been (begrudgingly) accepted by the other kami at Izumo, but that doesn't make her any less human or help her deal with her growing feelings for Tomoe. Should she be true to her heart or cut Tomoe loose for his own good? Either way, getting dragged into a group date isn't going to help matters at all!
