I AM AN ESCORT.I screw men and get screwed for money, living my life everyday as Jericho Lane. My clientele list is immaculate. I am sought out, demanded and damn good at my job.I don’t care that these men have families at home, or that they are important people. I do it for the money.to survive. There is nothing that could make me feel a bit of remorse or concern about what I do because I was born with the inability to experience or feel emotions...I don’t feel PAINI don’t feel SORROW.I don’t feel extreme HAPPINESS or LOVEI am VOID.A blank canvas of emotions.An empty hole in an endless sea of circumstances, moods and relationships.Until one client changes EVERYTHING.
