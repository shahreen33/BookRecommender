Easton Novak is hiding something fearsome inside of him. An unconventional upbringing has turned his inner grizzly into a berserker—one who has all but destroyed his humanity. Being around people isn’t easy. Not when he doesn’t understand any of their reactions, or half of what they’re saying. And if he can convince his alpha he’s half sane, he just might let Easton live. But when the raven from Easton’s childhood shows up at his door again, he knows he’s slowly sinking into a madness he can’t come back from. She’s not real. She can’t be.  Raven shifter, Aviana King, is terrified of bears. They’re her people’s natural enemy, but she hasn’t been able to forget the bear cub she befriended all those years ago. Faced with a loveless courtship she doesn’t want, she visits Easton just to see if the sparking feelings she felt for him when they were kids are still there. The only problem is, he thought she was just a friendly raven all those years ago, and now he doesn’t recognize her human form at all. But as she searches for the courage to approach him and his terrifying Gray Back Crew, it becomes clear that the sweet silver bear cub from her childhood has grown into a powerful, dominant, barely-controlled monster grizzly. Now, the greatest threat to Aviana’s life is the man she loves. He isn’t Easton Novak anymore. He’s Beaston.
