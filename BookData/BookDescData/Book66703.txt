In these ten tales of cruelty master storyteller Roald Dahl explores how and why it is we make others suffer.Among others, you'll read the story of two young bullies and the boy they torment, the adulterous wife who uncovers her husband's secret, the man with a painting tattooed on his back whose value he doesn't appreciate and the butler and chef who run rings around their obnoxious employer.Roald Dahl reveals even more about the darker side of human nature in seven other centenary editions: Lust, Madness, Deception, Innocence, Trickery, War and Fear.
