Tartuffe, or the Imposter is a comedy in five acts and in verse by Molière, and one of his most famous plays. It was condemned and banned from the stage for five years by the outcry of the « dévots », who were very influential at the kings court in Molière’s day. Tartuffe is a satire on religious hypocrisy. The religious fraud Tartuffe, a penniless scoundrel, worms his way into the rich merchant’s Orgon’s affections and household, blinding the master of the house with his religious « devotion » and counterfeit zeal. He almost succeeds in his attempts to seduce Orgon’s wife, marry his daughter and drive away his son before the final unmasking.The translation into English verse of one of Molière’s most masterful and most popular plays. “A continuous delight from beginning to end” (Richard Eberhart).
