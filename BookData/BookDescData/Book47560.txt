If you're having fun living your bachelor life in your Alaskan hometown and out of nowhere a woman shows up holding a baby she insists is yours, you need a plan-a birth plan.  BP Step #1 - Lift your jaw off the floor.  BP Step #2 - Figure out the baby's age-do the math.  BP Step #3 - Try to remember the woman and with any luck, her name.  BP Step #4 - Double check that she's not confusing you with your twin brother.  BP Step #5 - Ignore your five sister's scowls as your entire family watches the drama unfold.  There's only one thing you shouldn't do.  BP Step #6 - Don't assume she's there because she wants your daughter to call you Daddy. You'll only end up disappointed.  Time to figure out a new plan-one that changes her mind.
