A YA novel from USA Today bestselling author Sarina Bowen.  Never ask a question unless you’re sure you want the truth.  I’ve been listening to my father sing for my whole life. I carry him in my pocket on my mp3 player. It’s just that we’ve never met face to face.  My mother would never tell me how I came to be, or why my rock star father and I have never met. I thought it was her only secret. I was wrong.  When she dies, he finally appears. Suddenly I have a first class ticket into my father’s exclusive world. A world I don’t want any part of – not at this cost.   Only three things keep me going: my a cappella singing group, a swoony blue-eyed boy named Jake, and the burning questions in my soul.   There’s a secret shame that comes from being an unwanted child. It drags me down, and puts distance between me and the boy I love.  My father is the only one alive who knows my history. I need the truth, even if it scares me.
