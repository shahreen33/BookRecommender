Self-publishing has become *the* phenomenon of the digital age. With direct access to the internet, Amazon and a host of other internet distributors worldwide, writers and journalists self-published over 300,000 titles last year. "Indie-Publishing" bypasses the traditional route of agent and trade publisher, creating a direct market online and through print-on-demand. The challenges are significant though and this excellent new book will help you from the start of the first sentence to the distribution of your book into the global marketplace of readers: editing, formatting, cover design, coping with sales statements and balancing social media activity with time to write.
