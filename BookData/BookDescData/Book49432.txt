 Mills &amp; Boon Blush series brings you moving, true-to-life romancesMeggie is coming to stay!   Normally, architect Sam Solomon would be thrilled that his daughter, Meggie, is coming to live with him. But he's not happy with the circumstances. His ex-wife has suddenly become ill and is unable to take care of their daughter. On top of that, Sam has just started a huge restoration job that promises to eat up all his time. And Meggie is a handful, requiring a lot more attention than an average ten-year-old because she's mentally handicapped.   Taking care of his daughter is a full-time job, so Sam hires a nanny, Christy Lane. Before he knows it, Christy has the unruly Meggie cleaning up her toys, eating her vegetables and playing sports. Christy is so different from any woman he's ever met it's as if she's from a whole other world. A world he never would've known if it wasn't for the child who brought them together .
