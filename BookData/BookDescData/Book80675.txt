Penguin is having a party, and his nine adorable animal guests have their manners all mixed up. From one silly incident to another, the guests learn where to put your napkin (not on your head!), how to sip your milk (don't spray it!), and when to tell a joke (NOT when your mouth is full!). Proper Penguin's patience is tried, but by the time his guests say good-bye, they have even learned to say, "Thank you!"
