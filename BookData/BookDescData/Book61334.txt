THE MERCENARY...hated, haunted, and hunted. Who is he really? Independent and enigmatic, owing his allegiance to no man and no country. A mystery man and a cold-blooded murderer for hire. He can be bought but he can't be owned.And bought he is - by the CIA, British, and Russian intelligence in a joint effort to hunt down the madman who threatens world annihilation. But hired killers are expendable and the hunter becomes the hunted in a diabolical double-cross that explodes in an orgy of death and destruction.
