With this book, Liz Greene has taken a major step in the unveiling of the light of reason, so long obscured by those who have interpreted Saturn as a 'malefic' planet and, in doing so, presents a remarkably rich study of the unconscious mind, shedding light on that mysterious, elusive entity that psychology calls the self.Saturn's darker persona is recognized universally in myth and fairytale. Here, Dr. Greene traces his character through sign, house, aspect, and synastry in a brilliant analysis which reveals his other face: that of the Initiator who, for the price of our honesty, offers us greater consciousness, self-understanding and, eventually, freedom.
