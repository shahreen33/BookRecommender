She’s my sun and moon.My stars, my air, my sunshine.She’s every heartbeat. There are two kinds of women in the world – those I can bang, and those I can’t.My teammate’s sister?She’s a can’t.I moved in with her to protect her from a nasty ex, not to be the next guy in line.She’s the brains.I’m the brawn.She’s the fruit.I’m the sausage.She talks too much.I don’t talk at all, if I don’t have to.Should be easy to resist her.But every minute I spend with Felicity is another minute she gets under my skin. She makes me feel like something more than a dumb puckhead with a big Zamboni pony. And it’s getting harder to remember why I need to keep my hands to myself.
  Beauty and the Beefcake is a vegan-friendly standalone romantic comedy featuring a hockey player whose vocabulary is the only thing smaller than a hockey puck, a book smart but aimless ventriloquist with too many voices in her head, a dilapidated old house that may or may not be haunted, and no cheating or cliffhangers.
