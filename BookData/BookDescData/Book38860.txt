Alternate cover edition of ASIN B076YYXQ9S.Beautiful, intelligent, independent, strong-willed, wealthy... Lilith Fontenot seems, by all appearances, to have it all. But that's not how the highest paid prostitute in New Orleans sees herself. A stain on society. A scourge. A waste. Outsider. Prisoner... Any idyllic dream of the normal life she may have once imagined, Lilith buried long ago. Her only plan now is survival. But mob boss Nico Santelli and community center owner Soti Christos have not given up on Lilith. Each has his own very specific, very opposing, plans for her, and neither will rest until it becomes a reality.  WHORE is a singularly bracing take on an ancient tale of tireless love, betrayal, and the possibility of redemption.
