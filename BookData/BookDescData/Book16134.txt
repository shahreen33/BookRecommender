All Good Things Die In L.A. is a fast-paced and cinematic story centered around three ambitious characters who all want to desperately make it in L.A. Unfortunately, the city of angels isn’t as glamorous as it seems. Instead of trekking out to the Valley to work as a make-up artist, Joey has decided that he rather spend his time snorting meth. When she’s not binging on a box of Ding Dongs, Suzanne is stuck in retail hell and struggling with her screenplay. Meanwhile, fresh from the border, minimum-wager Rodri has three mouths to feed, a suspicious wife, and a big secret. The only thing they have going for them is their connection to “Mama’s”, a dingy soul food joint in Hollywood. As all three try to navigate life in L.A., just how far will each go to realize their dreams?
