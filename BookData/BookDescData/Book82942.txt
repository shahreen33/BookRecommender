Richard T. Schaefer's Racial and Ethnic Groups is the most comprehensive survey of racial and ethnic groups in the United States. It is also the most up-to-date with coverage of the 1996 presidential and congressional elections and their consequences. It also explores such timely topics as the economic impact of immigration, economic development of Native Americans, and changes in Affirmative Action programs. The new edition includes a chapter on overcoming exclusion which looks at three groups - the aged, people with disabilities, and lesbians and gays - and explores the challenges all groups face.
