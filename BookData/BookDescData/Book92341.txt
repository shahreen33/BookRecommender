Bridget Jones’s Diary meets Mean Girls as lovably flawed high school student Chloe Snow chronicles her junior year as she navigates the highs and lows of family, friendship, school, and losing her virginity.I’ll be honest: junior year has been a disaster. My horrible mom is back from Mexico. My dad’s girlfriend is living in our house. Did I mention my parents aren’t divorced yet? On the plus side, I lost my virginity!...and then the whole school found out and I got slut-shamed. Then, somehow, I got popular! But according to some people, it turned me into a monster, and I’m pretty sure everyone hates me now. Oh, and there was the Thanksgiving fiasco, and the prom queen debacle, and the illegal middle-of-the-night drive to the hospital. Want to hear the whole wild story? You’ll have to read my notes.
