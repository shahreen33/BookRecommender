~~~Being Bad Never Felt So Good~~~Being bad never felt so good. I fell for Ally the moment I saw her. Who doesn’t like a confident, intelligent woman with curves I could spend days exploring?Who am I kidding? I have. Many times. Our story ended abruptly when she packed her bags and left like we weren’t meant to be. We are. So I’m calling her bluff. That’s how I ended up thousands of miles from home, standing next to a man who claims to be her fiancé. Being good has never felt so bad. When it comes to a successful man with an incredible body and biteable jaw aka Hutton . . . let’s just say willpower is not my strong suit. Need more? Try bad-boy American. You’re welcome. Embracing my newfound good girl status, I do the right thing to start my reign. My desires no longer matter. The monarchy, the people, and my country do. There is no place for love in this new life. But I never expected to see him again, much less standing next to my royally appointed soon-to-be fiancé. As if that didn’t complicate things, he’s wearing a perfectly tailored tuxedo and my favorite smirk. I straighten my crown and adjust my dress, realizing this good girl never stood a chance. I’ll take the bad reputation if I get him. ~Being Bad Never Felt So Good~Bad Reputation will release December 7th.
