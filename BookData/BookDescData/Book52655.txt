My mother used to have a saying for everything. “You can’t be pretty and lucky.” She wasn’t pretty or lucky. “You have to kiss a lot of toads before you find your Prince Charming.” I kissed too many of those. Sorry, but Prince Charming isn’t in Hicktown, Kentucky. “The good ones go to Heaven; the bad ones go to Hell.” Guess I’m going to Hell. “Hell is paved with good intentions.” Surprisingly, that one is true. Why? Because ... I intended to stay away from Calder Riggs. I intended not to fall in love with him. I intended to find a man who wasn’t a loser or a joker. Oh well, I’ve never been afraid of Hell, anyway. That’s why I’m Crazy Bitch!
