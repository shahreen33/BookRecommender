Warrior supreme Guts has returned, and just in time to save the weakened Band of the Hawk from certain destructionâ€¦ and to form an intimate bond with the beautiful warrior Casca. But job one is to find a way to free Griffith, the Hawks' leader, from the dank dungeons and round-the-clock tortures of the Hawks' former benefactor, the King of Midland. But while the flayed and starved Griffith may be in isolation, he is not alone. Horrors beyond imagination await Guts and the Hawks in the catacombs, and those who die may just be the lucky ones!
