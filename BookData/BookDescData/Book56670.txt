I was a teenager when I ran away to Las Vegas determined to make it on my own. The choice was easy—stay for an ordinary marriage or escape for an extraordinary life. I took a chance on myself, trusted in fate, and boarded the bus bound for the unknown.  In the glitzy glamour of the showgirl scene, I entertained the famous, the elite, and the mafia. But what I never expected was the invitation from a mysterious stranger to land at my feet and invite me to explore my darkest desires.  With the mob hot on my trail, I decided to use my well-honed, entrepreneurial skills to advance my game and play a better one than their own. I wasn’t just another pretty face, but a cunning, ruthless bitch hellbent on getting what I wanted.  My name is Anna Ford. This is my story. And how it all came to be.  Standalone.
