‘We love Aussies,’ they said, ‘the readers will eat you up’.  Those seven little words got me on a plane to the USA for the ‘Raunchy with a touch of sexiness – Valentine’s Day Author Event’ in Miami.  I’m a romance author.

All I wanted was a little fun and some no strings attached fun while I was there.  It would be my very own ‘what happens in Miami, stays in Miami’.
