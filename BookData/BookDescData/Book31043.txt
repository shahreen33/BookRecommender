Surviving the blast is only the beginning…  Dakota Sloane, a tough-as-nails former foster kid, has spent her life running from the past. Her only family is her little sister, still trapped in the system.  When the news shows the bombs striking several major cities, Dakota’s first thought is to grab her sister and get the hell out of Miami.  Logan Garcia is a man haunted by secrets. His life plan is to drink himself into oblivion--until the shockwave hits, shattering the world as he knows it.  In the moments before the deadly fallout descends, Dakota offers Logan a deal. She knows a place to ride out the coming chaos, a safe house deep in the Everglades.  If he helps her rescue her sister, she’ll take him with her.  But Dakota’s past has caught up to her. Someone is hunting her through the radioactive ruins of Miami. And he won’t stop until he has her...or they’re both dead.  An electrifying post-apocalyptic survival adventure, the Nuclear Dawn series features fast-paced action combined with strong, complex characters. Perfect for fans of Logan Keys, Jacqueline Druga, Mike Kraus, and Boyd Craven.  *Rated PG-13 for violence and some swearing.*
