It's hard enough being a chameleon shifter with wonky powers... but opening Jewels Cafe in a supernatural town like Silver Springs? Maybe not the best idea.I thought I could work side by side with my best guy friend... but now I have to juggle hiding my crush for him and putting our cafe on the map. Because if no one in Silver Springs realizes that we've got this hidden gem soon, we might go out of business!So what do we do? Create a signature drink with hints of pumpkin spice just in time for fall.Surprise, surprise. I take one sip and I”m thrown for another loop. The sweetest bear shifter is drawn to me like honey. A sexy bunny shifter offers me his carrot. They don’t even seem to mind that I accidentally shift into everyone I meet.But can my chameleon powers save Jewels Cafe? Can I juggle these two hot shifters and my childhood crush? And what happens when a spell threatens to tear us apart?
