The American shoreline offers infinite beauty in countless forms, from curiously sculpted beaches to towering sea stacks, strewn seaweed, and crabs scuttling in tide pools. These natural phenomena blend harmoniously with man-made structures such as harbors, piers, boats, and lighthouses. The images in this book celebrate the fascinating and startlingly abstract beauty of seashores in the US, from foggy days in Maine to fiery sunsets along the Oregon coast and storm-shrouded lighthouses, quiet inlets, rocky cliffs, and much more. This book aims to enhance appreciation for oceans and their shape-shifting shorelines. They are, after all, timeless.
