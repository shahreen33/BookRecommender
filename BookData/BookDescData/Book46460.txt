Now in its fourth edition, this book - published in the Dutch language - is the leading Dutch textbook on European Union law. The book is for all those who wish to be acquainted with the great doctrines of EU law, using the social and historical context of European law. The immediate reason for this fourth edition formed the stormy developments in the field of economic and monetary union. The editors considered it was indispensable to insert a specific chapter devoted to all legal aspects of the 'eurocrisis' and related issues. Other chapters are adapted to recent developments in legislation, case law, and practice.
