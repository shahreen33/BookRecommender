The first book written by C.S. Lewis after his conversion, The Pilgrim's Regress is the record of Lewis's own search for meaning and spiritual satisfaction, a search that eventually led him to Christianity. This brilliant, Bunyanesque allegory tells a fascinating story and constitutes an effective Christian apologia.
