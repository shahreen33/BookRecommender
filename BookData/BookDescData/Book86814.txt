In hell, all souls believe they donâ€™t belong there. To sweeten their torment, Satan offers the damned the illusion of escape. Job, the Ombudsman, has the bitter job of trying to be their advocate. If no soul gets saved, the illusion shatters, so Satan gives Job the almost impossible task: help a soul escape from hell. With the help of the poets Hart Crane, Emily Dickinson, and Ezra Pound, and through the magic of the Brooklyn Bridge, they seek to redeem the soul of Washington A. Roebling, the builder of the bridge.
