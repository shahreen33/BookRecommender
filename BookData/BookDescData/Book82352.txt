A SACRED MISSIONLeaving a trail of dead and maimed men behind him, Blade again mounted the magnificent golden steed and rode toward the town ahead. But unknown to him, they were awaiting him, to honor and adore him. And to provide him with perhaps the greatest challenge of his life.It had been written in the most holy of books that he who comes to Pendar riding the Golden Horse would be the Father of Pendar. The Messiah. And so it was that he was welcomed as the great and holy Pendaroth--the savior with ten times the strength of a man...a being with great and terrible power.And so it was, also, that he made the decision to become the Pendaroth. And in so doing, to protect the great walls of Vilesh from the mighty siege machines that would destroy it. And from any soldiers who would dare to attack the walled city.This, Richard Blade swore by his honor as a warrior, the thing most sacred to him.
