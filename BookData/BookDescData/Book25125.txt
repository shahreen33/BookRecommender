In this volume, the intrepid lawyer/gourmand Shiro deals with the closing of his beloved local supermarket, his ageing parents (and growing older himself), dodges lawyerly politics, and reveals a shocking secret to Kenji about why their apartment is so cheap to rent. Shiro continues to showcase an array of inventive yet simple-to-make dishes, and his cooking buddy Kayoko comes up with tasty recipes to cook up Mr. Kohinataâ€™s food after his fridge breaks down. The recipes include celebratory year-end-only dishes as Shiro rings in the New Year at home, with Kenji, for the first time.
