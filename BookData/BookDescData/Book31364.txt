Be careful what you witch for…  Ghost Detective Jude Byrne is missing the excitement of the high-profile investigations he and his partner have been handling. Every time the bell jingles over the shop door, he finds himself hoping it’s their next big case. Jude gets his wish and then some when Anson Hollister, curator of the Salem Witch House, walks into West Side Magick with a frightening story to tell. He’s been visited by the spirit of Thatcher Webb, the judge who’d presided over the Salem Witch Trials, sentencing nineteen innocent women to hang.  Psychic Copeland Forbes is enjoying the slower pace of life with Jude. Back from vacation and settled into their new house, he’s content working cases that don’t make him want to sleep with the lights on. Agreeing to take Anson’s case, Cope becomes violently ill on a trip to investigate The Witch House, making him fear there is something more sinister involved rather than the simple haunting Anson described.  With no sign of Thatcher Webb’s spirit, the investigation is at a near standstill, until warlock Callum Churchill, who’s ancestor, Abigail, was one of Thatcher Webb’s victims, disappears on a visit to The Witch House. Can Jude and Cope find the missing witch and put a stop to the diabolical goings on or will they become the next spirits haunting the ghost house?
