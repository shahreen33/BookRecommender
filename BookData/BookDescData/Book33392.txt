Harvey Mackay, Doris Christopher, Pete Dawkins, Clay Jones and John Pappajohn know that the answer to how you recover from career toppling adversity, and then go on to achieve pinnacles of success lies in firsthand knowledge of “the adversity paradox”. They all attest to having found that the knowledge they gained from overcoming adversity played such a crucial role in their success trajectories, they now consider adversity a friend. While many motivational business books promise easy access to prosperity and power by way of secret insight, quick and easy steps, or “insider tips” that are dubious at best, The Adversity Paradox tells it straight and offers no secret formula or silver bullet; instead it offers candid accounts from those whose skills, resourcefulness, and confidence have been tested by adversity and who have put their misfortunes to good use by gaining invaluable business lessons from them. The paths to success are diverse, but The Adversity Paradox identifies patterns that anyone can study and learn from. Business people working to overcome humble beginnings, lack of knowledge, unexpected setbacks, or any manner of misfortune may find the greatest tool for creating business success lies in this new book.
