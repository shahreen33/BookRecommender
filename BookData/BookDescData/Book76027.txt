Welcome ​to 1876 and a rootin’-tootin’ America bursting with gunslingers, outlaws, and garou.JANE (a genuine hero-eene)Calamity’s her name, and garou hunting’s her game—when she’s not starring in Wild Bill’s Traveling Show, that is. She reckons that if a girl wants to be a legend, she should just go ahead and be one.FRANK (*wolf whistle*)Frank “the Pistol Prince” Butler is the Wild West’s #1 bachelor. He’s also the best sharpshooter onboth sides of the Mississippi, but he’s about to meet his match. . . .ANNIE (get your gun!)Annie Oakley (yep, that Annie) is lookin’ for a job, not a romance, but she can’t deny there’s something about Frank she likes. Really likes. Still, she’s pretty sure that anything he can do,she can do better.A HAIRY SITUATIONAfter a garou hunt goes south and Jane finds a suspicious-like bite on her arm, she turns tail for Deadwood, where there’s been talk of a garou cure. But things ain’t always what they seem—meaning the gang better hightail it after her before they’re a day late and a Jane short.
