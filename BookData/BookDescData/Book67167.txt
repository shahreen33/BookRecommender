When Anakin Skywalker fell, both to the pull of the dark side and the blade of Obi-Wan Kenobi, he rose back up, more machine than man. Having lost everything that was once dear to him, he now takes his first steps into a darker world...beginning by hunting down and eradicating the galaxy's remaining Jedi! But Jocasta Nu, librarian of the Jedi Temple, is making a desperate effort to gather and preserve whatever she can of the religion's legacy.
