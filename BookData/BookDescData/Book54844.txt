Two sex demons walk into a church and get married in the sight of God, surrounded by their friends and family. Sounds like the beginning of a bad joke? Not so much. All Perrian “Perry” Haines wants is to marry the man of her dreams—more like nightmares—and be left alone, but when Samael, a psychotic archangel, is out to murder her and all her kind, it puts a damper on her not so happily ever after. Submitting to Samael almost seems safer than her new husband, the seductive sex-demon O’Neil Haines, whose secrets hold the key to her survival and her humanity. Instant snark-filled sparks fly as Perry and Haines discover the origins of her birth and the real reason Samael wants to end her destiny. What a way to start a honeymoon!
