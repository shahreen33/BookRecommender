The blood of my friend is on Aon’s hands, a King who would do anything to protect me. He believes his actions are justified because of a prophecy by the Ancients predicting my undoing by the hands of a friend. I refuse to accept it. Nothing can justify what Aon did, what he took from me. But as one threat is buried, another arises. The other Kings and Queens of Under are waking up from their crypts, and a war among us is imminent. The need for revenge and power is driving immortals to the brink of madness.While the other Kings and Queens of Under are blinded by their own selfish conquests, something big and more dangerous than anything we’ve ever faced is about to shake Under to its core. There’s one King who seems to hold the key to it all, the answers to our fate. A white-winged angel, a legion whose mind is made of a thousand souls with magic strong enough to hold the Ancients captive at the bottom of the pool. The King of Blood.I just need to determine whether he’s an ally…or the worst enemy Under has ever seen.
