Charlotte Wilde gives her heart to the wrong men. The last one left with her life savings and their nubile neighbor. Her first published cozy mystery is a flop. Her literary agent’s about to dump her. She has a serious case of writer’s block. And she’s dead broke.  Which is how she finds herself in rural Idaho looking after her former boss's elderly mother-in-law. While Mrs. Lanigan recovers from her broken hip, Charlotte expects to have plenty of time to focus on her writing. What she gets instead are two very large distractions: the patient herself, and the patient's son Ardan Lanigan.  As Charlotte dutifully sets out to help Mrs. Lanigan sort through a box of old letters, both women become consumed with the details written on every page. What seemed at first to be ordinary correspondence between Mrs. Lanigan's mother and an unknown man makes her question everything she thought she knew about the identity of her father.  Then there’s Ardan. Intelligent, quiet, and bookishly handsome, Charlotte feels an immediate connection to him. Unfortunately, he’s made promises to someone else. Ones he cannot break.  In the third installment of the Blue Mountain series, Tess Thompson reunites us with the Lanigan brothers, their cranky mother, and the feisty Heywood sisters. This story of forbidden love and hundred-year old mystery will keep you turning pages way past your bedtime.
