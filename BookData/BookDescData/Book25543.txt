Kuhina Nui is an Hawaii historical novel about King Kamehameha's favorite wife Ka'ahumanu. She seized power after his death and ruled as co-ruler and Queen Regent from 1819 to 1832. The Hawaiian war god Ku demands that the Queen explain her decisions to end the Hawaii religion and she is sent along with her unwilling modern-day conscripts to re-visit the islands and evaluate the effect of her wide-sweeping decisions.
