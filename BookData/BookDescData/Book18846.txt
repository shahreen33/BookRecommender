This fall...Happily-ever-after.That’s what happens when you get married.Right?Turns out sparkly rings, cake and a fantastic wedding do not automatically grant you that, not even when it’s all you truly want.I’m even starting to doubt the bottomless, unconditional love I share with the man I married will be enough.I can’t have happily ever after, know why?Because I can’t give Romeo what he truly wants. I’ve tried. So hard. I won’t be happy unless he is and something is missing. Someone.Paparazzi are in my face. The flashing cameras and prying eyes are everywhere. My secret is getting harder to hide, and I know the second the scoop is dished the grip I have on the fraying rope of that happily ever after will snap right in my face.In our face.I can’t let that happen. No matter what. Because with or without a happy ending, Romeo comes Before Anyone Else.
