This year will either make me or break me…  My professors worry that I'm sliding down a slippery slope, but I know I'm still on the path of redemption. I've worked too hard for too long, and I have no intention of letting down my family. When Bryn disappears during a routine field trip, though, I must put my need to succeed on hold. After all, what good is being the best if I can't use my powers to help those closest to me? The more facts I uncover, the more I realize that her disappearance is part of a much larger scheme--one that threatens our very existence.  Can I stop a diabolical plan in motion or will I suffer the same fate as those I'm striving to save?
