In the early hours of February 15, 1982, tragedy struck the Ocean Ranger oil rig when it capsized and sank in a severe weather storm 170 nautical miles east of St. John's, Newfoundland. All of the eighty-four crewmen perished, including fifty-six men from the province. This was Canada's greatest maritime disaster since World War II. Rig is a powerful story filled with first-person accounts and previously unpublished photographs. In an intimate journey through grief and sadness, "Rig" searches for reconciliation among the victims' families and those who risked their own lives to help those on the Ocean Ranger.
