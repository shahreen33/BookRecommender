The night we met, I only tagged along to support my best friend. Then I saw Lilly. There’s no harm in picking up a girl for myself, right? One time. A few hours with her underneath me. No longer than a night. That’s all I ever need with a woman. I’m the Vice President of the Lost Kings MC. There’s no shortage of women waiting to warm my bed.Lilly’s appetite matches my own and one night suits her fine. But it’s not enough. I can’t get her out of my head, even though she makes it clear she’s not available. Suddenly, I find myself seeking Lilly out on holidays and special occasions, using any excuse to be near her. That’s when I realize she’s the only one I want to spend all my nights with. Now if I can convince her what we have amounts to more than a few lust-filled hours. I don’t where we went wrong but this is how it all begins… *Zero Hour is intended to be a prequel to Z's first full-length novel, Zero Tolerance. It contains three previously published short stories and one brand new, never before published story.
