Logan Trahan is one of the French Quarter’s hottest bartenders. A single, charming, sexy southern boy who’s proud to pour the best Pimm’s Cup in town. Yes, that’s his biggest accomplishment. So what?  Dana Doucet is a widowed mom of two who’s doing it all. And doing it well, thank you very much. But she had a moment — okay, an entire night — of weakness and gave in after, ironically, nine months of Logan’s naughty flirtations. And a couple of those Pimm’s Cups.  It was just one night, but now they’re stuck with each other forever. Or at least for the next eighteen years, eight months, and one week. Not that she’s counting.  Well, this is definitely big. But there’s no way it’s going to be easy.
