Veterinary receptionist Kit Hall doesn’t get close to people, and for good reasons: his epilepsy makes him feel like a freak, and his ex was an abusive jerk. But that doesn’t always deter people from wanting to get close to Kit. When a Good Samaritan saves him from his wannabe boyfriend in a parking lot, he doesn’t expect to find the guy so attractive. He definitely doesn’t expect his savior to turn out to be his new boss.Dale Miller, veterinarian and old-fashioned guy, sees right through Kit’s prickly facade. He likes what he sees, but convincing Kit to give a relationship a shot isn’t going to be a walk in the park. Of course, for Kit, resisting Dale isn’t going to be easy either.
