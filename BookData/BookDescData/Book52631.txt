Zara Brooks needs a fresh start.  Consumed with insecurity and damaged by betrayal, Zara leaves her old life and all the heartache it holds behind her.  Or so she thinks…  Zara is deeply wounded and every choice she makes in her new hometown is evidence of that pain.  Pierce Reynolds has lived in Windsor all his life and loves the community. When multiple businesses in town are set ablaze faster than the police department can investigate, Pierce volunteers to be the lead investigator on the case.  Pierce’s investigation lands him at Zara’s front door and he’s immediately taken with her. While Zara can’t deny that he’s an attractive and well-respected man, she refuses to get involved.  Once tragedy strikes, leaving Zara vulnerable, Pierce learns there’s a lot of hurt hiding beneath her tough exterior and handles her with care. Shocked by the depth of Pierce’s kindness, Zara finds her heart yearns for more.  But Zara treads cautiously.  Because she knows how easy it is to get burned.
