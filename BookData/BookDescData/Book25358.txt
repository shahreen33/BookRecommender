The setting of this interesting story is in Canada's far north. The ruggedness of the country, the long, severe winters with their blizzards and brief hours of daylight, the lack of cash in Father's pocket, and various other circumstances contribute to the emergencies, the adventures, the trials of faith, and the excitement of this book.Living in a log house, without electricity, without a telephone, and without a vehicle, this close-knit family of eight is resourceful and courageous, developing a dependence on God that is far more secure and rewarding than any earthly or material security.Based on the experiences of a real family, this book portrays loving home relationships and parental teaching that builds strong Christian character and faith.Written for junior and intermediate age children.-taken from the books description on milestonebooks.com
