Librarian's Note: This is an alternate/new cover for ASIN B00EW0YM3ABOOK 2 of the G-String Set in the Six Silver Strings Series Falling in love with Jack was easy, but there is nothing easy about staying in love with this arrogant rock star while settling into a new life in Los Angeles. The epic story of Jack and Marissa continues. Marissa and Tristan in his life changed his outlook. Jack feels needed. He welcomes the responsibility of a family. He embraces the love and companionship. Quickly, he whisks his son and the intriguing woman he had never forgotten to his home in LA. To Marissa, her future seems as mysterious as duskâ€™s shimmering shadows beneath the surface of the luxurious guitar shaped pool. There is no doubt this could be her dream house, her dream life with the man she loves. Not so dreamy is all she is beginning to see packaged with him. The crazy hours of a very active life. The garbage behind the glam. Mostly, a moody and presumptuous rock star whose public persona is opposite of the sweet celebrity she fell for. "Weathering Jack Storm" is book 2 of the G Strings Set, a spin off from the well loved rock and roll band romance Silver Strings Series. This full sized novel can stand alone, but is greatly enhanced by reading Book 1, "Jack Who?"
