Simon Kirby-Jones, amateur sleuth, gay American vampire living in the cozy British village of Snupperton Mumsley, is a respected historian and also, under a well-guarded pseudonym, a bestselling crime writer.  When he’s invited to an exclusive writer’s conference he’s astonished –and outraged—to see that “Dorina Darlington” is the featured speaker. Clearly the woman is an imposter, because Simon is the real Dorina Darlington! And when the fake Dorina turns up dead, Simon suspects he’s next on the killer’s list…  There are definite advantages to being undead—little fear of being murdered is high on the list. But Simon is as nosy as he is kind, so he decides to unearth the true killer before any of his fellow writers fall prey!
