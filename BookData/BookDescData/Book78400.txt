CHAOSThat's my life. No other way to describe it. As the Sargent-at-Arms for the Deathstalkers MC, my days are filled withConstant craziness and crap. But I like it. It's who I am. And what I'm all about.Finally, after years of Hell, everything feels like it's right where it's supposed to be.Except with herShe's far from where she's supposed to be.Tracie is so damned determined to be with someone who isn't "one of us." Delusional.That's what she is.Downright insane at times.Those idiots can't handle her.Will never be able to handle her.And I'm about to show her why.And she'll finally understand.Because this life ain't for everyone,Especially when danger lurks in the shadows of all theChaos.
