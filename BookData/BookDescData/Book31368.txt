I vow to love you and protect you as my omega, my husband, and my mate. I vow to be a good father to every child born of your womb whether born of my seed or not.  Christian Hawkins, owner and operator of Greasy Fingers Garage in Hollydale is in a rut. His life is spent taking care of his business and looking after his younger brother Kent. The scent of cinnamon is everywhere as the alpha finds himself haunted by the memory of the omega that he ran into...literally...on his way home from work one night.  On the run from the abusive ex who had no desire to be a father to the child he carries, omega Liam Leigh finds himself homeless, hungry, alone, and pregnant in the sweet little town of Hollydale just a couple weeks before Thanksgiving.  Christian and Liam both keep running into each other, as well as an odd little old man with a penchant for appearing just when he's most needed. But what's up with the unique golden tipped white feathers that keep popping up?  This is the second book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is 31k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language. Caution for possible triggers: The homeless MC is an assault survivor. No assault scenes are shown, just a factual, non-detailed accounting of past events.
