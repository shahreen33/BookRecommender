Jennifer Jane Watson has spent the past ten Christmases in a maximum security prison. The last thing she expects is to get early parole along with a job on a secluded Canadian cattle ranch serving Christmas holiday dinners to three of the sexiest cowboys she's ever met!  Rafe, Brady and Dan thought they were getting a couple of male ex-cons to help out around their secluded ranch. The last thing they expect is an attractive and very appealing woman fresh out of prison. In the snowbound wilds of Northern Ontario, female companionship is rare. It's a good thing the three men like to share...  They're dominating, sexy-as-sin and they fill JJ with the hottest m√©nage fantasies she's ever had. Suddenly she's craving Cowboys for Christmas and wishing for something she knows she can never have...a happily ever after.
