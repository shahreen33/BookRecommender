Rebecca and Gideon have been married for years and they are enjoying life happily when a tragic accident happens. They both die in the accident and are waiting to see what their fate will be. God makes them live the last three months of their life again separately on earth and they have to go through a series of trials to find each other again. 'I'll meet you in heaven!' Gideon promises as they are separated and cast back onto the earth in bodily forms which are no longer fully human. Their unity was their strength, their bind, their soul, their separation yields a yearning to find each other again that nothing else can fulfill. Was God so cruel as to create this special love then remove it and test it? Will they ever see each other again? Will they be reunited? Can Gideon's promise ever really come true? Rebecca yearns for the answers to these questions and more as she seeks for a purpose. Why were they cast back onto the earth, is the earth they have been cast back down onto real or is it merely a waiting room for death? What if at the end of it all there is nothing? What if its a deception and she never sees Gideon again. Can there be life whilst you are waiting for a love to be rekindled or is it just an empty existence void of promises and truths? What if she really died in the accident and he didn't and her mind is tricking her to believe something that did not exist. Or what if Gideon really died and she didn't and this is her imagination's way of shielding her from the grief of loss?Will Rebecca really meet Gideon again in Heaven or was the promise an illusion which will never be fulfilled?
