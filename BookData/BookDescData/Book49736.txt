New Brunswickers saw their first live Santa, as played by Fredericton confectioner Charles A. Sampson, in December 1872. When Sampson died in 1929 in his ninetieth year, he was described by the local newspaper as "a grand old man." In the 1880s, the author writes, a tree in a store window would be enough to draw a large crowd, and sometimes special trains were provided to take passengers from one town to the other to see.In Christmas in Atlantic Canada, prolific folklorist David Goss traces the history of the holiday in our region, from its earliest celebration, quite possibly in 1604, to modern times. Using historical records, diaries, and old newspapers, he documents the fascinating narrative of how the occasion has been marked. This book will appeal to history buffs and lovers of all things holiday. Includes 25 images. Features a foreword by Gerry Bowler, author of Santa Claus, A Biography and The World Encyclopedia of Christmas.
