Sylvia Blackwell is tired. Her grandchildren are being kept away from her, and the expected inheritance that might finally get her middle-aged son to move out has failed to materialise – thanks to her mother's cat. It is becoming increasingly difficult to remain composed. On a romantic clifftop walk for her 47th Wedding Anniversary, an unexpected opportunity leads to a momentous decision that will irretrievably change the course of her life.  The Craft Room is a darkly comic tale of sex, crepe paper, murder and knitting in a sleepy Devon town, with a 'truly original' premise and genuinely jaw-dropping moments. What would you do if unexpectedly freed from bondage you never knew you were in? How would your children cope? How far would you go to protect them from an uncomfortable truth? You can only push a grandmother so far...  Praise for Weekend Rockstars:-  “A classic British romantic comedy in fact, that I genuinely think stands up against the best out there - if Nick Hornby had written this, it would already have been optioned for a film, hit the Bestsellers list and wouldn’t be half as good as it is, because what the hell does he know about being in a covers band? I ask you.”  “Well written and accessible, this is a study of human nature as much a take on the foibles of budding rockstars.”  “Great characters, well-written and believable, lots of in-jokes, familiar circumstances. If you've ever been in a band, wanted to be in a band, even seen a band play, you should read this book”  “A fabulous, well written, funny and uplifting read. Totally believable characters. It is hard to believe that this is a debut novel.”  “I was expecting a niche book, only read by aspiring musicians. Instead I was surprised at the quality of the writing, especially the conversations. Potential film here.”  “Very accurately captures the euphoria/self loathing of playing "Sex on fire" to a room full of drunken divorcees.”  “It is a special book, and they don’t come along too often.”
