This novel, the author's masterpiece, is one of the greatest expressions ever of the tortured intersection of political and personal destinies in Eastern Europe. Futuristic, experimental, and remarkably prophetic, the book traces the adventures of a young Pole whose own fate parallels the collapse of Western civilization following a Chinese communist invasion from the East. Written in 1927, Witkiewicz's novel presages the horrifying anti-utopian society that would become a reality for millions of Eastern Europeans in the late 1930s. Insatiability succeeds in conveying the catastrophic mood of that time - its malaise, its desires, its terrifying glimpse of the future.
