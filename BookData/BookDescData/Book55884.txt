Lizzie is the busiest, buzziest bee in Hivetown! She longs to impress the Queen by winning a spelling contest, but she studies to the point of exhaustion on top of trying to juggle all her other activities. When she dozes off in the middle of the competition, the only solution is rest -- and her refreshing visit to the local Garden finally teaches Lizzie to stop and smell the flowers, "which...is exactly what bees are supposed to do."
