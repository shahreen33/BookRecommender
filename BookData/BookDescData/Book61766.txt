  Personal trainer Jonah Bodine discovers more than he bargained for with the half-siblings he didn’t know he had in small-town West Virginia. Not only is his dead father a person of interest in a cold case disappearance, but the entire town seems way too invested in Jonah’s happily ever after potential. His summer of solitude in a lakeside cottage is ruined when his matchmaking sister saddles him with an unwanted roommate. Adorable, snort-laughing nerd Shelby Thompson came to Bootleg Springs looking for answers and ends up getting adopted by the town’s nosy elders. Maneuvered into sharing a cottage with the handsome trainer, she makes the best of a sticky situation by offering her perpetually shirtless roommate a strings-free summer fling. Jonah is tempted. Very tempted. But Shelby has secrets. And as the Callie Kendall mystery unravels, Shelby’s own past comes back to haunt her. The danger is very real and so are the feelings she’s developing for Jonah.
