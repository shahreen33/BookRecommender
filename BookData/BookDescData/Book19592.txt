The poems in this book deal with some of the everlasting questions that we all have to face, and they may seem bleak and gloomy to some readers. What are we doing here? What purpose can we find for our lives? Is there any higher meaning that we can understand or is it just the here and now? Don't expect answers. It is a poetry book filled with skepticism, humor, and hope. Read it thinking about Baudelaire, and forget about Mary Oliver.
