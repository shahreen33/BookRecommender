It is New Year's Day at King Arthur's court, and a mysterious knight in green arrives at the holiday feast with a peculiar demand. He challenges anyone present to strike a blow against him with his fearsome great axe - but on the condition that, in one year's time, he may deliver the same blow in return. Gawain and the Green Knight is a comic adaptation of the Arthurian folktale of the same name. It will be posted in four parts, with the goal of publishing a hardcover print edition of the complete story in early 2017.
