Mohandas Gandhi (1869-1948) is widely acknowledged as one of the great souls of the twentieth century. As the leader of the Indian independence movement he defined the modem practice of nonviolence, wedding an ethic of love to a practical method of social struggle. In the end, however, his philosophy was rooted in a deep spirituality. For Gandhi the struggle for peace and social justice was ultimately related to the search for God. These writings reveal the heart and soul of a man whose life and message bear special relevance to all spiritual seekers.
