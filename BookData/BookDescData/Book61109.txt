Two hot-shot hockey players are about to clash in Genevive Chamblee’s sexy M/M romance Defending the Net.   Brighton Rabalais only wants to play hockey. He’s uninterested in the politics behind the sport, but his recruiting to the Saint Anne’s Civets is as much about politics as it is his hockey abilities. He’s been hired to replace the enigmatic, three-time champion, veteran goalie, Gatien Glesseau, who happens to be as sexy as he is talented.  Their clashing is inevitable, but Brighton can’t get a read on Gatien. However, with his own secrets a concern, Brighton doesn’t need another complication. But when Gatien threatens to invade Brighton’s privacy, Brighton defends his heart with the same vigor and passion as he does the net.
