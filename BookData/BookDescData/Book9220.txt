It was the adventure of a life time. In an obscure marina off the shores of Maryland a schooner unlike any other ever built was discovered. Dorian and Diana Coe purchased the schooner and sailed from the shores of tranquility into the bowels of hell itself. Prurient tales of suicide, murder, and the disappearance of an entire crew were hand written within the ship's logs. On her decks sailed a well seasoned Captain and crew that never knew the schooner's shadowed past. The new owners ignored the words of men with integrity and sailed the Black Witch in the Spring of 1935. Into the realms of illusion and pure evil the ship and its compliment sailed never knowing the fate awaiting them!
