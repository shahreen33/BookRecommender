This casebook allows students to learn more effectively by providing critical reading and thinking questions and well-situated text boxes with supplemental information to explain and expand understanding. With better advance preparation, class can begin at a more sophisticated level and proceed to deeper issues. The material is presented in a visually engaging manner, and the accompanying electronic version provides live links to cited sources and useful websites. Provisions from the Restatement, UCC, CISG, and UNIDROIT appear in text, eliminating the need for a statutory supplement. The book is organized chronologically in the traditional order for contract analysis. It includes classic cases foundational in the historical development of many concepts and newer cases chosen for their teachability and lessons about modern business practices and current issues. Practice Pointers provide a transactional focus by explaining the function of common contract clauses. The book includes both essay and multiple choice problems that encourage periodic review.
