Sewn signatures, printed on 125gsm acid-free paper, and bound by Atheneum Press in brown wibalin cloth stamped in gold, with a silk ribbon marker and head and tailbands. 300 copies.(Out of print)...from the publisher's website:Hidden away in the pages of an old copy of Lives of the Saints in a strange second-hand bookshop is a diary brimming with heresy and claims of supernatural powers. When civil servant Miguel Iba√±ez stumbles across it he at first believes it to be the ravings of a mad man. But what if it is true? What if the anonymous author has really learned the secrets of controlling time? Could Miguel acquire the same skills and thereby correct the incongruities in his own life?  Trapped in a mediocre job at a forgotten Ministry, his marriage falling apart, Miguel desperately searches for more hidden entries. He is led on an increasingly frantic chase through the bookstores, abandoned buildings and dark subways of Buenos Aires.  Miguel's obsession brings him to the doors of the Saint Perpetuus Club, a secret society that holds the key to the salamanca, the cave where the Devil grants all wishes . . . for a price.  The deeper Miguel goes, the more he wonders whom he can trust. His wife, his friends, his old philosophy professor? Perhaps they are all members of the Club? Is Miguel willing to risk his life, even his immortal soul, to uncover the secrets of The Saint Perpetuus Club of Buenos Aires?  The Saint Perpetuus Club of Buenos Aires is a sewn hardback novel of 233 pages with silk ribbon marker, head and tailbands, and d/w. Limited to 300 copies.  ISBN 978-1-905784-16-5
