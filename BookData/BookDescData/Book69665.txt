Sex is his weapon. Power is her drug.  Caesar Accardo is gasoline. Mostly harmless while stable, but Aria holds the match to set the dishonored Cosa Nostra prince on fire in more ways than one. And if he burns down everything in his path because of it—so be it.  The problem is … she just wasn’t prepared for all of him.  Aria De Rose is a hurricane. Amazing from afar, but destructive up close. Caesar keeps getting pulled into the Camorra queen’s plans in her effort to gain power, but he’s a better player than she knows.  The thing is … women like her are the reason why rules are meant to be broken.  Philadelphia isn’t ready for game these two are playing—the sacrifices they make might not be worth it in the end, and someone will always lose in a war.  They’re broken, so very vicious, and they are not the good guys. But for every villain in the world, there’s a monster at his back who made him that way.  And monsters like those hide in plain sight.
