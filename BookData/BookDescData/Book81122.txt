When the Sage Gardens Social Committee arranges a murder mystery weekend at a winter resort, Samantha convinces Walt, Jo and Eddy to join her, as the group that solves the murder wins a cruise.  But the cruise becomes the last thing on the four retirees’ minds when they are snowed in and then Eddy stumbles across a dead body. Then things get even worse when the body goes missing and the four friends find that they have a real murder mystery to solve. But how can they solve the mystery without a body?  Will the ‘Sage Gardens Sleuths’ find the dead body and the murderer before the snow melts and the murderer disappears? Or worse, will they land up in danger with no way to escape?  This is book 10 in the Sage Gardens Cozy Mystery Series. The main mystery is solved in each book, but the series is best enjoyed when read in order.
