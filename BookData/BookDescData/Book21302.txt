"One has all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it." —Jane AustenJane Austen’s masterpieces are littered with unsuitable gentlemen—Willoughby, Wickham, Churchill, Crawford, Tilney, Elliot, et al.—adding color and depth to her plots but often barely sketched. Have you never wondered about the pasts of her rakes, rattles, and gentlemen rogues? Surely, there's more than one side to their stories. In this romance anthology, eleven Austenesque authors expose the histories of Austen’s anti-heroes. "Dangerous to Know: Jane Austen’s Rakes & Gentlemen Rogues" is a titillating collection of Georgian era short stories—a backstory or parallel tale off-stage of canon—whilst remaining steadfast to the characters we recognize in Austen’s great works.What say you? Are you in? Everyone may be attracted to a bad boy…even temporarily...but heaven help us if we marry one. MATURE CONTENT as per EDITOR 1. None: possible kissing and affection2. Mild: kissing3.
