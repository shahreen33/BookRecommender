In Prattville (formerly called Dead Dog), Oklahoma, in 1916, Tulsa May Bruder has given up on love. Her first and only suitor -- Doctor Odysseus P. Foote, better known as Doc Odie -- has jilted her at their very public engagement party. The whole town is talking and Tulsa May feels like the local wallflower. But then Luther Harlan Briggs, who has been like a brother to her for the last decade, tries to retrieve Tulsa's standing by pretending to court her, knowing that a new gentleman caller -- especially one with his wild reputation -- will replace the old one in the town folks' gossip. Suddenly, Tulsa May sees a face she's known forever in a whole new light - and realizes that, as Luther says, "friendship can turn to romance in the blink of an eye."
