Charging from the pages of SHADOWLAND comes the all-new POWER MAN &amp; IRON FIST! When Danny Rand transformed his multinational corporation into a non-profit foundation, he thought he had left fighting behind - but with so many innocents wrongly convicted, the battle never ends! Their first case is Luke Cage and Danny Rand's former secretary, Jennie Royce, imprisoned for a murder she didn't commit - or did she? And Iron Fist isn't fighting alone. He's got a new partner: Victor Alvarez, the all-new Power Man, he of the exploding punches - and exploding temper! Can Danny train his young charge well enough to face returning foil El Aguila - as well as new threats Don Pagliacci; the Commedia Dell'Morte; and the beautiful, deadly Noir? That's right, Marvel's original mismatched action duo begins a new era of greatness right here! Collecting POWER MAN &amp; IRON FIST (2011) #1-5.
