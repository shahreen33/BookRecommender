  Loki Grant’s first memories are of living in a crate behind an inn in Ayr, struggling to survive. Clan Grant saved him from his lonely existence and took him in as one of their own. But though the Highlands have become his home and he loves his adopted parents, Brodie and Celestina, Loki feels lost. Part of him is still that scrappy wee lad who relied on his wits to survive the streets, and he is not sure he belongs. The feistiest and most beautiful lass in the clan, Arabella, steals his heart, but when her father resists the match because Loki is not of clan blood, Loki decides to confront his past. He wishes to satisfy Bella’s father by discovering his parentage, but he also hopes his quest will help him understand his purpose.
  As far as Arabella is concerned, Loki Grant is the wiliest, brawest, and most handsome warrior in existence. She is determined to have him as her husband regardless of what her father thinks. So when Loki’s search for his sire leads him into trouble, she rushes headlong after him.
  
    
      Together, Loki and Arabella must discover the dark secrets of Loki’s origins, for only by confronting the past can they hope for a bright future together.
