When her well-meaning boss puts a PI on her case, Mackenzie comes face to face with the incredible, unbelievable truth: magic is real, and whatever spell has kept her hidden and separate from the paranormal world is rapidly deteriorating.  With time running out, she has no choice but to trust Jackson as they struggle to uncover the truth of her past—and her destiny.
