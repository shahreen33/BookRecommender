Like his novel, Snow Falling On Cedars, for which he received the PEN/Faulkner Award, Guterson's beautifully observed and emotionally piercing short stories are set largely in the Pacific Northwest. In these vast landscapes, hunting, fishing, and sports are the givens of men's lives. With prose that stings like the scent of gunpowder, this is a collection of power.ContentsAngels in the snowOpening dayDay of the moonwalkAliensWood grouse on a high promontory overlooking CanadaPiranhasThree huntersAmerican elmArcturusThe flower garden
