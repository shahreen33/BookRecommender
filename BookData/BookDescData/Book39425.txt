Preternatural beauty, sublime vistas, starlit groves? Elsewhere is a place you can taste and smell and touch. Elsewhere is far more real than the stifling workaday world, and it's all in Magri White's head. Thousands daytrip to Elsewhere to Escape and explore. But beware, tourist: something that Magri did not call up is roaming this Dreamland. A limb-ripping shape-shifter who is outside Magri's control. Was this yellow-eyed werewolf once Jaeger Ayers? You won't get out without paying his price. Blending humor and horror, Dream Sequence is Carla Speed McNeil's most challenging book yet.
