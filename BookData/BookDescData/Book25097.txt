A modern day fairy tale from the creator of the critically-acclaimed Bunny Drop!High school student Yaneko loves to sleep, so much that she can barely wake up of her own accord. That is, until she is roused from her slumber by a sleep spirit known as Nerim. Yaneko must accompany the benevolent spirit on his daily work route, as he grants the gift of comfortable sleep to people (and animals!) of all ages. But just what is his true purpose and why has he chosen Yaneko to be his assistant? This could very well be the beginning of a beautiful friendship!
