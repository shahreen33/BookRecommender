Kari Hagen didn’t want to come to Walker Creek, Texas, but she made a promise. She’s supposed to deliver a letter to her late mother’s first love, so now she just has to find him. Should she accept an offer of assistance from that tall cowboy who’s as handsome as any man she’s ever seen? The sooner Mr. Caleb Walker gets her mother’s letter, the sooner Kari can get busy earning money as a seamstress for her train fare back to Minnesota!  Seth Davis isn't expecting any surprises when he meets the train. He plans to pick up his uncle’s new racehorse and head back to Walker Creek Ranch. Yet what about that pretty little miss standing alone on the platform…all honey-gold curls, blue calico, and no taller than his chin? Is she lost? He’s never seen her before, though she looks oddly familiar, something telling Seth that his day just got a whole lot more interesting.  
  Walker Creek Brides, a sweet Western historical romance series by award-winning author Miriam Minger that reminds us angels are near and love is where you least expect to find it.
