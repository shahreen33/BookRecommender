On Cole Morgan's first day working at Prowl magazine he sends an innocent email to his friend, not realizing that all internal emails are monitored. It wouldn't be a big deal except for the fact that the email is all about his new boss, sexy werewolf Evan West. The email leads to an incredibly awkward workplace harassment seminar which just makes Evan hate him all the more. It couldn't possibly get worse, right? Wrong.Evan West has always had trouble controlling his wolf. He's worked hard to master the beast within. So when Cole Morgan walks in his boardroom and Evan's instincts go wild it causes him to automatically dislike the man. It doesn't matter that he wants to throw him down on the table, there and then, and take him in front of the entire office, the human is still annoying as hell.
