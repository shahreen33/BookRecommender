One blizzard, two days, three men to keep her warm."Powertools, Book 3"Naked is Kayla's style. She's exposed to bare skin more than the average person-like when she's up to her elbows in massage oil, soothing the tired muscles of the construction crew building her new spa, a barter to offset some of the cost. Once it's finished, she plans to open a private retreat for fellow naturists.It should be a routine service. Yet for some reason, caressing the man on her table is blurring her normally crystal-clear distinction between nudity and sexuality. And stirring up kinky fantasies involving the rest of the crew.She never intended to share details about her lifestyle-slash-business plan, not even with the open-minded, sexy crew. But when a faulty truck engine and one hell of a snowstorm trap the three men at her cabin, heat sears away her cover story-and her inhibitions.Cocooned in blissful isolation, Dave, Neil and James show her that passion knows no barrier, with or without clothing. Leaving Kayla wondering if two days of mutual satisfaction will ever be enough...Warning: This book features a m/m/m/f menage hot enough to melt an entire blizzard's worth of snow and ice.
