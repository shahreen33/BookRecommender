#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER “Compulsively readable.”—The Wall Street Journal “Don’t pick up [this] Jack Reacher novel if you don’t have some time on your hands, because Worth Dying For is difficult to put down. . . . Child manages to get an amazing amount of suspense into the novel.”—Associated Press   There’s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it. First he falls foul of the Duncans, a local clan that has terrified an entire county into submission. But it’s the unsolved, decades-old case of a missing child that Reacher can’t let go.   The Duncans want Reacher gone—and it’s not just past secrets they’re trying to hide. For as dangerous as the Duncans are, they’re just the bottom of a criminal food chain stretching halfway around the world. For Reacher, it would have made much more sense to put some distance between himself and the hard-core trouble that’s bearing down on him. For Reacher, that was also impossible.BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Lee Child's The Affair.  “A model of suspenseful storytelling and an outstanding addition to a series that stands in the front rank of modern thrillers.”—The Washington Post “Still the thinking man’s action hero, supreme butt-kicker and smartest guy in the room.”—The Seattle Times “This series is about as good as pop fiction gets.”—The Miami Herald
