Susan cannot stand living with her eleven younger siblings for another minute, so she answers an advertisement for a mail order bride, carefully choosing a man who has never married and has no children so she won’t be plagued with other people’s ill-behaved offspring. When she arrives in Fort Worth, she finds out her fiancé has been killed, and his older brother is offering to take his place. The only problem is his brother is a widower with four young boys. Dare she do it?
