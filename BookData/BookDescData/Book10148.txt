Love, romance, hearts, flowers, cupid…. Rubbish.Abby Fine still hasn’t gotten over the pain of a year-old betrayal and plans to spend this Valentine’s Day drowning her sorrows with a ménage of men named Ben, Jerry, and Riesling. Her plans are diverted when she drops and breaks her new iPhone and gives in to a momentary hormone surge, agreeing to let office hottie and tech god Tom Walker squirm his way into her condo to fix it. Tom shows up with his Xbox, spicy Chinese food, and a habit of stealing kisses every time she lets her guard down. Can a weekend of laughter, video games, and movies change Abby’s opinion of stupid Cupid?
