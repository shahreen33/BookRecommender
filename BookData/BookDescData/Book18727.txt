My dark and light, my heaven and hell, my day and night, my sunshine and rain, they are my perfect opposites."
Life isn't always beautiful, it doesn't always take you down the right path, it doesn't always make you laugh and it certainly doesn't always go as planned.My story starts with Whiskey and Jase Levanox. My best friends. A piece of my soul. My glue. My bind. My everything. We were inseparable.But life doesn't always give us what we want and when given a choice, sometimes we can't choose. How do you pick between two people you love so deeply? So I ended up alone.Then I found Jase again. He's sick. Cancer. He can't find Whiskey and it's now up to me to reunite the brothers but what if I can't? What if Whiskey doesn't want to be found? What if I can't face the man I loved so deeply?Loosing Jase will break me, but he's part of how this story comes together. Life goes how life goes and to understand mine and Whiskey's story, you have to understand Jase's. Even if it burns. So this...this is our story.
