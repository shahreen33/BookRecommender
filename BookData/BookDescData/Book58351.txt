With fantastic beasts, savage survivors of a nuclear war, and imaginative artwork by Frank Thorne and Jack Sparling, Mighty Samson Archives Volume 2 hits the ground running with nonstop post-apocalyptic adventure and sci-fi fun. Created by prolific writer Otto Binder and artistic titan Frank Thorne, the Mighty Samson's comic-book career lasted for only thirty-two issues, but Dark Horse is bringing the exploits of this daring, one-eyed adventurer to modern audiences in a series of elegant hardcovers! Born into a peaceful yet primitive tribe of N'Yark, in a radioactive future America, Samson vows to protect his defenseless human kin from the dangers around them -- and his motto becomes, "To protect the weak from the powerful, the good from the evil!" With the beautiful Sharmaine and her scientist father, Mindor, Samson ventures out into his strange world on a quest to unravel the secrets of his country's past while surviving in a future filled with ridiculously transformed animals and desperate, violent humans. Surprisingly lighthearted, these tales have more than a little humor mixed in with their themes of destruction and human folly.
