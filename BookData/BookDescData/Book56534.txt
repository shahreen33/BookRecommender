Now that Special Agent Nate Hawthorn is busy determining if their latest case was murder or suicide, and is left dealing with the backlash of Connor Levineâ€™s release, Suede Harris finds information that could lead to a potential motive for their killer. But will she share it with Nate, or try to find answers on her own?  While sorting out the timeline, Suede learns secrets that could not only land her in hot water with the Sheriff, but change everything she trusts and believes. When betrayal cuts too close to home, Suede is forced to see just who has her back and who would leave her hanging.   Author Note: This is book 3 of a 6 book murder mystery series. The books cannot standalone, so please be warned that you'd need to read all 6 to get the full story. Each book will release the last Thurs of the month! The town in the story is fictional, so the coordinates on the cover do NOT correlate to the murder locations. Hope you love the story.
