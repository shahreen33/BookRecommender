He's seven feet tall, blue, and horned. He's an assassin and one of the most dangerous prisoners here. He's like no one I've ever met before...and he might be my only chance.This story stands completely alone and is only marginally connected to the Ice Planet Barbarians or Corsairs series. You do not need to read those books in order to follow this one.
