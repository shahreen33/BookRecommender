She was never meant to be his…  Two ruthless enemies. One cage. Zero chance of escape. An explosive lust that can’t be contained.  Council assassin Jade Lakotesh survives by trusting no one. Attachments a weakness. Sex a weapon. Her mission success rate flawless. Until she ends up naked, captured, and collared, her latest assignment in jeopardy. The blame for her predicament: the hothead, scarred man who prowls the cage beside her—his confusing appeal a danger she has no idea how to neutralize.  Ex-Resistance fighter Walsh Ryker hit rock bottom with the deaths of those he loved most. Now, he’s plummeted to a new low, trapped with a cellmate as ice cold as she is stunningly hot. She’s out for blood, lacks any ability to cooperate…and leaves him more alive than he’s been in years. For a man no longer interested in feeling anything at all, she may be the greatest hazard he’s faced to date.  As danger mounts and they must work together to defeat a shared threat, will the unwelcome passion between these two enemies entomb them in the dark forever—or be the key that sets them free?  TORMENTED, Book Three in the Condemned series, is a stand-alone, high heat, action-adventure romance that hurtles to the ends of the universe to explore redemption and forgiveness, need and love, and the power of second chances.  Like the other books in the Condemned series, TORMENTED can stand on its own.  This book does come with a trigger warning. Dragath25 is a dark, brutal prison planet.
