Revenge never tasted so sweet.  I had started over and made a great life for myself. Then Logan walked back into my life, but he didn't recognize me. He had walked away ten years ago and devastated me. Now I would get my revenge and make him pay for hurting me. Who says that revenge can't be fun? He's still the same cocky guy I knew, but he's also sweet and that made me question how long I could hold out for. I planned to thoroughly enjoy my time with Logan before I destroyed his life. I just hoped the cost wouldn't be too high.  I've lived my life the way I wanted to, not answering to anyone else. The result was friends that don't have a very high opinion of me and a lonely life that I started to wish included someone who truly cared for me. Cece was the hottest thing I'd ever seen and the moment I had her, I knew she was not just someone that would pass through my life. My attraction to her didn't dim, even when she left me tied to a bed. Her spirit and spunky attitude didn't push me away no matter how hard she tried, but I began to question if I could truly bring this woman around or if she would be the one to tear my world apart.
