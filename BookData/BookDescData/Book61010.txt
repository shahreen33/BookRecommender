She wants to save the Knights…  When Miranda Callahan’s father, principle owner and hands-on dictator of the Georgia Knights, has a heart attack, the responsibility to make the team an independent success becomes solely hers. Though everyone expects her to fail in her new role, Miranda is determined to take her team to the top and earn her father's love and respect on the way. The only other obstacle is the League's consultant – a secret crush from her past – the man trying to take over the team, and the one person who can save them all.  He wants revenge…  LUCAS WAINRIGHT is a turnaround consultant, hired by the League to save the Knights and so many other teams – only this time it’s personal; before being ousted by Seamus Callahan, Lucas' family had been the owners of the team. Now, he has the perfect opportunity to regain his rightful position with the Knights, if he’s willing to suppress his scruples and his attraction to Miranda Callahan.  Can Miranda and Lucas let go of old grudges and hold on to their new love?  The Knights of Passions series Book 1: Going all the Way Book 2: Love from Left Field Book 3: The Game Changer
