Love and parasites, painfully hungry work, people in the water, vindication at a price, itchy needles, lingering debts, ignored warnings, and the true cost of an epidemic. Experience the worst kind of parental guidance, watch the devil bleed, and wait for the eternal messengers to take you apart before carrying the last pieces of you away.Straddling the boundaries between horror, suspense, dark humor, and the bizarre - Ants In My Blood is a diverse collection featuring eighteen compelling tales from the author of Indifference and Daddy Monster.
