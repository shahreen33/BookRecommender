HE' S WANTED HER FOR SEVEN YEARS Samuel McDougal never could take Harriet out of his mind since the first day he met her as a freshman at Oxford. But with too red hair and too big spectacles, he surely has no chance. He must forget her and move on; though he's not been with a woman before. AND SHE'S JUST A GOVERNESS Harriet always knew of Samuel's infatuation with her, expecting he'd grow out of it. For some time though, she's been stirred by his tall and lean person. More than stirred in fact. Albeit he's the heir to a powerful Scottish clan, due to a lofty match. As a humble widow, she can only dream of him. BUT RANKS DON'T COUNT WHEN DESIRE SIMMERS.  Erotic novella
