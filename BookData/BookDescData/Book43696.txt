Better yet, touch me instead?” With skin the color of smooth vanilla, and the sensual glint in those caramel-brown eyes, even a pledged virgin like Piper has to fight off the lure of his sexuality. She opts instead for a friendship based on their shared abusive backgrounds.Piper is determined to forge a better life in California. But the collective cries of nine murdered women reaching out to her from those weekly news bulletins suspends that task.
