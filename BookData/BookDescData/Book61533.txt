Mary Todd Lincoln is probably the most maligned of famous women in our nation's history. The truth about the President's wife has for years been hidden under a mountain of myth built up largely by Lincoln's biographer and law partner, William H. Herndon. Now for the first time the true woman beneath that myth is presented in a warmly sympathetic biography based on new research. When the veil of legend surrounding her is torn aside, and entirely new picture of a woman and a marriage emerges.
