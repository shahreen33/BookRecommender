Saffron McNabb is living her best life. After abandoning corporate rat race almost twenty years before, Saffy’s happily managing a small bed and breakfast in the north Georgia mountains. That is, until the owner of the Creekside B &amp; B wants to sell, and not to Saffy. Bruce Baird is in desperate need of a change. Bored both professionally and personally, when he’s forced to take vacation, the normally unadventurous actuary decides to throw caution to the wind. A close encounter with one of Saffy’s rescued animals leaves the tightly-wound man and the free-spirited woman at odds. But when reality intrudes on the odd couple, they find they have more in common than not, and maybe, just maybe, Saffy and Bruce actually make a perfect combination.
