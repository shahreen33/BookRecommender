No one reading this book could possibly remain untouched by the beauty and intelligence of these powerful mammals of the sea."—Irene Pepperberg, author of Alex &amp; Me"Reiss fills the book with such intriguing tales and with the science behind them… Reiss is passionate about her science, but she is passionate about her subjects as well."—The Tampa Bay Times
