A party girl and a clean-cut college hockey player discover that they’re not so different in this sexy, soulful Bayard Hockey novel from the bestselling author of Shut Out and the Heller Brothers series. Ella Verran has three goals this semester: get off academic probation, repair her relationship with her friend Skylar, and take some responsibility for her life. All of which are hard enough without hot, snobby hockey player Ben Buckingham around to distract her. Ella can’t stand Ben, and she knows the feeling is mutual. But he’s best friends with Skylar’s boyfriend, so he’s always around—taunting and tempting Ella in ways she never thought possible. As the star forward of the Bayard College hockey team, Ben has goals too, like playing well enough to land a spot on an NHL roster. Ben is perfectly poised on the ice, so why can’t he keep his cool around Ella? Her wild behavior rubs him in all the wrong ways—and a few of the right ones. But as they skate around each other, Ben learns that there’s more to Ella than her bad reputation. And when the line between love and hate starts to blur, he can’t resist crossing over and sweeping her off her feet. “Kelly Jamieson is my go-to author for hockey romance.”—USA Today bestselling author Jami Davenport The Aces Hockey series: MAJOR MISCONDUCT | OFF LIMITS | ICING | TOP SHELF | BACK CHECK The Bayard Hockey series: SHUT OUT | CROSS CHECK The standalone hockey romance: DANCING IN THE RAIN And don’t miss her Last Shot series: BODY SHOT | HOT SHOT Includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.
