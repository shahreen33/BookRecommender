This is a celebration of books, reading, and our imaginations, I Wish I Could Write a Book opens with a list of types of books and where to find them. The simple, lyrical prose then becomes more frantic as a young reader encounters pirates sailing the sea, a classroom of monsters "learning math with their paws," and even an animal doctor making house calls in a helicopter.With lavish illustrations nearly spilling off the page, the young reader finally makes a startling discovery about his own imagination and creativity. This book is for anyone who loves books and wants to instill this passion in the next generation.
