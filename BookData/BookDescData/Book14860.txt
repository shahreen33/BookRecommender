Scientifically speaking, it made sense to send two hundred women and 'frozen pops' to establish the colony on New Georgia and insure a good gene pool. But when the colonists arrive after fifteen years of space travel, and discover that the alien compound directly across from their new city is filled with young, virile Xtanian men eager for 'queens' Eden Chisholm has her hands full trying to keep the peace. The Xtanian's themselves are stunningly human-like, but their customs are completely alien to Earth culture. In the Xtianian society, women are rare and therefore the men are of little value beyond what they provide for the comfort and safety of their 'queens'. And the queens have harems. Rating: Contains graphic sex, explicit language, profanity, some violence, group sex, and some material that could be offensive to sensitive readers.
