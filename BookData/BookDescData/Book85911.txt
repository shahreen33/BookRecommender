Nothing in life has ever come easy for the boy from the other side of the tracks. A mother that left. A father that hit. A brother that protected. They say everything happens for a reason. Joss Hess has spent his entire life looking for that reason. After nearly killing a man and barely avoiding prison, Joss finds himself sentenced to 18 months on Briscoe Ranch, where certain things are expected. Hard work. Manners. Responsibility. Respect. Worst of all—anger management and restraint. If he fails, Joss will be sent back to the state penitentiary to serve the remainder of his sentence. One road block stands between Joss and his freedom: Ren BriscoeRaised by ranchers, Ren Briscoe has been around men her entire life. Home on summer vacation, she quickly realizes that Joss Hess is unlike any man she has ever encountered before. She hates everything about him…his filthy mouth, arrogant attitude, the way he makes fun of her purity ring and her boyfriend. Mostly, she hates him because no matter how hard she fights it. Joss occupies her every thought. He may be the convict serving his sentence; but the real prisoner is Ren.
