Zinnia Riddle doesn't use her witch powers much these days. She works as a clerk at the Wisteria Permits Department, where there hasn't been much need for spells and potions... until now.  When a beloved coworker is found dead next to her desk, the whole office gets paranoid. Is one of them a killer? Did the victim leave behind clues in the book she was writing? Is there a town-wide conspiracy, or is some lone serial predator on the loose?  The police are always two steps behind the evil that's threatening the peaceful town. Now it's up to Zinnia Riddle and the witches in her coven to uncover the secrets hiding in plain sight.  Will Zinnia's rusty magic hold up against a powerful enemy?  WOLVES OF WISTERIA is the sixth book set in Angela Pepper's Wisteria Witches universe, and the first book featuring Zinnia Riddle in her own thrilling mystery!
