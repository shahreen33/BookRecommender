Her world fell apart when King’s Harlots no longer trusted her, but she continues to fight to gain back their respect. All she wants is to help those wronged by the evil that has put a shadow on everyone she knows. Asher Donovan comes to her for help when he needs her most only to have passion flare up between them.
