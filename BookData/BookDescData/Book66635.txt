Sometimes we experience something so traumatic in our lives, it changes us forever…Renee Johnson has found herself in the midst of turmoil. She has made nothing but a complete mess out of her life and nothing could prepare her for the path laid out before her. An unexpected turn of events plunges her into the most challenging situation she has ever faced. With her best friend, Miah Hunter at her side, Renee must traverse a course that most would not even dare.Chase Randall, Renee’s new love interest and her light in a dark world, has been challenged by something he never expected. A surprise situation sure to test his resolve and ultimately, his humanity. Despite the negative impact of their plight on their lives, Chase weather’s the storm, only to face the biggest tribulation in the end. Together, Renee and Chase withstand the beating, leaving them to face a new world in the aftermath of their tragic loss.Subjected to the indecision of medical professionals who insist on perpetuating a practice they claim is safe, every woman should learn to question them. Doctors are human too and are far from perfect, but patients tend to say nothing, never challenge their practices, and therefore things will never change. The events described in this memoir were either a direct or indirect result of a doctor’s dismissal of signs of impending difficulties, or their failure to act in a timely fashion using interventions that could have otherwise made a difference. In A Flash calls them all into question and, with any luck, will force them to at least look into what appears to be the source of devastating loss for thousands of women everywhere. End the madness: Question their motives, stand up for your rights, and never allow them to disregard even the slightest concern.
