  Is my perfect match on campus one guy or three?
 I had a filthy fantasy. One so bad that the night before going to college, I had the wildest dream about the all-star football player falling at my feet. I was brought down to reality as I soon found out that life at NYU didn’t turn out the way that I hoped. All the social clubs that I joined were a bust and my roommate turned out to be far from my friend, but a bully that I needed to get as far away from as possible. Suddenly, I got a text. Not any ordinary text, but one so dirty that it drove my mind wild. It messed with me. So, I responded. And that’s how the texting relationship started and as the texts got dirtier there was only one thing on my mind... who was this guy? Or was it three guys? The message tone changed depending on the time of day. The ones I got first thing in the morning, were so hot that they could turn steel bars into pools of molten metal. The ones in the afternoon were even better but just… different. And the texts I got in the evening were so damn dirty I could barely sleep without putting my hands between my thighs. They were so addictive that I agreed to meet this Casanova of the text world. I had one worry, though. What if it was three guys? What was I going to do with all three of them at once?   Author´s Note: Triple Sext is a stand-alone reverse harem with a mixture of bullying, romance, humor, and even suspense.
