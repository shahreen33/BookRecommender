He carries the burden of protecting an entire townBeing the oldest Kennard brother, I’ve got a centuries-old promise to uphold—run the family business to give the townspeople jobs and the sort of security they can only find in Justice. When a motorcycle club blows that plan apart, I’ll do anything to make them aware that they picked the wrong town to target. As a former Green Beret, I know just how to sabotage an enemy. The only weakness in my armor is my attraction to a five-foot-nothing blonde who unknowingly holds my heart in her hands. My obsession with her could cost me my life, but I’d sacrifice it all to save hers.She owes a debt that could cost her lifeI’ve spent three years hiding out in Justice and paying off a debt to the Soul Suckers, one they’ve decided to collect whether I’m ready to pay or not. When danger lands on my doorstep, one man jumps in to help. Alder Kennard—former Special Forces soldier and current object of all my fantasies. But the Soul Suckers won’t let a debt go unpaid, and with the price on my head rising every day, it’s only a matter of time until they come back for me. Alder would put his life on the line to save mine, which is something I simply can’t afford.Everyone has a debt to pay, and the only currency I have left is my body. So when the time comes, I’ll trade my life for his.
