Escape with a ruthless player tonight… When Sam McKinley meets Nikolai Rustanov, it’s fire at first sight. A fire she runs away from as quickly as her heels can carry her. All Sam has ever wanted was a nice, normal family with a nice, normal man. The arrogant Russian hockey player who claims he doesn’t believe in love right before he offers to “eat her for breakfast,” is about as far from that as a girl can get. But some flames just won’t go out. Sam is dead set on running. But Nikolai is determined to catch her, and when he does, he’ll do just about anything to make her surrender. The tenth smoking hot interracial romance in the 50 Loving States series, HER RUSSIAN SURRENDER is a deep read set in Indiana that will melt your heart and ignite your sense of passion.
