Molly Kincaid is an extremely successful and equally wealthy defense attorney, but that is all even her closest friends know about her. Behind the facade is a dark past she thought she buried long ago. Now, Molly must face that past and the danger that comes with it. Murders and mayhem, a Civil War gold legend, and a secret Molly has carried for twenty-nine years threaten to bring her world crashing down around her. Molly Kincaid must return to the land of her birth and nothing good can come of that... or could it? Molly's house is on fire and the only way out is through the flames.
