“Must be brave, stubborn, and impervious to the tempers of loved ones.”The first line hissed with history.“Hours are endless, pay is non-existence, quitting absolutely forbidden.”The second line ached with truth.“Able to function on no sleep, refrain from running when times get hard, and be more than just a living canvas but a lover.” The third thrummed with honesty.“Other attributes required: forgiving, opinionated, and not afraid to tell me when I’m wrong. Must also enjoy being touched and kissed at any time of my choosing.”The fourth glowed with promise.“Call or email ‘YOUR HEART, HIS SOUL’ if interested in applying.”The final made my future unfold.The advert was so similar to one I should never have applied for. A twist of fate that brought two destined people back together. A job I would take in a heartbeat if the employer could offer such terms.But I wasn’t free.Neither was Gil. Therefore, my interview could never happen.
