A dark force lurks among the trees in the forest of Silverwood. Welcome to the most terrifying camping trip of your life. Deep within the forest of Silverwood, California, a crack between dimensions has appeared. A dark force that lurks among the trees is growing stronger, determined to return home if it can only gather the strength to open the doorâ€”bad news for a Boy Scout troop and the employees of Hirsch Capital on a company retreat nearby. As their darkest fears and impulses power the mysterious force, their bonding exercises take a deadly turn. Will anyone be able to keep their minds long enough to close the door before our world is torn apart? Created by Brian Keene, based on Silverwood by Tony E. Valenzuela.
