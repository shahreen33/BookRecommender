A Classic Tale of Adventure and Terror “You have entered a world of death, but do not want to die. No treasure on earth is worth facing the Yeti.”In the year 1850, a British caravan crossing the Himalayan Mountains from India into China has vanished, along with its priceless treasure. Now the race is on to reclaim the lost fortune as a pair of intrepid soldiers - a virtuous African private and a daring British corporal - spearhead their own mission to seize the prize by betraying their fellow troops. On this epic adventure, each man’s will, character and fortitude will be challenged to survive the perilous quest as they battle the wrath of the vengeful English army, the fury of the native bandits, the greed of their cutthroat accomplices, and the harsh, frozen hell of the alpine peaks. And the only other obstacle to their success is a savage beast of mythical power.
