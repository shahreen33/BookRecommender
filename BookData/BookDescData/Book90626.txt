Tomas hates school, hates books and hates stories. Forced to visit the library, he stops to listen to magical tales that the Unicorn Lady spins. These tales draw him in and are about to change the course of his life for ever... Set against the backdrop of war-torn Europe, I Believe in Unicorns explores the power of stories to transform lives. Produced in association with the Unicorn Theatre, the first purpose-built professional theatre for children in the UK, located on London's South Bank.
