Chief (Knox Fire 3) An Alpha Older Firefighter and Younger BBW Romance  Hanna I am a nurse and I’ve fallen for my patient. His face and neck were burned in a fire when he saved a little boy. His girlfriend sees him and she leaves him in the hospital, but I know she will come to her senses and come back to him. Before she does, I just have to prove to him that his scars don’t matter to me and I don’t care that he is older than me.   Noah Her voice is the first thing I heard in the hospital bed. And when I wake up, she is the first person I search for. When I realize how young she is, I try to push her away because she deserves someone who is younger and without a mangled face. That’s what I keep telling myself anyway. If only I can convince my heart.  Note: This is a steamy, sweet, SHORT romance. It has a HEA with alpha male and a plus size woman that makes him hers! If you love short romances with insta love, hot love scenes, and a sweet story, then this one is for you.
