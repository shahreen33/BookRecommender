Up until two years ago, I was living large and my life’s priorities were anchored to three things – my NBA stardom, money and celebrity.I was also a colossal dick. Until one night turned my world upside down and I suffered unspeakable loss. That event changed the man I was and made me a widowed-single father. Now I’m a desperate parent trying to raise my special needs son and find him a trustworthy live-in nanny. Grad student Brooklyn Hayes may be the one, with her single-minded focus on caring for my son and finishing her Master’s degree. She’s the perfect fit for our needs. Maybe too perfect… with her bright smile, nurturing kindness and gentle touch. Caleb isn’t the only one who’s fallen for her. I don’t know when or how it happened, but she changed the game for me. Turning my losing streak into a winning second-half. Game Changer is a Single Dad/Nanny Romance.
