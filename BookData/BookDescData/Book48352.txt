A KISS OF MADNESS  Madness - A word defined as the state of insanity. Chaotic frenzy. Crazy.  It doesn’t matter how you define it. It only matters how you perceive it.  I’ve always known things I shouldn’t know. Seen things I shouldn’t see, things no one else sees. But one terrifying vision—and my reaction to it—lands me in Brocker’s Center for the Criminally Insane. I’m convinced I can make it through my time here unscathed. After all, I’m not crazy. But after spending time with three guys—a schizophrenic with two personalities, a pathological liar who isn’t to be trusted, and a nymphomaniac with a penchant for knives—I’m beginning to doubt my sanity.  Can I separate the real from the mad, or will this place make me spiral further down into the dark recesses of my mind?  Am I crazy? I’ll let you decide...  *This is a twisted romance novel that’ll leave you questioning if what you’re reading is true, or just a Kiss Of Madness*  **WARNING: This book contains themes and situations some readers may find sensitive including mental illness, assault, and attempted sexual assault.
