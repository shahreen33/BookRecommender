Kitty wasn't always such a scaredy-cat. She used to be brave and lionhearted and nervy. That is, until one late October day a group of terrifying monsters showed up on her doorstop and Kitty became VERY scared. Then she decided to take matters into her own paws.Bad Kitty is back in her first full-length picture book since A Bad Kitty Christmas (over 300,000 copies sold to date), just in time for another holiday! Now she's up against something scary, something creepy, something more frightening than Puppy's good moods: Halloween.
