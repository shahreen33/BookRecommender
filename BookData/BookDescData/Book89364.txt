The newest book in Karen Chance's New York Times bestselling vampire series!Being a time traveler is a bitch, just ask Cassie Palmer. As the Pythia, or chief seer for the supernatural world, she's got responsibilities and powers — including the ability to travel through time — she still doesn't fully understand. Cassie is on what should have been a quick mission to rescue the near immortal mage John Pritkin, a friend lost in time. But nothing is ever simple where Cassie is concerned. For one thing, her friend isn't lost, his soul is, and she must hunt for it through the ages in different versions of himself. For another, Cassis is stuck traveling with Pritkin's father, the only one who can reverse Pritkin's curse . . . and an irascible demon who is high on Cassie's list of least-favorite people. And third, the guardians of the time-line don't want anyone mucking about with it — even a Pythia like Cassie — and especially not when she's dragging a powerful demon along!What's a poor Pythia to do?Well, if that Pythia is Cassie Palmer, it's to carry on anyway. And in between flitting about through time, to also stop the return of an ancient and very vengeful god. And to find out the startling truth about her parents. And to sort out a few things with her charming, evasive and completely maddening vampire lover. And you thought your week was packed!
