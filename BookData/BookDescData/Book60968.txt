A bitter lone wolf An angry Alpha A kidnapping gone wrong A cult planning to end shifterkind...  Tegan  Being kidnapped wasn't on my list of things to do tonight, but seeing as my life was already halfway down the shitter? Why not? I have no family. No pack. No home. No one will miss me.  To add insult to injury, the very ticked off Alpha wolf who's taken me hostage? Just happens to be my fated mate. I hate him. I want him. Lust is complicated when all you want to do is gouge his eyes out.   But even if we mated, he won't want me once he sees the brand on my chest. I'm marked. Hunted. A danger to him and his pack...  Too bad I'm too selfish to walk away.   Finding Home is a 34,000 word paranormal romance, and the first book in the Northpoint Wolves series. There are mpreg elements in later books, and this series is a bit darker than my usual fare, but there is a guaranteed HEA for all my couples. See author's note for list of triggers.
