A journey through the inbetween places of the British landscape to the bleak coast, Kingdom follows a family on their holiday to a small caravan park, where teenager Andrew explores the dunes, and half-remembered stories from the past are shared. Once again, Jon McNaught creates a beautiful graphic novel that makes the ordinary, extraordinary.
