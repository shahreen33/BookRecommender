A debut middle grade novel about a girl named Ratchet and her quest to make a friend, save a park, and find her own definition of normal. Ratchet tells her story through the assignments in her homeschool journal.If only getting a new life were as easy as getting a new notebook.But it's not.It's the first day of school for all the kids in the neighborhood. But not for me. I'm homeschooled. That means nothing new. No new book bag, no new clothes, and no friends â€“ old or new. The best I've got is this notebook. I'm supposed to use it for my writing assignments, but my dad never checks. Here's what I'm really going to use it for:Ratchet's Top Secret PlanProject Goal: turn my old, recycled, freakish, friendless, motherless life into something shiny and new.This year, I'm going make something change.
