The Merrow were a notorious bunch of liars, cheaters and scoundrels. Descended from a long line of swindlers, conmen, pirates and politicians. Unfortunately for Devon Patel, Makura Princess, she’s expected to marry one of the Merrow Royal Princes. Hiring the services of the Southern Sanctuary match maker therefore seems like a smart first move. But before Devon can blink she’s trapped in the Southern Sanctuary and suffering through fourteen blind dates from hell.Worse still, it seems someone out there really wants Devon dead. Lumbered with the annoying Liam Chambers, who says he just wants to protect her. Devon’s not sure if she can trust a Merrow who smiles at her all the time and has a sneaky way of getting under her skin. Decisions? Decisions? Should she go with her gut and kill the Merrow, or go with her heart and kiss him?Liam Chambers isn’t your typical Merrow. He doesn’t lie, cheat or steal. Which is probably why his family hate him so much. And whilst he may not be interested in getting married, to his complete shock he finds himself very interested in the Makura Princess he has sworn to protect. The more the royal diva snaps, snarls and threatens to kill him, the more Liam wants her. Before too long Liam doesn’t just want to protect Devon, he wants to shackle himself to the shrew for life.
