Aris Calisto, newest student at Aether Academy of Crystal Magic and Witchcraft not only stands out with her quirky outfits and bubblegum pink hair but also draws attention by being what’s considered the lowest of the low in the Akasha society- a Mixta.  When mysterious things start happening, including unexpected bindings, things going missing, and being claimed by a not-so-traditional familiar, Aris realizes she’s in over her cotton candy-colored head. Enter in the five guys who have been magically roped into Aris’s rodeo:  -Caspian, the playful potions brewer, -Drayce, the summoner who never seems to get overwhelmed, -Kye, a broody rune drawer who Aris can’t help but pester, -Xan, the spell caster with no sense of humor to speak of, -and Torryn, the history professor who seems to demand every waking hour working on mastering her power.  With a cauldron full of men behind her, can Aris use her i’magic’nation to figure out what’s happening to her capricious coven? Or will she find out that life’s a real witch?
