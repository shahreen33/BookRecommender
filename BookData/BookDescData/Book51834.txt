Superman is the most powerful being in the universe. And for once, that's not a good thing. The Last Son of Krypton is now an enforcer of Darkseid, the evil despot who will stop at nothing to take over Earth 2. However, there is one man who can stop them and that's...Superman?

Can they band together in time to prepare for Apokolips and the forces of Darkseid? And can Val-Zod become the hero they need him to be?Writer Tom Taylor (INJUSTICE: GODS AMONG US) and artist Nicola Scott (SUPERMAN) continue their New York Times best-selling run with EARTH 2 VOL. 5: THE KRYPTONIAN.
