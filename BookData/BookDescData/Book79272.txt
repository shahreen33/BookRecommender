Cornelia has been noticeably missing from school for two days. Curious about what has happened to her, Will, Irma, Taranee and Hay Lin visit her apartment and find out why: she is overwhelmingly upset about Caleb being transformed into a delicate flower. Meanwhile, Frost kidnaps Taranee's brother Peter and the other Guardians fight Frost in order to rescue him. After the battle has ended, they all get transported to Kandrakar where they meet up with Yan Lin, who informs them that by not giving Cornelia the comfort she needed, their friendship is strained and with that, their powers will diminish. If that wasn't enough to get the Guardians concerned, Will informs Irma, Taranee and Hay Lin that her mom has made a decision to move back to Fadden Hills.
