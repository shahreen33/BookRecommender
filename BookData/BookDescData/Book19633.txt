David Ben Gurion was a man with a mission that burned in his heart from the time he was a young boy. He suffered danger and privation to pursue it. No risk was too great for him to suffer to achieve his goal. He emigrated from Poland to Israel when local Arabs had carte blanche for murder and destruction. He persevered to be instrumental in the founding and protection of the new state of Israel. He molded the new government, chose its leaders and helped to carve the nation into an international entity. His legacy lives in the vibrancy of its people, its government and its economy.
