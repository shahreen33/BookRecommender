Siblings Mitch, Tony, and Jovi discover that mysterious creatures called Grezniks are close to achieving their mission: blowing up Earth and shattering Life to bits. Over the centuries, Grezniks have nearly succeeded many times. But each time, their efforts have been foiled by Tukors and their allies. Now, Grezniks are closer than ever before, and no one knows if any Tukors are left in the world to stop them. The Tukor's Journey is an epic action adventure. Chock-full of faraway lands. Volcanoes. Mountains. Tundra. Tropical forests. Raging rivers. Steamy geysers. Farms. Big cities. Tractors flying at the speed of sound. Blue stones that defy the laws of physics. And lots of real life creatures. And Grezniks. Vicious. Deadly. Unfathomable strength and speed. Seeping through the world unseen--slippery, crawly, swift. Soon they'll be ready to blow up Earth into tiny pieces. Three kids are unexpectedly invited to help defeat the Grezniks, but will they have the courage to join the battle?
