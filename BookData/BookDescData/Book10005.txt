Over the years, I’ve watched Rafe Morelli charm every kind of beautiful woman out of her panties. Most of them are practical enough to hold onto their hearts, though; he doesn’t want those. I am the only woman around who has managed to keep her panties out of Rafe’s hands, but not her heart. It all began with a startling act of kindness—a twisted act of kindness, but what other kind can you expect from a bad guy? Rafe’s much more than that, though, and I know I’m just what he needs. I also know a relationship is off-limits. Loving a Morelli isn’t just a dangerous game—it can be a deadly one. I never wanted to align myself with the dark side, I never wanted to play any games, but no matter how much it derails my life, the only person I find myself wanting to serve is Rafe Morelli. Rafe isn’t looking for love, and I’m not looking for trouble. The thing love and trouble have in common? Both have a way of finding you when you’re least expecting it…Note: Submitting in Vegas is not a standalone, it is the final book in a continuing-story trilogy.
