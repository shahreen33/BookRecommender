Ned the knight always does exactly what he's told. When his parents ask him to pick up his toys, dig up the cabbages, or go to bed on time, he does it all with a smile. And when the dragon swoops into town every night, Ned always runs inside just as he's asked. But one morning Ned says "NO!" He will not help his dad find his shield, his arrow, or his bow, and that night, he refuses to go inside. After a surprising encounter with the dragon, will he change his tune?
