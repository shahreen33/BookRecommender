  Underwood, Scotch, and Wry
, Arthur finds that his snarky attitude isn’t going to help get him out of trouble. He needs to delve into the murky world of self-publishing to learn about the areas of the book business he has mocked relentlessly for decades.  Or he may just give up and drink.  Katarina is a successful romance author who seems immune to Arthur’s charms…mostly.  Can she save him from himself?
