Lady Luck may have smiled upon fresh-faced college student Taiga Mutou in the form of his cute coworker Yuiko agreeing to go out with him. But little did he know that this particular lady was rotten through and through! Now, instead of the carefree relationship he aspired to, Taiga finds himself penning boy's-love novels and getting dragged to creepy events! To make things worse, he still hasn't been able to entirely give up on that ideal relationship. So when the couple's first Christmas rolls around, Taiga decides to tutor a schoolboy for some extra cash. Only Yuiko's fujoshi filter seems to have rubbed off on Taiga more than he ever anticipated, and now he's seeing his new part-time gig in a whole new light?! Can Taiga hang on to the job, or will his Christmas plans be thwarted by his own fully ripe and rotten tendencies - not to mention Mr. Perfect, Kashiwabari, who still wants Yuiko for himself?!
