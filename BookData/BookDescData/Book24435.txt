Gert finally realizes that being such a murderous maniac might be the reason she's not been able to find her way out of the candy-coated world of Fairyland that has been her nightmare for over forty years. She sets off on a new quest to redeem herself and tries to earn her way back home with good deeds and kindness and love and whatever other mushy, touchy-feely things she can manage. The epic and hilarious fantasy quest continues from fan favorite cartoonist SKOTTIE YOUNG Collecting issues 11 through 15.
