I'd always thought bad boys were sexy, but this was taking it to the extreme.  Clearly, I had issues. After becoming obsessed with Death, the angels came for me, and then I ended up in Hell. Oddly, that sounds a lot worse than it really is. Don't get me wrong, the demons in this place are pretty annoying, but there are a few perks.  At least four of them. Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub, and Samyaza.  I left everything behind to help change the world. My big plan was to fight back, to stand up for what I believed in. Instead, I'm useless. A failure.  I thought we were supposed to be a united front. I thought my guys would be at my side for the rest of eternity. I thought we had something special. Unfortunately, it's not going to be that easy. If I want this, I'm going to have to fight for it.  But the heart wants what it wants, And mine is rooting for evil.
