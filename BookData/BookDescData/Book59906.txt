One bit a woman, leaving puncture wounds all over her body. Another attacked the contents of a warehouse full of glasses and mugs. Yet another lifted furniture into the air, then sent objects flying in another house. These are some of the strange and sometimes terrifying cases collected by poltergeist investigator William Roll. A parapsychologist, Roll studies these "noisy ghosts" to understand what they are and why they do what they do.
