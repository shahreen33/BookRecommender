Stung by her fiancé’s betrayal, she has no reason to trust the scandalous Major Hampton. But as Yankee troops close in, Eden must take refuge in the major’s mysterious ancestral home, leading her into the shadowy corners of deceit and desire, where endless love lurks within every soft whisper.Rating: SpicyPage Count: 328Word Count 90000Print ISBN: 1-60154-957-1 Available for Kindle (and print) at Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com for the Nook.
