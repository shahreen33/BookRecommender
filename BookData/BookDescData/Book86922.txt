 A former Rogue being presented to the Fates. What could go wrong?When I was offered a seat on the Ethereal Council, no one said anything about meeting the actual Fates. But on the day of my presentation, not only do I offend the three women who control every single thread of life, but an Angel's thread is cut short, and no one knows how.Now it's my job to find out who did it before the death gets pinned on me and starts a war.
  Maybe being a Rogue was the least of my problems.
