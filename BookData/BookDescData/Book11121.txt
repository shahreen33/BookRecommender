PERMANENT OBSCURITY: Or a Cautionary Tale of Two Girlsand Their Misadventures with Drugs, Pornography and Death by Dolores Santana (as told to Richard Perez) * A youthful bohemian satire, * a story of alienated nonconformists, * a "girls on the lam" story, * a sexploitation and S/M romp, * a spoof of cult celebrity and "true-life" tabloid sensationalism:PERMANENT OBSCURITYInspired by the underground sexploitation films of the 1960s, this bold updating of the "roughie" subgenre and lampoon of auteur filmmaking largely takes place in New York City's East Village (circa the Bush era), and it chronicles the rise and fall of a unique and intense relationship. Dolores and Serena, two chemically dependent, down-and-out artists set out to take control of their lives by making a fetish-noir/femdom movie. Of course, things don't exactly turn out as planned.
