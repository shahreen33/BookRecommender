Crumb has got to be one of the most confessional artists of all time, and certainly the most confessional artist ever in his chosen genre. In both interviews and art, he not only relates the external facts of his life but also turns his id inside-out. The three passions of his life, he's said, are sex, music, and his art, and all three of them get intertwined in both his personal life and his work.My Troubles with Women is a collection that especially speaks to the first passion.
