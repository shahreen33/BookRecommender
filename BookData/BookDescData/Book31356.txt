  Sometimes love will come in the most unexpected places.
  Scott is a YouTuber known for his popular Outdoor Omega adventure videos. While on a trip through the Winnipeg area to film a zip lining adventure, he detours to a small neighboring town for their annual sugaring off festival.  Justin is a seasoned constable with the RCMP… yep, he’s a hot, alpha Mountie and Scott can’t stop sneaking peeks at the guy who seems to pop up around every corner.  Through a weird twist of fate—and a little help from a local legend named Amik—Scott and Justin find themselves stranded together in a remote cabin for several days. The two hit it off with an almost instant connection, but Scott is an American whose travel visa is about to expire and his law-abiding Mountie isn’t about to let him stay illegally.  Return to the world of Hollydale with quirky romance full of all the fluffy feels that you’d expect from a Hollydale novella. This is the eighth book of The Hollydale Omegas series but is absolutely able to be read as a standalone. This is a 26k novella and definitely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.
