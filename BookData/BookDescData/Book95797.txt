I had a plan.My life and career were starting to take off and head in the direction I always dreamed of.I wasn't looking for a relationship or love. Then she stumbled into my hotel room and into my life. Literally falling at my feet.She was drunk. It was an innocent mistake. That would have been the end of it. Except she’s the President’s daughter. I’m a young congressman and we got caught together.Did I mention I was almost naked in the photos that were splashed around the country?Now we need to play the game of politics by getting married to get the press off our backs. You also don’t say no to the President when he asks you to protect his daughter.My reluctant bride is unhappy and making my life hell. She insists sex is off the table. Little does she know I’m not one to walk away from a challenge.
