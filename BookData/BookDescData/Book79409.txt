Clive Barker’s shocking return to Hellraiser continues! Pinhead, Hell’s priestly servant, has grown bored with his position in Hell. He needs to find a replacement before he can leave Hell, and chooses the only human to defeat him and his Cenobite followers - Kirsty Cotton. Kirsty accepts Pinhead’s offer, and descends into Hell to reunite with the loved ones Pinhead killed - and to rid humanity of Pinhead’s evil once and for all. Now, with their arrangement set, Pinhead and Kirsty Cotton begin a new battle - but is it too late for either to find salvation?
