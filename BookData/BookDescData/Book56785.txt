Dear Skylar,Five years. That’s a long time to go without talking to somebody, especially someone who was such a huge part of your life…A letter from my first kiss and my childhood everything…from prison.He may be nicknamed Saint, but this sweet, sexy biker most definitely has a wild streak. Hearing from him draws me right back into the Knights of Fury motorcycle club—the people I’ll always think of as family.He’s still the only man I’ve ever wanted.Each good, old-fashioned letter from my “prison pen pal” has my heart racing. Which is nothing compared to how I feel when Saint surprises me in person, as a free man.I was just a kid the last time we saw each other, but the connection between us now is anything but innocent.He’s the type of man who would do anything to protect his woman. And with my world crashing down around me, that’s exactly what I’m going to need.This book is approximately 67,000 words
