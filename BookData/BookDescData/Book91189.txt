It’s been two years since Jonas missed the biggest folk music concert of his career. But back then, he also met Fritz, and the two have been ridiculously in love ever since then. Now, Jonas is ready to take the next step and ask Fritz to marry him.  Fritz still hates folk music, just the way he did when he was forced to attend Jonas’ concert. That never changed, even though he suffered through a lot of them by now. Nevertheless, he’s ready to make sure Jonas knows Fritz is perfectly fine living with a folk music star… and marrying one.  But the weather has other plans, and once more, they’re stuck in traffic. And that’s just the beginning of a day that might not lead to a perfect Christmas Eve… or will it?
