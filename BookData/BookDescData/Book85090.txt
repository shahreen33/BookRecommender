Originally published under the title Letting Go, three years ago, this is Morrie Schwartz's enlightened and compassionate philosophy of living, written as he was battling the effects of ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). Sadly, Morrie died before the book was published. A year later,though, a former student of Morrie's, Mitch Albom, wrote Tuesdays withMorrie, chronicling Morrie's impact on his life. This book is, as the title says, Morrie in his own words, his invaluable legacy to us all.
