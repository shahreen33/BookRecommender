KAYLAMy infatuation with Ezra Johnson started how all obsessions begin—with a simple crush. Over the years I silently soaked up every shy smile and random act of kindness, wrestling them away to a secret place in my heart meant for unrequited love.Because if it wasn’t for the fact that I tutor him once a week, I’m pretty sure he wouldn’t even know I exist.Then I find his sketchbook.And it changes everything.EZRAThere are two certainties in my life: I’ve been in love with Kayla Reynolds since I was fourteen, and I can’t have her.I’ve spent years settling for a two-dimensional fantasy world, capturing her beauty with a pencil and paper. She’s kind, smart, gorgeous…And she belongs to someone else.Or so I thought.An interesting turn of events makes me realize things aren’t always how they appear on the outside, and now I’ve got my chance to be the man she deserves.For as long as I can remember, I’ve been called a loser. The cripple. An outcast.But maybe—just maybe—this time the good guy won’t finish last.*** Releasing March 15th, 2018 ***
