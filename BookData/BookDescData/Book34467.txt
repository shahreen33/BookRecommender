One of the most highly anticipated sequels of all-time is finally here in BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT: MASTER RACE! In 1986, Frank Miller introduced his iconic take on Batman and changed the face of comics forever. Now, three decades after BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, Miller himself has returned with a third chapter to his groundbreaking saga. BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT: MASTER RACE continues Frank Miller's landmark DARK KNIGHT SAGA that began with 1986's THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS and continued with its 2001-2002 sequel THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN. Co-written by Brian Azzarello and drawn by Andy Kubert and Klaus Janson, BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT: MASTER RACE returns to a world gone awry left in the aftermath of the toppling of Lex Luthor and the apparent death... of Batman himself? Then who will save Gotham City and the rest of the planet against the mysterious Master Race? Also collected in this graphic novel are the nine mini-comics that originally appeared in the monthly periodical release of BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT: MASTER RACE, each of which focuses on a different character from within the world of Miller's Dark Knight. The minicomics are also written by Miller and Azzarello and drawn by some of the greatest artists currently working in comics, including Miller himself, Eduardo Risso and John Romita, Jr.! Collected here are all nine chapters of BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT: MASTER RACE as well as the nine mini-comics.Read more on BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT: MASTER RACE: http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2017/09/...
