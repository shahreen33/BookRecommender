“An INCREDIBLE read. Gripping storytelling with an unassuming plot. Could not put this beauty down.” — Andrew W.  Brigham Young VIII wants to kill himself.  Brigham “Brig” Young VIII wants to kill himself in a way that will embarrass and publicly shame his faith, his family, and especially his father.  Brig is a high-functioning opiate addict that unwittingly gets involved with members of a violent Hong Kong organized crime syndicate on his journey to his frozen tomb on the north face of Mount Everest.  Written in the fragmented narrative, Suicide By Everest is the violent, darkly humorous story of Brigham Young VIII, first-in-line to inherit the riches and influence that the Young dynasty, through their hotel empire, has amassed over the centuries. Brig is a broken man that has disappointed his father, embarrassed his family, shamed his faith, ruined relationships and blames everyone but himself. Hitting rock bottom, Brig decides that his only option is suicide. But not just any suicide. Brig resolves to make a vengeful statement of his death, embarking on a physical and mental journey from his home in Salt Lake City, to Hong Kong, through China, and finally to his frozen gravesite on Mount Everest.
