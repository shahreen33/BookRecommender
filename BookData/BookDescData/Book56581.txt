Continue the thrilling story of Stone and Madison.  “What am I going to do without you?” she whispered in my ear.  “Don’t worry about me. Take care of Bryan.”  “I can’t do it without you. I can’t do anything without you.” She sniveled in my ear, grabbing on to my neck. I could feel her tears on my shoulder.  “Look at me. You have to. Bryan needs you. I need you to tell me you’re going to be alright.”  “No…no, I’m not.”  “Maddie, please…tell me. I won’t be able to sleep tonight or ever. Tell me.”  I remembered this day like it was yesterday. The day Stone killed Lucky for me. I was thirteen years old. I loved Stone since I was eleven. He was my everything. The only good thing in my life, aside from the kids. I know I shouldn't love him. I know it is forbidden. But, I do and I don't care what anyone thinks. This other man controls me. He has taken me away from my kids...Away from Stone. He hurts me every day. Physically and emotionally. He tears me down and makes me do things I don't want to do. I won't let him get to me, at least, I'll try. I have to be strong...for them. I'll wait for Stone to save me...again. But, will he? Or will he realize that the love we share can never be?
