The magic of Potter Lake strikes again when Evonne Girard— cosmetologist and obsessed podcast fan meets Taj Wright— Registered Nurse and musician following a nasty fall. There are jokes, there is flirting, lingering stares abound… but neither thinks they’ll see the other again any time soon. Evonne discovers that the cute house she’s renting belongs to the handsome nurse with the eyes she can’t forget....but she’s not in Potter Lake to meet a man. She’s on a mission to prove to her parents that she isn’t the failure that was kicked out of college and showed up on their doorstep ten years ago. Taj is delighted to rent his guest house to the pretty, snappy former patient he can’t stop thinking about. Potter Lake was a place to run when his dreams of achieving success with his former band died, and a haven to give back what was given to him. When the opportunity to live that dream again rolls around, Taj isn’t sure that he wants it to come true. Evonne and Taj quickly become more than landlord and tenant when they're forced to share close quarters. When a severe storm drives them from Potter Lake to a beachside retreat, their pasts collide, revealing a common nemesis. One shared secret could change the trajectory of something beautiful. On a rainy night in Georgia, two hearts meet. They’re never the same again. *This book contains adult situations and language as well as African American Vernacular English and Black culture colloquialisms.*
