For Dillon Frayser, a rising star for The Baltimore Banners hockey team, life has come easy. A solid childhood, a happy family, a natural talent for playing the game he loves. The only thing missing is the degree he promised his parents he would get soon after he was drafted. If he could just force himself to focus on carbon atoms and organic chemistry, he wouldn't have to worry about squeezing in embarrassing tutoring sessions between a busy schedule filled with practices and games.  Maggie Andersen dreads meeting her new student but she needs the money that tutoring will provide. That doesn't mean she's willing to put up with the anticipated antics of an arrogant brainless jock. When she finally meets Dillon, he turns out to be the exact opposite of what she expected: smart, funny, driven, and humble. Maggie soon finds herself letting her guard down and discovering a different kind of chemistry.  Will the tutoring sessions lead to something more for the mismatched pair? Or is this nothing more than a one-timer for the sexy hockey player?
