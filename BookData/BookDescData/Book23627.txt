Beneath the quiet charm of Martha's Vineyard, trouble is brewing. A beautiful con woman has brought her latest scheme to the exclusive island community and is wreaking havoc with several lives. Talented local artist Holly Anderson has a vested interest in exposing this conniving vixen who brazenly seduced her father into a scandalous affair and a reckless game of theft, blackmail and possible murder. Then there's Sam Steadman, a man with a few secrets of his own. The darkly handsome photographer has come to the island to track down the thief who stole the only worthwhile possession his parents owned. Soon it's clear that Sam and Holly are after the same woman. As their lives and hearts collide, they've got to decide if they're enemies or allies, strangers...or something much, much more.
