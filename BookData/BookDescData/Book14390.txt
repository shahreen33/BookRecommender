Becca Wilkinson is a nobody, and those that are aware of her existence know her as "that quiet girl in the back of class", "loser", or her favorite- "that chick that killed all those people". While most people at Leeville High have long forgotten Becca's role in the devastating car wreck that happened a year ago, she still has nightmares. Her memories are in fragments and what little she remembers doesn't make sense. Memories of hearing voices and moving things without touching them. Luke Johnston is a new kid and has all the girls at Leeville eating out the palm of his hand...except Becca. He seems drawn to her but there's something dark and dangerous about him that gives her pause. But Luke knows something about her-the true nature behind what happened during the accident. Can she let her guard down to learn the truth?
