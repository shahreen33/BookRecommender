In a radioactive, nuclear-ravaged future, Samson is born into a tribe of peaceful yet desperate people struggling to survive in the desolate city of N'Yark. Surrounded by hungry, wild creatures &amp;mdash; creatively mutated and brought to life by Thorne and subsequent artists &amp;mdash; and the more savage, selfish remnants of humanity, life is precarious at best for the tribe until Samson displays amazing powers. Discovering that young Samson is a mutant himself, his mother trains Samson to value life, and on her deathbed Samson vows "to protect the weak from the powerful, the good from the evil!"* This volume reprints the first seven comic books from the original 1960s Mighty Samson series, with playful and imaginative artwork by Frank Thorne seen in the first five issues!
