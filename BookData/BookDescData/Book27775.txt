 JESSE:It began with his electric touch and a hurricane of frenzied passion that ravaged my body, my mind, my soul...my entire life.We both knew where the line was, yet we crossed it because it was the only way we could be close to one another. We told ourselves it was nothing more than a fantasy--a beach vacay we could treat like a dream, cherishing it in our hearts, but evading the real life repercussions of our actions.If only it had been that easy...We couldn't keep away from each other, and one lust-filled encounter after another birthed a connection, which turned into so much more.Now I'm head over heels for my best friend's father.Oh, Eric Westright...you've changed me. I'm addicted to your touch. I'm a servant to your desires.I kept telling myself it was nothing more than a dream, but now the thought of awakening from our life together terrifies me. I can't bear a world where I never knew what it was like to be lost in those magnificent blue eyes, to feel his caress against my face, his lips against my own...him loving me deep inside.Oh, please, if this is all a dream, don't let me wake up. Let me have this. I know I messed up, but I can fix everything I've broken. I finally see the light at the end of the tunnel, and I'll make it right.I'll do whatever it takes. Just please let me have him FOREVER.*Contains the same triggers as BFF: Best Friend's Father and BFF: Claimed. This is the final installment in the Best Friend's Father series.
