NOEL I never knew starting my freshman year in high school would change my life the way it did. The moment I saw her, I knew I had to be near her, to have her. I never dreamed she would choose me. Her beautiful smile made everything better, made me whole. Until I lost her. I've given her time, and now I'm going to claim what's always been mine.
