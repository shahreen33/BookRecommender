Far from being a recluse, H. P. Lovecraft traveled widely -- ranging as far north as Quebec, as far south as Florida and Louisiana, and as far west as Ohio. He wrote interestingly and at length about these expeditions.Collected here are all HPL's formal travelogues, including "Vermont-A First Impression" (1927), "Observations on Several Parts of America" (1928), "Travels in the Provinces of America" (1929), and "An Account of a Visit to Charleston" (1930).Also included is A Description of the Town of Quebeck, in New France, Lately Added to His Britannick Majesty's Dominions, which, at 75,000 words, was Lovecraft's longest work. As a bonus, all of Lovecraft's hand-drawn maps and illustrations of the regions he visited are reproduced.
