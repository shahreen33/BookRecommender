I’m a saint. On paper.I have a stable job as a personal trainer. My side hustle involves taking people out on hikes and pushing them to their limits. I love my friends and family equally.Every now and again, I need the itch between my shoulder blades branded with scratch marks.I’m haunted by that phantom ache when Nina Williams walks into my life to hire me for a hiking contest. Killer, dimpled smile, potty mouth, sharp mind and a confidence that makes me want to beg.She doesn’t want to want me. Yet, with a past as complicated and dark as mine, we’re destined to cross every line she puts in place.If I were truly a good guy, I would have wished her luck and turned her away.But how can I? That nameless thing inside me that feeds on sex, adventure and the promise of redemption just got invited to play.
