Turner Burks  I've pretty much always given up what I want for the happiness of others. It seems to be a pattern with me. It's why nobody even thought to ask anyone else when things started going nuts with my alpha and he suddenly needed a babysitter. "Of course, Turner will drop everything, including his education to come to the rescue of the streak." So, I'm not even really that surprised when the man who is perfect for me in every way, my mate, shows up in Crossville, looking for his missing… HUSBAND. Looks like one more thing I'm going to have to give up. But how am I ever going to survive letting my mate go to live happily with another man?  Kendrick Williams  When my brother calls home after three weeks of being missing to inform us that he'd been kidnapped, held for weeks, found, saved and was fine, but didn't want to come home, my family and I really aren't sure what to think. Being a private investigator––I spend most of my time behind a desk pouring over a computer––I use my rescorses to track him down, needing to make sure he really is fine and not Stockholming it up in Tennessee somewhere. When I lie about being Warren's husband, I immediately regret it when his landlord turns out to be the most amazing man I've ever met. Now if only getting passed the hurdle that is the man I want thinking I'm married to my brother was the strangest thing I'll have to deal with while in Crossville.  Warning: Mpreg elements!  Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama.  Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses::
