A woman who can’t be found. A man who can’t connect.  Barrett has worked hard to get his life exactly how he wants it. Solitary. Free from external pressure to try to be someone he isn’t. Nothing could convince him that he could possibly want anything more.  Until Clarke happened until his life with her mile-a-minute mouth, reckless impulsiveness, and her previously never before seen ability to take him just the way he is.  And he can’t help but wonder if maybe his friends and family were right; there was more to life. And even he could have it. With her.
