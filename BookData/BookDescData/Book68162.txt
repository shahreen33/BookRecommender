Christmas is looking rather bleak for recent divorcee, Alaska. Spending her vacation with her family will truly test the limits of her sanity, but she’s determined to push through and get some killer slope time in the snowy mountains.  Drake is looking forward to spending the holiday season hunkered down with his polar bear clan, rest and recouping from his constant training for the Olympics. When he and his clan-mates are called out on a dangerous search and rescue mission he never dreamed he’d come face to face with his fated mate.  Saving Alaska from her car was only the beginning, and the pair find themselves in a dangerous cat and mouse game with someone determined to kill her. Is it Alaska’s Snowy Fate to find Drake and fall in love, only to die in the process?  ***Formerly part of the Snowy Knights Anthology - No significant changes have been made to the story.***  This is a sweet romance with a small bit of steam included, it of course has a HEA even though it is a short story.
