A man who wakes up to read his own obituary in the newspaper; a woman who learns the meaning of life thanks to her stolen bicycle; a stern sub-inspector who is expected to rid a small town of a prowling leopard; a traumatized man who is intent on ending his life, thanks to his adulterous wife; a man who is willing to get his little finger chopped off in order to win his lady love; a pickpocket who can’t forget his art; a caterer who steals a dog for ransom—these are some of the characters from this collection of short stories. Some weird, some cranky, some adventurous—but all overwhelmingly familiar and believable.The Bicycle Thief and Other Short Stories is Manish Sahu’s debut work. The stories which are all based in the heart of India, are earthy, amusing and very perceptive. Each tale is a slice of life from everyday India.
