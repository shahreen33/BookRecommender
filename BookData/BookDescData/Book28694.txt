From bestselling author L.J. Shen, comes a new standalone, enemies-to-lovers romance.  CÃ©lian Laurent. Manhattan royalty. Notorious playboy. Heir to a media empire. ...And my new boss.  I could have impressed him, if not for last month's unforgettable one-night stand. I left it with more than orgasms and a pleasant memory--namely, his wallet. Now he's staring me down like I'm the dirt under his Italian loafers, and I'm supposed to take it. But the thing about being Judith "Jude" Humphry is I have nothing to lose. Brooklyn girl. Infamously quirky. Heir to a stack of medical bills and a tattered couch. When he looks at me from across the room, I see the glint in his eyes, and that makes us rivals. He knows it. So do I. Every day in the newsroom is a battle. Every night in his bed, war. But it's my heart at stake, and I fear I'll be raising the white flag.
