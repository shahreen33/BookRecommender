A young wizard must bring together the great wizards of the Realm and find the next ‘Great Wizard’ in order to save their world from Calamity and Ruckus.Red is a Wiz tasked with finding the other Wiz’s of the realm so they can band together to form the Great Wiz, a being of light, and destroy the growing evil darkness known only as the Ruckus. On this journey, he meets Bog Wiz, Sad Dad, and Feather Duster—but soon their fate rests on the shoulders of a young Wiz named Bean who is too strong, too hot-headed, and completely untested to be any real help. Bean might not be ready to be the hero the world needs, but Red is willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that the Ruckus doesn’t win.  It's a battle of good versus evil in this amazing adventure written and illustrated by Joey McCormick (Adventure Time). When heroes and villains come in all shapes and sizes, sometimes, all it takes to truly save the world is one small Bean.
