Promposals are taking over Deacon Locke’s high school and there is no place left to hide. Even Elijah, resident oddball, is looking to score a date. Although graduation is looming and prom could be his last chance to connect with the classmates he’s always kept at a distance, shy and unusually tall Deacon doesn’t think he can get up the nerve to ask anyone to the dance. Especially given all the theatrics involved nowadays.It isn’t until Deacon confides in his witty and outgoing best friend, Jean, that he realizes she could be a great person to take. Only problem is Jean isn’t your typical prom date. She’s older. A lot older. And she’s also Deacon’s grandmother.Strange as it may seem, Deacon doesn’t really care what the social fallout might be from having Jean on his arm. He’s not exactly popular, so what does he have to lose?But when Deacon meets Soraya—a girl unlike any other he’s ever met—he fears he has totally squandered his chances of having a prom he’ll never forget.Deacon couldn’t be more wrong. About everything.
