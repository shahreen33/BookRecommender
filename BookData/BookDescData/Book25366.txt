An uncommon look at the commonplace of creation, this book will engage both children and adults with its combination of scientific accuracy, wide-eyed wonder, and subtle humor. Joanne De Jonge here presents a wealth of little-known facts about various birds and water creatures while highlighting each subject's unique place in creation.Moving from the sky above to the sea below, this book first paints an awe-inspiring picture of our galaxy, then watches an eagle soaring and geese migrating. De Jonge also writes about the dark, not-so-silent deep, exploring a jellyfish and uncovering the beauty of manatees. Throughout, Of Skies and Seas reminds the reader that God's hand is evident in all these wonders.
