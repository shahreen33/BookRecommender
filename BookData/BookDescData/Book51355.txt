A groundbreaking argument that perversions are more common than we think, from everyone’s favorite provocateur.In his eye-opening new book, Perv, the award-winning columnist and psychologist Jesse Bering argues that we are all sexual deviants on one level or another. As Bering takes us into the lives of a woman who falls madly in love with the Eiffel Tower, a young man addicted to seductive sneezes, and an octogenarian who derives pleasure from pretending to be a baby, among others,he challenges us to move beyond our judgments and attitudes toward “deviant” sex and consider the alternative: What would happen if we rise above our fears and revulsions and accepted our true natures?With his signature wit and irreverent style, Bering pulls back the curtains on the history of perversions, the biological reasons behind our distaste for unusual sexual proclivities, and the latest research on desire. Armed with reason, science, and an insatiable appetite for knowledge, he humanizes deviants while asking some very provocative questions about the nature ofhypocrisy, prejudice, and when sexual desire can lead to harm.A groundbreaking look at our complex relationship with our carnal urges and the ways in which we disguise, deny, and shame the sexual deviant in all of us, Perv brings our hidden desires into the light.
