Having a crush on your best friend’s hot dad is perfectly normal.Accidentally selling him your v-card in an exclusive, illicit online auction? Yeah, not so normal... I’ve had a crush on Marshall Bane – “Mr. B” – since I first knew what a crush was. I mean, the man checks every single box: gorgeous, dominant, richer than sin, and built like a Greek god. …He also happens to be my best friend’s dad. When dire financial straits force me to put my v-card up for auction at an exclusive club, I know it’s a terrible idea. But, I’m out of options, and a million dollars is a million dollars, right? Except, my mysterious auction winner? Marshall Bane. Totally beautiful, totally forbidden, totally more than twice my age, totally-has-had-me-twisted-up-tangled-up-and-aching-for-him for years Marshall Bane. This is forbidden. It’s inappropriate. It’s damn-near breaking the law. Selling my v-card to my best friend’s dad is so wrong. But you know what’s worse?...Being this excited for him to collect.
