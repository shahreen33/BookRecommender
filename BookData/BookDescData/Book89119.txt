To add to her worries, a crescent moon is destined to appear on her left palm that will compel her to kill Kieran Abel, the demi-god son of Okeus. Now that Okeus has discovered his long coveted human son, he will torture Piper for eons if she follows through. But she canâ€™t ignore her new inexplicable craving for demon souls. With every monster she kills, her power grows and she feels herself turning darker. Time is running out and Piper will do anything to protect those she loves, even if it means risking her own soul.
