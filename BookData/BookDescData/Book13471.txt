She was his only light in a lifetime of darkness…  Haunted by guilt after the death of her mother, Lena Gardner hides behind the persona of the perfect daughter she feels obligated to be. At nineteen, she’s working her way through college and being groomed for her leadership of her father’s empire, but no one can be perfect all the time. She longs to be someone else, even if only for a few hours under the cover of night. Each time she gives in to that longing, she loses herself a little more. Only one man knows the real Lena Gardner, and only he has the power to save her from herself.  Owen Langford has worked hard to overcome a traumatic past, and the glowing memory of a childhood friendship was his true salvation. Now at age nineteen, Owen is determined to graduate college early and start his own business. He’s adamant that nothing is more important than achieving his goals, but fate may have other plans for him. Both he and Lena have their reasons for keeping their relationship casual, but Owen never expected to find his childhood savior sitting next to him in a lecture hall.  And he never expected to fall in love with her.  AUTHOR’S NOTE: This duet is a no cheating, no break-up, guaranteed HEA.
