Cloud Stories is the first new collection of comics by K. Thor Jensen in ten years. A thematically-connected journey through the upper atmosphere, it veers wildly between slapstick comedy, creeping horror and otherworldly fantasy. Drawn in a staggering array of visual styles, this is a collection unlike anything you've ever read.
