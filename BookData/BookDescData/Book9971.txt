I am complex.My love is all-encompassing.And when it comes to my heart, there is only one rule:Don’t mess with what’s mine.Until the age of seven, I was Joel Alexander Donovan, son of Jimmy. The man who terrorized a town and made its citizens fear the very ground he walked on. Including me, the day I realized that ground ran red with blood.At age eighteen, I became Priest.A man without a past.A man determined to right the wrongs of my father.A man who never believed anyone could love the son of such a monster.But then a thief stole my heart.A sweetheart lit up my world.And I forgot for a moment you should never turn your back on your enemy. And thus begins a lesson to those who would seek to harm: Never underestimate what the Priest will do to protect the Princess and the Prick.
