Scores of natural disasters have pushed Earth into a steady stream of chaos. Sixteen-year-old half-elf, arch mage Emily Dalton suspects the impending holocaust is part of a master plan put into motion by Iscar - a powerful magician, driven by his family's desire to conquer Earth and the parallel planet of Acacia. The only way to thwart Iscar's efforts is to journey past thousands of half-dead warriors in the Dothan Forest and avoid an even deadlier opponent, Maaca, the Queen of the vampires. Will Emily survive the crossing back into Acacia to save the world?
