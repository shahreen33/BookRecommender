  Seduce him or die trying…
 While stranded in the most zombie-infested part of the city, Lee will do anything to save her injured friend—even seduce Dominic, the dangerous army sergeant leading their mission. Although he tries to resist, she challenges his orders not to fraternize with civilians in the hottest way possible. Unprepared for the soul-shattering desire that burns between them, Lee quickly finds herself in over her head. Soon the seducer becomes the seduced and Lee must fight to keep her heart, and her dark secrets, from destroying them all.  This novella is the second episode in the Heaven in Hell series and ends on a cliffhanger.
