What’s better than romance? How about cold hard cash…Marley Ellis doesn’t have time for love, she’s got an artistic empire to build and a sugar daddy to charm. At least she did, until a late night catfishing introduces her to insanely hot and very bored tech bro, Will.Will’s been treading water, searching for something to believe in. He’s sure Marley’s the answer, but convincing her that he’s1) not a douche2) a daddy she can believe in is going to be a challenge. Luckily, he’s bringing his A-game because the good life is sweet, but love is sweeter.
