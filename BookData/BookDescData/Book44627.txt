Darwyn Cooke is the Eisner Award-winning writer/artist of such classics as DC: The New Frontier, Selina’s Big Score, and last year’s smash-hit, The Hunter. Now, Cooke is back and following up the New York Times best-selling Hunter with a heart-pounding sequel: The Outfit. After evening the score with those who betrayed him, and recovering the money he was cheated out of from the syndicate, Parker is riding high, living in swank hotels and enjoying the finer things in life again. Until, that is, he’s fingered by a squealer who rats him out to the Outfit for the price they put on his head… and they find out too late that if you push Parker, it better be all the way into the grave! Darwyn Cooke is an Eisner- and Emmy-winning creator whose adaptation of Richard Stark’s first groundbreaking Parker novel has earned him multiple 2010 Eisner Award nominations!
