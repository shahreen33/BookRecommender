It started with a little white lie... Lindsay Winthrop's weekly podcast on sex and dating has garnered thousands of listeners across the country, thanks to experience with a loving fiancé she's been with for years. Except, her husband-to-be doesn't exist, and now she's in a bind. With a book deal on the line, she has to find a man fast, and Malik Brooks might be just the man she's looking for.  If he knows what's good for him, he'll stay away from her... A few years ago Malik gave up sex and now works hard as a metal sculptor. In doing so, he's created enough pieces to fill a gallery, and his vow of celibacy has kept him focused. When a major deal falls through, Lindsay makes him an offer he can't refuse, and all he has to do is pretend to be her fiancé. Sounds easy at first, but after one kiss, he wants more. Then things really get interesting.
