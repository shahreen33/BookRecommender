This snippet takes place after Night Season (World of the Lupi, #4) and just before the free short story, Cyncerely Yours (World of the Lupi, #4.5). It’s more of a scene than a complete story, but I thought readers who’ve enjoyed the series might enjoy listening in on Cullen’s counselling session with Father Michaels.
