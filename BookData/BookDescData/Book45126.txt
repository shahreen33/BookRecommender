This nerd-jock will do anything to score…  After a steamy kiss from the hottest nerd I’d ever met, we became friends with benefits. I didn’t care he played hockey. That’s not why I liked him. Because we bonded over what we love most—video games.  Jamie knew every button to press. Every level to hit. And he scored every time… Until a threat from his past changed everything.  Jocking Jameson is a full-length standalone novel, complete with hot hockey players, plenty of laughs, and a HEA. Scroll up to get your copy today!
