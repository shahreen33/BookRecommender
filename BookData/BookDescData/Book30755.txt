When Kellan Ayrwick returns home for his father’s retirement from Braxton College, he finds a dead body in Diamond Hall’s stairwell.  Unfortunately, Kellan has a connection to the victim, and so do several members of his family. Could one of them be guilty of murder? Soon after, the college's athletic program receives mysterious donations, a nasty blog denounces his father and someone attempts to change students' grades.  Someone is playing games on campus, but none of the facts add up. With the help of his eccentric and trouble-making nana, Kellan tries to stay out of the sheriff’s way. And if that wasn't enough already, his own past comes spiraling back to change his life forever.  In the debut novel in the Braxton Campus Mysteries Series, you'll discover a cozy, secluded Pennsylvania village full of quirky, sarcastic and nosy residents.
