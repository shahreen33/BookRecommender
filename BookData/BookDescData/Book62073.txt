A manual for Drubchen practice of the peaceful and wrathful deities of the Three Roots (Tsasum). This text is not required for the widespread practical methods that exist for cycles such as the Kagyad Desheg Düpa and the Lama Gongdü, which have specific and detailed instructions and stand on their own. Nevertheless, taking into consideration something that could be applied generally to any practice that pertained to the Three Roots, this text was compiled by Padma Garwang T'hrinlay Drodul Tzal (Jamgön Kongtrul the Great). It was put together from traditional terma texts of higher and lower terma, the Jang-ter (Northern Treasure) cycle and the terma of the dharma king Ratna Lingpa.
