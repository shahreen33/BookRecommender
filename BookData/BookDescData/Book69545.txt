The debut short story collection from acclaimed U.K. writer Priya Sharma, “All the Fabulous Beasts,” collects 16 stunning and monstrous tales of love, rebirth, nature, and sexuality. A heady mix of myth and ontology, horror and the modern macabre.“Priya Sharma has been writing and publishing short stories for over a decade, and I’m delighted that she’s finally receiving the recognition her work deserves.She’s extremely skillful in creating characters with whom we can empathize–no matter their deeds–leading her readers down roads of beauty and horror. I especially love her award-winning novelette ‘Fabulous Beasts,’ a perfect piece of storytelling.”–Ellen Datlow, Best Horror of the Year series
