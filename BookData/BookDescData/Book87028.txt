Global apocalypse never felt so good.  Olivia almost has the perfect life. She almost has a job. She almost has a boyfriend. She almost has a future.  It’s a good thing she has friends.  On a sunny day in June, the entire world steps sideways into a new reality—out of this chaos, almost a third of the human population find themselves transformed into Elves, Dwarves, Goblins, and Trolls. Olivia is now a Dark Elf mage, and her new girlfriend is one sexy kitty.  With magic, however, come monsters, and things that draw blood in the night— and now a werewolf is carving a path of pain and terror through the park next to Olivia’s home. The old Olivia would have been hiding under her sister’s bed.  The new Olivia is going hunting.  Adversity is the forge of the soul. For Olivia, today is Forging Day.
