Laugh-out-loud funny and unabashedly uplifting, with just the right amount of Southern sass, Sally Kilpatrick's wonderful novel centers on one woman's journey from unhappy marriage to a surprising second chance . . .  On the day Posey Love discovers that her born-again husband has been ministering to some of his flock a little too eagerly, she also learns that he's left her broke and homeless. Posey married Chad five years ago in hopes of finding the stability her hippie mother couldn't provide. Instead she got all the trappings of security--house, car, seemingly respectable husband--at the price of her freedom. Posey's mother, Lark, accepts her daughter's return home with grace, though her sister can't resist pointing out that being a sweet Southern wife hasn't worked out as planned. And so, with the Seven Deadly Sins as a guide, Posey decides to let loose for once. Envy is easy to check off the list--Posey only has to look at her best friend's adorable baby for that. One very drunken night at The Fountain bar takes care of gluttony. As for lust--her long-time friend, John, is suddenly becoming much more than a pal. One by one, Posey is bulldozing through her old beliefs about love, family--and what it really means to be good. And she's finding that breaking a few rules might be the perfect way to heal a heart . . . Praise for Sally Kilpatrick's Novels "Don't miss this quirky, fun love story.
