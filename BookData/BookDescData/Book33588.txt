the wolf &amp; her moon is a poetry book about the vulnerable experience of living as a survivor. I was raised by a wolf hybrid who was more of a parent to me than my own parents, due to alcoholism and drugs. My poetry books encapsulates what it's like to struggle with unhealthy coping, emotions, toxic thoughts, depression, anxiety, trauma, and being a member of the lgbt community. But I also take you on the journey of healing, how difficult it is to unlearn automatic unhealthy behaviors and thoughts, inspiring you to adventure on your own path of healing and hope. Many of my poems in chapters comprise skills and lessons I learned in therapy which helped me heal. My book is more than just a poetry book, it's an experience, a care package, to help all those in the darkness find the moonlight.
