 A gay romance from best selling author R.P. James   This is about the hottest set of tennis I've ever played...  Honestly, I'm feeling just a little bit washed up, over the hill. I mean, I'm only in my mid-thirties, and there's no real reason that I should think this about myself. My life, to all appearances, is in a good place, and I'm a reasonably successful man.  But, I guess one of the major things making me feel like this is the fact that my wife and I have been growing apart, and I'm having trouble relating to her the way I used to.  I decided one weekend while she's out with her girlfriends on a trip to Las Vegas to start taking tennis lessons, hoping that it might reinvigorate me to some extent, and bring back some of the joy to my life that I've missed.  My instructor, however, is an almost perversely handsome young man, and as hard as I try to behave myself, things between the two of us go a hell of a lot farther than just the tennis lessons...    *Warning: This book contains lots of HOT sex, drama and adult language.
