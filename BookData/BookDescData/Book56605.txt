What would you do for the one you love? Me? I traded my freedom for hers.But then she betrayed me and left me to rot without so much as a goodbye.You know how they say you need to forgive and forget?Well, I can't. I won't.In fact, I'm good with never laying eyes on Kenzie Michaels again.Unfortunately for me, life has other plans.So when the woman who ripped my heart out of my chest - and stomped on it for good measure - shows up in my town, I'm left dealing with feelings both old and new.And a single question that rules my every thought: Do I give in and fight for the future we were supposed to have?
