Second book in The Dead Trilogy. Roger Conniston is a newly promoted Senior Scenes of Crime Officer with a lot to prove and a lot to protect. He's up against an ex-bare-knuckle fighter called Hades who is planning the most audacious robbery in England's history. For Hades, the success of this job is paramount; and he's planned it in meticulous detail, from the explosive diversions to the selection of his team and the weapons they'll use. Roger is faced with a decision: continue working with the police and put faith in the flawed investigative skills of DCI Chamberlain, or cut the ties and venture out alone to stop Hades and secure everything he cares about. Stealing Elgar shows how two opposites approach the same problem, and how they carve their way through conflicting interests to reach - or destroy - their goal.
