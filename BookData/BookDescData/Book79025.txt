Escape to sunny Corfu but beware...Lizzie does her best to help her brother adjust, and together they set out to do the witch’s bidding, in the hope that if they do as she asks she will finally let them be. The witch’s ravens are forever spying on them or paying them a visit, but soon the sight of them becomes welcome as Lizzie and Tom’s efforts start to pay off. Slowly, they begin to have some fun together. New friends help with that, including Stamatis, whom Lizzie finds all the more irresistible…"The plot gets going so quickly that it is almost impossible to précis it without giving the game away...Continuous action and a number of sub-plots draw you in fast." ~Hilary Whitton Paipeti, author of In the Footsteps of Lawrence Durrell and Gerald Durrell in CorfuStart reading from episode 1 and let your most enthralling Greek holiday begin!
