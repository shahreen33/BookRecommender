'Extraordinary and original' Raymond Briggs'A tender fireside story about an ageing labourer ... witty, affectionate ... enchanting, in the vein of The Snowman' Evening Standard'Sometimes it feels like I might be the only person awake in the whole country. People might find that a lonely thought. Not me...'As the rest of the world sleeps, the Gritterman goes out to work. Through the wind and the snow. Through the blue-black hours when time slips away, he grits the paths and the pavements and the roads. For him, a life without gritting is no life at all...A song for the unsung hero, this is a story about stoicism, dignity and a man leaving behind the work that he loves. It is accompanied by the author's own illustrations.**Listen to or download The Gritterman's companion album featuring 10 new tracks by Orlando Weeks.
