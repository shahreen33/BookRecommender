Discontent: The Lieutenant Harrington Series, Book 5. Two bodies wait on an oceanside boat dock for Miami Homicide Lieutenant Nash Harrington. Yet this isn't a typical Wednesday morning murder. The bodies are those of two undercover vice officers who have been sniffing into the local drug trade. Harrington quickly learns that the slain officers are small pieces of a much larger puzzle. Someone is making moves in the Miami drug world, moves that may leave everyone in their path on a slab and with a toe tag. But putting himself in their path is the lieutenantâ€™s only shot at catching them.
