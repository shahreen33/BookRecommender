New York telecommunications expert Jessica Bloom has never quite gotten things right. She's failed at relationships, and only believes herself to have moved ahead at work due to dumb luck. Her fortunes change when she flies to Madrid on an acquisitions deal -- but wakes up married to a matador instead! While she's held a burning attraction to her handsome business adversary for months, she never dreamed she'd make such an enormous split-second decision. Surely, this is a mistake they can both get undone? Her new husband, however, has plans to the contrary...Fernando Garcia de la Vega runs a telecommunications firm poised for a US takeover. What Fernando doesn't expect, is its beautiful International Division head also capturing his heart. Descended from a long line of bullfighters, Fernando stands to inherit the family's lucrative estate, if he meets the criteria in his grandfather's will and marries by age thirty-two. Yet, a marriage of convenience was something Fernando was loathe to consider... until now. When the fates conspire to put the right woman in the right place -- at the right time, how can Fernando deny his destiny? His only problem lies in convincing Jessica to remain his bride.
