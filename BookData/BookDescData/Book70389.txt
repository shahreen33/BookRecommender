A wedding night she'll never forget! Untouched Theodora Marlstone always wanted the fairy-tale wedding—a white dress and an adoring groom. Instead she's walking up the aisle toward a marriage of convenience to outrageously attractive Argentinean Alejandro Valquez! He promises raw sensuality, not devotion, but thanks to her father's will, Teddy must say "I do"…. Alejandro never wanted a wife, but his buttoned-up bride is a delicious present just waiting to be unwrapped. Beneath the white silk lies a woman who exceeds his wildest imagination, and it's clear that this union will burn the very paper it's written on!
