There will be days when you completely fall a p a r t and that's okay. There will be days where your ribs feel like blades. Let them cut you. There is beauty in the bleeding. There is hope in the healing. Christina Hart, bestselling author of Empty Hotel Rooms Meant for Us and Letting Go Is an Acquired Taste, releases her first full-length poetry collection. This collection focuses on the idea that from pain comes growth. That one thing leads to another. And if you look hard enough, there is beauty in it all - even the hurt.
