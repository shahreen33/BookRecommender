NOTE: This book contains cursing. Perhaps humorous cursing, but cursing nevertheless. If this offends you, I don't suggest reading this book.Terry56 - "I thought I would go into withdrawal before I could read another BA, Michael, and family book! I read the 1st 21 Kurtherian Gambit books 6 times and will read them again! I loved the 1st Endgame book and now I have fallen in love with this one! Please, oh, please hurry with the next one!"
