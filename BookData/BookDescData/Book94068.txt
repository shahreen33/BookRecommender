From the illustrator of the award-winning Sophie's Squash comes a rollicking read-aloud featuring a very tiny toad who gets displaced as animals--and humans--brush past him on the road.In the middle of a puddlein the middle of a roadon a teeter-totter twigsat a teeny-tiny toad. Snap! went the twig! Up went the toad! And he landed on a tree by the side of the road.It's hard to be a tiny toad minding your own business on a twig. First a bird pecks at him. . . . Then a bee buzzes. . . . Then a dog barks . . . and so on. And each time the toad is surprised by a buzz or a woof (or the toe of a sneaker!), he hops to a new location farther down the road. With fun sounds, clever rhymes, and an irresistible rhythm, this is the perfect story for sharing one-on-one or in a group.
