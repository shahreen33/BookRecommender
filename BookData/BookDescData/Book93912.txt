River Alhers is damaged goods. On the surface she's a driven business woman, leading a new division of the marketing firm she works for. But she knows better than anyone that being driven also tends to drive people away. At twenty eight she's made some of the toughest decisions of her life by burying the reason she's damaged deep inside her. That is until she walks into a tattoo parlor and falls into the arms of someone else just as broken.West Brighton is bad news. He's a tattooed rebel with more money than he needs, and so many scars on his heart, he's sure there's no way to let someone in. Until River, but she's still stuck on her ex and his friend -- Adam Beckerson.Adam Beckerson is a changed man. He's made a successful career for himself and his best friend, Tara, hasn't left his side. She gets him-- the real him that he's never shown anyone, but there's still something missing. Each one of them is beautifully flawed and in one another they can find perfection, if only they are willing to reshape their shattered dreams into new, better ones.
