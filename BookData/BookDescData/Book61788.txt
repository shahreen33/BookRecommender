Hannah Stewart’s always been different when it comes to relationships. Monogamy doesn’t work for her. She needs more. And more is something most people can’t handle.She gets more than she bargains for, though, when she partners up with local brewery owners Mitchell and Ben for a business venture and finds herself attracted to both of them. She proposes polyamory, where she dates each of them with their full consent.Mitchell Fredericks and Ben Harrington have been “friends with benefits” for years. But with Hannah in the mix, it’s not so easy to ignore emotions. She brings out a side of them they’d never been willing to face head-on, especially as their separate relationships shift into a menage. Desire, friendship, and boundaries will be put to the test. If they can’t learn to swallow their fear and communicate, everything will fall apart.
