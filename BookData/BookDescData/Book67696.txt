Her father is The King of England. She is The Controversial Princess.Regarded as down to earth by the press and rebellious by The King, Princess Adeline refuses to bow to the royal expectations her title carries. She knows better than anyone that the united front of the royal family is nothing but smoke and mirrors - lies and secrets masked by power and privilege. She wants no part of it, and she will never surrender to The King's demand to marry a man she does not love. But despite Adeline's determination to retain her free will, she remains deeply unfulfilled, feeling caged and suffocated.That is until she meets Josh Jameson. Drawn in by his confidence, Adeline is soon captivated by the scandalously sexy American actor.

However, while Josh may be Hollywood royalty, he's not actual royalty, and Adeline knows The King and his advisors will do everything in their power to keep them apart.But Josh Jameson becomes the princess's ultimate vice.And although she bows to no one, she bows to him.
