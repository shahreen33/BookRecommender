Once upon a time a young man pissed off the king of the fae... Spoiler alert: don’t do that.  Alpha Zane had the perfect life: money, a hot boyfriend, and a wonderful future waiting for him. Only that boyfriend was not who he seemed—yet, somehow, Zane was the one who ended up cursed by the King of the Fae.  Now Zane’s a urisk—a kind of brownie fae—and tied to Lake Vale Valley. He spends his days with his cat, Pixiedoodle, his only human contact the delivery service that drops off his orders, leaving them on the front porch.  Omega Felix makes ends meet delivering for a local company. When he’s asked to deliver outside his normal area to Vale Valley, he begrudgingly agrees.  The delivery is a disaster from the long walk up the dirt drive to the angry man shouting at him to leave the goods on the porch and go away. Which would be fine if he didn’t scent the curmudgeon as his mate.  Sometimes having fae abilities sucks.  Zane’s too scared to let the omega see him and run away or worse—be disgusted—even as Felix chips away at the barriers Zane has set in place to protect his heart.  But he’s about to realize that in Vale Valley love conquers all, true love wins, and curses can be broken when a true mate accepts his love for exactly who he is both inside and out.  Omega and the Beast is book one of Season Three of the popular multi-author series, Vale Valley, a small town open to everyone who needs love and a home. Omega and the Beast is a super sweet with knotty heat modern day fairy tale retelling with an mpreg twist.
