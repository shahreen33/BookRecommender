“I can feel the power of the Earth flowing through my veins as it has for hundreds of years, inching me closer to permanent immortality. Soon, it will be a part of my very being, every fiber of my body will be immortal, not just clothed in it. All I have to do is complete the ritual and I’ll stop at nothing to do so. Just one more key ingredient.  A stolen heart.”  Lenora, leader of the Wayward Witches, has roamed the Earth for hundreds of years, searching for her coven not yet born. Now, with just one sister shy, Lenora and the other witches prepare what they can for the ultimate ritual, the one that will bring them eternal immortality.  But can she keep her younger coven sisters in line? And will they find the fourth addition to their circle or will it all fall apart before it’s even begun?
