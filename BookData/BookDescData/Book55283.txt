As many as a third of leaders lead at a distance, and the number is rising. Internationally recognized leadership guru Kevin Eikenberry (Remarkable Leadership book and podcast) teams with his Remote Leadership Institute co-founder Wayne Turmel to chart all the ways that remote leadership differs from leading in-person.To make leadership happen today we must rely more on technology and far less on face-to face communication. This can make the work of leaders and team members more isolating, frustrating and stressful. This book is for motivated leaders who want to get a handle on their remote work and teams. The book is built around the authors' 3 O model: Ourselves, Others, and Outcomes. They explain how to cultivate the mindset and attitude needed to lead oneself effectively at a distance; how to engage others when you're not physically present; and what processes and tools to use to make sure dispersed teams achieve the desired outcomes. In some ways the job of a leader has changed less than we think. Leadership is leadership and people are people. But (and it is a pretty big but) how we do it needs to evolve if we want the results and outcomes our organizations demand, leaders need, and their team members deserve.
