The murder of a wealthy miller beckons two of King William the Conqueror's cleverest men to the town of Bedwyn to uncover dark secrets and find a two-legged killer more savage than any beast. This is the first in a new historical whodunit series set in Norman England. From the author of The Nine Giants and The Trip to Jerusalem.
