Feisty insurance investigator Amber Fox is finally marrying her boss, Brad Beckett, in seven days. All she has to do before the wedding is get a manicure, a bikini wax, and buy some sexy honeymoon undies. Easy peasy… Until glamour model Aleesha starts receiving threatening letters, and Brad’s suddenly hired as her bodyguard. Unfortunately, Aleesha’s definition of guarding her body is different to Amber’s. Especially since Aleesha is Brad’s ex and has her sights set on getting him back. And when Brad’s arrested, facing life imprisonment, it looks like the only thing on Amber’s honeymoon itinerary will be conjugal prison visits. Can Amber solve the case and clear Brad’s name? Is Brad as innocent as he claims? Or is this the end for Amber and Brad?
