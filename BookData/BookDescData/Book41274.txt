There is more to the Bible than we ever imagined...messages from God--both hopeful and troubling--hidden for ages, now revealed by modern computer technology. The Chamberlain Keytells how Timothy Smith, an appraiser and conservator of artifacts and antiquities, discovered and decoded a complex message in an ancient Hebrew manuscript of the Bible--a message that applied startlingly and unmistakably tohim!The book relates the painstaking process Smith undertook to verify and authenticate this "contact"--a quest filled with adventure and mystery. But instead of using old maps to find buried treasure, this hunt uses the data calculation power of modern technology. The author's remarkable discovery shows how the Bible is even more amazing than we ever dreamed... layered with meaning and insight, a book like no other, prepared by a brilliant Creator who wants to explain his loving plans, as well as issue serious warnings that may apply to the generations alive today."
