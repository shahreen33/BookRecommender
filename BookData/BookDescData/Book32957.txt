I’ve spent my entire life protecting something.The netMy teammatesMy sisterI’ve played hockey my entire life. Had many girlfriends. Slept with more women than I care to mention. Been in love twice.While one woman tried to control me by changing me into someone I no longer recognized, the other loved me not for who I could be, but for who I already was. She was my high school sweetheart but, like a fool, I walked away and let someone else take my place.Now she’s back and even more beautiful than I remembered. But one glance tells me she’s guarded. At seventeen, I asked for something she wasn’t ready to give away. Today… I’d settle for holding her hand.At one time she trusted me with her heart and I broke it. Now, I’ll do whatever it takes to convince her to let down her guard and give me a chance to prove I’m worthy of being trusted with it again. I was the first boy she ever kissed. And after all these years, I want to be the man she kisses for the rest of her life.
