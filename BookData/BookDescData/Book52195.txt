'If I'd told the truth, it would have been fiction'Everyone loves Eva. Beautiful, bright, fun, generous - she's perfect.So when her dead body is found in a ditch in the local woods the only thing anyone wants to know is: Who could have done this?It has to be Luke, her boyfriend. He has the motive, the means, the opportunity and he's no stranger to the police.Even though the picture is incomplete, the pieces fit. But as time passes, stories change.Told from six narrative strands, this cleverly woven and utterly compulsive novel challenges preconceptions; makes you second, third and fourth guess yourself; and holds an uncomfortable mirror up to the way societies and systems treat those they perceive to be on the outside.
