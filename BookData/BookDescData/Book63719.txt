Smallmouth bass swim in more streams, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs than any other gamefish, and exceptional, world-class fishing opportunities for them are found across the country, from the John Day River in Oregon to the Great Lakes, to Maine's Penobscot. While numerous books have been written on smallmouth, this is the first book to cover the cutting-edge techniques and fly patterns being used by some of the country's top fly fishing guides. Though most of these flies and techniques have been developed and refined in the rivers and lakes of the Midwest (a hotbed of smallmouth fly fishing) anglers can adapt them for their waters. -Cutting edge fly patterns for smallmouth, including full color plates and recipes, as well as new techniques for fishing these patterns -A "tips" section from various guides, both old school and new, including Luke Kavajecz, Kyle Zempel, Austin Adduci, Kip Vieth, and Bart Landwehr -Covers smallmouth bass essentials including biology, behavior, and where to find trophy bass -Interviews with Mike Schultz, Lefty Kreh, Chuck Kraft, and Larry Dahlberg
