Valentine's Inc. Book 7. Newspaper reporter, Granger Galloway, is in charge of the Valentine’s Bazaar, an annual fundraiser for the LGBTQ community of Salem, Massachusetts. This year, no one has volunteered to man the Bazaar’s hottest attraction: The Kissing Booth. After being turned down by every gay and straight man he knows, Granger does the unthinkable and hires the pros at Valentine’s Inc. to send him the perfect fake boyfriend to man the booth. The problem now is how to explain the gorgeous man kissing the mayor’s lips off is a Rent-A-Hunk!  Lennox MacArthur looks like a model straight off the cover of a Highland romance novel, kilt and all. When he’s hired by Granger to be his Valentine's weekend boyfriend and man the kissing booth for charity, he figures it will be an easy gig. He never counted on losing his heart to the awkwardly adorable reporter. His conundrum is that he’s kissing every cop, fireman, witch, bored housewife, and granny in town except the one man who stole his heart on sight.  When Granger mistakes Lennox’s true feelings for part of their fake boyfriends act, will it ruin his one chance at true love or will Granger land the man of his dreams if he sets aside his pride and takes his turn in line at the kissing booth?
