Complete 5 book series! Contains the first five books of the City Shifters: the Pride series. Follow the five lion shifter Chase brothers on the hunt for true love, as they discover five independent, feisty heroines, evil villains, mysterious pasts, underground fights, family, friends, and happily ever after (times five)!  Thrill of the Chase -- Feisty chef Natalia holds her own against corrupt restaurant managers and loan sharks until alpha Logan Chase purchases her restaurant and saves her life. When she learns Logan is actually a lion shifter, Nat is ready to run for the hills. Will their love affair sizzle, or are they a recipe for disaster?  Chasing Trouble -- Half-medusa Eloise Deacon has two days to rescue a hyena princess or pay back ten grand in ransom money, with no idea how to do either until Benedict Chase bails her out of jail. He even sticks around after she steals his wallet, his clothes, and his heart. But her half-medusa magic could end up freezing them both if Eloise can't figure out who wants her dead.  Storm Chaser -- Leopard shifter Sophia will go round for round with anyone in the illegal underground fights, even Atticus Chase. The only problem is, she doesn't know she's a shifter. Unless she learns to control her leopard, her life is forfeit. With Atticus barely able to control his lion at the thought of losing her, they might not survive to find out what else is hidden in Sophia's mysterious past...  Cut to the Chase -- Wolf alpha Ruby O'Shea fends off the advances of most male shifters, but finds her match in Carter Chase, the quiet lion shifter. She's in charge of her pack, her bar, and her life, but when Carter finally gets her in bed, Ruby's only too willing to give up a little control...  Chasing the Dream -- Isobel survived years of experimentation in a medical lab and losing her mate young, never dreaming that happily ever after was in her cards -- until Edgar Chase rescues her from an auction and helps her dream again.
