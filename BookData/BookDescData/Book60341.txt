FOG is the rare adventure that jolts the heart and mind, a tale of unconquerable spirit and menace, and the vaporous line between good and evil that exists in us all.When the Asia sinks in a storm along the harsh winter shores of 1882 Cape Cod, the crew, the captain, and the captain’s young daughter are cast into the midnight sea. Swept ashore, the Asia’s captain meets an unforeseen end. His child makes landfall, and dies not far away. With dawn’s arrival, all that remains are the jagged hulk of the Asia and the whispers of a secret. So begins a race to find a history-altering treasure, and a contest that pits keeper Daniel Cole and his fellow Peaked Hill Bars lifesavers against a philosophical killer, a mooncusser who walks a stoic horse along the ridge line of the Cape’s towering beach cliffs, bending fate to his aims. Hope and despair, love and loss, sacrifice and sin, riddle and answer, blur and intertwine in a tale that calls into question our own moral compass, and the very nature of progress and civilization.
