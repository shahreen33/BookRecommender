An anthology of short thrillers, chillers, mysteries and tales with a twist by Occult Horror Author, Sarah England. Most of the stories in this collection have been previously published, and form the basis of S. E. England's earlier work writing short stories and serials for magazines. While few are in the same terrifying vein as her bestselling, occult horror trilogy, 'Father of Lies,' most have a supernatural or medical theme to them, something which usually creeps into Sarah's stories. From the female detective with a murder case just a little too close to home, to the angry sales reps dabbling with online retribution, there are plenty of spooky stories here for you to dip in and out of.
