I married my stepbrother.Yeah, no one’s more surprised than me. I can’t fucking stand him.All I wanted was a quiet summer before starting college. Catch up on my books. Maybe get a summer job. Then he dropped into my life.His name’s Gavin Caldwell, and he’s stupidly rich. Cocky. Arrogant. Ridiculously, panty-meltingly hot.And he’s parading around our bridal suite shirtless. Pantless.He has no freaking shame, and I have to pretend to be in love with him.I hate him.So why can’t I stop thinking about him?
