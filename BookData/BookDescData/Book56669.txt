 
  LIGHTNING ON MY SKIN
  
  THUNDER IN MY SOUL
  
  HEAVY ON MY HEART
  
  YOU WERE MY PERFECT STORM
 My world stopped turning six years ago.My best friend. My best girl. A burning field in the pouring rain.I survived, but I left the biggest part of me with them.And now I sift through the rubble of my broken life.I didn’t want a second chance.Redemption. Closure.Not for me.Until Gelsey.A dancer. A dreamer. Everything I’m not.She’s the light to my dark.The sun from another sky.But sunny days never last.The storm is coming.And this time when darkness falls, I might surrender
