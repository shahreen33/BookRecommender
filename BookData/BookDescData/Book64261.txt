Do you keep a can of chaw in your work bag? Do you have a few recipes for squirrel in your back pocket? You’re not alone, so do the authors. Do you spend a lot of time a. huntin’ b. fishin’ c. cussin’ or d. all of the above? In The Total Redneck Manual, there is no wrong answer.Whether you’re cruising in your pickup yelling “truck yeah”, have a bird dog named “Buddy”, consider yourself a “dime store cowgirl”, or are aspiring to all three, there’s something in this country-fried cultural document for you. This is a loving celebration of an all-American cultural icon, but it’s also a hands-on working book that can help anyone better enjoy the great outdoors.  In true Field &amp; Stream fashion, it offers tried and true tips on 200+ essentials from picking the right hunting dog to fixing just about anything with duct tape and paracord, to frying up catfish and hushpuppies just like grandma used to make.  But being a redneck isn’t all hunting and fishing. It’s . . . largely hunting and fishing, according to the authors. But you’ll also learn how to open a beer bottle with just about anything, spit with deadly accuracy, and kit out the truck of your dreams. So, kick off your boots, crack open a cold one, take a seat on the porch, and learn from the best.
