Shauna Marino left Cottage Grove, California an innocent teenager, gangly, wild and with no fashion sense, always diving headfirst into whatever feelings ruled the moment. Now, she’s back to fix her mistakes. She’s gained a respectable job, set a plan in motion to benefit the town, and all that’s left is to prove to Grayson Schyler she’s changed. Maybe this time, he won’t tell her no when she shows up naked and asks him to make her a woman.Grayson Schyler, former Wimbledon champion, would've recognized Shauna anywhere. She’s made his life sweeter one moment, and hell the next. As someone in the public eye, he’d gone to great strains not to allow the media to misread their relationship, which wasn't always easy when Shauna was around. Now she’s back, asking for his help, and all he can think about is if she came back to make him pay for what he’d done.
