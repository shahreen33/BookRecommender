A fresh, seasonal take on vegetarian cooking—for the whole family. When David Frenkiel and Luise Vindahl became a couple, they decided to make a concerted effort to cook truly healthy food in their home together. When their daughter came along, this became even more important. They knew they wanted to stick to vegetarian, but they also knew the food had to be delicious, enticing, and wholesome. In this book they share recipes for families that they have developed in the past four years. Vegetarian Everyday is filled with innovative ideas for using nutritious whole ingredients in new ways. For instance, the authors use broccoli to create pesto, make a pie crust from ground almonds, and brighten up mushroom burgers with grilled peaches. Some of their most beloved recipes are Watermelon Gazpacho, Quinoa &amp; Vegetable Chorizo Salad, Beet Bourginon, Zucchini Noodles with Marinated Mushrooms, and Frozen Strawberry Cheesecake. Because the recipes generally avoid dairy, refined flour, and sugar, this book provides plenty of inspired dishes for those with gluten and other allergies. Bursting with color and flavor, this is vegetarian cooking that the whole family can love.
