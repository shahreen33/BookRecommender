A Step Outside of Normal is the first in the Read on the Run series. It is an anthology of seven short stories, by five different authors, presenting situations which are almost, but not quite, normal. Not really supernatural, not really fantasy, not really general fiction. But what they all share is that each is a little bit “off”. And short, to suit your busy lifestyle.Hell of a Day, by Laurie Axinn Gienapp, is about a young man who has to deal with divorced parents who don’t like each other… but with an unusual setting.Sunnybrook Acres, by Catherine Valenti, is a story of a retirement home, with an unusual cadre of residents.Pirates, by Kathleen Terrell, looks at the world out of the eyes of a young child. Always, by Theresa Thompson, is a tender story about loss, except that maybe it’s not so tender. Xyxyx, by R. S. Leergard, examines the beginning of the world, but perhaps not our world.The Double, by Laurie Axinn Gienapp, presents a young woman who appears to have a doppelganger. And Rage, by Catherine Valenti – well, you’ll just have to read that one.
