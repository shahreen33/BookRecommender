We vowed forever. What we got was two years.But now I’m back to take back what was stolen from me.She’s mine to have, and mine to hold.Again. A filthy oil-rig roughneck like me had no business with a wife like her. She was the pretty little flower I never should have put my dirty hands on. But Leanna was my everything. My heart. My obsession. And one year ago, they told me another man took her away from me. …I just found out that was bullshit. And now, there’s going to be hell to pay. Her family never thought I was good enough for her. The wrong side of the tracks, and too rough and savage for their sweet, innocence Leanna. They lied to keep me from her, and her from me. But now that I know the truth? Well, now I’m coming back for what’s mine. I’m twice the man I was before—harder, fiercer, and even more obsessed. For richer or for poorer? Well, she had me poor and loved every second of my rough hands pinning her to our marriage bed. I’ve made my fortune since, but I’m ready to throw it all away to get her back in my arms where she belongs. The bastards that took her from me think they can keep us apart. …They’re dead fucking wrong. A year ago, I thought I lost her. Two days ago, I learned the truth. And tonight, I’m taking back my bride.  And I’ll burn the whole world down to get her if I have to.   Looking for a ridiculously over the top alpha hero completely obsessed with claiming his one and only? You’re in the right place! This one’s equal parts sweeter than sugar and hotter than sin, and I’m pretty sure you’re going to eat it right up ;). As with all my books, this standalone is safe, with no cheating, and a HEA guaranteed.
