LoMoving to River’s Edge was supposed to be a fresh start.Away from chaos.Away from bad influences and worse relationships.All I wanted was to give my little brother more of a chance than I ever had.It should’ve been simple.I didn’t count on my transgressions following me.And I definitely didn’t count on meeting Dare.Tall, tortured, and tattooed.A Lost Boy through and through.Falling for someone like him was asking for heartache.But I was a sucker for punishment.DareI had a routine.Eat, work, sleep, repeat, only ever doing the bare minimum to keep up appearances.I kept my circle small and my guard high.I spent years making sure I didn’t repeat the mistakes of my past, forming an impenetrable layer of ice around my heart.Then Logan showed up in my town, in my tattoo shop, testing my patience along with my self-control.She was fire and I was ice.I should’ve stayed away.But I had been cold for far too long.
