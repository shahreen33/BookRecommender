In 1961 Alabama, twelve-year-old Johnny tries to keep his promise to look after his disabled Pa when his older brother leaves for military service, but secrets from the past, Cuban politics, and racial tensions would make the task challenging even for his hero, Superman. The Troubles of Johnny Cannon is a historical coming-of-age novel set against the backdrop of 1960s espionage, Cold War paranoia, and Southern racial tensions."A boy with a highly original voice winces his way into the bewildering world of adults during a neglected moment in American history."(Richard Peck, author of the Newbery Medal-winning A Year Down Yonder)“The Troubles of Johnny Cannon is a gripping novel, filled with great characters and big ideas. Johnny Cannon is a touching, fascinating hero with a wonderfully original voice, and through him, Isaiah Campbell tells an engrossing tale set against the backdrop of both the Civil Rights movement and the Bay of Pigs Invasion. I don't wish any more troubles upon poor Johnny, but I wouldn't mind reading another few novels with him, either."(Stuart Gibbs, author of Belly Up)"Isaiah Campbell has given us something special with The Troubles of Johnny Cannon—a story of humor, mystery, and heart, of courage and friendship and what it means to be family, all told in the unforgettable voice of Johnny Cannon himself—a hero you won’t soon forget. This is a book that made me laugh and think, and had me cheering for Johnny at every turn. An ambitious and exciting read."(Claire Legrand, author of The Cavendish Home for Boys and Girls)"Isaiah Campbell took me right to the heart of everything hopeful and harrowing about being a kid in a complicated 1960s world. He also made me laugh, starting on page one. The only trouble with The Troubles of Johnny Cannon is that the pages ran out at the end."(Tim Federle, author of Better Nate Than Ever)
