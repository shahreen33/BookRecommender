The period spanning 600 AD to 1750 AD is perceived as the long phase of India's transition from the ancient to the immediately pre-colonial times. The book tells the story of medieval India, a defining and eventful chapter in the making of its cultural and political history. It is a period marked by a multiplicity of states, spread of urbanisation, foreign invasions, growth of science and technology, achievements in literature and philosophy as well as consolidation of the subcontinent. Drawing upon primary materials, archival records, historical narratives and accounts of travellers and European commercial records, the book is an authoritative introduction to this era.Irfan Habib (b. 1931) is widely regarded as one of the foremost historians of medieval India and of the Marxist school. Habib's work straddles diverse areas from historical geography to the impact of colonialism on India to exploring its medieval administrative and economic history. Among his notable books are The Agrarian System of Mughal India 1556-1707 and An Atlas of the Mughal Empire. He was Professor of History at the Aligarh Muslim University from 1969 to 1991. Habib was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 2005 and conferred emeritus status by the AMU in 2007.
