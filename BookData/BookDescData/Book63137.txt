The Barnes &amp; Noble ReviewWhat happens when a staff sergeant questions a two-star general's parentage to his face? Torin Kerr discovers the answer in Tanya Huff's much-anticipated sequel to Valor's Choice.Separated from her company, Kerr is ordered to report to a top-secret reconnaissance mission, either as punishment for her quick mouth or praise for her service. Kerr must turn a ragtag group of Marines into a cohesive fighting unit in a matter of days, while maneuvering through the murky political waters of the Confederation.Huff's vivid creation of alien species and how they interact gives this novel a tangibility rarely found in futuristic SF. Fast-paced action and quick-witted quips create the intimate feeling of camaraderie that is necessary for any good military tale. Staff Sergeant Kerr's character maintains steely control in the toughest situations, a heroine cut from the same cloth as P.I. Vicki Nelson from Huff's Blood Price series. (S.A.)
