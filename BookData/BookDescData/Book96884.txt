Gorgeous, incendiary, tempting as original sin, and totally off limits.He’s rough, dominant, and hot as hell on wheels. Channing Hensley blew into my life like a firestorm, and I’ve been in love and lust with him since the minute I laid eyes on himAll in secret, of course.He doesn’t know. No one can know the things I dream of him doing to me. No one can know that I – the picture-perfect sweet little good girl – want him to be my first.So I hid it away instead, in a letter, where I poured out my heart and my deepest darkest fantasies to the man with the body made for reckless choices, and the piercing green eyes that dare you to make them. The man with the dark past and the fierce gaze that lingers on me in a way that takes my breath away.He’s six years older than me. He works for my family’s law firm.He’s totally wrong, utterly inappropriate, and completely irresistible.Channing Hensley is my stepbrother.And I *want* him.Filthy, scandalous, and so sugary sweet your teeth will hurt. This one’s a heaping dose of wrong in the right kind of way ;). If an older, dominant, obsessed alpha claiming his untouched heroine sounds like your cup of tea (oh, you know it is), then you should probably dive right in. Safe, no cheating, and a HEA guaranteed.
