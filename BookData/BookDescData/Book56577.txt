I’m Special Agent Jackson Turner. Over eighteen years ago, my brothers Andrew and Sylvester were killed by Madison Stone and Joseph Shelton AKA Stone. Today, I’m breaking the law. I’m stalking my niece Alyssa and I’m planning a slow, painful death for her mother Madison.  But, during this planning, I came across some very disturbing information. Information that could change the course of my criminal behavior and convince me to save a family I was once set out to destroy. The truth leads me down a dark path of secrets, lies, deception and murder. Will I sacrifice avenging the death of my brothers to save Madison and her family? Or will I destroy her?
