It is May, 1798, and Ireland is a country at war.  One hundred thousand peasants have risen up against the Crown to the tales of men, women and children butchered as traitors. It is whispered that the feared and despised ghosts of Oliver Cromwellâ€™s New Model army have returned seeking bloodshed, and no one is safe.  Major Lorn Mullone, a man forged by war and torn by past failures, is sent by the government to apprehend Colonel Black, a dangerous and shadowy figure, who is harming the fragile peace talks with his own murderous retribution.  In a race against time, Lorn must journey across a country riven by fighting, where at the walled town of New Ross, he discovers a new horror.  In the desperate battle for peace, Lorn must survive for the sake of Ireland's future.  Liberty or Death is an authentic historical story set against the brutal backdrop of Ireland's Great Rebellion, the first novella in The Soldier Chronicles series.
