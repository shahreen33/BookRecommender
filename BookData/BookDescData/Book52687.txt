Boom.Yahaira thinks she knows who conducts the air raids. But these days, one can’t be sure. Maybe it’s the ISIS, the Syrian government, or the rebels. As bombs after bombs are being dropped around their shelter, she looks at her brother and their bawling mother. How long can they survive in this filth?Did they do something wrong? Did they kill innocents, slaughter humans, or murder the poor? Did they rape women, mutilate children, torture slaves? From the alleyways of Aleppo to the treacherous Mediterranean Sea, Yahaira asks herself the same questions over and over again. They are being punished for something they don’t know about. Maybe it will always be this way.Based on the refugee crisis currently ongoing in Syria and beautifully encapsulating destroyed edifices and torn lives, Escaped – The Ballad of a Syrian Refugee summarises what it is like to live in troubled lands in troubled times.THE AUTHORNandini Jiva is a seventeen-year-old girl living in Ahmedabad.
