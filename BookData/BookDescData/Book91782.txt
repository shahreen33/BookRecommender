Off Grid and Free: My Path to the Wilderness is the story of the journey Ron Melchiore undertook as a young man from the city, first to homesteading in northern Maine and then to living in the bush of northern Saskatchewan. He has lived off grid since approximately 1980 and speaks candidly about the joys and the tribulations of his chosen lifestyle. In this nonfiction, Ron shares the diversity of his experiences in an easy-to-read, humorous, and sometimes harrowing narrative.The book includes his hiking of the 2,100 mile Appalachian Trail in winter, bicycling across the United States, homesteading off grid, and the terror of being surrounded by a wildfire and surprise encounters with bears, and more. For readers with an outdoors spirit, people with an off grid and self-sufficiency bent, and dreamers who like to read about adventure, Ron hopes to inspire others to "take the road less traveled."Ron has been published in Back Home Magazine, Small Farmers Journal, and Countryside Magazine.
