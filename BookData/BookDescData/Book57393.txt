THE THIRD PATRICK MELROSE NOVEL Patrick Melrose, cleaned-up and world-weary, is a reluctant guest at a glittering party deep in the English countryside. Amid a crowd of flitting social dragonflies, he finds his search for redemption and capacity for forgiveness challenged by his observation of the cruelties around him. Armed with his biting wit and a newly fashioned openness, can Patrick, who has been to the furthest limits of experience and back again, find release from the savageries of his childhood? ‘A masterpiece. Edward St Aubyn is a writer of immense gifts.’ -Patrick McGrath ‘St Aubyn’s Melrose series slices and dices morality with prose so chiselled and a narrative so intense that the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.’ -Geordie Greig, Evening Standard ‘I’ve loved Edward St Aubyn’s Patrick Melrose novels. Read them all, now.’ -David Nicholls ‘A memorable tour de force.’ -New York Times Book Review
