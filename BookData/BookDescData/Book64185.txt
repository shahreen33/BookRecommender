One day a forest violently grows in the place of a small New Mexico town, the remnants of which are quickly overrun by the forest's inhabitants â€” every manner of ghoul, beast, or monster imaginable. So what comes next? Naturally, guided tours! But what happens when the so-called indestructible tram breaks down in the middle of the forest of nightmares? In The Haunted Forest Tour, James A. Moore and Jeff Strand collaborate to blend horror and humor into an absurd and horrific tale. Get your ticket punched, enjoy your ride, and please keep your hands in the trolley at all times!
