Summer and the Grand Tournament of High Colleges have come to the University of Maradaine. If the heat and the crowds weren't enough to bring the campus and the neighborhood of Aventil to a boiling point, rumors that The Thorn is on the warpath— killing the last of the Red Rabbits— is enough to tip all of Maradaine into the fire. Except Veranix Calbert, magic student at the University, is the Thorn, and he's not the one viciously hunting the Red Rabbits. Veranix has hands full with his share of responsibilities for the Tournament, and as the Thorn he’s been trying to find the source of the effitte being sold on campus. He’s as confused as anyone about the rumors. When the Thorn imposter publicly attacks the local Aventil constables, the constabulary bring in special investigators: two dedicated and determined inspectors from the Maradaine Grand Inspectors Unit, who specialize in the strangest cases. Veranix must find out who the imposter is and stop him before the inspectors arrest him for the imposter’s crimes.
