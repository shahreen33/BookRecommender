Never trust a man who answers the door wearing nothing more than a pair of low-cut jeans and a panty-melting smirk.That should've been my first sign.I write about guys like him for a living — sexy and charming, yet reluctant to get into a serious relationship. His body screams sex appeal, but his condescending personality makes him a classic f*ckboy.And I want nothing to do with that.Writing romance novels comes with its perks — traveling, meeting new people, creating characters from the voices in my head — but Ethan Rochester enters my life and rearranges my preconceived notions about writing what inspires you.Meeting him was fate, but falling for him was inevitable.And forgetting him will be impossible.**This is a complete STANDALONE novel — filled with plenty of humor, steam, &amp; romance! 18 &amp; up only due to explicit sexual content, language, and adult content. Previously published as My Week with the Bad Boy by Brooke Cumberland &amp; Lyra Parish.**
