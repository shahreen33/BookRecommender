Brantley Phipps doesn’t need a boyfriend. In his line of work, relationships are impossible. All he wants is one night of fun before he starts his three-month rotation as Assistant Hotel Director on a cruise ship.  He scores the jackpot with a hot older guy who hits all his yes, please buttons and who wants the same thing as him. Talk about a night to remember. That should last him a while…  Until he discovers that his one-night stand is none other than the legendary Captain Silver Fox aka his boss for the next three months. Oops.  Still, it shouldn’t be an issue because Brantley doesn’t do coworkers and Fox is known for being strict as hell about not dating employees. That should make things easy, if not for that pesky attraction that keeps flaring up whenever they're in the same room.  It's gonna be a long three months...  Shipping the Captain has an age gap, yummy steamy scenes, a Caribbean setting, and a summer fling that turns into an embarrassing case of falling for the boss. It’s the sixth book in the Valentine’s Inc. Cruises series but can be read as a complete standalone. The only connection in the series is the shared premise of the Valentine’s Inc. cruise.
