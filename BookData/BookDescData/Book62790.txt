"The Wolf can break my bones, but he can't destroy my heart."I will never lie down and say die because there are four hearts that beat for me, including my own, and it's the strongest weapon I have. I will defeat the Wolf. I will take his life. He'd better sleep with one eye open, because I'm coming for him.Who is the Wolf? He's one dead son-of-a-bitch in my eyes. He underestimated me and now he has no clue where I am. I've found my place to hide, and it's only a matter of time until I see my freedom."Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, burn in hell, Red, because I've had enough." - The WolfThe game isn't over yet. For me, it's just begun.
