Vengeance has a name, and her name is mine. My role is to take action against the darkest men I’ve ever come across.To kill them one at a time. Until my list is complete. And in doing so, I’m going to use my most powerful weapon—my body. They ruined my life, and now it’s my turn to destroy theirs. Even if it means a death sentence for me, each drop of blood will be deserving. Each kill will be worthy of the price I may need to pay. My name is Isadora, and my target is the Moretti Mafia.
