The true story of the pool table rape and murder of Margaret Anderson. Left for dead, practically beheaded in a manure pile, Margaret fights for life. But in the end, the single mother leaves behind a son. Author Dauplaise practically makes Margaret blow a breath at readers as he recreates the night she was killed. He then takes readers to the place she was trying to escape back to, her home state of Montana and finally, on the investigative hunt of a lifetime as this America's Most Wanted drama ends with the capture of her killer five years later. Readers will remember the case. Dauplaise infiltrates the motorcycle gang (club) culture of the 1980s to expose what happened to Anderson and why she was just six months away from disappearing back to Montana. True-crime enthusiasts will revel in the detail and the hunt. Vivid. Enthralling. Horrific. Mike Dauplaise has a microscopic ability to see and know the truth as it exists, not as it seems. He presents here a murder story that needs to be told.
