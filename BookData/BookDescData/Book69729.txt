Ana Avdonin had always been a little difficult. Particular, hard to please, and she didn’t deny any of it. As a Bratva princess and the daughter of Anton Avdonin, she was taught that if—not when—she chose to have a man stand by her side, he should be worthy of the position. When Koldan Vasin swept into her life like a hurricane, he quickly turned everything that Ana thought she knew upside down. He’d always called her beautiful even at her ugliest; even in her worst moments, she was so beautiful to him. From engagement, to a wedding, a move to Jersey, and even children, the snapshots of Ana and Koldan’s life haven’t always been perfect, but they have been honest, filled with love, and painfully real. Loving is the easy part. Living is what’s hard. ***PLEASE NOTE: The Jersey Vignettes is an 18k COMPANION novella to The Russian Guns series. It follows a decade of time in the life of Ana and Koldan Vasin from marriage, and far beyond. It is NOT to be read as a standalone in the series.
