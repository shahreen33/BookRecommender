Matsuyama Kaze is a ronin, or masterless samurai, destined to travel the countryside until he fulfills the dying wish of his lord's wife. At a crossroads on the way to the town of Suzaka, Kaze finds the body of a merchant pierced by an arrow. Not satisfied with the conclusions of local officials, he sets out to solve the crime himself. Kaze soon becomes embroiled with an unlikely - and untrustworthy - cast of characters, who are as colorful as they are crafty. Each has a secret to keep and an ax to grind, and it will take all of Kaze's subtlety, stealth, and samurai skills to unravel the mystery and unmask the killer.
