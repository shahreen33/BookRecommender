Death becomes me. Now I know what it finally means.  As if being a halfling wasn’t enough. Now I’m something more, but I have no clue what my abilities are or what is going on. Oh, and I’m being hunted. The reasoning behind it makes my blood run cold when I find out. I need to find a way to protect myself, but as I begin to learn more about who I am and my past, powers and abilities arise. Now I need to make a choice on how to use them, all while trying to stay alive. At least I have my four hot housemates trying to help, although they’re more of a distraction and delicious temptation. Not to mention this telepathic thing is getting out of hand. Hopefully I’ll discover exactly what it all means. Life is never easy. Time to buckle up and learn.  ***This is a fastburn RH.***
