Leading radical journalist on violence and anti-fascism, certainty and lies, sex and ghostsBeing Numerous shatters the mainstream consensus on politics, personhood, and truth, and offers in its place a bracing analysis of a perilous world and how we might live in it. Beginning with an interrogation of what it means to fight fascism, Natasha Lennard explores the limits of individual rights, the criminalization of political dissent, the myths of radical sex, and why we may choose to leave room in our lives for ghosts. At once politically committed and philosophically capacious, Being Numerous is a revaluation of the idea that “the personal is political,” and goes on to ask the central question of our time—how can we live a non-fascist life?
