Stud Finder is a standalone, dual-POV novella that links characters from The Knocked Up Plan with the The Big Rock books and does not need to be read in any order.There are three little words most guys don’t want to hear on the first date. Not those... I mean these... “knock me up.”This single gal has had enough of the games, the BS and the endless chase. I know what I want most, and it’s not true love. It’s a bun in the oven, and I’m not afraid to hit up my sex-on-a-stick co-worker to do the job. Ryder is gorgeous, witty and charming—and he’s also a notorious commitment-phobe. That makes him the perfect candidate to make a deposit in the bank of me.I won’t fall for him, he won’t fall for me, and there’s no way baby will make three. Right?****There are four words every guy wants to hear on the first date—“your place or mine?”When my hot-as-sin co-worker makes me a no-strings-attached offer that involves her place, my place, any place—as well as any position—I can’t refuse. Besides, I've got my own reasons to take her up on her deal even with her one BIG condition.There’s no way I’ll want more from one woman than any position, any where, any night? Except... what if I do?Note: Be prepared to swoon and fan yourself from the heat! This full-length standalone contains lots of hot baby-making s-e-x, happy tears, naughty jokes and a hot, swoon-worthy hero you will fall madly in love with.
