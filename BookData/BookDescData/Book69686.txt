***STANDALONE NOVEL. NO CLIFFHANGER***  Malina Everything I do is for my daughter. I only want the best for her life. So when her father finally decided that after three years he wanted to get to know her, I put my feelings aside and allowed him in. Not to be with me, but to be a daddy to her. Well, a few things came with him that I wasn’t prepared for—a crazy ass girlfriend who wanted to guard her territory at any cost, and a fine ass uncle that made it clear he wanted my attention.  My best friend Laney is telling me to go for it, but my conscience is messing with me on a daily and telling me that it’s just too close for comfort. But the heart wants what the heart wants and before long, I start to feel that pull toward this man who makes me feel like no other man ever has.  Zeke When I first saw Malina, I knew I had to have her. Yeah, there’s code that says if your family has touched the merchandise, then you don’t entertain it. But Malina isn’t just any woman. Because not one woman that I’ve ever encountered made me want to reach out and touch her on sight—but she did. From the way she carried herself, to the way she looked at me, I knew that if she let me in, she would know what it was like to be loved for real . . . and by a real man.  Rocco I’m not perfect by any means. I’ve done my share of dirt. I can’t even say for sure that my dirty deeds are done. I love women . . . a lot of them. As a result, I’ve had a few babies along the way—babies that I haven’t always done right by; so I’m setting out to change that and do what a real father is supposed to do. Problem is the woman that I’m “with” doesn’t really grasp the concept of what it is I’m trying to do and her reaction to it all causes a whole lot of chaos.  Kia I’m territorial. I don’t make excuses for it. It’s who I am. And when I feel that somebody is trying to step into my zone and steal what belongs to me, I react. This chick, Malina, who opened her legs to my man and had his child, thinks she’s going to come in with her daughter and claim a spot that never belonged to her. She’s dead wrong. If I have to show her what that means, that’s what it’ll be. But she won’t like it if it does come down to that, so if I was her, I’d tread carefully.  “Family Ties” is a love story at its core, but inside of this love story, many other themes appear; the primary one being that love really has no boundaries when it comes to family…  A FULL Excerpt can be found here: http://www.perriforrest.com/category/...  ***Strong language content that some readers may find to be offensive.***
