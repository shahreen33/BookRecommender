In a time when a live Human specimen would fetch a king’s ransom on the black market, being a smuggler seemed like the perfect front to search for her people. But the cost of Dezmara Strykar’s operation has forced her to win each smuggling run she enters. Now every smuggler is gunning for her top position, and her rare black Zebulon star freighter makes her an easily recognizable target. But dodging jealous smugglers, safeguarding her Human identity and solving the mystery surrounding who she is will become harder than she ever imagined. A mysterious creature in a black Zebulon star freighter has murdered a freedom fighter and has stolen the only weapon that can save countless worlds from an unspeakable evil. Dezmara’s next run will turn into much more than just cover to search for Humans. Dezmara Strykar just became the most wanted murder suspect in the universe. Now she is going to have to run for her life.
