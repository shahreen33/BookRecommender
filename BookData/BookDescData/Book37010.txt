My mother said we should drive down to his place and see what might be in it for us."Brilliantly written, deeply moving, fantastically funny, Lucky Us introduces us to Eva and Iris.

Filled with gorgeous writing, memorable characters, and surprising events, Lucky Us is a thrilling and resonant novel about success and failure, good luck and bad, the creation of a family, and the pleasures and inevitable perils of family life. From Brooklyn's beauty parlors to London's West End, a group of unforgettable people love, lie, cheat, and survive in this story of our fragile, absurd, heroic species.
