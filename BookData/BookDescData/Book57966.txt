An account of an exhilarating adventure across West Africa, from the Cameroun rain forest via the Sahara an Tombouctou. Christina Dodwell always chooses an unorthodox means of travel, but mircolight is the most unusual yet. As well as the danger involved it also had the great advantage of getting her to areas in accessible t ground transport and allowing her to land whenever she wished to explore.She met duck-billed women, pygmies, a mountain sorcerer, dancers and nomads. She canoed on Lake Chad, flew through a dust storm, rode a camel into the Air Mountains and - most memorable of all her many adventures - discovered a dinosaur graveyard.
