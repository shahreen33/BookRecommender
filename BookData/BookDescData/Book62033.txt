The idea of being able to dispatch one's enemies over vast differences through rituals using either arrows or darts is a common theme in many cultures. It is especially widespread in circumpacific cultures where there are many variations in detail but where the main theme remains constantâ€”effective removal of negative forces both spiritual and human. The phur-pa, a three-bladed dart or dagger, is the implement of this action in Tibet and its use is quite common throughout areas of Tibetan ritual influence. How the idea, probably of shamanic origins, and the phur-pa with its connected rituals became part of the Buddhist religion is a study that remains to be done. It may have been a facet of the conversion of deities carried on by Padmasambhava but there is no direct evidence of this and it is only known that the phur-pa was one of the implements he used in subduing and converting spirits antagonistic to Buddhism. It has not been possible to deal with these problems of origin. Therefore, what I have attempted to do in this brief monograph is to supply a tentative basic iconography and a general introduction to the ritual functions of the phur-pa as a stepping stone into future work.146 page PDF version is numbered with 76 pages of text and 63 pages of plates.
