It was always him. The one I shouldn't want, shouldn't crave, the one who could destroy my carefully built life.Hagen Lykaios was the essence of sin, indulgence, and danger - everything I knew to avoid.All it took was one unexpected touch, and he consumed me, left me begging, needy, and hungry for more.He said if I entered his world he would corrupt me, own me, and change all that I had ever known...and you know what? I went anyway.
