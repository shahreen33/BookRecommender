And leave it to a band of organized tobacco thieves to break into dozens of warehouses and steal the livelihood of law-abiding citizens, or a group of drunkards threatening to spread smallpox when they were confined to quarantine to wreak havoc throughout the city. Join prolific local author Alice Sink as she recounts tales of the dastardly denizens and rakish residents of this North Carolina town."
