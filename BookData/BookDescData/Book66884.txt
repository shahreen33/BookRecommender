DEAR ALLY, HOW DO YOU WRITE A BOOK?It’s going to be exactly what it sounds like–me, answering writing-related questions from REAL teenagers! Because I’ve learned through the years that a lot of you are extremely passionate about writing, and you ask some GREAT questions.Plus, “how to write” books were really important for me when I was starting out, but there were none aimed at teenagers. This is my attempt to change that.But first….I need you help.I NEED REAL WRITING-RELATED QUESTIONS FROM REAL TEENS!If you’re a teen and you like to write… Or if you know a teen who likes to write….PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR WRITING-RELATED QUESTIONS, and I’ll go through them all and–hopefully–yours will end up in the finished book!The book, btw, will be published by Scholastic in the fall of 2018–just in time for NaNoWriMo!If you want your question considered, just go to AllyCarter.com/DearAlly and let me know what you’d like to know. --from Ally Carter's blog
