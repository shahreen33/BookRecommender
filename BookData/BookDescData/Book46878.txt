Critics have heralded Richard Wilbur's translations of Molière's seventeenth-century dramas as masterpieces. In brilliant rhymed couplets Wilbur renders into English not only the form and spirit of Molière's language but also its substance.The Misanthrope, one of Molière's most popular plays, is a searching comic study of falsity, shallowness, and self-righteousness. The misanthrope in this case is Alceste, a man whose conscience and sincerity are too rigorous for his time. In Tartuffe the title character, a wily opportunist and swindler, affects sanctity and gains complete ascendancy over Orgon, a rich bourgeois who in his middle years has become a bigot and prude. Only when Orgon actually witnesses Tartuffe's attempt to seduce his wife does he come to his senses. Richard Wilbur won a share of the Bollingen Translation Prize for his much-acclaimed translation of this satiric turn on religious hypocrisy.
