If you want to read gripping stories that don’t rely on sex, swearing, and graphic violence—you’ve come to the right place!  DEEP MAGIC is a bi-monthly electronic magazine that publishes clean short fiction in the fantasy and science fiction genres (epic, paranormal, steampunk, etc). Our issues are also filled with author interviews, art features, book reviews and tips for writers.In this issue you'll find an exclusive interview with NYT bestselling author Brandon Mull about his new Fablehaven series as well as writing craft articles from WSJ bestseller (and founder) Jeff Wheeler and the newly minted NYT #1 Bestseller Kathryn Purdie. We also features some wonderful stories in this issue. Caitlyn McFarland's "Lady of War" is one that will make you hope she turns it into a novel. We also have Ronald Ferguson's "Wizards and Wizdom", a very clever tale about a wizard in training. There is also Gwendolyn's Clare, whose debut novel comes out soon, with her short story "Waracabra Tigers" to whet your fantasy tastes. For sci-fi, we have a delightfully creative tale called "Pirate Readers" about a future where reading real books is actually banned. And finally, Allen Shoff's space travel story "The Tariff" about a clever ship captain seeking to thwart a blockade. This month we also feature two book excerpts (instead of one) that we think you'll love to purchase. Erin Summerill's "Ever the Hunted" and a sneak peek at Bethany Wiggins' new work, "The Dragon's Price."
