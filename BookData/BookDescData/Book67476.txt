If King Mario wanted a war, he would get one. It has been one week since I promised war against the Dark Fae. One week of planning and aligning all the pieces on my board to assure victory. Then he did something unexpected. Now, I have no idea which way to move. Offense? Defense? Offense? Defense? Good news? I’ve got some quality drama to keep me entertained. From the Marabella and Palo show to Bobby and Esme's return, my days have been filled. What about time with my boys though? No worries! Even in war we have time for romance. Right? At least I have my cat Lunatic. Though, I have to admit she sometimes seems more human than cat. Is there something I’m not seeing? Hopefully, we will figure it out because if not… well I would rather not consider that! Stay positive… right? I have only one rule and I plan to follow it. Always punch first.  This 53k third installment of the Vengeance series is filled with fantasy, adventure, and a ton of steamy steam. Get your fans and water bottles ready because this is going to be a hot one! Not to mention the substantial blood, violence, and swearing that we’ve come to love! Be ready for this fast paced and exciting continuation with Gray and her guards!  A note to readers of both the Red Masques &amp; Vengeance: There will be spoilers!!! The plot lines intertwine so I am releasing both books at the same time. Feel free to pick either release but I just wanted to give you a heads up! Enjoy!  Also, don’t forget to follow my FB group Sinclair’s Ravens for new updates!!!
