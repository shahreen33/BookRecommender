Once upon a time, there lived a witch. A kickass, brilliant, dope as hell witch whose magicks inspired fear and envy. Like all classic fairy tales, her story had the usual goodies.  Destiny.  Adventure.  Missing souls.  Unfathomable evil, the precarious fate of the entire universe, blah, blah, blah.  But let’s get back to that witch with the awesome hair…  Fine, it’s me. I’m the all-powerful witch. And, okay, maybe my story isn’t a classic fairy tale. Not unless I missed the part about Little Red delivering comic books and munchies in her basket and Beauty sleeping off two-for-one margarita night. But I do have a soul mate—my very own Charming.  Except he’s no prince. He’s a level-headed, by the book, insanely sexy detective.  And me?  Well, I’m Stoned. Warning: Not recommended for readers under the age of 18 thanks to a dirty talking hero, a filthy-minded heroine, and the hot magicks they create. This story starts where Styx leaves off, so although it is a new couple, it is HIGHLY(pun totally intended) recommended they be read in order.
