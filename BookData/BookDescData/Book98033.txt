"A stirring reminder of the horrors of war and a distinctive take on the timelessness of love." - Kirkus ReviewsIt is April 1916 and thousands of men have left home to fight in the war to end all wars. Jessica Brown's father is about to be one of these men. A year later, he is still alive, but Jess has to steal to keep her family from starving. And then a telegram arrives - her father has been killed in action. Four generations later, Sam Foster's father is admitted to hospital with a suspected brain haemorrhage. A nurse asks if she would like to take her father’s hand. Sam refuses. All she wants is to get out of this place, stuck between the world of the living and the world of the dead, a place with no hope and no future, as quickly as possible. As Sam's father's condition worsens, her dreams become more frequent - and more frightening. She realises that what she is experiencing is not a dream, but someone else's living nightmare... We've Come to Take You Home is an emotionally-charged story of a friendship forged 100 years apart. “As Sam’s story collides with the past, the novel slowly becomes whole, leading to an eloquent and moving ending” – Kirkus Reviews‘Powerful, intelligent and moving, a very assured and intricately plotted debut novel, with a great sense of place.’Graeme Simsion, author of The Rosie Project and The Rosie Effect 'Susan Gandar's story bridges different times, different worlds, with energy, drive and elegance. She writes with a sense of subtle wonder that her characters share with the reader, but the real mystery, as in all good storytelling, is timeless; how we live, how we love, and above all who we really are. A great read.'Michael Russell, author of 'The City of Shadows’ and ‘The City of Strangers’‘Couldn’t put it down!’Clara Salaman, author of ‘Shame on You’ and ‘The Boat’
