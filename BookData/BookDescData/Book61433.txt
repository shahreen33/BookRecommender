 You reap what you sow  The final part of the Dixie Killer Blues trilogy in which maverick private investigator Evan Buckley and disgraced detective Ed Guillory forge relentlessly ahead with their uneasy alliance in the hunt for Dixie’s killer.  Clashing with cold-blooded psychopaths and the vindictive gang leader Chico along the way, their efforts are hamstrung when Guillory’s attempts to redeem himself lead to unexpected consequences—and Evan finds himself the victim of Chico’s latest sick fantasy as he takes on the mantle of serial killer Ed Gein.  To make matters worse, nobody’s neck is safe as Dixie’s brother, Jackson, continues to wreak his own brand of havoc in his quest for vengeance, but in the final showdown it’s not Dixie’s death that rocks him back on his heels—and it’s not anything his home-made garrote can help him with this time.  Meanwhile, when Ellie Martin’s single-minded pursuit of her own self interest—and Evan’s associated demise—comes back to bite her, she realizes too late that she’s set in motion forces she can’t control and discovers to her cost an eternal and unforgiving truth: You reap what you sow.  As always, things get worse before they get better, but, in the end, everybody gets what they deserve—more or less—just not necessarily what they were hoping for, and, in Evan’s case, life will never be the same again.
