Fires smolder endlessly below the dangerous surface of Guatemala City's municipal dump. Deadlier fires seethe beneath the tenuous calm of a nation recovering from brutal civil war. Anthropologist Vicki Andrews is researching Guatemala's "garbage people" when she stumbles across a human body. Curiosity turns to horror as she uncovers no stranger, but an American environmentalist-Vicki's only sister, Holly. With authorities dismissing the death as another street crime, Vicki begins tracing Holly's last steps, a pilgrimage leading from slum squalor to the breathtaking and endangered cloud forests of the Sierra de las Minas Biosphere. But every unraveled thread raises more questions. What betrayal connects Holly's murder, the recent massacre of a Mayan village, and the long-ago deaths of Vicki's own parents? Nor is Vicki the only one demanding answers. Before her search reaches its startling end, the conflagration has spilled across international borders to threaten an American administration and the current war on terror. With no one turning out to be who they'd seemed, who can Vicki trust and who should she fear? A politically relevant tale of international intrigue and God's redemptive beauty and hope.
