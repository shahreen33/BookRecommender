Carole Seddon hates Christmas. So her neighbour and best friend, Jude, drags her along to go shopping at a local store called Gallimaufry. Then, a few days later, Gallimaufry is burnt down and a body is discovered in the ashes. It seems like a tragic accident, but no-one can die of natural causes when a gun is involved.
