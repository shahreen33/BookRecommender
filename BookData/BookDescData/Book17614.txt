From the moment Hannah Sanders arrived in town, she felt there was something wrong.     A lot of houses were for sale, and the town seemed infected by an unearthly quiet. And then, on Hannah’s first day of classes, she ran into a group of cheerleaders—the most popular girls in school.     The odd thing was that they were nearly identical in appearance: blonde, beautiful, and deathly pale.     But Hannah wants desperately to fit in—regardless of what her friend Lukas is telling her: if she doesn’t watch her back, she’s going to be blonde and popular and dead—just like all the other zombies in this town. . . .
