Werewolves meet the Wild West in this exciting second installment of the Wolf Brides trilogy.  Lorelei McGregor has tumbled from the top tier of Turn of the Century Boston society. Determined not to sully her family’s name further, she answers an ad in the newspaper for a mail order bride. The big city is no longer home, so she’ll try her hand at surviving the Wild West cattle town of Colorado Springs with her new stranger husband.  The man she meets is tall and strapping, and about as wild as a person can get. His strange mannerisms scream that something is off, but out of options, Lorelei has to learn to adapt to life on a homestead with a family who doesn’t seem altogether human.  Jeremiah Dawson is keeping big secrets from his mail-order bride, but he can’t trust her with the truth until he knows she won’t run from him. When a mission to track down some of the most notorious outlaws in the Colorado territory goes wrong, he’ll have to learn to trust her, or cut her loose to save her from the feral animal inside of him.  If he chooses wisely, he just might find the woman who can fix his broken wolf.  Content Warning: explicit love scenes, language, badass Wild West werewolves, and sexy shifter secrets. Adult only shifter romance.
