On the wings of a mid-life crisis, thirty-something Geetanjali Rao is back in her parent’s house in India. Armed with an astrologer’s prediction that ‘Jupiter is looking out for her’, she has to start a new life from scratch; new friends, new job, and a new love.Throughout this journey, her journal faithfully captures the events that unfold and provides us with a ringside view of Geetanjali’s hopes, fears, discoveries and adventures that mirror so many of our own.Heartwarmingly funny and occasionally sad, this is a poignant story of a woman, who despite the risk involved, opens herself up to falling crazily in love.
