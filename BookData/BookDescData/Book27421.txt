The world is lying to you. Is that news? It must be very upsetting. Richard Fitcher found it upsetting.He’s a witch hunter who doesn’t believe in witches, and tonight he’s taking a reporter and her cameraman on a witch hunt. He’s all ready to jazz it up with spooky noises and a gimmicky magic ritual that locates witches. People like that kind of crap, right? But there’s a problem.It worked this time.So now Richard is forced to call up old knowledge and power he didn’t believe to be real, challenging things that crawled out of the pit, if he has any hope of surviving the night. But this loser might actually find some value—the pit does have a tendency to shave off your uneven edges—if it doesn’t kill you.Either way, it’s a lovely night for a witching.
