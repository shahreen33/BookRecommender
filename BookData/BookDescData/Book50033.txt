FayeI needed the money.My sister’s medical bills were mounting, and I needed lots of money—fast. The only thing I had was my virginity, and I knew just the place to sell it. I never expected to have the night of my life, but that’s what I did. I don’t know the name of the man who purchased me and helped me more than he can know. I only have the memories…ChaseI’ve never been interested in virgins. I prefer a woman who knows how to take care of my dick and not ask for direction, but one look at her and I knew there was no going back.For months after that night, I tried to find her, but I failed. So, when I discover she’s been working at my company for the past month, I know that’s going to change. She’s going to work right beside me, and I’m going to take what belongs to me. She was a virgin—and now she’s mine.We have unfinished business, and I don’t care what it takes to get her back in my bed. I never said I was a good guy when it came to getting what I wanted, but Faye has a way that drives me crazy. I can’t walk away from her because … I fucking love her.
