"I Can See Angels" is a delightful new collection of real-life angel encounters; fascinating and comforting, showing you that there is always an angel by your side. Read about: the grandma who attended her granddaughter's wedding - even after she'd 'passed away'!; the angel who saved three people from drowning - before mysteriously disappearing; the teenager who was dramatically rescued from a soon-to-be demolished building; and, the mysterious 'angel on a plane'.
