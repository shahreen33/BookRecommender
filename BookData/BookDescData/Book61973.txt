Americans’ confidence that their vote counts—and is correctly counted—relies on secure election systems. In recent years, American citizens have become increasingly uneasy concerning potential threats to the Nation's election infrastructure. Cyber intrusions to voting machines and voter registration systems diminish the overall public confidence that elected officials need to perform their public duties, and undermine the integrity of the Nation’s democratic process. If left unaddressed, system vulnerabilities will continue to threaten the stability of our Nation's democratic system.As the lead agency for securing the Nation's homeland, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a mission to maintain public trust and confidence in America’s election system. The department is working directly with election officials throughout the U.S. to help them protect election systems, by sharing timely and actionable threat information and offering cybersecurity services to safeguard their systems.
