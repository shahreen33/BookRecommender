The journey of Verity across the wonderfully altered landscape of mid-America began in Queen City Jazz: "A dizzying novel that takes full advantage of the creative potential of nanotech," said The New York Times. Now it continues down the river in Mississippi Blues. Verity takes the wildest cast of characters since Philip Jos√© Farmer's Riverworld, both living and resurrected, down the river to possible salvation in New Orleans and beyond in a great SF epic.
