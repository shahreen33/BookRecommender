I just keep making mistakes.  It was supposed to be an easy job. Steal a timepiece from Hook and in exchange, find out where my little sister is. But the hero isn't always the hero and sometimes the bad guy is the person you least expect.  Now I'm scrambling to get to Belle before she's gone forever, trying to repair the connection to my Lost Boys, dealing with a blackmailer, and oh, did I mention? I'm going to prom with Lucas Hook.  I'm Ever Darlington and yeah, things just got even more complicated.  Guilt, betrayal and lies continue in EVER FOUND, book 2 in the Lost Boys of Neverly Prep series, a dark and dirty fast build/medium burn contemporary RH academy romance based loosely on the characters from Peter Pan. Complete at 53,000 words. All the players are over 18 and there is another cliffhanger, but I promise it will be worth it!
