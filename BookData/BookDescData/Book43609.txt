More than eighty years after his death, Charlotte Montague has written an intriguing biography of the enigmatic author and, in the process, uncovered the mystery of the strange man behind the darkness—H. P. Lovecraft—the master of modern horror fiction. Part of the Oxford People series, this book dares you to explore the hidden secrets of your own imagination through the life of a man whose writing was inspired by nightmares. H. P. Lovecraft was virtually unknown during his lifetime and only published his stories in pulp magazines such as Weird Tales and Astounding Stories. He died a recluse in poverty and obscurity, aged just 46. Consumed with self-doubt, despair, and monstrous inner demons, his nightmares inhabit every page of his writing. H. P. Lovecraft and the universe he created are part of an astonishing cultural phenomenon. Lovecraft's reputation has been revived to the point of reverence, and he now occupies a position of great respect within American literature—as one of the most significant horror fiction writers of the twentieth century. His dark grotesque creations have inspired authors such as Stephen King and Clive Barker, as well as film directors John Carpenter, Sturart Gordon, and Roger Corman. Dark forbidden knowledge is always a central theme in Lovecraft's stories, with protagonists who dare to discover hidden secrets which, in the end, completely destroy them.Explore the depths of H. P. Lovecraft's own dark secrets, and discover some things about your own.
