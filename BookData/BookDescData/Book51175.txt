This book follows Then There Was You.  Love isn't always about timing.Sometimes you have to throw caution to the wind and roll with it. I admit I wasn't ready. I know you don't want to look at me, let alone talk to me, but please, let me explain.Let me tell you all the ways my heart broke when you walked away.Let me show you what our years apart have done to me.Give me a chance to find my way back to you . . .
