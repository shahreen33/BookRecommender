The "Shaman Fight in Tokyo" is approaching, and talent scouts are scouring the world for contestants. Who's doing the scouting? The Patch, the Native American people who have overseen the Shaman Fight since the dawn of time.

As shamans, wizards and holy folk gather for the preliminaries, Yoh finds himself matched up with his first real opponent, Horohoro - a powerful young shaman representing the oldest culture in Japan!
