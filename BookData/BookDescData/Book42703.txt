We all believe in death, but we don’t believe it will come for us. To face that truth head on, to be fearless in the face of mortality--our own and our beloveds'--is the job of the artist. But it’s a job many shy away from because it is the hardest of truths. Not Ally Malinenko. In FITTING THE OCEAN IN YOUR MOUTH, Malinenko faces both death and life and the space in between with grace and courage. And thank everything for that, because she allows all of us mortals to feel less alone. A cancer survivor, the daughter of a cancer survivor, a New Yorker who dies a little with each morning commute, Malinenko understands what E.B. White’s Charlotte the spider told us all along--we’re born, we live a while, we die. We are humble and radiant and temporary. This book is a courageous testimony to the power of the human spirit and the human heart. In a world that may make us feel hopeless, Malinenko offers us hope. Everything is temporary, yes, Malinenko tells us, but there is beauty still, if we reach for it and believe in it and sing it loud. There is always a tomorrow, however we imagine that.
