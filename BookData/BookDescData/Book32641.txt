Damselle has spent sixteen years terrorized by magical creatures and evil villains. She’s finished waiting for the next bad thing to happen or for arrogant knights to come to her rescue. And she’s really tired of being shunned as if her bad luck is contagious.After an fortunate fall down a wishing well, Damselle learns why trouble shadows her every step: her cursed name marks her forever a damsel in distress. To change her name, Damselle must find three items of vast magical power - and survive long enough to carry them through the forest.Though aided by her companions, Damselle's journey through the woods may be more distressing than even she dreamed. Because, in The Willowwax, a hydrophobic witch and a Society of Evil Stepmothers are the least of her concerns. And of course she'll have to shake the incompetent but persistent knight on her tail...DAMSELLE IN DISTRESS turns the typical "damsel in distress" story on its head, weaving elements of folktales, fairy tales, and mythology along the way. If you love tales of fantasy and lore - and love to see either fantastically fractured - this is the story for you.
