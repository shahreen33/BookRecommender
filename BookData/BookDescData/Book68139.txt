Lyssa had one job. Pretend to be her best friend's doting girlfriend during a visit with his reclusive, ex-military hero father, John. But who could have predicted she'd be instantly attracted to the intensely rugged mountain man? Or that, despite their age difference, he'd not only want Lyssa, too--forever--but would catch on to the ruse immediately?No way in hell Lyssa was his son's actual girlfriend. They weren't even convincing liars. Forcing them to admit the truth, however, could hurt his son and John refused to do that. One thing he couldn't refuse, though? His burning hunger for Lyssa. And if he wasn't mistaken, his son continued to create situations that left him and Lyssa alone. Not touching his golden beauty before the truth comes out might prove to be the one obstacle in John's life he isn't strong enough to overcome......and the result could be a wild, enduring love for the ages.
