What do the hot, genius entrepreneur and I have in common?  Absolutely nothing.  Taika Parata may be rich as hell, but he’s a total jerk. He spends his days traveling the globe in the lap of luxury, while I dreamed of leaving my tiny hometown for a nomadic life and never got further than Boston.  But when fate throws us together, our preconceptions are challenged and suddenly we both have an entirely new perception of the world… and each other.  NOTE: This is a 12K SHORT STORY that was first available as part of Volume 2 of the Heart2Heart charity anthology. No content has been changed or added. It has ties to the O'Leary universe, but can easily be read as a standalone.
