Twist legend into truth. Merlin's magic is not myth, but history. In a Regency era England influenced by Camelot and the Round Table, a girl with an impish streak finds trouble. Taken hostage by a smuggler, Martha Dunsmore is saved by an 'angel'. She finds him again at a country house party. Clandestine magician, espionage expert, heir to a duke, Brinston is the perennial hero--and Martha's angel. On a mission for the government, Brinston has no time for dalliance. Convincing Martha that espionage should be left to the male pushes his patience, if not his magic, to its limits. When he ignores her, she mocks and challenges him.Together they must trap a thief before madness becomes murder and treachery becomes treason.
