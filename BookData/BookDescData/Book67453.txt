My whole life was a lie. And just when things were looking up, everything came crashing down.I find myself a prisoner to someone unexpected, and then, I’m forced to fight.Fight or become a selected mate.Like hell I’ll roll over.But something’s wrong here, and I know I need to escape.Where even am I?What happened to my mates too? My fake father?Too many unanswered questions, my main focus is freedom.As I fight for my freedom, I make allies and discover new enemies as I embrace my true nature.No one can hold down Savage.Time to spill some blood.This is a fastburn RH.
