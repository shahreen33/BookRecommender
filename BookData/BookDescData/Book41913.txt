Whitney Gable is the kind of woman you fight to the death to protect.To keep.To cherish.I’ve finally learned my lesson, and it’s time to prove I’m the man who’s worthy of her.I don’t care what it takes, because failure is not an option.No matter who or what stands in our way—this time, she’ll be mine forever.
