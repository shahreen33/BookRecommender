I didn’t know darkness and evil lurked inside me until I had to murder in order to survive. Forced to become my own worst enemy. With so much blood on my hands, I was surprised I could still see my own skin.I killed.I tortured.I loved…I played God while I was rotting in Hell. Thriving on control and power was the only way I knew how to live. There were no other options.If you weren’t my friend, you were my foe.If you weren’t with me, you were against me.Traitors, as I called them. There were no imaginary lines. I’d crossed them all. No boundaries. No second chances. No redemption.Not for me.For them.For anyone.Only for her…She loved me. Always convinced I was a saint, never believing I was just another sinner.A fucking monster.Until it was too late.Except, I didn’t choose this life. It. Chose. Me.
