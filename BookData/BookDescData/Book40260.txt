What would you do if you had a time machine? Bet on sporting events? Assassinate all the evildoers of history? Or maybe try to fix all the mistakes and regrets that have haunted you all these years? Join Jess as she travels back in time to share her wisdom with her naive younger self, stand up to bullies who terrorized her child self, and teach her horny teenage self a thing or two! What begins as a raunchy adventure in teen wish fulfillment grows into a thoughtful story about memory, regret, and growing up. One time machine, one frustrated girl, one sexy futuristic jumpsuit... infinite possibilities!
