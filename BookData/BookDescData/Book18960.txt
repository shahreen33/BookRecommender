A THOUGHTFUL TRAVEL INTO THE SCIENCE FICTIONHow to write wild-eyed, overstuffed, multiplex, maximalist, recomplicated, high-bandwidth Science Fiction, or, “realize I don’t wanna be a miser/how come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser?”Don’t expect this book to be a traditional “How To”. It’s a travel into the Science Fiction.“Science fiction is the literature of ideas?Sure it is—on a tightly rationed basis!The truth is, most writers of science fiction and fantasy are naturally stingy.We tend to hoard ideas, like the dragon Smaug lying on his treasure. We parcel them out in dribs and drabs. One notion per story. Maybe two High Concepts per novel.Why do we do this?”
