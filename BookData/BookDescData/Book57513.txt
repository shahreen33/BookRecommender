Now that we live in a world that is more accepting than ever of “nontraditional” families, it’s time to create a literary space for this not-so-unique, shared but-completely-individual experience.In Raised by Unicorns: Stories from Children with LGBTQ+ Parents, Frank Lowe has carefully edited an anthology that reflects on the upbringing of children in all kinds of LGBTQ+ families. Rather than presenting a single account, it features many different stories to express the uniqueness of each family and of this shared experience. It’s visceral and raw, not always pretty, and not always glamorous, but love is always the common thread.Ultimately, Lowe portrays a true representation of this particular niche of the human experience―a snapshot of the time we are living in now. Raised by Unicorns guides the reader through an empathetic journey and is nothing short of compelling and poignant. We’ve all heard the phrase “raised by wolves”; now we have a window into the world of being “raised by unicorns.”
