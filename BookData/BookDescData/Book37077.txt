Little Karin is a vampire, but instead of needing to drink blood, she has an excess of blood that she must give to her victims. If done right, giving blood to her victim can be an extremely positive thing. The problem is that Karin never seems to do things right...As Karin and Kenta's official first date continues, Anju shows up to keep an eye on the clumsy couple. But when Kenta takes notice of her, he grabs Karin and ushers her off to the Ferris wheel. There he tells her how he really feels...but will this destroy their relationship?
