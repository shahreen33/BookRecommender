Also available in Arcanum Unbounded: The Cosmere Collection."This story was written specifically for the Mistborn Adventure Game, a tabletop RPG. Please keep in mind that the story was intended to help a GM bring his players up to speed on the world if they havenâ€™t read the books. There are a few goodies for those who want to know more about Kelsier, but this story is not meant to stand wholly on its own."~ Brandon Sanderson.
