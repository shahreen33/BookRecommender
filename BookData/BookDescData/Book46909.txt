When everything is easily crushable under well-meaning feet, how can a Humongo ever fit in in such a little world?From the creator of "The Night of the Living Dead" and the Zombie movement that permeates our culture today, comes a sarcastic and cynical children's tale of different creatures trying to coexist in a benign, yet power-hungry environment. In line with Antoine de Saint-Exupery’s Little Prince, The Little World of Humongo Bongo is a beautiful metaphor on the evolution of our civilization, depicted with humour and simplicity.Featuring illustrations by Romero himself, welcome to a zany little world captured by the lens of one of the world’s visionary film creators.
