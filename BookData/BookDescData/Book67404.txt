 Evanescent: fleeting or over quickly.  Such as one’s time at Liminal Academy. At this crash-course school, students learn how to be human and prepare for their purpose within the earthly realm. . .Unless you’re a sh*t-stirring succubus with a personal agenda.Then the academy becomes your playground.So drop on in.  The first trimester is now in session.*****************Excerpt:“Humans do not stare at other human’s buttocks,” he reprimands.His overly correct speech and uptight demeanor make me want to ruffle his feathers further.  He opens the door and steps back to allow me through.  Another humanism, being a gentleman, but I am far from being a lady.  I lightly trail my fingers over the zipper of his slacks as I enter the room.His breath sucks in and I feel the angry heat of his glare.And his lust.I can always feel someone’s lust.Especially when it’s coupled with forbidden undertones and nothing is more forbidden then someone like myself.
  I am the taboo.
*****************Liminal Academy is a three -book reverse harem series that will chronicle the story of Lilith and Chiron, originally seen in The Afflicted Zodiac, but also will introduce new, sexy characters.  It is not required to read The Afflicted Zodiac to read those in this series.  Evanescent (Liminal Academy 1) is RH, fast-burn, and contains language and scenes for readers 18+.  It will end with ‘to be continued’, but consequent books are quick to follow.
