  Two funny, unlikely friends--a thoughtful sloth and an impatient fox--make their big debut in this hilarious new picture book celebrating friendship and the wonderful ways in which we're all different.
Best friends Jasper and Ollie decide to go to the pool. On your mark, get set . . . WAIT! As Jasper races ahead--crashing into the mailman, speeding past the ice cream truck--Ollie takes his sweet time, pausing to admire a butterfly, smell a daisy, and help the mailman pick up his letters!With a clever design that shows Jasper's hectic rush compared with Ollie's casual stroll, this hilarious story allows young readers to easily recognize the differences between the two pals. It's a smartly paced, hugely funny celebration of what makes each person special. Kids AND grown-ups will giggle as they decide if they're more of a "Jasper" or an "Ollie." It's also a great story to share the concept of "taking time to smell the roses"--a perfect lesson in our overly scheduled world.And look for book two from this exciting new author-illustrator, coming in summer 2020: Jasper &amp; Ollie Build a Fort.Critics love Jasper &amp; Ollie!: "A hilarious and lively romp that sneaks in a message about the importance of patience and will have its readers hoping for some follow-up adventures of the 'odd couple' friends."--School Library Journal"Forget the tortoise and the hare, this tale of friendship between an unhurried sloth and a wild fox is a funnier version of those famous opposites, and one that will have kids wondering whether they're more like the deliberate Ollie or the frenetic Jasper."--ReadBrightly.comChildren's Book Council "Hot Off the Press" selection
