Running is America’s most popular participatory sport, yet more than half of those who identify as runners get injured every year. Falling prey to injuries from overtraining, faulty form, poor eating, and improper footwear, many runners eventually, and reluctantly, abandon the sport for a less strenuous pastime. But for the first time in the United States, Hiroaki Tanaka’s Slow Jogging demonstrates that there is an efficient, healthier, and pain-free approach to running for all ages and lifestyles.Tanaka’s method of easy running, or “slow jogging,” is an injury-free approach to running that helps participants burn calories, lose weight, and even reverse the effects of Type-2 diabetes.
