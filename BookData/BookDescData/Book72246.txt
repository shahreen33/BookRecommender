The kindred spirit / doppelgänger / protégé of "Hideous Exuberance". Incorporates non-linear plots, comical rants, unsettling inner monologues; stream of consciousness dream sequences, surrealistic scenarios and time-traveling characters. Revel in the chaotic confusion of sociopathic celebrities, suburban swingers, suicidal trust fund girls, decadent jet setters; medieval princesses, "Evilangelists", D-list standup comics and disreputable, vindictive lost souls that search in vain for metaphysical clarity.Please refer to the Blog Posting on the Stephen C.
