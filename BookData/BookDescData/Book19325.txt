Drawn from material written over a span of 12 years, this collection has been a labor of love. 128 form and free verse poems dance together through a variety of topics, themes and styles. Each poem has been selected for its strong visual presentation, an element of timelessness and one or more of the following: potent metaphor or allegory, intricate yet tastefully evasive abstraction, a concrete storylineâ€”real or imagined.
