He's the ultimate fantasy crush. You've seen him on the big screen - the 'fantasy' man you cheat on your husband with; the man you never expect to meetâ€¦ But what if you did? Perfect Plans, the first of a two-part series, takes you through this possibility.Every woman fantasizes about 'what if' at some point in her marriage; lost in dreams of something MORE. Abigail Ryan takes a leap that most women would envy. Abandoning her seemingly perfect life in Canada, she moves to London, England, and falls into the lap of Alexander Tate - every woman's fantasy crush. Her perfect plan unfolds to a world where reality meets dreams, and dreams meet reality; throwing her into a tail-spin of self-doubt and public scrutiny. Alex Tate wants nothing more than to escape the dream-world in which he lives; his desire for love, marriage and family, with all of its real-world normalcy out of his world-famous reach. Aby and Alex face the obstacles of their own realities, now intertwined, before succumbing to their questionable fates. Are you ready to fall into your fantasy, when reality lurks right outside the door?
