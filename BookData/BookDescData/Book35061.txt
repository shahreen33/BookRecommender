Charlie is the laid-back captain of the basketball team. Nate is the neurotic, scheming president of the robotics club.

At stake? Student group funding that will either cover a robotics competition or new cheerleading uniforms--but not both. Bad sportsmanship? Sure.Chainsaws? Why not.Running away from home on Thanksgiving? Nothing can possibly go wrong.
