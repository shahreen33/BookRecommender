“In another life, she was my forever.” An unexpected tragedy leaves Professor Nathaniel Hunt a widower alone with a newborn baby. He hires a nanny. She’s young, but well-qualified, with a simple life, a crazy name obsession, and a boyfriend she met at the grocery store. Over time, he discovers she knows things about him—things that happened before she was born—like a hidden scar on his head, his favorite pizza, and how he cheated on a high school Spanish test. She speaks familiar words and shares haunting memories that take him back to over two decades earlier when he lost his best friend in a tragic accident. “I’m afraid of what’s going to happen when you realize I’m not her.”Transcend is a sexy, mind-bending journey that uncovers possibilities, challenges beliefs, and begets the age-old question: is there life after death?Subscribe
