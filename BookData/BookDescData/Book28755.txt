Winner of Library Media Connection Editors' Choice Award. "I was howling with laughter!" --Jeff CrosbyDo you dread sitting down with a book? We do, too. That's why we wrote this--a book for kids who don't like to read. If someone's bugging you to open a book, grab this one. Once you start flipping through the pages, you'll probably start laughing. Things always seem to go by faster when you're laughing. In this book, you'll find out how the Bacon brothers get through their 20-minute reading requirement without really reading. Tips range from practical (bathroom reading), to gross (bloody noses), to outrageous (man-eating monsters). You'll also learn what to do when someone makes you read on vacation and how to deal with the kids in your class who actually like to read. This book is full of easy words. And if you come across a word you don't know, you can just skip it. Really, you won't miss any of the good parts. We know, sitting down with any book, including this one, isn't the same as playing outside, or singing, or building a pillow fort, or even washing the car. But if you have to read, you may as well pick a book written by people who feel the same way you do. Try it. Pretty soon you may be surprised you've actually finished a book!
