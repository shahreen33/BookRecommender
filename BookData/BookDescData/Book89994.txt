Would the new man be good enough to evade his chosen killer? Which made for fascinating and exciting viewing, compelling enough to distract the public’s attention while the Big Five industrial complexes ran the world. Then, in 2203, with the choice of a member of a maverick cult as Quizmaster, the system developed a little hitch…Solar Lottery was Philip K. Dick’s first published novel, brilliant and idiosyncratic, powerful and affecting.
