Maeve Oâ€™Brien and Jenna Branson anticipate a relaxing, fun filled weekend with their two children at an annual music festival in the Nevada County Fairgrounds. Instead, they fall victim to an unforeseen chain of circumstance that threatens to tear apart the very essence of their family unit. This unfortunate series of events brings together a host of characters whose lives are forever changed: a birth mother who tries to illegally reclaim her son, the questionable ethics of a psychiatrist, the desperate search for an amnestic woman, and more. By the time the last domino falls and the dust clears, nothing will ever be the same.
