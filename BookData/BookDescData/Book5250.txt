What happens when a 35 year-old soccer mom from Indianapolis, Indiana sends her only child off to college and suddenly discovers that she has no identify of her own?That's exactly what happened to Samantha (Sammie) Dennison. Her marriage was loveless from the start; her 'mannequin' husband has his own agenda which has never included her, and she feels lonely, ignored and downright frumpy.Her best friend tells her to get a life, and that's exactly what Sammie does, starting with a Kickboxing/Pilates class to get into shape, and then continuing her regiment by signing up for pole-dance lessons. Sammie graduates at the top of her class, and ultimately ends up with a secret career as a pole dancer at a Gentleman's Club in Indy called 'Jewels.'Known only by her dancer name, "Diamond," she is well on her way to finally carving out a secret life and identity all of her own that brings excitement and mystery to her otherwise mundane existence. The thrill of the dance and sexuality she discovers within herself is a potent mixture, but it's all about the dance with Sammie.That is, until bad-boy biker Slate enters the picture. He is the ultimate 'alpha' male and quickly draws the attention of the dancers - including Sammie. Slate is a 'prospect' for the notorious Outlaw Motorcycle Club, but he is also inexplicably drawn to "Diamond." Sammie is totally out of her league with Slate and the dangerous people he associates with in Indianapolis during the summer of 2012.No spoilers here, but something BIG is brewing in Indy; and it ain't about race cars either.
