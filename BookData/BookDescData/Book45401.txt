Fluffy Vandermere, the cat sergeant in charge of P.U.R.S.T. (Pets of the Universe Ready for Space Travel), works tirelessly to protect the world from alien (aka bug) domination. It's a big job. ?The whole planet is Fluffy's space station. All the people in the world are his humans. And every space pet out there is his responsibility.? Now, suddenly and without warning, Fluffy discovers P.U.R.S.T. headquarters, the most secure building in the world, is under attack by an angry swarm of insects, and they're armed with every cat's worst nightmare --- spray bottles! Warding off this level of terrifying invasion will require cunning, skill, ingenuity and the ability to move quickly. Fluffy's been out of the field and at his desk job for quite some time now --- is he up to this massive challenge? You bet he is! This hysterical graphic novel by talented artist Ashley Spires is a spin-off from her successful Binky Adventure series (Binky is a member of P.U.R.S.T.). Just as in the Binky books, dry wit and slapstick humor abound here as the animals oh-so-seriously go about their jobs --- with the occasional bathroom break, of course. The artwork, presented in many images per page, deftly conveys loads of action, emotional drama and physical comedy. This is a perfect book for emerging readers who are looking for something more challenging than a picture book that doesn't have too much text. The irresistible Fluffy also does a terrific job of showcasing lessons on the character attributes of individual responsibility, determination and courage.
