"my name is tookie" Tookie, now fifteen-years-old, shares her nightmarish memories as a survivor of unspeakable and depraved atrocities committed by the very organization and people who were in charge of her protection in this dark-fiction, tell-all novella. Lost in a corrupt 'system,' Tookie suffered mind-blowing abuse that would cripple any child. Although it's devastating to read about these horrific crimes, Tookie's inspiring hard-won recovery, and the devotion of her loving grandmother, are breathtaking in this "based-in-part-on-a-true-story" novella.Â
