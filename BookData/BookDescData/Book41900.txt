This Christmas, I’ll be getting a visit from a man in a suit, only it won’t be Santa. Let me first say: Reed York was never my boyfriend. He was the pen. I was the company ink. Though if you want to get technical, we were more like colleagues-who-hated-each-other … with benefits. Everything was fine until the charming jerk went behind my back, stole my promotion, and became my boss—literally overnight. Refusing to work beneath him (professionally speaking and otherwise), I transferred 2,014 miles away to our Chicago division, and I’ve spent the past year trying to remember how much I hated his panty-melting smirk so I can forget how much I secretly loved the way his ocean eyes lit every time I walked into the room. But he’s just announced a last-minute site visit the week between Christmas and New Year’s Day, and on top of that, he’s audaciously designated me as his ‘right hand gal’ during his visit. If he thinks he has a snowball’s chance in this hell at getting back in my good graces, he’s got another thing coming. Reed York might be a man used to getting everything he’s ever wanted, but Joa Jolivet is a woman that never forgets. He can put me on his Christmas list all he wants, but everyone knows naughty boys only get coal.
