Mary’s kids, Ben and Cathy, are visiting Dune House, the majestic Bed and Breakfast by the sea, and Mary and Suzie could not be more excited. Mary is planning a fun-filled week catching up with them.  But her plans are turned upside down when a guest at Dune House turns up dead. Ben is a suspect and Suzie and Mary feel like they have no choice but to investigate the murder and try to clear his name. But things get even more complicated when the evidence indicates that Cathy’s new boyfriend, Rick, might be involved.  Is Rick there to meet Mary and spend time with Cathy or is it all an elaborate ruse? Is Mary wearing rose-colored glasses and Ben really was involved? Will Suzie and Mary find the murderer before there is another victim?
