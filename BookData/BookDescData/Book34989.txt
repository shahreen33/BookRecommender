For several weeks, Jason Luke appeared on Facebook pages from around the globe and wrote live scenes based on the suggestions of readers.It was a fun, and grueling challenge. Hundreds and hundreds of readers posted brilliant suggestions, asking him to write scenes that used characters from his book, ‘Interview with a Master’.Most of the scenes involve the main characters, Jonah and Leticia, but the other characters in the book also make an appearance… and in several of the scenes, Jason actually appears- interacting with the fictional characters he created!At the end of the book are 30 brand new scenes that he wrote after the Tour with suggestions from his readers on his Facebook page. These are scenes that no one has read before now.These paragraphs were not written as excerpts from the upcoming sequel. They are stand-alone scenes that have a life of their own, and are not part of any future book. Enjoy!SPOILER WARNING: There are many spoilers in this book as it was intended to be read after reading Interview with a Master.
