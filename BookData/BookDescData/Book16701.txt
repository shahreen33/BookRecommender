In the year 2220, only about 15% of Earth's population have survived and thrived after the Nuclear Disaster of 2020. With the collapse of modern society, the population has regressed into eight clans. Amongst these clans, an unusual girl grows from child to adult. Raised on the run and in hiding, Shilo wants to be free of the expectations of women. But in a ruined world where anyone could be an enemy, only the radiation-twisted mutants are clearly identifiable. A fertile female is a precious treasure, and any lapse in caution can mean a loss of the freedom she longs for. Training as hard as a soldier would, in order to free herself from social constraints, she finds herself faced with an offer from a new clan--an offer that provides her with what she desires. But her recently found independence brings discovery, and discovery brings two very different men from her pastâ€”and each of them is determined to claim her. One is obsessed with owning her, the other desires her as the only person who can make him love again.
