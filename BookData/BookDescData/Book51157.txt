 One handywoman.One single dad.One set of twins.And the wall isn't the only thing being drilled...I learned the hard way that being a handywoman isn't easy. The questions, the stares--the assumption I'm the proud owner of a cock and balls. Not that it matters. I've proven over and over that I'm ready for anything the judgmental asses throw at me. Except the hot, single dad of twins who just moved to town. Brantley Cooper gets the shock of his life when I show up on his doorstep to fix up his kids' new rooms. His son is confused why 'the pretty lady has a drill,' and his daughter has a new obsession--me. On paper, my job is easy. Go in, do their bedrooms, and leave. In theory, I'm spending eight hours a day with a guarded, sexy as hell guy, and I'm staying for dinner more often than I'm eating it alone, on my couch, with Friends re-runs. I shouldn't be staying for dinner. I shouldn't be helping him out with the twins. I shouldn't be falling in love with tiny toes and dimpled cheeks. And I most definitely should not be kissing my client.Oops...---
