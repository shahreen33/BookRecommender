“Selling with EASE will help you close more deals, advance your career and build your income.” JEB BLOUNT - Bestselling Author of Fanatical Prospecting and People Buy You There are 4 distinct steps to every business transaction employed by all successful salespeople – and it’s the understanding and execution of those 4 steps that separates the elite from the rest of the pack. Why do we all find it so difficult to recall more than one or two occasions when we felt that we were treated exceptionally by the salesperson who dealt with us? Is it that the majority of those salespeople knew the four steps but chose not to make use of them? Or maybe common (sales) sense isn’t quite as common as many people like to pretend it is. If that’s the case, then it’s probably time for this information to be broken down, simplified and re-explained – so that it can be implemented effectively by all those who find themselves at the frontline. If you want genuine sales and business success that (as an added bonus) leads to satisfied customers who would happily recommend you and then come back for more – then you really need to read this book.
