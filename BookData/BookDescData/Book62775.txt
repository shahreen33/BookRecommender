And last time I got with a bad boy, it ended with me pointing a gun and pulling the trigger.Talk about going out with a bang.Jimmy makes me want things I shouldn’t want, which means I have two options: avoid him or piss him off. But no matter what I do he isn't fazed, and I'm quickly realizing there's more to Jimmy than I originally thought.JIMMYOver the past year, I’ve been called a lot of things. Slacker. Troublemaker. Party animal.I thought I was on top of the world.

Rules aren't exactly my forte, but I only plan on breaking one of them.I want to get back to being one of the good guys.Although Dropout is the third book in the Good Guys series, it can be enjoyed as a standalone.
