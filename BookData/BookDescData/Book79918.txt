Everyone knows that chameleons are the best at fitting in. But Leon is an exception. Leon is neon! In fact, he's so bright that he keeps all the other chameleons awake at night. Poor Leon is lonely, so he goes off in search of somewhere he won't be a nuisance. In this delightful interactive book filled with vibrant neon artwork, children can help Leon on his journey by counting his steps, sending him to sleep, and giving him lots of reassurance when he's feeling down. But will he ever find a place where he can fit in?
