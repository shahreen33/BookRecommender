I’ve been obsessed with Ruby since the day I saw her.I’m rough, rugged, and damaged. Ever since I got out of the Marines, all I’ve wanted is to be left alone on my mountain.Then, she walked into my bar, ordered a cheeseburger and a cherry coke, and before she took a single bite I was in love. Smitten. Completely obsessed with this beautiful, innocent girl.But I’m not the only one who’s noticed her. My bar’s also the meeting spot for the Iron Diablos MC -- and I’m the only man around here who’ll stand up to them. And I’ll do anything to protect Ruby and make her mine.Anything.
