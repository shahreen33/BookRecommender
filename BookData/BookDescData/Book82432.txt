Chelsea didn’t try to teleport. But after accidentally teleporting onto classified Navy vessel SeaSatellite5, all she’s rocking is the boat.  Trevor didn’t believe Chelsea had teleported on board. The same girl who’d given him a brief lifeline to sanity three months ago literally fell from the sky, under a mile of ocean, directly to him. But Trevor’s happiness at seeing her is cut short by a centuries-long family grudge. Chelsea is Atlantean, which would be totally fine if Trevor’s family weren’t Lemurian, the enemies of Atlantis. But Trevor wants no part of his family’s war. The only thing he wants is Chelsea, Atlantean or not.  But when SeaSatellite5 uncovers Atlantean ruins, placing the entire crew in the crosshairs of an ancient war, Trevor will have to come clean about his heritage to Chelsea and the US Navy. There are those who want the Atlantean artifacts inside the ruins, and only Trevor knows the relics for what they really are: Link Pieces, tools used by the ancient civilizations for their time-travel war.  With lies and shifting alliances abound, Chelsea and Trevor must think fast to save SeaSatellite5. If they don’t, the Lemurians will do whatever necessary to seize the artifacts and Atlantis will be destroyed forever.
