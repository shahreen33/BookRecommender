The third part of the laugh-out-loud sci-fi adventure series from the author critics are calling 'the new Douglas Adams.'  Cal Carver, petty-criminal turned space adventurer, is on a suicide mission - and he really hates suicide missions. But this time its to save his best buddy, Splurt, who has been taken prisoner by the evil Zertex corporation.  When they discover that the ship carrying Splurt never made it to Zertex, their search leads them through a wormhole to a mysterious planet unlike any they have seen before. Will they survive this strange new world and finally find their friend? And, more importantly, does he even want to be found?  Packed with gladiator battles, angry bees, a big thing blowing up, and the return of the galaxy's oldest assassin, Space Team: The Search for Splurt is the rip-roaring conclusion to the first Space Team trilogy.
