Haydan Walker is perfectly content as the only remaining bachelor in the Ashe Crew. Sure, his crew seems happy, but his bear is different and has no urge to find a mate. So when one of the Gray Backs begs him to claim his sister, Haydan’s instinct is to run as far away as he can. Cassie Belle isn’t taking no for an answer, though, and Haydan is about to find out the little sexy-as-hell, smart-mouthed hellion is toting some serious baggage.  Cassie is no pushover. She knows what she wants, and she patiently hunts until she gets it. And right now, she wants Haydan to claim her so she’ll be under the protection of the giant, tatted-up, steely-eyed bad boy bear shifter. She’ll be the perfect mate—friends with benefits—and she’ll be sure to leave her emotions at the door. It’s a solid plan until Haydan shows her how different life could be if she’d only let someone in.  Change is hard, and facing her past even harder, but if she can allow Haydan to help, Cassie just might find the sanctuary she’s been searching for.
