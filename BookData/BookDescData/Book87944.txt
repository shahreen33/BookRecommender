AVA has been suffering from sexual dysfunction for years. Tired of not being able to have a normal relationship with a man, she is steered in the direction of DR. CHASE HUDSON, a psychologist and sexual surrogate.  When she signed up for her sessions, she wasn't prepared for his god-like good looks or her instant, intense, and growing connection with him.  But as things heat up... and professional lines get blurred, she is forced to confront the question: What are you supposed to do when you start falling for your sex surrogate?* There will be a companion novella from Chase's POV due out this winter with an extended epilogue. Stay tuned. *Expanded/revised edition November 2015* For possible triggers, go here: http://www.jessicagadziala.com/trigge... *
