The six little ninjas of Dojo Daycare and Dojo Daytrip are back for a third adventure—this time, planning a surprise birthday party for their master. Stealthy as ever, the ninja girls and ninja boys tiptoe around without a noise (or so they think) as they prepare for the celebration. Meanwhile, the master is spooked by the noises and shadows he senses around him. Is there a dragon over there? It’s a total dojo scare! Master must be more aware. He tells himself: If I use my ears and eyes, I won’t be taken by—SURPRISE! Master gasps, then laughs and cries. He can’t believe his ninja eyes! Streamers, poppers, candles, cake—he’s delighted by the party and by the thoughtfulness of his little ninja charges. There’s even a gift: a dragon-in-the-box who pops out for one last scream.Chris Tougas’s digitally rendered ninjas pop off the page once again in this laugh-out-loud story. Told in rhyming verse with a playful rhythm, accompanied by hilarious illustrations and big sound effects, Dojo Surprise makes for a riotous read-aloud with a kindhearted message.LEVELINGGrade Range: PreK–3Fountas &amp; Pinnell: JReading Recovery: 17Lexile: AD 540LCOMMON CORERF.1.2,3,3a,3c,3f,4,4a,4b,4cSL.1.1,1a,1b,1c,2,3,4,5,6L.1.2,2d,2e,4,4a,4c,5,5c,5d,6RL.1.1,2,3,4,6,7,9,10W.1.3,5,6,7,8
