Elyza Leigh, young, impulsive, and pretty, borrows boys' clothes and runs away from her chaperone in London, an unsuccessful Season, and an offer of a dreary marriage. At a country inn she fortunately encounters Clive Redmayne - her purse has been stolen. He pays her bill and gives her a seat in his travelling coach. Handsome and rich, he has just returned from India. After a duel, a kidnapping, and a hectic road chase, people and proposals are happily disentangled.
