Cop-shapeshifter Tessa Holly won't ever grow old. Descended from Ireland's fairy race, the Tuatha de Danann (Clan of Danu), she'll enjoy long life and spectacular abilities. This legacy comes with a price: Her life will never be her own. Tessa's Clan will choose her friends, career and husband. But when her brother and a human girl fall prey to enemy Formorians bent on stealing Danann longevity, the Clan goes silent. To rescue the captives, Tessa must rely on a man no one trusts as her guide through cairns, castles and cathedrals in search of her people's greatest treasures. Along the way, she discovers a power greater than any she's known. If she uses it during the final, crucial battle with Formorians, will she save-or destroy-her people?"
