Autumn is stuck in a rut. She's been on many first dates but is beginning to wonder if she'll ever experience happiness -- or a second date, for that matter.  When she gets a new phone, she receives a call from an "Unknown Number." The person's first words are, "So. You were going to tell me how wet you are." Autumn is stunned -- because the caller happens to be a woman.  Over the next few months, the mysterious calls continue, and the "girl talk" gets more and more personal.  But Autumn is straight . . . isn't she?
