When writer, comedian and Red Dwarf actor Robert Llewellyn's son scrawled a picture of him at Christmas and titled it 'Some Old Bloke', Robert was cast deep into thought about life and what it means to be a bloke and an old one at that.In this lighthearted, revealing and occasionally philosophical autobiography, we take a meandering route through Robert's life and career: from the sensitive young boy at odds with his ex-military father, through his stint as a hippy and his years of arrested development in the world of fringe comedy, all the way up to the full-body medicals and hard-earned insights of middle age.Whether he is waxing lyrical about fresh laundry, making an impassioned case for the importance of alternative energy or recounting a detailed history of the dogs in his life, Robert presents a refreshingly open and un-cynical look at the world at large and, of course, the joys of being a bloke.
