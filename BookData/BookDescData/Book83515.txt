After an upheaval, you must face what seems impossible: continuing your life. Artie Van Why found himself in that situation after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and he recalls his experiences as a survivor and witness of that day in this memoir. Van Why also looks back at what brought him to New York, including his struggle with his sexuality and spirituality. He shares these personal details because as you read about him standing in front of the burning towers, it�s important to understand the person he was on that day, what he�d been through, what he�d endured, and what he�d overcome. Finally, in what were originally Huffington Post blogs, Van Why shares what his life has been like since 9/11, including how he�s coped with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and all the other manifestations of grief, mourning, and sadness that can be applied to any life-altering experience.
