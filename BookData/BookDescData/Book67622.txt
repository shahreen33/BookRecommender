  Theo Cruz, a New York man known for his family’s billion-dollar empire, Cruz Enterprises, has been indicted this afternoon in the Court of Public Opinion on charges of Bro-Code Conspiracy.  Chief counsel for the prosecution, Caplin Hawkins, spoke candidly about the accusation. “Once thought of as a best friend to many—including myself—Theo Cruz has officially turned his back on human decency. He’s conniving and dishonest, and a habitual offender of Bro-Code Law 676. He’ll rue the day he forgot that you never—under any circumstances—get involved with your best friend’s little sister.” 
  Fact: I haven’t actually been arrested or indicted. More important fact: I inadvertently messed up—big-time.  Two strangers in a foreign country, we said hello. Hello turned into a kiss. A kiss turned into a rendezvous. And a rendezvous turned into more than I’d ever imagined.  But her unruly golden curls and beautiful body hid an important detail—She’s my mouthiest billionaire best friend’s forbidden little sister.  Fact: I knew not of my crimes. More important fact: I know now, but even though I know I’m playing with fire, there’s no way I’m stopping. I can’t leave her alone.  Question: What do you do when you fall for your best friend’s little sister? More important question: How long can you keep it a secret before it all goes up in flames?  Disclaimer: The Billionaire’s Forbidden Little Sister is a romantic comedy, NOT a taboo romance. We repeat: It is NOT about a billionaire canoodling with his own sister. However, if you find yourself wishing it were, we suggest switching around some names to make it so. We can’t guarantee it won’t be confusing at times, but who knows? It could be just what your doctor ordered.
