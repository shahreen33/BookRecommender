Share the joys of yoga—and increase the benefits. The familiar postures of Hatha Yoga have renewed power and effectiveness when partners work together. Though all the asanas are touched upon, this comprehensive holistic program charts new ground in looking at a joint practice. There are creative interpretations for two of yogic breathing, symbolic hand gestures, mantras, and vinyasas—those special, flowing sequences of poses. For a restorative and healing workout, one person goes into repose while the other applies leans, stretches, twists, and compressions. Special advice on the art of partnering reveals how to create a positive, safe, and nurturing environment. In all the exchanges, the mutual support helps both people work better and improve alignment. Special black and white symbols representing each partner make directions easy to follow.
