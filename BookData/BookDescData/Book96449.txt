Alana Warren has her entire life planned out. She’s making big changes and going after the future she wants, but one thing she doesn’t plan on is the tatted up bad-boy bear shifter who saunters into her coffee shop. The constant snarl in his throat says something is wrong with that man, but for some reason, she can’t get him out of her head. A couple of chance encounters with him have her questioning her entire future. Alana is a good girl and proud, but little by little, Aaron Keller is bringing out her wild side.

He’s not the mating kind, but one look at the curvy beauty in the local coffee shop and his animal is thinking it’s time to settle his wild ways. But between finding his place in his new Bloodrunner Crew, his new job with the fire department, and brawling with one seriously nasty coven of vampires, his life is complete chaos. Too bad his timing with the sexy good-girl, Alana, has the potential to wreck her entire future. And now Aaron must decide whether to cut her loose to keep her safe, or bring her close and expose the woman he’s falling for to all the dangers of his life.
