”Shane is my stepbrother; he's family and strictly off-limits.”  Shane Prescott is a fun-loving omega with a knack for landing in trouble. He prides himself on efficiently running the waitstaff at his brother’s restaurant, Kamasouptra. Between his brother-slash-bestie, Keith, and his dog, Rocky, Shane doesn’t need anything else to make him happy. Love would be nice, but that ship sailed the day his mom married Keith’s dad.  Keith Anderson is focused on two things: making Kamasouptra the premiere place to dine in Hollydale and not giving into his feelings for his stepbrother. For the past several years, his life has been running smoothly to the point of being in rut. Keith’s life begins to change when an offbeat old lady befriends him and starts to make Keith think that it’s time to alpha up and chase what he really wants.  Between a smarmy food critic, April Fools pranks gone wrong, and two helpful old coots who dispense their unsolicited folksy wisdom to the brothers—you’ll be in stitches as you root for a pair of men who are so busy trying to follow societal expectations that they’re oblivious to the clear signs that maybe… just maybe… they were never meant to have a brotherly relationship in the first place. Things are about to change in major ways for this pair of stepbrothers, if they can just be brave enough to take a chance for happiness.  Return to the world of Hollydale with a quirky romance full of all the fluffy feels that you’d expect from a Hollydale novella. This is the eleventh book of The Hollydale Omegas series but is absolutely able to be read as a standalone. This is a 32k novella and definitely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.
