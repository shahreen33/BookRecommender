The West Marin Review, an award-winning literary and art journal, offers a cornucopia of delights from new and well-published writers, artists, and sometimes composers. The journal provides a blend of fiction and essays, humor, nature, memoir, poetry, art, and music. Contributors are from urban and rural places near and farâ€”locals in the rural enclave of West Marin, visitors who reside in Paris, and others in between occupy these pages. Volume 5 features Burt Bacharach, Peter Coyote, Howard Norman, Linda Pastan, Susan Trott, and Barbara Vos.
