The key to having a positive, happy, faith-filled day is to start each morning setting your mind in the right direction. It's easy to lie in bed thinking: "I don't feel like going to work. I don't want to deal with these children. I didn't exercise yesterday." We don't realize it, but that's setting the tone for a lousy day. If you don't intentionally set the tone for the day, negative thoughts will set it for you. WAKE UP TO HOPE will help you begin each morning grateful, thinking about God's goodness, expecting His favor, and laying the foundation for a blessed, productive day.
