I assumed I was human.I assumed wrong.I dream of death and warm blood on my hands. I dream of the day I burn the world to the ground. I dream of the dayI will finally die.Running is something my mother taught me to do very well. I never knew why until the night I cause an earthquake and meet Isaiah. My shadow. My protector. My other half. I need him. I need his blood. He is the only one who can keep me hidden from the man who created me. The man who createdthe monster.The world is depending on me not to fall in love. But what happens when the temptation becomes too great and falling is my only option? Can I live knowing I will destroy the world because his touch is the only thing keeping me alive?And how can I trust someone as lost as I am?Touch Passion. Touch Power. Touch Smoke!
