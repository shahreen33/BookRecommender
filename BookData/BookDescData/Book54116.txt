I sacrificed everything for my family. It wasn't enough. I lost my mother, and now I'm about to lose my brother.I've got only one thing left to gamble: my life. Which is why I'm willing to play Euphoria Online in Death March mode.If I survive six months in-game against a lethal array of wyverns, ogres, necromancers, and more, I'll earn my brother a pardon.If I lose?Well. I'm done with losing.
