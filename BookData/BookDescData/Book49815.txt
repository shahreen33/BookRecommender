Have you ever wondered about how life would have been "if"? Have you ever wondered about what would have happened "if" you had done something different? Did you think that what was in your imagination never matched your reality? Have you known children that seemed to have been in tune with you before you could speak? Is there anyway for you to understand the far-reaching consequences of one small choice? This book provides a way to see how choices from centuries ago affect family dynamics in the present, and how they influence children for their futures.
