An abandoned Egyptian goddess follows her visions to Ireland, and finds more than she ever bargained for... Bat Sitru used to be a goddess. Well, technically she still is. But with no followers, no temples, and only the overly mischievous cat-goddess Bastet as a friend, it's difficult to lay claim to the title. When her visions—once faded—return to her, they point to a land in the north, one of green slopes, mist, and rainbows. She is shown a hope for comfort and home, something that has long been missing from her existence. Once there, she begins to wonder if her visions have led her wrong. She's cold, damp, and her new landlords, the O’Loinsigh brothers, are not particularly welcoming. On top of that, she is confronted by a dead leprechaun on the rear stoop, a dagger that sucks the life of immortals, and territorial gods. As past secrets collides with the present, will Bat be able to carve a place for herself in this new land? Or will this goddess be forgotten once more?  Please note: A previous, and shorter, version of this story was released in the anthology Shamrocked. This is also a slow-burn RH.
