1963 Mexico, Maine:  The Wood family is much like its close, Catholic, immigrant neighbors, all dependent on the fathers' wages from the Oxford Paper Company.  Until the sudden death of Dad, when this family of now-only-women (Monica is one of four daughters) is set adrift.  Incandescent, funny, and to-the-bone moving, When We Were the Kennedys is the story of how a family saves itself--first by depending on Father Bob, youngest brother of Monica's mother, a Catholic priest who feels his new family responsibilities deeply.  And then, as the nation is shocked by the loss of its handsome Catholic president, Jackie Kennedy's televised grace restores the Woods--who are now strong enough themselves to stage an unprecedented family roadtrip to Washington, DC, to save Father Bob from his own griefs.
