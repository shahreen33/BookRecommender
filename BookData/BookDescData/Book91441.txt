Starting a new job - or a new life - is never easy.  Tina White, the new resident witch in Western Woods, is just starting to settle into a routine when it's all blown right to bits. Sara, her roommate, has finally gotten a job. But when her new boss literally dies on her, Sara is petrified that she's not only going to lose her job, but that she's going to end up in jail.  Promising Sara that they're not going to let that happen, Tina joins her other roommates in working to clear Sara's name. But between trying to solve the murder, working with Amy to figure out what coven she's from and organizing a party to try and get different species of paranormals interacting with each other, Tina's definitely juggling a lot.  Can she keep all the balls in the air before everything comes crashing down on her?  
  Two Peas in a Potion is the second book in the Western Woods mystery series of full-length, humerous paranormal cozy mystery novels.
