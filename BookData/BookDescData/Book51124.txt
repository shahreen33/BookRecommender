Temptation is a sneaky bitch that brought two men in my life and I wanted them both. One left without saying a word. The other asked me to be his and I said yes. I moved on...so I thought. Life isn't a fairytale. Everyone has a secret. Everyone has a flaw. And mine? Well, sometimes vows aren't for everyone. They say there's two sides to every story, but the truth makes three. In case you didnâ€™t hear me the first time, let me repeat it. Life isn't a fucking fairytale.
