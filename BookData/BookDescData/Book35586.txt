There is a reason that some people can eat all they want and seemingly never gain a pound, while others count every calorie, exercise, and can't lose an ounce. Millions of people—an estimated 45 percent of dieters—have Metabolism B, a condition that causes the body to over-process carbohydrate foods into excess body fat. Registered dietitian Diane Kress's scientifically based, easy-to-follow program has helped thousands of people with Metabolism B lose weight and keep it off.As someone who struggled with Metabolism B for years, Kress knows firsthand the frustration of diets that don't work. The solution? A simple, three-step, carb-controlling program that stabilizes blood glucose levels and reprograms the metabolism to melt away fat. The Metabolism Miracle starts working on Day 1.
