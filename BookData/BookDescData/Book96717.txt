Inspired by the story of Beauty and the Beast, a short and sexy interpretation of the classic fairy tale…  For years untold, there has always been a beast in the cursed forest. Every year at the Harvest Festival, a new bride is sent to him... never to return. But when Willow is chosen to be the newest bride, she seeks out the help of the local wise woman.  Willow might be able to break the curse, but to do so, she must refrain from looking at the beast entirely. It sounds easy enough, but as things get heated between them, can she keep her promise? Or will she need to see who — and what — she's bedding first?
