From the mining shanty towns of West Virginia comes this moving and passionate saga of a family, a community, and a way of life all but gone. In this coal-smudged place, Dillon, Rachel, and Jackie hopelessly intertwined in love and politics live in the shadow of the dying mines and the doomed union movement. Set against the devastation of the Depression, the fearful pulse of a world at war, the dawning hope of the War on Poverty, and, ultimately, the untamable force of nature herself, THE UNQUIET EARTH is a bold and bittersweet story of unforgettable men and women, and the times that made them great.
