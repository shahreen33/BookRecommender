It all started with a radio, a black plastic squawker that sits on a shelf outside Noah's room. Now don't get him wrong. He enjoys a Saint Paul Saints baseball game, or the smooth sounds of a little Nora Jones, but the daily flood of cheerless talk radio gives him migraines. Shrill voices filling the airways with reckless claims make him sweat. While he does not speak lightly about grave issues, Noah feels it's high time for more fun and funny a humorous corrective, so to speak. This Noah operates in a world of horse hilarity. He writes. He travels. He plays cribbage. He falls in love. He dishes on the human condition. He even sounds off on things like hope, trust and the meaning of Valentine's Day. Noah's a good news kind of guy who operates on the 100watt side of life. The only thing funnier than his laugh out loud exploits is the fact that the exploits say more about the rest of us than they do about a horse named Noah Vail.
