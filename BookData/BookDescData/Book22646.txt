Everything is about to change for Sophie Beaumont. Sophie has moved her entire life; never staying in one place too long. She didn’t understand why… until now. Sophie is a shifter. A wolf shifter and she has a lot to learn. About being herself, being a wolf, and being what she needs to be to protect her pack. On top of that, her intense feelings for the pack’s Alpha, Caeden, threatens to ruin everything. Especially if the rival pack, the Grimms, find out that Sophie is not the human she claims to be.
