In the first generation of the Oberllyn family series, the ancestors of the modern Oberllyns find themselves under siege; first by an unscrupulous dishonorably discharged vet with an eye for a good farm and pretty slaves, to the long road west by wagon train to escape the Civil war. Elijah Oberllyn is a retired government agent married to a Native American schoolteacher. They have seven children. Unwillingly, Elijah and his older sons become the government’s point men to stop a rebellion in San Francisco. Of course, if you’ve worked for the US Marshal’s office and Alan Pinkerton in your early career, such actions are not entirely unexpected. Follow the family firm as it once was, and see how it began to develop into what it is now… and will be someday.
