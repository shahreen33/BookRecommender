Fandom: Captain AmericaRelationship: James "Bucky" Barnes/Steve Rogers --------------------------------------------------It all starts because Steve is too dumb to handle his smartphone.A wrong number AU in which Bucky Barnes doesn't enter Steve's life (meaning: Bucky wasn't born until the eighties, but Steve is still Captain America) until Steve accidentally dials the wrong number. Wherein there is a lot of texting, some advice via Natasha and Darcy, a bit of pining, and a first date in an amusement park. Oh, and on top of being a disabled veteran, Bucky is a professional catwalker. Literally.
