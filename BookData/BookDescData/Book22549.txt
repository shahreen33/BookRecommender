I've been a vampire hunter all my life. Usually, the job's pretty straightforward: find a vamp and kill it, while staying alive in the process. But things have been getting weird lately. The vamps have started hunting in packs, which is almost unheard of. And they’re up to something at an old warehouse down by the Port of Long Beach. Then there’s the daywalking vamp that I came across. None of that should be happening, and I need answers.I usually work alone. But with all the strange stuff that's been going on, I’ve begun teaming up with fellow hunter Lee Halstrom, a hot Texan that occasionally makes me forget what a bad idea it is to mix business and pleasure. And then there’s Bane. For years the mysterious vampire has been circling me, but never going in for the kill. All of a sudden, he’s putting himself right in the middle of my business. I need to find out what game he's playing…either that, or I could just end him.***This is the first novella in The Tinder Chronicles.
