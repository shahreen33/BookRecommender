Tobias Butler has been sitting on death row since being sentenced for a gruesome murder in 2007. Bored out of his mind, he decided to apply to the online penpal program in 2012. It's a pleasant distraction—nothing more, nothing less—for three years, until he's contacted by a beautiful, smart young lawyer named Jess. She's convinced he's innocent and wants to see him freed.

Jess is desperate to release him—and he's desperate to feel his hands squeeze the life out of her once she does.  **Bonus read: "Dark Bishop Part One - Pawn" courtesy of Casey L.
