  Criminal Delights
My name is Max, but people call me The London Whipper. I’ve been silent for many years. Now I’m ready to make my final move.  Only The Devil Knows follows the people trapped within my web of lies:  Nathaniel Harris, a psychologist who works with the criminally insane.  Genevieve Knight, the Chief Inspector determined to find me once and for all.  Wyatt Pearson, the beautiful boy who believes I’m a hero instead of a cold-blooded murderer.  Each of these people has one thing in common—they all want me. But what happens when my whip tangles around them and distorts everything they believe to be true?  I’ve kept my identity under wraps… until now. It’s time to show the public what I’ve been working on. After all, what’s a serial killer if he doesn’t have some artistic flair and his favourite boy at his side?  This book is part of CRIMINAL DELIGHTS. Each novel can be read as a standalone and contains a dark M/M romance. Warning: These books are for adult readers who enjoy stories where lines between right and wrong get blurry. High heat, twisted and tantalizing, these are not for the fainthearted.
