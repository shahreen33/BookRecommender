Get ready for a ride through the alphabet at a busy construction site. There's a big yellow Bulldozer, a tall shiny Crane, and a rusty red Dump truck--and the construction crew is hard at work. But what are they building? Melissa Iwai's bright, bold illustrations perfectly complement June Sobel's irresistible rhyming text. Join the excitement as the workers build, scoop, and dig their way from 
  A,
 for 
  A
sphalt, to the end of the alphabet for an exciting roller-coaster ride!
