The China Tea Book chronicles the history of tea in China and its transmission across the globe, the abundance of tea types, miraculous health benefits of the drink, tea-brewing and tasting etiquette, and the immensity and sophistication of "tea culture." Large numbers of fine illustrations are a superb foil to the ambience of China's ancient culture that permeates the narration. And the layout and binding almost seem to inject the elegant soul of this volume with a touch of Chinese sagacity. Whether the reader takes an interest in tea culture or is a fan of Chinese culture, The China Tea Book is the best choice for reading, visual appreciation and collection. 《中国茶书》梳理了中国茶文化的历史及传播，包括不同茶叶的特点和地理、历史特色，以及在泡饮品赏方面的差别之处等。此外，本书对茶文化中各个体系和范畴的精髓进行了介绍，包括中国艺术史上与茶相关的古诗、书法作品和古画等。不论是茶文化的发烧友还是中国传统文化的爱好者，都能从本书中获得愉悦的阅读、欣赏、收藏体验。
