COLD IS THE CALLER WHO HAS AN AXE TO GRIND  DI Bethany Smith is called out to a murder scene where the state of the body is like nothing she’s ever seen before. The victim, a male, has been left in a terrifying mess. Why? What do the clues left behind mean? They’re not obviously pointing to anything, and working it out is nigh on impossible.

Someone has a serious issue and intends to let the players in the game know it—but who the hell is it?  A fourth body links them all in a chilling way.  What does a skull image have to do with it? Why red contact lenses? And why is a vacuum cleaner one of the tools of the killer’s trade?
