She's tackling her demons in the City of Angels.  Secret McQueen has been many things in her life: head of the Vampire Tribunal, werewolf queen twice over, bounty hunter, fighter, lover. She's been the hunter and the hunted. Hell, she even died once.  One thing she never thought she'd be, however, was a normal human. Because "normal" was never a word to apply to her.  Now, Secret's a former vampire/werewolf-hybrid living in a human's body. She continues to answer the call of the supernatural, working for an elite FBI special unit designed to help the general public accept the existence of the creatures that used to only be found in nightmares. She's happily married to the man of her dreams.  But when her old vampire mentor Sig goes missing, and her former beau Holden Chancery comes calling for help, Secret will be pulled out of her new sunny existence and sent back into the nightlife she once knew so well.  She'll find herself asking if there's any room for humanity in a world full of monsters.  And she might find there's more than a little monster left in her, still.
