He’s That Guy.You know, the hero in almost every romance novel. The super-rich, powerful CEO who is beyond sexy. Lives in a penthouse. Is wicked in bed. Has massive…feet. Is kind of a jerk, but really he’s not because he harbors some major secret that, once revealed, explains why he is the way he is—therefore completely redeeming himself and making all the readers who hated to love him swoon….Yeah. That one.Well, I found him. I’m a writer who has spent years searching for the perfect muse.Now that I know he exists, I have a mission. To make him fall in love with me. This should be easy. I mean, I have issues, but above all, I’m a great catch. Problem is, I did a stupid thing. And now he hates me. Unfortunately for him, he’s my That Guy. And he’s going to love me…. Whether he wants to or not.
