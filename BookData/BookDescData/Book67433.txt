When Estrella’s twin sister Hope is abducted outside a conference in Geneva, Estrella’s carefully ordered world takes a sharp left turn into darkness. She vows revenge on the human traffickers that abducted Hope, and her best friend Charlie has her back, always. Throw in two wildly inappropriate gifts from her pseudo-parent Lucifer, and a sexy mercenary from her past, and she has everything she needs to break the people who broke Hope. Blood will spill and her inner darkness will rise, but Estrella doesn’t care. She has never been the good twin. Although this book can be read as a standalone novel, it is set just after the epilogue of The Redeemable. There will be cameos from a lot of your old favorites and references to previous storylines, so the author recommends reading THE REDEEMABLE first, although it's not necessary. This novel contains smoking hot sex (including mmf), swearing and a fair bit of violence.
