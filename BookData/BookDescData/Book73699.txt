In 12th Century East Anglia, poor Saxon boys stay poor. It takes an exceptional one to win Henry II's friendship, and to rise to the job of High Sheriff of all Norfolk and Suffolk, as my hero Wimer did. Falling foul of the stormy relationship between Henry and his Archbishop, he is excommunicated three times, twice by Thomas a'Becket, and once by the Pope. This will guarantee him a place in Hell, especially given his feelings towards Henry's mistress Ida, unless he can find land and resources to do something spectacular in the way of penance.
