FIRST PEOPLE GOT SICK. THEN THEY GOT VERY SICK..Nick Adams is just a normal guy. He loves his family, appreciates his home, and covets his car. But he absolutely hates his job. Which is what makes it so difficult that not a single customer has come by his store today. It seems as though there’s a bug going around, something that has come out of nowhere and is keeping people at home. Still, it’s probably nothing to worry about. People get sick all the time.And besides, things are finally starting to look up. Nick’s first customer of the day has just stumbled through the door… HIS DAY IS ABOUT TO GET WORSE..It won’t be long before Nick’s entire life is turned upside down, sending him on a frantic journey through a ravaged world that will ultimately lead him 500 feet upwards to a hilltop amusement park. Is it the last safe place on Earth, or are the monsters at the top of the hill even worse than the ones below?WELCOME TO RIPLEY HEIGHTS. WHERE THE FUN NEVER STARTS.
