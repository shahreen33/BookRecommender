Yield or die... Back in San Francisco, Mika is working on bringing the Marshall greenhouse back to its full glory despite her sister constantly breathing down her neck about the Matriarch ritual. Claire tries to force Mika's hand, but she refuses to give her sister the power to control her, or Audrey's life. She just can't take the risk.  Mika challenges Claire to the title of Matriarch to her sister's fury. There hasn't been a witch challenge in centuries, and Mika isn't sure she is stronger than her sister but it has to be worth the risk. The only problem is...if one does not yield, both will die.Â   Can Mika survive the challenge without exposing what she is?
