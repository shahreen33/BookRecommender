A funny new middle grade series about three 12-year-old best friends who start a babysitting club in their small California town. No parents. Unlimited snacks. And, okay, occasionally watching other peopleâ€™s children. What could possibly go wrong? Perfect for fans of series like Whatever After and the Dork Diaries.
