Little Jumbo’s mama is not only the greatest, but the biggest elephant ever! Naturally, she is not really the biggest in the world but from his perspective, she is a giant. She is brave and protects him; she plays with him, finds the tastiest fruit and cuddles him when it is time to sleep. And best of all—Mama loves him just like he loves Mama.
