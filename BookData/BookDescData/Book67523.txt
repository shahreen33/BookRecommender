Every time they kill me it hurts a little more…  The monsters of Savage Magic Academy need a whipping boy. Only, this year, they’re getting a whipping girl instead, and it just so happens to be me.  When the students’ magic burns within them. When their monsters rage inside of them. They won’t lose control on the unsuspecting humans outside our school.  That’s what I was brought here for.  But if I can make it through the year, if I can die over and over again without breaking, then I might get the one thing I need: my little brother back.  None of them want me to know the truth. They’re counting on me to fail. But what they don’t know? They aren’t the first ones to try to break me.  These students might think they’re monsters, but they’re nothing compared to my parents. And if my own flesh and blood couldn’t break me, these little sh*ts don’t have a chance.  ROYAL MONSTERS is a bully academy reverse harem romance. All the characters are over eighteen. There is swearing and sexual situations. It is also a series of “episodes,” like television episodes. Each story will be short, and it will end on a cliffhanger, but the next episode will come soon after.
