He is a true master at his craft" Blaze McRob, Bram Stoker Award nominee " Lutzke is a student of the horror genre with a rich voice that needs to be heard." author, Terry M. West "Lutzke's writing is personal, detailed and often heart breaking in a terrifying way." Matt Molgaard, Horror Novel Reviews "Chad Lutzke is an emerging and exciting dark author with a firm grasp on the genre. His shadows have drastically different heartbeats, unique souls, but are unified by their dark charm and bleak shrouds." Zachary Walters, The Mouths of Madness Podcast "Lutzke has a way with words that merges horror and compassion in a single sentence. Reminiscent of Robert McCammon." Joe Mynhardt, Crystal Lake Publishing "Unique and enveloping. At times playful and alternately existential, though always invoking empathy for the protagonist's predicament. Chad Lutzke's writing is doubtlessly bleak, yet with an odd sense of hope." author, James Ferace "Chad's writing is a trip to the buffet of horror. No stone left unturned."
