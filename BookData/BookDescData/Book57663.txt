Seventeen-year-old Maggie Duncan is torn between her obligations as a dutiful daughter and her hatred of her father’s cruel pursuit of money and power. But on the boundary between childhood and womanhood, Maggie discovers it is not her father who stands in the way of her happiness -- it is her own tightly held bitterness. Drawn to a man quietly struggling to overcome his past, Maggie must learn to let go of hatred and embrace divine love and forgiveness. In The Heather Hills of Stonewycke two best-selling authors begin a glorious series about hearts and minds being opened to God. Davina Porter’s wonderful narration captures all the sweep and grandeur of this panoramic saga.
