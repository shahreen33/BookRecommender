This is an alternate cover edition for B00L4EAE66 Can a sexy pirate, a persnickity angel and a rowdy Irishman work together long enough to save the world? Legendary pirate Anne Bonny is alive and swashbuckling her way through the 21st century, but her stormy romantic life would make Blackbeard pack up ship and move to Kansas. Anne is a Sentinel, a soldier for mankind’s mysterious guardians, the Angeli. Anne will live 1000 years, but in return, she’s required to hunt Perfidia, corrupted Angeli who drain human energy to survive. After losing his corporeal body in battle, Anne’s fellow Sentinel and former lover, Con Carey, now visits her by possessing the bodies of humans. And Anne’s romance with the aloof Arch Angeli Michael has intensified... much to Con’s chagrin. Now this unusual love triangle must work together to defeat Seth, a Perfidian of untold power who threatens to end not only the Angeli, but the world.
