A multidimensional explosion hurls a starship's few passengers across the galaxies &amp; onto an uncharted barren tundra. With no technical skills &amp; scant supplies, the survivors face a bleak end on an alien world. One brave woman holds the daring answer, but it is the most desperate one possible. Elegant &amp; electric, We Who Are About To brings us face to face with our basic assumptions about our will to live. While most of the stranded tourists decide to defy the odds &amp; insist on colonizing the planet &amp; creating life, the narrator decides to practice the art of dying. When she's threatened with compulsory reproduction, she defends herself with lethal force. Originally published in 1977, this is one of the most subtle, complex &amp; exciting sf novels ever written about the attempt to survive a hostile alien environment. It's characteristic of Russ's genius that such a readable novel is also one of her most intellectually intricate.
