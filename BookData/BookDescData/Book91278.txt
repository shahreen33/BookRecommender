Meet the tough, dedicated men of Boston Fire - and the women who turn their lives upside down.Nursing a broken heart while everybody around him seems to be drowning in happiness has Grant Cutter wondering whether staying with Engine 59 - or even Boston Fire - is in his future. It's tempting as hell to pack up what fits in his Jeep and hit the road. But then a 911 call brings the woman who shattered his heart back into his life, and he knows he won't ever be able to fully leave her in his rearview mirror.For a few months, Wren Everett had thought the nightmare of her past was behind her and she might live happily ever after with Grant. Until she got the phone call letting her know the time her ex had spent in jail for assault hadn't cooled his temper or determination that she belonged with him. Cutting ties with Grant was the hardest thing she'd ever had to do, but it was also the only way to keep him safe.Now that Grant is back, he's not letting Wren push him away again. Even with the trust issues between them, Wren dares to hope she and Grant might have a future together after all...if they're willing to fight for it.
