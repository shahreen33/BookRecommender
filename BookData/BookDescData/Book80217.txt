Seriously? Four dragon warriors need to stalk my every move? I get it; they think I’m dangerous, but I’m only on their island to learn. Not to destroy it.This is another unfortunate side-effect of being the freak who descended from all three supernatural lineages. The bloodthirsty dragons, the destructive wolves, and the disloyal witches. Some believe that, when I transition in a few months, there’s a slight, teeny tiny chance I could unleash hell on the supernatural world. Call me crazy, but I’d know if I harbored that kind of power inside me.… Wouldn’t I?My entire life, all I’ve wanted was to be normal. Hence the reason I didn’t think twice about trading in my crown for a stack of books. I’ve got four terms on this island to prove the naysayers wrong, including my chaperones—Kai, Ori, Paulo, and Rayen.These four are gorgeous, but also ominous as heck. Babysitting me has clearly taken their focus off something they’ve deemed more important. So, now they go out of their way to make my life a living hell, with hopes that I’ll give up and leave.Thanks, guys.You could cut the tension between us with a knife, but what’s weird is I don’t hate them all the time. There are even odd moments when I catch them watching me. And not in their usual “wish-you-were-dead” sort of way.Even if I survive the academy, there’s still no guarantee these four and I won’t kill each other before graduation.***Note: DRAGON FIRE ACADEMY is an upper YA/NA reverse harem romance. This series will take you on a brand-new journey with a descendant of the beloved Seaton Falls shifters, featured in THE LOST ROYALS SAGA. So, keep an eye out for cameos from some of your favorite characters! New readers, rest assured; it’s completely unnecessary to read the previous five-book series before embarking on this fresh chapter, set in a world filled with fierce wolves, hotheaded dragons, and powerful witches you don’t want to cross.
