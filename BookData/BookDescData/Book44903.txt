"My name is Detective Matthew Craig and I am hunting a serial killer no one else believes exists."  They call her the poor cursed princess. He is one of the police force’s finest. When upper-class daughter Charlotte O’Callaghan loses her parents to a hit and run at the age of 15, she feels as if she died along with them until one accident on the evening to her 16th birthday and a freak coincidence on the night of her parents' death anniversary changes everything. Matthew Craig has connected seventeen deaths to each other by nothing more than the date and time of death. No one believes that these violent deaths have been executed by one person, because other than the date and time of death and them being unsolved homicides, there are no similarities. That and the hit-and-run he feels where everything started. It is his investigation into that hit-and-run that has Charlotte and Matthew crossing paths and that changes everything.This book is not suitable for minors and the faint-hearted, due to violence, murder, and explicit content!
