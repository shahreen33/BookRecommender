A young physicist discovers radio frequencies coming from empty spots in outer space that, when amplified and rebroadcast, have a powerful effect on human beings: pure and total euphoria. Questions are raised about how to commodify such an effect, the ethics of exploiting it, and the nature and balance of human happiness. First published in Collier's Magazine.
