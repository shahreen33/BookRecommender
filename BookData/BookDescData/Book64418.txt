The go-to handbook for bariatric surgery—packed with pre- and post-op advice, plus 120 high-protein recipes  Over 200,000 Americans undergo weight loss surgery (WLS) every year, but no single book has included everything they need to know—until now. At last, The Bariatric Bible is your comprehensive guide! Post-op, WLS patients ease back into eating (first liquids, then soft foods) before transitioning to a lifelong high-protein diet. For quick reference, Carol Bowen Ball has color-coded her 120 delicious recipes according to these three stages—plus, every one includes a nutritional breakdown of calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fat. But the bariatric lifestyle is about more than just cooking—it requires new, healthier habits around exercise, relationships, and eating out. Ball, a WLS patient herself, explains all this and more to help readers secure the best possible outcome: lifelong health.
