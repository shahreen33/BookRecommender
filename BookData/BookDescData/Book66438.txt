When seventeen-year-old Andromeda breaks free from her cryonic chamber, she’s prepared for a bleak reception on humanity's new colony planet. She definitely isn’t expecting to be revived in a desert wasteland by a soldier with a vagabond smile who introduces her to the villagers as their 'Goddess'. Andra has woken a thousand years too late, in a desperate society where technology is considered magic and its practitioners revered as Deities.Zhade has been searching for the Third Goddess ever since he was banished from his home city four years ago. She doesn't wield magic as well as the first two Goddesses did, and they weren't even strong enough to save themselves, let alone the world. Zhade only hopes Andra will live long enough to get him back to his rightful place in Eerensed. His city. His throne. She is a bargaining chip and nothing more. Or so he thinks.​Together, a girl a thousand years from home and the exiled prince who woke her will have to fight to save themselves and the people of Eerensed, whose lives rely on ancient and deteriorating technology. If the people find out Andra’s not really a goddess, they’ll kill her. If they start loving her more than their king, he’ll kill her. If she doesn’t find a way to get back to Earth, the planet will kill them all.The first book in the duology is scheduled for summer 2020.
