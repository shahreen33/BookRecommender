An angel finds passion and danger in the arms of an unexpected lover in Nalini Singh’s New York Times bestselling series that “may do for angels what [Christine] Feehan did for vampires” (Dear Author)… The gentle teacher of angelic young, and the keeper of her people’s histories, Jessamy is respected and admired by everyone who knows her. Yet, born unable to soar into flight, she has spent thousands of years trapped in the mountain stronghold of the Refuge, her heart encased in painful loneliness…until the arrival of Galen, warrior angel from a martial court. Rough-edged and blunt, Galen is a weapons-master at home with violence, a stranger to the sweet words it takes to woo a woman—but he is also a man determined to claim Jessamy for his own, to dance with her through the skies denied her for so very long…even if their exhilarating passion proves as dangerous as the landscape of war and unrest that lies before them. Angels’ Dance previously appeared in the anthology, Angels’ Flight .
