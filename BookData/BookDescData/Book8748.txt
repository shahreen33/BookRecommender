A Christian Living Spiritual Guide & Self-help book for Women
Women are the bearers of the gift that defeats the enemy according to Genesis. The enemy fights back by stealing our faith, joy, and happiness through low self-esteem, loneliness, worry, finances, doubt, fears, single parenting, generational patterns and regrets of the past. Women’s issues and empowerment are at the forefront of the media and a key challenge for the church today. Women need Godly strategies to win the battle of spiritual warfare over their feelings and current circumstances. The time is now to gain a future filled with identity, faith, love, power, and purpose for bold Christian living. 
  The lies of the enemy end today.
