It is to Number One that patients young and old come when they need a doctor’s care, for everything from the measles to a rare and baffling blood disease.An unexpected turn of events threatens to drive O’Reilly from his home for good, unless the entire village can rally behind their doctor and prove that love really can conquer all.An Irish Country Love Story is a new and heartwarming installment in Patrick Taylor's beloved bestselling Irish Country series.
