Richard Burton, Richard Harris, Peter O’Toole, and Oliver Reed: On screen they were stars. Off screen they were legends. Hellraisers is the story of drunken binges of near biblical proportions, parties and orgies, broken marriages, riots, and wanton sexual conquests. Indeed acts so outrageous that if you or I had perpetrated them we could have ended up in jail. They got away with the kind of behaviour that today’s film stars could scarcely dream of, because of their mercurial acting talent and because the press and public loved them. They were truly the last of a breed. Hellraisers is a celebratory catalogue of their miscreant deeds, a greatest hits package of their most breathtakingly outrageous behavior, told with humor and affection. You can’t help but enjoy it—after all, they certainly did.
