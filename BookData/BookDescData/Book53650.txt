A Romantic Comedy by S.K. Rose - Coming 8.22.19My name is Scarlett Mavis. I have a sweet tooth, no filters, and video games are my life. Let me clarify that last part: They’re not a hobby; they’re not a way to kill the time; They. Are. My. LIFE. Where family, men, and humans, in general, have failed me, video games are always there waiting for me to return to their warm and accepting embrace.In real life I may be a heartbroken geek, but put a controller in my hands and I become an indestructible warrior. What else does a girl really need?Enter player two, Kane Decker.Handsome, nerdy, incredible kisser, and just my type. Our first date was perfect in every way. Then, like always, reality came crashing down with one simple truth. He wasn’t my teammate; he was the enemy. And there’s nothing I’m better at than taking out a rival player. But this isn’t a game, and the stakes are all too real. For the first time in my life, I may have met my match. Game on.18+
