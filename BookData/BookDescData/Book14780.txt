Willa Knight: The saviour of both worlds, or the destruction of everything?  Sometimes history lies, and the tales of Minatsol and Topia are no different. Since the birth of Topia, Staviti has woven a web of deceit around the truth of Creation, striving only to maintain his power while destroying anything that gets in his way. Now, Willa and the Abcurses are determined to strip back the layers, to uncover the truth, and to understand the true nature of the two worlds before it's too late. The only problem? Any wrong step in their quest to restore balance might have terrible repercussions. Every single being—living or dead—might have to pay the price.  This is a full novel, 90,000 words. Book 5 of 5 in the Curse of the Gods Series
