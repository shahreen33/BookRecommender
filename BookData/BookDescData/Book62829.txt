There's nothing, not anymore. No perfect life. No clear path. Just...nothing.  I didn't want the life my parents mapped out for me. Being the piano prodigy was never my goal. It was theirs.I craved normalcy, a life of my own.I should have been careful what I wished for because one second, one moment of anger was all it took to rip away everything that mattered.Now I'm left with nothing but regret.He thinks he can save me, but the shadows that surround always pull me back, reminding me of what I'd done, of what I'd wanted. He's a rock god. I'm a nothing. And I refuse to take him down with me.
