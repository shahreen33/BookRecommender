Kaylee Cummings is back in Covington to change her destiny. She used to be known as the town rich girl, misunderstood by everyone but one boy, Anson Carter. They’d loved hard, and then destroyed each other in their youth, so when she crashes into him again, the residual anger from what he’d done comes back ten-fold. All she has to do is stay far away from him, and follow through with her plan to change her life, but he’s reminding her exactly why she fell for him when they were teenagers. That panther shifter is trouble with a capital T, but she can’t seem to keep away from him. And he seems to be having the same problem staying away from her. Too bad what she’s really in town for could destroy them both if they aren’t careful.  Anson Carter never moved on from Kaylee. How could he? He’d picked her when they were seventeen, and then given everything for her, only to be betrayed. Now, all he can hope is to find peace in the Appalachian Mountains with a misfit, moonshiner crew of reclusive panther shifters. But when Kaylee blows back in town, his anger is hard to keep. She’s so different now, and her many secrets only make him more curious about the beautiful human he used to know. He’s drawn to her, but she’s back in their hometown for reasons that could get him and his Red Havoc Crew killed. Anson must make a choice—the girl he used to love, or the safety of the crew he’s grown to trust.   Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets.
