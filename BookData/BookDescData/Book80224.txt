If I thought my mates were protective before, that’s nothing compared to how they are now. It’s for a good reason… somebody is after me, but we don’t know why. What am I? As I start developing more and more powers, the only thing we have is questions. Maybe these people are right to come after me and hunt me down? What if I’m a monster?  Monster is the first book in the Shifter Academy Series, an RH series. Book 1: Different Book 2: Monster Book 3: Hybrid (coming May 2019!)
