Eric  When life serves up the worst, just put on your best face and greet the day with a smile. That's the philosophy that's made my mom the strongest person I know, and it's one I've tried to live by, too. With a great job running a very successful diner, it seems like the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.  Only... my face is always just an act. Years ago, I let a man I loved control my life and make me feel like I was nothing. I got away--just barely. But now he's back, and I don't know if I have the strength to make it through.  I never wanted to rely on anyone else, but I may just have to depend on my favorite customer--a gruff security guard with a protective streak--to feel safe again.  Reeve  I'm a f*cking failure. Couldn't hack it as a cop, so now I'm stuck with the laminated badge of hospital security. I go through the motions every day, with only one bright spot in my life: Eric, the owner of the local diner. We talk, we flirt, I imagine him on his knees...  And then I go home alone and try not to think about how empty my life is.  I've never let anyone get close to me, but Eric's busting down all my best defenses. When his assh*le ex comes back into his life, it triggers that hyper-protective instinct I thought I'd buried.  I'm not going to make the mistakes of my past.  And I'm not going to let anyone hurt Eric ever again.
