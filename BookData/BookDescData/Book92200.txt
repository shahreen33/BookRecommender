Apex Racing is expanding and absorbing Pilot and his lovers. Everyone is happy with itâ€¦except Johnny. He's feeling constantly left out and more alone than ever before. It's time to seek out his own win, and find his holeshot even if its off the track and away from Pilot.  Gavin is determined to put together the hottest Supercross team, and he wants that to include Bryce Nickels, but that seems almost impossible since he signed with Apex. Perhaps, he needs a new angle, like the sexy business partner of the bodyguard, Johnny Killebrew. Maybe he'll sign on more than he bargained for.  Everyone is chasing their own dreams, but Johnny isn't sure he even has one.
