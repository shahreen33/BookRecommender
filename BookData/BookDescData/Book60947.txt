Will he risk it all to be in safe arms?When a damaged man stumbles on a second chance, it's all too easy to turn and run. It takes a determined photographer to convince him risk is worth it all.People deserve a second chance, right? How about a third or fourth?But what if I can't even admit to myself who I am? I was truthful once before. I came out to one other person, and he left me broken and scarred. He destroyed the boy I was. I don't even use the same name anymore; I go by Trent now. But I survived the streets. I got lucky and I made something of myself. I'm happy, sort of.It's Angelo who lights up my life. He's my world. My rock and my family. He's always there for me. But I keep hurting him. I say stupid things, and I always keep him at a distance. Still, he knows me better than anyone.And I want him. But I can't let myself go there. Not again.I've lived in denial for so long and it's killing me. In my weakest moments, I reach for Angelo and when he slips into my arms, I can breathe. He's my solace. Selflessly, he's there and he never expects anything in return. No judgment, not even an explanation. Having him in my arms is everything, and it's getting harder to push him away. I'm not sure I want to anymore.He doesn't date, but he deserves to be loved. Cherished. Then he drops a bombshellâ€”he's found The One. I wish he'd fallen for me. I need that second chance to tell him. I need to risk it all because in his arms, I'm safe. I'm me.
