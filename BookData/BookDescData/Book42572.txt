Series Description: Just when you thought it was safe to get out of the water, fish grow legs! From the mind of acclaimed artist Junji Ito comes this diabolic cross between Resident Evil and The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau. Yes, it's Gyo, where terror takes the name of horribly mutated fish and sea creatures that invade, en masse, a seaside town. Sophisticated, atmospheric work by perhaps the finest horror comics working in the world today. Young couple Tadashi and Kaori are vacationing in Okinawa, but instead of enjoying their time, they bicker endlessly about such important topics as Tadashi's bad breath! But that stench may actually be something quite different. When a strange walking fish appears, Tadashi and Kaori know something's amiss. When a Great White Shark attacks -- walking -- they know they're in real trouble!
