What do you do when you're feeling blue--especially when your mood takes the form of a drippy, oozy monster called the Blooz? Do you ignore it? Do you ask it lots of questions? Do you give it an ice-pop and hope it goes away? Through trial and error, the child in this story discovers that while it may not be easy, it's not impossible to shake the Blooz.    With a read-aloud rhythm and whimsical illustrations, this debut picture book helps children talk about emotions--and is perfect for young fans of friendly monsters.
