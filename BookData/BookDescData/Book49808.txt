Ghost stories are found in every corner of Newfoundland and Labrador, and no one knows them better than storyteller and folklorist Dale Jarvis. In this collection of ghostly tales, Jarvis introduces you to old legends, including spectral Viking longships, encounters with ghostly ferrymen, and strange voices on the trapline, while exploring classic elements of local folklore such as tokens and premonitions, bad weather lights, and the Old Hag herself. In addition to historical tales, you will also come face to face with some of the province’s eeriest urban legends, from the mysterious Red Eyes of Glovertown, to the chilling west coast Webber, to the Phantom Drummer of Conception Bay North.With leaping witches, dancing devils, phantom locomotives, and even a ghostly kitten or two, there is no mistaking that you are exploring truly haunted ground. Welcome to Newfoundland and Labrador—a place so steeped in history and tradition that some inhabitants never, ever, want to leave.
