If your daughter went missing, how many years would it take for you to admit she’s never coming home?  Betsy Blake was only four years old when she vanished outside her family home in Dublin.  Her father – wracked with guilt for the past seventeen years – still can’t bring himself to admit the search is over, despite the fact his wife has moved on and police have closed off the investigation.  When he is informed he must undergo major heart surgery that he only has a fifty percent chance of surviving, Gordon Blake hires a local PI to give the investigation one last try.  But surely rookie PI Lenny Moon – who has little or no experience in such high-profile investigating – doesn’t have what it takes to make a breakthrough in this case before Gordon is put to sleep.  …or does he?  The clock is ticking…  Whatever Happened to Betsy Blake? will stay in your head for a long time. A very, very long time.
