Clementine is having not so good of a week.-On Monday she's sent to the principal’s office for cutting off Margaret’s hair.- Tuesday, Margaret's mother is mad at her. - Wednesday, she's sent to the principal... again. - Thursday, Margaret stops speaking to her. - Friday starts with yucky eggs and gets worse. - And by Saturday, even her mother is mad at her. Okay, fine. Clementine is having a DISASTROUS week.
