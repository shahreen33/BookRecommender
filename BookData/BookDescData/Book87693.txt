Sakura Kinomoto seems like your average fourth grader--loves P.E., hates math--but there's something about her that's not so normal... she can use magic! As the Cardcaptor, it is Sakura's job to use her powers to track down the missing Clow Cards before disaster befalls the Earth. But there's a new boy in town, Syaoran Li, who claims that the cards are his birthright. According to the Covenant, there can only be one Cardcaptor--did Kero-chan pick the wrong person?
