No one feels this more strongly than Jordie, a woman who doesn't belong in a seedy dive on the banks of a bayou. But here she is . . . and Shaw Kinnard is here to kill her. As Shaw takes aim, Jordie is certain her time has come. Instead, Shaw has other plans. He abducts Jordie, hoping to get his hands on the $30 million her brother has stolen. But he isn't the only one: Jordie's brother made a deal with the FBI, but his ruthless boss will stop at nothing to find the money first. Now on the run from the feds and a notorious criminal, Jordie and Shaw must rely on their wits to stay alive. Miles away from civilization and surrounded by swampland, Jordie and Shaw play each other against their common enemies. Jordie's only chance of survival is to outwit Shaw, but he suspects her from the start. Was she in on her brother's scam, or is she an innocent pawn in this deadly vendetta? And just how valuable is her life to Shaw, her remorseless and manipulative captor?
