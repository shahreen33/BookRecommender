Permit me, lovely readers, to take you on a journey. Firstly though, wherever you are, it is important that you should be comfy. For example, if you are in bed, make sure there are no spiky pieces of Lego under your bum bum. That sort of thing simply won't do...Pippin's just an ordinary little girl who lives with her ordinary little granny in the ordinary little town of Funsprings. Or so she thinks. When some rather terrible goings on start occurring, Granny is forced to reveal a secret - she used to be a secret crime fighter! And on top of that, Pippin has a special gift - she is Shiny, and can talk to animals. Hurray!But life's not all fun times and lemonade and monster munch for tea. Not only has all the water gone, the animals are disappearing too. Someone as rotten as a pig fart in a jar must be behind all this, and it's up to Pippin to find out who. Armed with her new power and some new friends to boot, Pippin will confront kidnappers, evil scientists and would-be diamond thieves in this fantastic new series from Harry Heape (brilliantly illustrated by Rebecca Bagley too, you lucky things!).
