The Best Parody of The #1 Bestseller In Its GenreGet your unique take on the fastest-selling book ever! FIFTY SHADES OF GREY to the second power meets Keisha and Jada from the Block. Aspiring recording studio owners, Keisha Beale and Jada Jameson, score a rare meeting with venture capitalist Tristan White, and are thrust into a world beyond their wildest imaginations. Lured by Tristan White and his offer of fronting the capital for her business in exchange for an indecent proposal, of sorts, Keisha finds herself with no other option. Tortured by demons from her past, Keisha's inability to come to terms with them threatens to undermine the future of her business and her tumultuous, unconventional relationship with Tristan White. Erotic, amusing, and in places hilarious, the Jungle Fever Romance Quadrilogy is a parody with a unique take on a Fifty Shades-type story that will take you even further into the BDSM world, and promises to make the vanilla original Fifty Shades more colorful. The first two books focus on Keisha and Tristan's romance, and the final two will focus on Jada and Nathan's.Grab your copy today!Top 100 Drama USATop 100 IR/MCTop 100 African American
