I left Lakeside, Montana heartbroken and lost with no desire to ever return.But life had other plans.Moving back wasn’t what I wanted to do, but I’d do anything for my daughter Emmy. Including put myself right in the path of Sadie Jones.My daughter’s new dance teacher.The reason my heart was never fully opened to anyone else was because it’s always belonged to her.When I watched Reed Sanders drive away from Lakeside, I knew my heart would never recover.He was meant for more than what this town could offer him.Than what I could offer him.I tried to warn him to stay away from me but he refused to listen.If only he would have, maybe then I wouldn’t feel so broken.The heart is mysterious. It can be closed off and open at the same time.Unfortunately, sometimes it takes danger lurking around the corner to make it choose a side.All I can hope is that one day I can finally hear the words… I’m Yours.
