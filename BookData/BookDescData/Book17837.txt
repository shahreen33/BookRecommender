An alternate cover edition can be found here.This world is full of coincidence...I said it was full of pervs with a boner for pubescent kids, murderers lurking in the shadows, and God-awful things I didn't care to think about.God. I didn't know if I qualified to say that anymore. How did things get so out of control, so messy? I was normal, once. Put on my bra one arms strap at a time, laced my Converses from bottom to top just like everyone else. Granted it was a slightly different version of normal--a little too far left of kosher, maybe? But before all of this twistedness happened, I was me. I was a little ignorant, a little naïve. I was whatever my social network profile said. But I hadn't updated it in, like, three months, so...Three months ago, I was the girl who wore her hair in a saggy ponytail, the girl with the stutter. I despised my mom's cooking, gamed too much, and laughed at all my dad's jokes even when they were corny as hell. I'd never been kissed or gotten into trouble. I was Mikayla Blake, human, prone to fuckups and mishaps. No more, no less.Three months ago, my new life started. And nothing's been coincidence since.
