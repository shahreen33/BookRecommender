Breathe life into your backlist  Have you launched a novel, or many novels, only to have them land with a whimper? Have you had a great selling book or series slowly fade away to obscurity? What if you could relaunch those books, turning your backlist into a great source of income? You can. This book will teach you: - How to analyze your previous launches to determine failure points - How to turn your backlist into an automated system that feeds readers back into your other books - What types of relaunches exist, and which is right for your book. - How other authors have successfully relaunched. What worked, and what didnâ€™t.
