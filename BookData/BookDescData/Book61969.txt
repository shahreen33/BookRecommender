The Birth of New Aeon is the preliminary text of a lecture delivered at the 2008 London conference CESNUR—Center for Research of New Religious Movements. Djurdjevic presents a perverse, postmodern interpretation of the Thelema of Aleister Crowley as the religion of twilight—the twilight of God, the dusk of the subject, the twilight of history that contains the drive of self-creation. He interprets the 
  Book of the Law
 in the light of Mark C. Taylor's postmodern theology, avoiding the nightmare of "Thelemic" writing—the lack of innovation.
