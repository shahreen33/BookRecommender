Tired of running from her past, nurse Kate Callison intends to become Austin Grace Hospital's permanent ER director and make Texas her home. Despite staff friction, she's moving ahead. Then unthinkable tragedy wraps the ER in crime tape, bringing swarms of media, legal chaos--and a search-and-rescue hero who seems determined to meddle in her life. For Wes Tanner, nothing beats finding someone who's lost; he's known that helpless terror firsthand. So he'll expand his team's lifeline of hope: K9 tracking, swift water rescue, even horse-mounted searches. He's ready for anything--except Austin Grace's prickly and dismissive ER director. As Kate and Wes discover more about each other, new respect becomes something deeper. Kate wonders if her heart might have finally found a home. Then an unsolved missing persons case--and a startling new one--become catalysts that threaten the loss of all she and Wes have found.
