When Buffy and Xander sign up for home ec, assuming it will be an extra-credit cakewalk, they aren’t aware that the teacher is a ravenous tiger demon in disguise. The demon’s unquenchable appetite has him kidnapping his top students and forcing them to cook for him, and when Xander claims some store-bought treats are his own creations, he becomes the demon’s next victim! It’s not enough that Buffy has to keep her grades up, but she also has to rescue her friends and fellow students-and give the tiger demon his just desserts!Author Kel McDonald (Misfits of Avalon) and artist Yishan Li bring monsters and more high-school high jinks into the life of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
