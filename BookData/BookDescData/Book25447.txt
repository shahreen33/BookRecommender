Safari guide Ella Craine sees the world in a different way. Ever wondered why a Hamerkop is better than you? Or thought about which animal has the weirdest tongue in the Kalahari? Probably not. A collection of true safari stories and quirky wildlife observations, 'An Unlikely Safari Guide' will leave you astonished at the antics of eccentric safari guests and giggling the next time you think of a wildebeest. And if all goes to plan, you'll crave a plate of cookies by the end. It's all about mind control... From menacing mongooses (or is it mongeese?) to philosophical antlions, 'An Unlikely Safari Guide' is delightfully unlikely.
