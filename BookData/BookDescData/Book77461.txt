Who needs claws when you’ve got a baseball bat? Lauren Evans sure as heck doesn’t.  Human Lauren has a protective streak a mile wide and one immediate goal in life—get her best friend out of an abusive household. If that involves a little bat-based redecorating, so be it. Unfortunately—or fortunately—a certain sexy-as-hell cop breaks up the fight before she has a chance to really get going. Grayslake police officer Van Abrams is too hot for his own good, and his handcuffs make all those wonderful places tingle. Too bad he, you know, arrested her and stuff. But then he becomes overbearing, demanding, and commanding. Suddenly Lauren finds herself in his arms, in his bed, and mated to his werebear butt. What’s up with that? Werebear Enforcer Van Abrams doesn’t want anything to do with humans. He’s got reasons, and they’re damn good ones. He doesn’t need to explain himself to anyone, especially the curvaceous, luscious, gorgeous, human Lauren. Then, his bear decides Lauren is his mate and Van’s anti-human feelings abandon him. He still hasn’t figured out if that’s a good thing. Of course, when danger rolls in from Boyne Falls and joins with a powerful prick from Grayslake, Van realizes that, human or not, Lauren is his. Van hopes he can kill their enemies and still make it home for dinner.  Warning: This book contains bad guys (more than one) being bad to good girls (two if you’re counting), and one group of humans who sorta end up… dead. Unfortunately, all that comes with a lot of blood, tears, and balls of fur. In this one, boy bears really do drool and human girls rule (and kick ass). We also learn that you can never have enough baseball bats, brake fluid, or fire pokers. Just sayin’.
