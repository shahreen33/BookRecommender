J SS Bach is the story of three generations of women from either side of Germany's 20th Century horror story - one side, a Jewish family from Vienna, the other linked to a ranking Nazi official at Dachau concentration camp - who suffer the consequences of what men do. Fast forward to 1990s California, and two survivors from the families meet. Rosa is a young Australian musicologist; Otto is a world-famous composer and cellist. Music and history link them. A novel of music, the Holocaust, love, and a dog. The author's writing is a wonderland, captivating and drawing the reader in to the presented world. Time becomes no object as a literary universe unfolds and carries the reader through eighty years, where emotions are real and raw and beautifully given.
