A stranger online. Dark hair and even darker eyes that knew my dirty desires before I did. A fantasy that should never be spoken. But he pulled the confession from me. And now he’s coming for me.Rough. Dirty. Dangerous.It’s supposed to be one night to get me off and make me forget.He’ll make me his and I’ll pretend I don’t want him to.I’ll run and he’ll chase. Because I asked him for this.I begged him for this.Tonight, in the darkness, he’s the hunter.And I’m the bait.
