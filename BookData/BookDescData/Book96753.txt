A trained assassin on the run. Trinity Durant isn't accustomed to relying on anyone for help. She's the deadliest of all her Valkyrie sisters, getting up close and personal for her kills. But this time, it's different. When she's injured on a job, she has no one to turn to except the handsome stranger holding a weapon on her. Since she needs to escape the city, she reluctantly accepts his help. Too late she realizes that he poses the biggest danger to her of all, by making her question everything about her life-and threatening her jaded heart. A man unwilling to walk away. When HRT sniper team leader Brody Colebrook heads home on medical leave for a well-deserved break, the last thing he expects is to stumble upon a mysterious woman in danger. She may be a stranger to him, but she's a friend of his commander's and now that Brody knows she's in trouble, he can't just leave her to be hunted down and executed. The moment he puts her in his truck it places them both in the crosshairs of a killer bent on revenge. She might trust Brody to have her back, but he wants far more than that. He wants everything she has to give, and he'll do whatever it takes to get it.
