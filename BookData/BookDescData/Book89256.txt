So far, she’d managed to handle everything the world had thrown at her. Everything, until Troy Sullivan strolled into the tattoo parlor where she worked.She had known men before, sure, but none of them could hold a candle to the man that walked up to the counter, looking to get some art done. As fate would have it, Alix finds herself on the run with the would-be man of her dreams, while a band of fanatics, hellbent on finding her, give chase.All Alix had ever wanted was a normal life. What she’d gotten was a messed up tragedy. And now, she’ll have to fight tooth and nail just to keep that.Building friendships isn’t easy...building a coven is even harder.
