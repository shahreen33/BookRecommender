A cold-hearted Duke meets his match in an American lady searching for love across the pond.  Hannah Turner is an American lady, sent back to London by her father, to find a decent husband. Her father's distant cousin was the Marquees of Hunting, so when Hannah searches for a place within the ton, she lives with Lord Archibald Turner, her second cousin and his wife, the new Countess of Tother.  At Charlotte and Archie's summer house, she meets Lord John Dunford, a famous rakehell and rather handsome gentleman. He is lust and temptation incarnate. Hannah had always promised herself she would wait until marriage, but would learning the arts of the bedroom be such a bad thing?  Lord John swore off marriage as a child. His father's terrible union, and the devastation his mother expressed knowing his father was in love with his mistress, put him off love and commitment. But when he meets Hannah Turner, his once cold heart trembled at the sight. Even though he couldn't offer her forever, a few nights in his bed could be the solution to the attraction burning between them.
