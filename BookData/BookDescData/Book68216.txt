He went to the woods to get away from it all. His past, the demons ever at his heels. And, perhaps most importantly, people. One million miles away from anyone. Save for the occasional visit from a client he had to endure. And that was exactly the way he liked it. Until one night, he finds her. Battered, scarred, tortured by the memories, in need of a safe haven. So he does the unthinkable. He offers to share his with her. It’s not long before feelings start to arise. Yet the demons refuse to stay at bay. And two fractured people will have to see if it is possible to come together… without breaking everything apart.
