The greatest evil in the universe has been wiped out. Darkseid, lord of Apokolips, is dead. But the death of a god carries great consequences. Now the Justice League, Earth’s greatest heroes, find themselves with more power than they’ve ever imagined. But all power has a price—and for the heroes of the Justice League, the price may just be their humanity. Now, Batman is driven non-stop by his power as the God of Knowledge. Superman, the God of Strength, begins to view humans as inferior. The Flash tries to outrun his fate as the God of Death. Green Lantern struggles with his newfound power as the God of Light. Shazam embraces a new pantheon as the God of Gods. And Lex Luthor… …where Darkseid fell, Lex Luthor may rise to take his place! If Earth’s greatest heroes can’t find their way back to their humanity, they may bring about their own destruction.Collects JUSTICE LEAGUE: GODS AND MEN SUPERMAN #1, JUSTICE LEAGUE: GODS AND MEN BATMAN #1, JUSTICE LEAGUE: GODS AND MEN THE FLASH #1, JUSTICE LEAGUE: GODS AND MEN GREEN LANTERN #1, JUSTICE LEAGUE: GODS AND MEN SHAZAM! #1 and JUSTICE LEAGUE: GODS AND MEN LEX LUTHOR #1
