Let there be war...Don Giovanni Battaglia will have his revenge. A bloody Mafia war has ravaged the southern region of Italy. Every man, woman, and child born under the name Calderone must be made to atone. That is the law. After two years of blood and bullets, the men sworn to follow without question find themselves wanting peace. But how can there be peace when the one person able to save their Don from the destructive path he is on is beyond their reach. Or is she?Mira Ellison lives...It's 1991 and Mira has learned how to begin again. Her best friend is dead, and the fashion empire she built from scratch is now gone. All she has left is the fleeting memory of a bittersweet love, and a mocha-brown baby with her father's eyes. She now has one single goal, to survive. She must protect her baby and hide from the Mafia men she is convinced are out to kill her. But is it all a lie? Soon Mira finds herself confronted by her past, and face to face with the man she loves but doesn't trust. And Giovanni Battaglia is furious. He gives Mira a choice. She can become his Donna or be his enemy. And this time Mira has more than her life to lose.
