After a research facility is destroyed, the surrounding forest becomes a horrific war zone between intelligent winged mutants and mercenaries hired by the man that created them. When a mutant infects a local, Sarah's cancer is cured and both sides discover that she holds the key to their future.Richard Myerscough's Bat Blood contains common themes found in techno-thrillers like Michael Critchton's Prey, medical thriller's such as Robin Cook's Coma, and horror/sci/fi in the same vein as John Saul's The God Project. Bat Blood is a fun novel that contains cinematic battle scenes that might have come out of a Michael Bay action movie. What makes the novel even more frightening, beyond just the fear of the unknown, is that it feels as though the content could be ripped out of the latest newspaper headlines. Clarion ReviewSarah's cure was her curse, and her destiny After Sarah Douglas is attacked and infected with the blood of a gargoyle-like creature, the cancer that riddled her body vanishes. The attack draws the attention of Doctor Scott, the scientist who inadvertently was responsible for infecting a colony of bats, and changing them into intelligent creatures that could threaten mankind. As the infected blood slowly transforms Sarah's body, she is caught in the middle of an horrific war between an army of mercenaries and a colony of mutate winged creatures. Watching the creatures gorge themselves on human flesh, she sees her future and fights to maintain her humanity. With Sarah's blood holding the key to his research the doctor uses his vast resources to try to capture her, along with keeping the outside world at bay. This gets harder to do as the colony expands its territory further away from the Devil's Claw, and members of the local population begin to disappear.
