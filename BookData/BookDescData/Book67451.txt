 An unforgivable accident tore my family apart.  It wasn’t my fault. It was his. I’m a Dragon and I’m seeking revenge. But in order to do that, I need to control the wildfire within me.   Joining the Broken Academy is the only way.   Yes, this secret world is my only hope. And another Dragon, Lee, wants to help me. Along with the other men who now seem more like lovers than mere allies. It’s a romantic world in here. But I can’t stray away from my path. There’s a reason why I came here. Him. The one who destroyed my family has to die. And I’m the one who’ll put him in his grave.
