William’s Witch: the second installment of a funny, sexy new paranormal romance series from New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Alyssa Day.  What happens when a centuries-old vampire who's allergic to magic falls for a very modern witch? Mayhem, madness, and romance!  &gt;&gt;William Pemberley woke up with a blazing hangover and realized that, yet again, he didn’t know where or when he was.  The where was a fairly common occurrence and had been for at least the past few decades, so it didn’t bother him all that much, but the when was a relatively new development, and he didn’t like it at all.  He shot up through six feet of soil into the moonlit quiet of a church graveyard, landing in the middle of a standoff between a couple of knife-wielding thugs and a woman wearing a lopsided pair of plastic wings.  “A tuxedo? Really?” the woman drawled in a rich, sultry voice that made him think of aged whiskey and dark chocolate. She looked William up and down and curled her lip. “Isn’t that a little old school?”  William glanced down at himself, mildly surprised to find that he was, indeed, wearing a tuxedo. He grinned at the butterfly. “Apparently, I had a very good time. What year is this?”  She snorted in a very unfeminine way that, oddly enough, turned him on a little. “2016. Vampires are out, shifters are in, hashtag it’s a new world, baby.”&lt;&lt;  [Author's note: this novelette – 14,000 words -- was originally published in the Taming the Vampire anthology, so if you have that one, you already have this and shouldn’t buy it twice. Thanks!]
