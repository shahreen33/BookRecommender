Previous Book: One for the Team Genre: LGBT Erotic Contemporary Others might be fooled into thinking Davey is just a computer nerd, but Jason knows better. He knows his geeky best friend is wicked to the core. So, he shouldn't be surprised when Davey lures him into a threesome on the night of their friends' wedding. Two guys and one girl turns out to be a pretty terrific thing, especially when watching Davey have sex is almost as hot as knowing Davey is watching him. And the girl doesn't seem to mind either. One threesome leads to more, but then something changes. Now, when Davey touches him, it's a whole new ballgame. Jason likes it...a lot...and he likes it even more when they try sex without the girl. Who knew? But Jason's troubles are just beginning. He sees new-found depths in their friendship. Depths he's willing to explore. Too bad Davey doesn't feel the same. The past has taught Davey that happily ever after doesn't exist and Jason is afraid he'll never be able to change Davey's mind. Will Jason be able to convince his stubborn friend that they can forge a two man team?
