"Conceit and Consequence" follows Lucy Truscott and her three female cousins through a series of romantic entanglements - some more bizarre than others - with spankings and other assorted humiliations inflicted on the girls by the bossy Lucy on the way. Smuggling, swashbuckling, and sodomy mix in a plot that's tighter than Mr. D'Arcy's breaches.
