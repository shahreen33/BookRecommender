She got her happy ending, or did she?IsabelIt was like a fairy tale. A handsome misunderstood prince with more money than he knew what to do with and he wanted me. A plain country bookworm with a penchant for numbers. I should be happy, right? Then why couldn’t I get that cocky grin out of my head and my heart?JasonI made a mistake. We all make them. But this one cost me the only woman I ever loved. Now she’s with him. A monster hiding behind a pretty face and fancy words. I won’t let him have her even if it means becoming a beast myself.Anyone who knows me or has read Chasing Rabbits knows that I love fairy tales. I love making new stories up from old classics. And a lot of my fairy tales aren’t the normal variety.
