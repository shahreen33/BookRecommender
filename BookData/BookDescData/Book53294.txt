My name is Allyanna and I am that Gift. I was taken from my family and used by The Guard to keep Alexander in line, I am their insurance, their leash, and their whipping girl.***DISCLAIMER*** This is NOT a completely fluffy story. Although it contains some humor and sweetness, it also has dark elements that might make some uncomfortable. It also contains elements of dominance, obsession, discipline and dubious consent. Thereâ€™s also some blood and violence doled out. If any of this offends you, this may not be the book for you.
