Destiny I was doing fine. Just fine. I’d long since left my cheating, two-timing, slime ball of a husband, and was doing well making my way in the world. I had a career that I loved as a financial advisor, great friends, and family. I didn’t need for anything. Especially not love. Don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t completely soured on the whole falling in love thing. However, after having my heart crushed once by the man who claimed to love me and only me, I wasn’t exactly itching to take another walk down that aisle. Especially, not with another athlete of all people. Then, in walks Tyler Townsend. Or rather, I walked into his life.

All of the teasing I’d done to my older brothers once they’d fallen in love was coming back to haunt me. I just knew it. Because as soon as Destiny McDonald blew into my world, all the games were over. No other woman would do. And I do anything to ensure that she knew it. And I do mean anything. Because this time I’m playing for keeps.
