If you've never been tempted to steal a book from a library; If you've never dreamed of being given a book with all the answers in it, and awakened disappointed because it's not really under your pillow;If your mother never gave away, threw out, or sold a book that had changed your life;If you're not still half looking for that book every time you pull one off the shelf...But of course you are."Talisman" is about hunger and magic.
