ABRAHAM DAVIS—Honest Abe to his friends—IS IN OVER HIS HEAD...He’s a fixer and a do good-er. The all-knowing, resident "grandfather" on the wrestling team who everyone relies on to fix their problems. His teammates go to him for everything; advice, homework, or when they need a sober driver at three in the morning--whether he likes it or not.Abe’s current mission is easy: mend his roommates broken heart by helping him find a girlfriend on the LoveU app--without getting caught in the lie...SKYLAR GABRIEL. IS. OVER. IT.Over her bad grades. Over her meddling older brother and his two best friends. And over dating douchebags. What she wants to know is: where have all the nice guys gone?She longs for a handsome, sweet, and honest guy who can make her laugh. In one last ditch effort to prove that he exists—Skylar turns to LoveU.  On her worst day, Skylar has no filter (it’s a miracle she hasn’t been ditched mid-date).On her best, she’s as wholesome, and sweet, as pie.On Thursday? She matches with Abraham Davis’s roommate. Skylar Gabriel is falling for the wrong guy—she just doesn’t realize it yet.Why?BECAUSE ABE DAVIS IS A LIAR.
