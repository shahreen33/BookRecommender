Miss Grace Weston has read countless books involving courtship and romance. Putting her knowledge into practice, she offers her assistance in finding a match for her sister, declaring herself an expert in romance. She is well-read on the subject, after all.  When a bargain between sisters is struck, Grace is unable to resist a challenge. She must prove her expertise by gaining a proposal, one she plans to reject, from the man whose fleeting flirtation left her heart in ruin years before: Lord Ramsbury, the next Earl of Coventry.  But Lord Ramsbury's pride does not take well to rejection, especially when he learns he must marry to keep his inheritance. And so he undertakes a challenge of his own: He will change Grace’s mind. In a battle of pride and proposals, his heart becomes more involved than he ever thought possible. To win the battle and Grace’s heart, he must employ his most harmful weapon.  But what is so harmful about a bit of romance?  Romancing Lord Ramsbury is a stand-alone sweet regency romance, part of the Brides of Brighton series.  Other books in the series...
