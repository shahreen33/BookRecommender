"Ping" is a short story written by Samuel Beckett in French (originally "Bing") in 1966, and later translated into English by the author and published in 1967. David Lodge has described it as: "the rendering of the consciousness of a person confined in a small, bare, white room, a person who is evidently under extreme duress, and probably at the last gasp of life."
