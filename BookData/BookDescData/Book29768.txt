Che Guevara's legend is unmatched in the modern world. Since his assassination in 1967 at the age of 39, the Argentine revolutionary has become an internationally famed icon, as revered as he is controversial. A Marxist ideologue, he sought to end global inequality by bringing down the American capitalist empire through armed guerrilla warfare - and has few rivals in the Cold War era as an apostle of change.In Che: A Revolutionary Life, Jon Lee Anderson and José Hernández reveal the man behind the myth, creating a complex portrait of this passionate idealist. Adapted from Anderson's masterwork, Che transports us from young Ernesto's medical school days to the battlefields of the Cuban revolution; from his place of power alongside Castro to his disastrous sojourn in the Congo, and his violent end in Bolivia.Through renowned Mexican artist José Hernández's drawings, we feel the bullets fly past in Cuba; smell the smoke of Castro's cigars; and scrutinize the face of the weary guerrilla as he is called 'Comandante' for the first time. With astonishing precision, colour, and drama, Che makes us first-hand witnesses to the revolutionary life and times of this historic figure. Combining Anderson's unprecedented access and research with Hernández's emotionally gripping artwork, Che resurrects the man for a new generation of readers.
