From the New York Times Bestselling Author that brought you The Resistance comes this dirty-talking, sexy standalone.Because first love deserves a second chanceOne month.One movie.One shot at a second chance.I fell madly in love at first sight with Jane Lewis. The girl with bright blue eyes, a pretty smile, and great ass owned my heart. I thought she was happy with the status quo, but ten years later, I foolishly let her go. Despite dating other women, no one compares to my first love. We are meant to be together, and I’m going to try my damnedest to convince her of that.Luke Anders tricked me. The deal was sealed before I knew he was behind it. We agreed to be just friends. Simple. Easy. But it’s not just the weather that’s hot in Texas. I was a fool to think I could resist him. He knows how to work his charms and those kissable lips, that great jaw, and biceps. We are here to work, but he has become downright distracting. I’m strong. I can handle one month of his flirtatious sexual torture. But if I happen to fall in bed with that sexy bastard for a night, or three, does that make me weak? Asking for a friend, of course. I guess I’m about to find out when love gets messy, it’s not just the talk that’s dirty.
