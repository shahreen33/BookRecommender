A psychotic kidnapper with a gun. A blindfolded ride to a ruthless drug dealer's compound. Torture. A slow death. These were the things that were waiting for me in the parkign lot while I worked the evening shift of what was sure to be my last day on earth. Then, he came in for dinner.He had a loud Harley-Davidson, a dry sense of humor, a contagious laugh, and seven friends. All he wanted was an enchilada dinner. But. He was my only hope. So, I handed him his meal, gestured to the parking lot, and told him my story. As he sauntered toward the parking lot no differently than he would have walked into a bar, I wondered just who this man could be. Finding the answer to that question wasn't as easy as a person might think. But it was the best ride of my life. ATAND-ALONE, HEA, NO CHEATING, NO ABUSE
