Stay away from mages. It was a singular phrase my father had ingrained in me from the time of my birth. Sorry, dad. I have a feeling that is going to be a f*cking problem. You have to understand… my life has been bland at best. Everything in my life, every single day, has been scripted, organized, and neat. Calm, cool, and collected. The problem? It wasn’t real. I wasn’t like the other witches in my father’s coven. I had a chaotic storm growing inside of me and the moment these mages stepped into the picture, it began to escape. My perfect image of my life shattered. Everything seemed to pale in comparison to them. Their magic was exotic and powerful. Their pull on me nearly… well, magical. But what are these men hiding? Why are they in Seattle at my high school? More importantly, what in the heck do they want with me? I have a feeling nothing will ever be the same after meeting them. They say it only takes a singular moment to change everything. No one tells you what to do after!  Join Nova on her 9 book series adventure!
