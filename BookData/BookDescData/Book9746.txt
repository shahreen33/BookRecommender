Three people win a competition in a Genealogy magazine and are invited to spend a few days at the Surrey estate of Nobel prize winning scientist and entrepreneur Professor Pyle. Wide-boy Nathan from Manchester is there only for the prize money; his entry an error as he was only trying to find the names of his mother’s grandparents for her. Middle-aged Carla from London is the genealogy nut, and only too happy to get away from her slob of a husband. Jada in San Diego, entered the competition while on holiday in England finding where her people originated from. At the professor’s mansion they are stunned to be offered the chance to travel back in time and set eyes upon three long-dead ancestors. They are given three wishes (Genie in the title). For differing reasons they all agree to go. They have ten minutes at a time to see their ancestor at some point during that person’s life.
