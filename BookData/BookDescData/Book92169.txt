From the neon strip of Little Vietnam to a desolate Albertsons parking lot, 15 Views of Orlando takes the reader on a secret tour of the City Beautiful. Told by 15 authors in a series of loosely linked fiction, the story is a (successful) experiment in setting, theme and community. The book also features interviews with Philip F. Deaver, Lindsay Hunter and six other contributors, as well as a Florida Lit manifesto by John King.All the proceeds from books sales will benefit Page 15, a local childrenâ€™s literacy nonprofit that provides free tutoring and creative writing programs to Orlando public school students.Limited run.
