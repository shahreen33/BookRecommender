As if one evil twin wasn’t bad enough, now there are two of them, plotting their way to the top in a bid to squash Emily and her friends on the show jumping circuit. Jess is the back stabber while Amber is the one to dominate in the show ring. The stakes have been raised and now everyone is on guard, training their hearts out to stay on top.  Emily has been invited to go and work with Patrick and his trainer. It’s the opportunity of a lifetime, the trainer someone who once coached the Irish Olympic team. But that puts a strain on her relationship with Jordan and no matter how many times she tells him that it’s about the horses and furthering her career and nothing else, he doesn’t believe her and is going to take a lot of convincing to get over his heart break.  But if Emily can really knuckle down and put in the work, there is a chance that she can beat Amber and Jess and not have them overshadow her at shows. And with Patrick dangling the offer of a new ride in front of her like a carrot, a horse imported from Ireland who can jump anything you point him at, the temptation is too great to say no. But will it ruin things between Emily and Jordan forever or does absence really make the heart grow fonder?
