Listen, listen to the wind and stone. Listen, listen to the sounds of old. Listen, listen as my hopes are drowned. Listen, listen to the sounds that bullets make of blood and bones. Where will you run today? How will you ever get away?‚Äù  This is NOT a romance. This is a ride.  Blood and Bone  The hollow sound of a casing hitting the floor. The clicking of heels walking in a misty alley. The ability to tie a cherry stem with her tongue. A haunting song no one else knows. That's all that's left of Jane's memories.  What would you do if the life you lived was a lie, and everyone knew but you? Where do you run when there is no one on your side? Jane discovers that deep inside her mind there is a map. What she doesn't know is that there is also a man who will do anything to get it.  But what he doesn't know is that Jane hasn't always been honest about the things she remembers. There are paces inside of Jane that even she doesn't like to go.  What would you do if the secret you kept was the only thing keeping you alive?  But keeping it meant someone else had to die.
