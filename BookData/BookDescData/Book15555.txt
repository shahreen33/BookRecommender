"It was done. Ava Cosgrove, Maiden of Arcadia was no more. Now, she was simply Ava, Wildlander Tribute Bride."Ava has been given as bride to the men of the Wildlands, a harsh, unforgiving place where Dark creatures roamed free and peace only a memory. Her virginity taken in public ceremony, she's now a woman of the Wildlands, the wife to a Clan of four. Her body aching from her first possession, Ava initially fears her new life. Her Clanmates, though, prove to be tender and caring, seeing to her every need out of the bedchamber and lovingly awakening her flesh inside of it. These mates - powerful, unbending Blaise; fierce but sensitive Jodah; mischevious, lighthearted Daven and gentle, masterful healer Killian - all stir her in their own ways, yet she struggles to come to terms with the idea of falling in love with more than one man.Ava slowly works to adjust to this strange new place, in a culture that reveres, rather than disdains women, where magic is not unheard-of, and violent death is an accepted part of life. As a rash of attacks from the fearsome Dark creatures that her Wildlander warriors are sworn to fight threatens both her community and her own Clan's lives, Ava must look into herself and find strength she did not know she possessed to fight alongside her Clan. Through tragedy, betrayal, forgiveness, and failure, Ava learns not only that love does not fit into the tidy definitions she'd once believed, but that she might be capable of far much more than she dreamed.
