Mitch Weatherby was at the top of his game. A scientist at Los Alamos, he was married to the love of his life - until a botched government raid left his wife dead in his arms and him accused of constructing an illicit nuclear weapon in his basement. Though Mitch knows he is innocent of the charges, evidence says otherwise and he's convicted and sent to prison for the rest of his life. So when black-clad commandos abduct Mitch during a prison transfer it feels more like a rescue. Until he learns that his saviors are from North Korea.Transported to a secret nuclear lab in the rugged mountains of the Workers Paradise, Mitch is given a choice- and after what his country did to him, he's in no mood to be tortured to death. And his captors are nothing like he thought, lampooned by the same media that labeled him a terrorist. Industrious and hard working, most of them are just trying to avoid malnutrition and the secret police. The only person who doesn't accept him is a fanatical and equally beautiful scientist, Chun Hyon-hui, who's mixed North Korean and Western blood leaves her ostracized by all.Forced to work together for the good of the fatherland Hyon-hui begins to realize that perhaps her zeal is misplaced, and Mitch's unexpected affection for the brilliant scientist begins to melt his stony heart. When the North finally tests their bomb, developed with Mitch's help, he knows that he must somehow undo what he has done and escape with the woman he's come to love, impossible as it seems. But how can Mitch break out of the most repressive nation on Earth, and will Hyon-hui even want to go with him?Nearly a decade of research went into writing The Silla Project, providing a glimpse into the nuclear program and the political tyranny of North Korea, one of the most threatening and enigmatic nations on Earth.
