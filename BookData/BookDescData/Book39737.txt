TWO ARCHERS. ONE-SHOT. Kate Bishop, A.K.A. Hawkeye, finds herself smack-dab in the middle of a battle royal between the world's most skilled sharpshooters — including an inexplicably young Clint Barton, A.K.A. the OTHER Hawkeye. The prize? Bragging rights for being named the best, of course — oh, and you get to stay alive! Unfortunately for Clint, several of his competitors are villains he's taken down, making HIM a primary target. So, on top of figuring out where and WHEN she is, Kate's got to find a way to win this little contest of skills and keep her not-so-old pal Clint out of the crosshairs… easy, peasy.
