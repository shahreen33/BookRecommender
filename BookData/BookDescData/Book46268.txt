French philosopher, political activist, and religious mystic Simone Weil was little known when she died young in 1943. In 1952 this English translation of her writings accelerated her posthumous fame and influence. Written at the onset of World War II, when her health was deteriorating and her social activism was giving way to spiritual introspection, this is truly the masterwork of a master mind. 248 pp.
