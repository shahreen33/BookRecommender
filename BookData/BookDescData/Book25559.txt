New city. New job. New life.Recently divorced single-mom, Sierra Torres’ life is a hot mess. And now, her car’s been stolen. When she reports the theft, a tall and broad-shouldered blast from her past walks in. Years ago, he disappeared without a trace after a perfect seven minutes in heaven. The provider. The supporter. The survivor. Police officer Matthew Hunter lives to serve and protect, not only the people of Baltimore City, but what’s left of his family. He’s the responsible one—the reliable cop. Seeing Sierra again ignites a fire in him he thought he extinguished a long time ago. One look into her fiery brown eyes and it all comes back. But Sierra's not interested in romance—just a little fun. However, hearts have a mind of their own. Feelings deepen each time they see each other. Soon, that’s not enough. They crave more. But when things begin to unravel after their past catches up with them, are their seven minutes in heaven over for good?
