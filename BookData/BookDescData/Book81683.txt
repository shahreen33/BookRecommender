Based on Mixon's work as a successful independent fiction editor, The Art &amp; Craft of Fiction: A Practitioner's Manual brings together in one place everything you need to know about writing a novel, an in-depth exploration of the myriad aspects of creating fiction in a warm, entertaining voice that welcomes you into the greater fellowship of all writers. Victoria Mixon's The Art &amp; Craft of Fiction should be on your writer 's shelf between Anne Lamott 's Bird By Bird and John Gardner 's On Becoming A Novelist. Read it all the way through first, then pick it up again and again whenever you re stuck and need encouragement, advice, and witty examples on the process to get on with the hard work. You are not alone, not with this book to set you on your way each writing day. Lucia Orth, author of Baby Jesus Pawn Shop
