She’s a temptation I just can’t resist…My business is security. I protect other people—sometimes at my own expense.It’s the only way to explain how I got talked into playing fake fiancé for my best friend’s little sister.Now I’m seeing little Samantha Watson through new eyes. Instead of the little girl I used to tease, I’m up close and personal with a stunning woman whose curves and heat and heart-stopping smile rocket straight to my heart, not to mention parts south.I’ve never minded going above and beyond for a job. Except playing the smitten lover doesn’t feel like acting anymore.Despite all my experience, I’m the one who forgot to secure my heart.The only rule for this job was to walk away at the end.But maybe this time—for the first time—I’m going to break the rules.
