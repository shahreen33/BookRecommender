Jackson Solt is the Founder and CEO of Solt Industries. With his jet-black hair and steel blue eyes, he’s also the hottest man Celeste has ever seen. That's also one of the reasons why she needs to stay away from him.  Celeste knows she shouldn’t lust after her boss. Being his Personal Assistant is a great job, but she wants so much more from him. When she senses Jackson feels the same heat toward her, she decides to test a theory... and takes a risk that could cost her dearly.  *This book contains explicit language and sexual content.
