Two hours ago, when I walked into this school for the first time, the sun was shining, the birds were singing and, apart from a knot in my guts the size of Tasmania, life was great.Now here I am, locked in a stationery cupboard.Rowena wants to be friends but the other kids don't.Is it because she's just stuffed a frog into Darryn Peck's mouth? Or is it because of her dad? How can she tell him that his shirts, and his habit of singing in public, are wrecking her life?It's not easy - especially when you can't speak.
