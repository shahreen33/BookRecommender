Five years after their wedding, and life is good for Renzo and Lucia. If not a little stressful. They’re always on the move—Lucia with her gallery, and Renzo being an assassin for The League. At the chance to slow life down with a week-long trip for just the two of them to Bali, they can’t pass it up. But even Bali will change things … It’s one more step toward forever. *Forever is a companion to the Renzo + Lucia series. It is not written as a standalone to the series and shouldn’t be read as such.
