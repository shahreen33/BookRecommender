The rosary is much more than an optional Catholic devotion for the old and dying. In fact, it is a vibrant and powerful intercessory tool in the hands of valiant spiritual warriors. From the moment Our Lady entrusted it to St. Dominic early in the thirteenth century, the rosary has been at the heart of authentic Catholic devotion. And yet it has also been an indispensable weapon in the hands of intercessors and those who actively resist the workings of the devil. In The Rosary, Johnnette Benkovic, founder and president of Living His Life Abundantly and the founder of Women of Grace, teams up with Thomas K. Sullivan, the creator of the Warrior Rosary, to explore why the rosary is the weapon for such a time as this. Together, theyâ€™ve gathered some of the most astonishing historical and contemporary accounts of victories associated with the rosary, along with their own inspiring personal experiences. Readers will discover insights that will enhance their own experience of the rosary, including special prayers based on the lives and writings of the saints who understood the power of this classic Catholic devotion.
