When the recession hits, this witty behind-the-scenes peek reveals the lifestyles of out-of-work cats. How do cats cope when there's no work for them? How do they spend their leisure time? That's the topic of this book. (They're playing a lot more pinball for one thing!) In happier times, cats could find work anywhere. From catching mice to making antique shops look homey, to starring in commercials, to sitting by the cash register giving customers hostile stares -- the Jobs were out there, and all an enterprising cat had to do was look for them. All that can change with the flash of a whisker. For every cat lucky enough to collect a regular paycheck, there are dozens more sitting at home -- scratching furniture, shedding, and waiting for jobs that may never come their way again. With funny, full-color photographs and humorous captions, Hard Times for Cats will appeal to anyone who's ever had either a cat or a job.
