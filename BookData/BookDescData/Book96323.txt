  A comprehensive, natural approach to treating acute and chronic Lyme disease, from a leading naturopathic physician who has managed his symptoms for more than fifteen years.
Lyme disease is one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases in the United States, and millions of people worldwide suffer from its shape-shifting symptoms. Now, in The Lyme Solution, Dr. Darin Ingels shares his revolutionary approach to treating and healing acute and chronic Lyme. Drawing on his experience as a naturopathic physician who has treated thousands of cases, and as a patient, Ingels reveals that Lyme is an autoimmune disease as much as it is an infection. Conventional treatments too often rely on toxic doses of antibiotics that weaken your body and worsen symptoms, instead of boosting your ability to fight for your health. Including the latest research about the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme, Ingels's uniquely holistic approach provides a path to wellness by fortifying the microbiome, enhancing the immune system, and strengthening the body's ability to heal from within. The Lyme Solution offers a simple, five-step plan, including:* the most effective early treatment and prevention measures to avoid contracting the disease or stop it in its tracks;* an Immune Boosting Diet and list of herbal supplements that will increase immunity and reduce inflammation;* guidelines for when and how to use antibiotics as an effective part of your treatment plan;* tools to identify and eliminate conditions that mimic Lyme disease or exacerbate your symptoms.Whether you are facing acute or chronic Lyme, or undiagnosed autoimmune symptoms, the natural, whole-body approach of The Lyme Solution will help you permanently recover your health, and reclaim your life.
