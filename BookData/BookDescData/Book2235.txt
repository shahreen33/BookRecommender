This collection of quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung forms an intriguing series of political ideas – all from one of the world’s most notorious leaders. Chairman Mao was born in 1893, and was the founding father of the People’s Republic of China. He governed the country from its establishment in 1949 until his death. He is, of course, a deeply controversial figure yet a highly important individual in world history. There are as many who celebrate as deplore him; most of the former praising his modernisations and improvements in housing, health care and education, whilst others have labelled him a dictator who has systematically abused human rights and caused the death of millions through starvation, executions and forced labour. This text forms the thoughts of Chairman Mao Tse-Tung on issues as varied as ‘the communist party’, ‘classes and class struggle’, ‘socialism and communism’, ‘women’, ‘the correct handling of contradictions among the people’, ‘war and peace’, ‘the people’s war’, ‘political work’ and the ‘relations between officers and men.’
