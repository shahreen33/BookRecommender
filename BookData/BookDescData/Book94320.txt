Irtha Vimbi is trapped. For years she has been stuck living off the river that runs beneath the city of Mohii, hiding from those who hunt her brother, a boy with magic capable of reshaping the world. Her only escape is the motherseed, a drug that puts her in the mind of an animal and gives her the freedom to explore the nearby jungle in safety... at a cost.  But when her brother's power is released and the city of Mohii is left in ruin, Irtha and her brother set out to find a new home in the City of a Thousand Faces, a place that can fulfill anyone's dream so long as they are willing to pay its price.  With a lucrative bounty placed on their heads, they must stay one step ahead of their hunters on a road through a jungle where unimaginable predators lurk, plants can speak, and the canopy grows so densely that even daylight cannot find a way through. It's a long, dangerous path, but if they survive it, Irtha might be able to find what she has been looking for all along... a way to defeat her addiction and keep her brother safe. A way to finally be free.  Brimming with originality, action, and memorable characters, the City of a Thousand Faces is the first book in the Welkin Duology, a series set in Chilongua, a unique fantasy world inspired by the abundant life and terrors found in the jungle.
