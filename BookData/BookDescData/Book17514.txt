The twin dragon princes, Aiden and Adrian, are on Earth with one purpose; to find their mate. Fortunately, with the help of their dragon, they find her. Unfortunately, she is being stalked by her ex who takes crazy to a new level. Evangelina has had creepy notes taped to her door, her apartment broken into and trashed, and most notably, an attempt made on her life. Thankfully, there are twin PI’s who are more than willing to help her. Too bad they’re crazy too. Oddly enough, it’s not that they are shapeshifters who unite to become one, huge, charming, chivalrous, two-headed dragon that is the hardest part for her to believe. Nope. What she can’t believe is that there are two sexy as sin men trying to convince her that she is their mate; their one and only for all time. Ha! The princes are going to need all the help that they can get to woo their mate, and to keep her safe.
