November 1814
Nothing is fair in love and war. . .With Napoleon Bonaparte exiled to Elba, the elite of Europe have gathered at the glittering Congress of Vienna--princes, ambassadors, the Russian tsar--negotiating the fate of the Continent by day and flirting and waltzing by night. But on one of those candle-warmed evenings, Princess Tatiana, the most beautiful and talked about woman in Vienna, is found murdered during an ill-timed rendezvous with three of her most powerful conquests. . . Suzanne Rannoch has tried to ignore rumors that her new husband, Malcolm, is also one of Tatiana's lovers. As a protégé of France's Prince Talleyrand and an attaché for Britain's Lord Castlereagh, Malcolm sets out to investigate the murder. He needs Suzanne's unique skills and knowledge if he is to succeed. The complex dance between husband and wife in the search for the truth tests their marriage, their liberty, and their very lives. No one's secrets are safe, and the future of Europe may hang in the balance. . .
