Picking up from his earlier collection "Sleepwalk", and the precursor to his award-winning "Shortcomings", the four stories in "Summer Blonde" are quintessential Tomine. Memorably featuring characters such as Neil, Carlo and Hillary Chan, among others, these are beautiful and haunting tales that illustrate with great sympathy the loneliness and bleak humour of modern life.
