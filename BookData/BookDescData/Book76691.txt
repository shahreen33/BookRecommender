With The Green Songbook any teacher can blend important environmental studies with singing and playing the guitar for elementary and middle school students. Each song in this collection has been selected and organized by chapter to focus on different aspects of eco-sustainability. Whether you are looking for just the right song to sing around a campfire, teach a science lesson, celebrate nature, lead a social change discussion, or inspire good habits with children, you will find songs to love and share in this book. Each chapter is prefaced with important notes for teachers and parents, and reference and research information. Most of the songs are demonstrated on the included mp3 CD and all music is arranged for beginning level guitarists.
