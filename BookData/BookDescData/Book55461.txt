***Can be read as a standalone***Julie Prescott is the life of every party. She’s loud, witty, and uses her body and pretty face to get whatever she wants. She’s never had a problem hooking up with guys, or ditching them when they don’t live up to her standards. Julie has a list of exes a mile long and a reputation to match, but she’s looking for more than just a degree in college. She’s looking for Mr. Perfect. Ben Sutherland is the enigmatic bassist of a popular local band. Born blind, Ben depends on his other senses to help him understand the world around him on a deeper level. His sultry voice and musical talent might make it impossible for him to go unnoticed on campus, but Ben isn’t looking for fame or groupies. He’s looking to perfect his music. Julie’s been lusting after Ben for months and when she finally meets him at a party, her confidence is shaken when she discovers she can’t use her physical beauty to charm him. Even though she's always relied on her looks, it’s her personality that wins Ben over and he’s determined to show her that she’s more than just a pretty face. But falling in love is the easy part. Family lies, a questionable reputation, and the chance of a lifetime threaten to tear Ben and Julie apart. Can they trust the futures they’ve chosen or will they take the biggest risk of all and listen to the sound of their own hearts?
