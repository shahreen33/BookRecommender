It’s going to hit you below the belt.  You’re going to reach for the  closest stand-in lover you can  find &amp; you’re going to make  a home in their body &amp;  you’re going to pretend your  childhood memories are hung  in his chest &amp; you skinned your knee  tripping over the curve of his arm  &amp; you have always been here.
