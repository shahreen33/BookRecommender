Every boyfriend she has ever had breaks up with her the moment they meet him. It’s not because of his eight-pack, or his panty shredding smile. No, the reason Breezy remains single is because Max is her best friend and roommate.When Breezy’s new boyfriend dumps her after meeting Max for the first time, Breezy is determined to cure her boyfriend woes by challenging Max to a bet: she can’t click her mouse, he can’t wrestle his snake, and neither one can say the word sex or they lose. It was a simple game of abstinence, until Max decides to tempt Breezy into a hilarious game of innuendos. Now, the only thing harder than Max’s “wood”, is figuring out just where their friendship lies after all bets are off. One thing’s for certain . . . All’s fair in sex, love, and innuendos.
