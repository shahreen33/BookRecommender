The small Montana town of Timberton tends to bring magic to the holidays, especially for guests of the local hotel. Resident artist and chef Mist has a way of touching people's lives with exquisite cuisine, imaginative art, and her own ethereal nature.  When a nearby theatre burns down just before Christmas, cast members of The Nutcracker arrive at the Timberton Hotel with only a sliver of holiday joy. Camaraderie, compassion, and shared inspiration combine to help at least one hidden dream come true. As with every Christmas season in Timberton, this year's guests will face the New Year with a renewed sense of hope.
