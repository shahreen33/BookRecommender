When an accident on the newly-established Martian colony places the lives of the colonists there at grave risk, ageing astronaut David Longrie is persuaded to pilot a patched-up spacecraft on a rescue mission. But space has its own perils, and soon David and his crew are fighting not just for the colonists' lives, but for their own survival.A novella originally published in the June 2006 edition of Analog Science Fiction and Fact, America's longest-running science fiction magazine, Puncher's Chance is an exciting and cautionary tale about the dangers—and necessities—of travelling to other worlds, and how extreme circumstances make cooperation possible between even the bitterest of adversaries.
