  Why you've never been able to lose weight, and how that can change now
 Everything you believe about how to lose weight is wrong. Weight gain and obesity are driven by hormones--in everyone--and only by understanding the effects of insulin and insulin resistance can we achieve lasting weight loss. In this highly readable and provocative book, Dr. Jason Fung sets out an original, robust theory of obesity that provides startling insights into proper nutrition. In addition to his five basic steps, a set of lifelong habits that will improve your health and control your insulin levels, Dr. Fung explains how to use intermittent fasting to break the cycle of insulin resistance and reach a healthy weight--for good. "Fung zeroes in on why insulin resistance has become so prevalent and offers specific outside-the-box solutions that have emerged as the key to maximizing health." --Jimmy Moore, author, Keto Clarity and Cholesterol Clarity
