This edition covers the course in around 1,000 pages. It includes additions carefully selected from hundreds of cases decided between 2009 and 2012. It also includes additions from recent statutes and authorities such as the Restatement Third of Torts. New cases illustrate core negligence issues such as the emergency doctrine, cause in fact, proximate cause, comparative fault, and assumed risk. New cases also address federal preemption, charitable immunity, tort duties of a contracting party, punitive damages and specialized fields, such as medical malpractice, products liability, governmental immunities, and duty to protect the plaintiff from others.
