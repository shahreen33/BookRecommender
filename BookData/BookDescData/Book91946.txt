This Explorer’s Guide tells you where to find abbeys, monasteries and churches throughout Great Britain, and also tells you about their history, architecture, builders and inhabitants—both past and present—and about the religious, political and social history of the British Isles. The first section is an extensive glossary that covers hundreds of details, including terminology, daily life, relifious life, and education, and the second part is a Gazetteer that provides separate listings for abbeys, etc. in England, Scotland, and Wales. Illustrated with numerous black-and-white line drawings, mostly copied from medieval manuscripts.
