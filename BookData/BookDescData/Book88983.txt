Rock. Freakin’. Hard.  That’s me. Mathew Barton. I party like a rock star, play like an All Star, and f*ck like a porn star.  There’s not a woman I can’t make mine, but the only one I want is off limits.  I went on tour to get Selena Torres out of my head. All it did was make me crave her more.  Now she’s taken, the property of a guy I used to call my best friend.  It doesn’t help he’s her agent.  But I see right through him. He only wants her for one thing, and it ain’t her hot curves and parted lips.  I should have stayed away, but now I’m home I’ve got no choice. I have to protect her.  I won’t stop until she’s in my arms, my bed, thrashing and crying out my name with that honey sweet voice.  Nothing is going to keep us apart—not that prick, not a contract, not a god damn army.  One way or another, I’m going to make Selena sing again.  Amped is a full-length bad boy romance with a happily ever after and no cheating. For a limited time, it also includes bestselling novel Wrecked as a bonus.  FREE BAD BOY EBOOK!
