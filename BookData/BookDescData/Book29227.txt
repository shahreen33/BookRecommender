A powerful thriller about the explosive intersection of love, race, and justice from a writer and producer of the Emmy winning Fox TV show Empire.East Texas: it's an unforgiving landscape where justice for all can be hard to come by-a fact that Darren Matthews, an African-American Texas Ranger knows all too well. Darren made it out alive, but returned to the only place he'll ever call home to fight those who forced him to flee. When the struggle lands him in hot water, Darren takes a trip along Highway 59 to Lark, where two murders-an African-American lawyer from Chicago and a local white woman-have stirred up a hornet's nest of resentment. Darren must solve the crimes before Lark's long simmering racial fault lines erupt. A rural noir suffused with the music of Texas, BLUEBIRD, BLUEBIRD, is an exhilarating, timely novel about the collision of race and justice in America.
