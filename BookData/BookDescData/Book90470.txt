As a child, David McKinstry always knew one thing: he wanted to be a father. However, as a single—and secretly gay—man, David's only option was to adopt. Lying about his sexuality on adoption applications, David was consistently met with a resounding "no."Challenging the Canadian government to champion his cause, in 199X officials finally agreed to use David as a test case to see if a gay man could adopt internationally. All thirteen applications were met with the same response: "we don't give kids to fags." Undeterred, and facing unfathomable levels of stigma, bigotry, and red tape from global adoption agencies, social workers, and politicians, David continued to advocate for change. Fighting for his dream, and with a little lie from the Canadian government, David became a true "rebel with a cause" by becoming the first gay Canadian man approved to adopt internationally and then, with his husband, the first to co-adopt. Rebel Dad: Triumphing Over Bureaucracy to Adopt Two Orphans Born Worlds Apart recounts David's emotional and inspiring journey as he navigates both coming to terms with his own sexuality and fighting to create a family he could call his own.
