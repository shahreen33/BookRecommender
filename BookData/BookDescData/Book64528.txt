Similar to the bestselling Sociopath Next Door comes a unique look at the psychopaths among us and how our society--from businesses and governments to religions--encourages and rewards psychopathic behavior, and what average citizens can do to survive and thrive when we must live with, learn from, or be led by sociopaths. Psychiatrists estimate that 1 percent of the adult population are psychopaths. That's about two million Americans. And they are our bosses, our politicians, our priests, and our neighbors. And they are running our economy and our lives.     Every day in the news we hear about people in positions of power doing deplorable things--in business, politics, and government, from sexual harassment to polluting the environment to covering up crimes. And it's no wonder considering a small percentage of people wield a large amount of power, and that these very same people fit the definition of a "psychopath."  A highly engaging and gripping read, Cameron Reilly's book adds to our growing understanding of sociopaths with a detailed analysis of how our society encourages and rewards psychopathic tendencies, and how, because of this, psychopaths the world over have risen to power. Using historical references to pop culture examples, Reilly offers a field guide to psychopaths--how to spot them and how to outmaneuver them so you can keep your sanity intact. This is the first-of-its-kind book to examine the shocking evidence and then suggest practical solutions for saving us all.
