I would say that my life changed as soon as those gunshots went off, but in reality everything changed the moment Leo and Greyson loaded that decapitated body into the truck back in Donnely.Now I am in a place I do not recognize, with people I had once seen as enemies. They are telling me that all of this is up to me, and here I am just wishing I was in my basement with a quil between my fingers.Though I know what cards I've been dealt; I know I never had a say in this. I wasn't born free like I had always thought. I had been created for a purpose and if I want to keep Killian safe - I need to do this.It has always been about him.The Ghost and the Darkness Volume 1, begins immediately where Fallocaust left off. Reaver and Killian have left Aras behind and are now deep in the greywastes hiding from King Silas with the help of some unlikely friends. Though their time living in safety is short-lived - for Elish Dekker is a man of many plans, and even more secrets.
