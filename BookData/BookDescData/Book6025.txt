Conventional wisdom says you can’t love two people, but I’ve proved that wrong. Because I did.  I’ve loved two boys in my lifetime. Two boys I grew up with; boys I laughed with and cried with and eventually fell in love with.  Our love morphed into an overwhelming devotion eventually opening our eyes, bodies and hearts to a very different type of love. A Forbidden Love. A Love others didn't understand. A Doomed Love.  They say that the heart isn’t meant for that kind of duplicity, but my stupid stubborn heart never listened. Loving them was a necessity, something akin to breathing. Nothing could keep us apart. Until that fateful night - the night that tore my heart into two equal, broken parts.  ***NOTE: Reckless Youth is Part One of a three-part, epic, MFM love story that spans the course of 25 years. It has drama, love, betrayal, sacrifice and of course, lots of steamy MFM action.
