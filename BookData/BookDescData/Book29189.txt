THE AWARD-WINNING AND CRITICALLY-ACCLAIMED MASTER OF HORROR RETURNS WITH A PAIR OF CHILLING TALES - BOTH NEVER-BEFORE PUBLISHED IN PRINT OR AUDIO - THAT EXAMINE THE VIOLENCE AND DEPRAVITY OF THE HUMAN CONDITION.Bringing together his acclaimed novella "The Sea Dream It Is the Sky" and an all-new short novel - "My Heart Struck Sorrow," John Hornor Jacobs turns his fertile imagination to the evil within the human soul.A brilliant mix of the psychological and supernatural, blending the acute insight of Roberto Bolaño and the eerie imagination of H.P. Lovecraft, "The Sea Dreams It Is the Sky" examines life in a South American dictatorship. Centered on the journal of a poet-in-exile and his failed attempts at translating a maddening text, it is told by a young woman trying to come to grips with a country that nearly devoured itself.In "My Heart Struck Sorrow," a librarian discovers a recording from the Deep South - which may be the musical stylings of the Devil himself.Breathtaking and haunting, "A Lush and Seething Hell" is a terrifying and exhilarating journey into darkness, an odyssey into the deepest reaches of ourselves that compels us to confront secrets best left hidden.©2019 John Hornor Jacobs
