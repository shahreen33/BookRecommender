Underwood, Scotch, and Wry is a snarky look at social media through the eyes of a Luddite college professor .  Arthur enjoys drink, the company of his female TAs, and generally being a pain in the butt for the dean of the English department. He has tenure. He hates computers.   The dean hates him.  Watch as Arthur and the dean engage in a angst filled battle to end (or save) his job. If you like social media, blogging, and mockery, youâ€™ll enjoy Underwood, Scotch, and Wry.
