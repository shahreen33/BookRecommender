From Eisner Award-winning writer Greg Rucka and acclaimed artist Matthew Southworth comes a new Stumptown mystery! Dex Parios has finally opened her own office, and her first case is to find rock star Mim Bracca's baby - her prized guitar - which disappeared after her band Tailhook's Portland show. Mim has no leads, and she doesn't want to go to the police, but Dex needs the case, and besides, it shouldn't be that hard to find a missing guitar. As long as the D.E.A. doesn't get involved ... or the Skinheads.
