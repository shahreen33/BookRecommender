Although these women have lived in every culture, few have known of their existence-until now. Born onto a planet in the throes of environmental and social crises, Lila's life implodes when her mother, Dominique, suddenly dies, and Lila is left with a mysterious illuminated manuscript that reveals that Lila is both a priestess and a genetic experiment called the Metamorphosis Project, a fusion of alchemy and magic designed to rebalance humanity's relationship with the Mother Earth. In search of her sister-priestesses and further understanding of her origins, Lila journeys from the mythic countryside of Glastonbury to Delphi, to an ancient hidden temple in the center of Paris, and finally, into the heart of the Amazon jungle. On her quest, Lila learns how to use her mutation to benefit Life. She also must decide between two passionate loves: a wise and beautiful sister-priestess, Rhea, and a mysterious man Theo, who has been waiting for her for millennia.Explore More: www.GaiaCodex.com~~~(O)~~~~EARLY REVIEWS: Sarah Drew's Gaia Codex has the ring of truth disguised as fiction.
