It’s the brightest light that casts the deepest shadows…  Magic, blood, and politics hide an enemy the pack never saw coming. One with more power than anyone understands.  Enemies are closing in on all sides, but they’re nothing more than a distraction to hide the real threat. It isn’t just the pack at risk –– not anymore.  Magic itself is being threatened.  Amber and her pack are trapped in the middle of a centuries long war, and the time has come to pick a side.  But it’s a choice she won’t be able to take back.  Nothing is as it seems. Trust is a valuable commodity that is sorely lacking in an increasingly dangerous world.  Amber must step up and take her place in the game, shattering illusions and pulling the truth from the shadows.
