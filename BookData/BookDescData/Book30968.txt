In KILLER HEAT, Assistant District Attorney Alex Cooper confronts a serial killer whose deadly exploits lead her through the little-known islands surrounding Manhattan. It's August in the city and just as she's claiming victory in a rape trial, she gets the call: the body of a young woman has been found in an abandoned building. The brutality of the beating is disturbing enough, but when a second body is found off the Belt Parkway, the city's top brass want the killer found fast, before the tabloids can start churning out ghoulish headlines.Once again Linda Fairstein brilliantly orchestrates a mix of cutting-edge legal issues, New York City history, and spine-tingling suspense. And at the center of it all is Alex Cooper - stunning, single-minded, accomplished, and not to be trifled with, in or out of the courtroom.
