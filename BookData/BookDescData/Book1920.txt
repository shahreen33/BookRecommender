You’d think life couldn’t get much worse than being arrested on prom night. But you’d be wrong.No friends. My two besties, Cassie and Lila, are now officially parentally banned.No summer of freedom. Instead, I’ll be working at a convenience store, earning money just so I can cover bail.No future. Just a series of humiliating “rehabilitation techniques” designed to teach me a lesson.The only silver lining is Aaron—a mystery wrapped in a leather jacket and wielding car keys—who just happens to show up right when I need him. Now I only feel alive when we’re driving together, the wind in my hair.Maybe finally getting a life only happens once you think your life is over.
