Josh Groban has lauded live musical theater as his biggest artistic inspiration. Since the tender age of nine, Josh has been deeply moved by the power of the theatrical arts. His love for musical theater gently simmered while his career as a recording artist exploded. After his debut album went multiplatinum in 2001, Joshs subsequent releases led to Billboard chart toppers, sold-out world tours, myriad TV appearances, duets with musical legends such as Celine Dion and Barbra Streisand, and several Grammy nominations. Yet it was with album number seven, his passion project, that his childhood dream was realized.
