In June 1938, at eighty-two, Freud began writing this terse survey of the fundamentals of psychoanalysis. He marshals here the whole range of psychoanalytic theory &amp; therapy in lucid prose &amp; continues his open-mindedness to new departures, such as the potential of drug therapy. While the book remained unfinished, it covers the essentials of psychoanalysis.
