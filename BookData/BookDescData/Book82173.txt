This is a standalone novella. It first appeared in the Curvy Lines Boxed Set as Like a Boss.   He’s the boss. I'm the booty call…  I gave my last relationship everything I had and got shafted in return. Now I'm all about proving I have what it takes to work amongst talented designers and architects of ARC Industries, and building a better future for myself.  Then my new boss arrives, and I just know trouble will follow.  How will I prove I'm more than a smart mouth and sexy curves when I'm distracted by daydreams of the company's sexy CEO, Theo Solomon?  To make matters worse, my daydreams turn into reality, and I become Theo's booty call.  Due to my past, I'm hesitant to accept that I want more than secret rendezvous. But is Theo worth the risk?
