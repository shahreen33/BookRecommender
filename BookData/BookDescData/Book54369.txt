Kaitlyn Henderson never expected to find a one-night stand at the event she attends. But there he was and there they were. From a family of cops, and as a 911 dispatcher herself, she embraces life, taking it as it comes, understanding that the next second may be your last. She wasn’t expecting anything more than their one shared night, however he takes that as a dare and is determined to prove there is so much more between them than twenty-four hours.
