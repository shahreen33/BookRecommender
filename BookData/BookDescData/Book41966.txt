Head of the class...Garrett Daniels has this whole life thing figured out.The cocky, charismatic former high school star quarterback is an idolized football coach and "cool" teacher in the hometown where he's not just a golden boy — he's platinum. He has good friends, a great house on the lake, and the best damn sidekick a man could ask for: Snoopy, the albino beagle.Then...Callie Carpenter comes home.And knocks him right on his tight end zone.Back to school...Callie has a pretty sweet life herself...on the other side of the country. But circumstances — that she'd prefer to never speak of again — have brought her back home, helping out her parents and substitute teaching at her old high school.Now she's facing bickering, raging hormones, constant gossip, awkward weirdness, and drama galore...and that's just the teachers.Just like old times...When Garrett offers to show his former high school sweetheart the secrets of his winning teacher ways, Callie jumps at the chance - and then has to stop herself from jumping him.Good friends are all they can ever be.Or...these teachers just might end up getting schooled — hard — by love.Listening Length: 7 hours and 15 minutes
