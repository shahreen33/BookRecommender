As he battles the demons of his past, falling in love is not in Zayd’s plan…Ashima's life is a long, tiresome struggle, until a tall, tattoo flaunting stranger registers in her guest house. Hoping against hope for a ray of sunshine in her life, unbridled attraction to a stranger is not what Ashima bargains for…Will Zayd and Ashima be able to forego their past and embrace their present, even when they know that if things went wrong, all they'll be left with is a broken heart and painful memories?
