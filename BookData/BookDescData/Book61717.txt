AidenIf you asked me last month if I had a fulfilling life being single, I would have said yes. But all of that changed when I met Stella. After a drink in my restaurant bar, we shared an incredible night together. The only problem was, she was gone when I woke up the next morning. No note, no phone number, nothing. Over a month later, I still can’t get her out of my mind. Somehow, she did a number on me, turning me into such a ball of self-pity, I can't even work up the desire to move on. With no way of contacting her, I’m more than a little shocked to find her waiting in front of my door one evening.Despite my wildest hopes, she isn’t here for a repeat of our passionate night. The nature of her visit is completely unexpected, ending with a surprise that’s about to turn both of our lives upside down.One I’m not sure I’m ready for.
