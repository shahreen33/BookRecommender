Betrayed by the first woman he ever loved, James lashes out at Rowan, the man who won her heart. When James nearly kills him, he panics and strands them both far from home, leaving them to take shelter in an abandoned crematorium. But the decaying building isn’t unoccupied. When a twisted presence takes an unhealthy interest in Rowan, the guys will have to work together to escape—before their stay becomes a permanent one. The Element of Death is a 20,000-word novella.
