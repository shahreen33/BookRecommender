Lion Breed, Rule Breaker had just a few rules he didn't break. Not for anything. Not for anyone.#1. Never have sex with a woman outside his own subspecies, especially a human woman.#2. Never, at any time, accept a mission concerning a female when Jonas Wyatt stinks of a lie.#3. Run don't walk, skip or stumble. Run, hell for leather away from any female, human or breed, when his desire for her appears, in any way, to have so much as a single sign of Mating Heat.Now, the woman believes he's mated, is too helpless, to fun loving and too full of life to ever be able to protect herself, let alone aide him in protecting her.If the damned animal inside him insisted on a mate, then why pick the woman it did? One that could be struck out at, at any time?But, what he suspected was a mating, may not be. No swollen glands? No heat? Just his animal instincts rioting, pacing, irritated whenever he's away from her.Okay, he could handle that.What ensues is a fiery affair that breaks all the rules of mating heat and will eventually endanger his mate with the very rules designed to protect the breeds when Jonas learns she's possibly been working against them.
