Although the homicide detective was skeptical, he agreed with Dez that they needed to find this killer before more bodies started turning up in the City.With the help of his co-worker Martine LaChance, Dez set out to uncover the secrets hidden in the murdered girls' past. Both he and Martine believe the killer is a serial; a madman who is leaving clues that point a false trail to a Native as the killer. With the help of Spirit Water, and the aid of forces in both the spirit world and the mundane, they are determined to find the killer before more innocent girls die at his hands.(Previously published as Bad Medicine)
