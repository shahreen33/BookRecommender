Though he is his father's heir, Bartholomew spends most of his time doing a whole lot of nothing, constantly reminded that his father doesn't need his help, and his siblings definitely don't want it.When he receives word that the village back home is being plagued by a highwayman, Bart leaps at the chance to prove to his family that he can handle more responsibility, that's he's more than an irritating older brother always getting in the way.But upon his arrival, the home he remember so fondly seems long gone, replaced by strangers, murder, and an old friend who seems to be only a pale, sad shadow of the boy Bart used to knowâ€¦ Author's note: This story was once part of Deceived, it has been split off to be its own novella. As Always, if you purchase this book in the past (as part of Deceived), you've only to contact me and I'll give you the new version (ebook only).
