"I should never have asked for a night with you. This would never have happened if I'd had more willpower." Once upon a time, I was a mute captive who wished for death. Now, I'm stowed away on a yacht. Saved and taken, the thief who stole me demands my voice, my past, my everything. I won't give in. But Elder refuses to take no for an answer. He pushes and cajoles, slowly discovering who I am. Until I find out he plays the cello to escape his demons, all while his music conjures mine. He's rich, I'm bankrupt. I'm mute by choice, he's curious by nature. So many reasons why we can never work. But that doesn't stop our connection, our passion. Until one night, he ruins everything. And our relationship becomes twisted and full of sin.
