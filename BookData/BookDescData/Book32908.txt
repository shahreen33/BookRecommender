What's a girl to do when a man who's countless shades of wrong feels oh-so-right?Ambitious book editor Asha Tate is a hopeless romantic. Despite her mediocre track record with men, she believes in swooning, sighing, and the everlasting love of true soul mates. Sure, sex is okay, but she’s not someone who’s ever been driven by her animal urges. Until now. When Asha stumbles upon the scorching hot Instagram feed of someone calling himself Professor Feelgood, she falls in lust for the first time. Not only is she left panting over the professor’s insane body, but his angst-filled poetry about losing his one true love speaks straight to her soul.  Desperately in need of a bestseller for her struggling publishing company, Asha knows the professor’s potential to sell to his millions of loyal followers could be the lifeline her bosses need. However, the ink is barely dry on a book deal before she realizes she’s made a terrible mistake. In real life, the man behind the persona is intense and infuriating, and sparks fly between the pair when ghosts from their shared past take them down paths that have previously been ripped up and paved over.  Asha tells herself she doesn't want him. She swears up and down that she doesn't need him. And when their connection gets too powerful to ignore, she tries to convince herself she doesn’t love him. But repeating lies, even those you truly want to believe, will never make them true.
  A compelling tale of love, hate, and reluctant soul mates, from the international bestselling author of
