Never kiss the devil. Not even if he’s sinfully gorgeous. Or impossible to resist.And certainly not when he’s got you tied and bound, and completely at his mercy.…Uh oh.I thought I had it bad when I was on my way to be married off to some weasley little lord to appease my family. But that’s before I’m taken by the most fearsome, vicious, alpha Viking to sail the seas.Tor Odinson is a beast of a man. A savage. A bloodthirsty warrior and ravager. Huge, growly, dominant…and completely and utterly beautiful. I’m supposed to fear him, not want him. I’m supposed to resist him, not crave him.…Yeah, whoops.Because once he throws me over his shoulder, and lays his hands on me, and ties me to bed, and makes me feel things I’ve never even dreamed of, I know “what I’m supposed to do” is the last thing I’ll be doing when it comes to Tor.I know it’s wrong to desire a man like him. But if this is a sin, I’m already damned.I fell for the devil, and now, I want it all.Completely over the top, growly af, tropes for DAYS, and wildly historically inaccurate. As in, if you’re a history major, I’m so, so sorry. Warning: not responsible for lost or ripped bodices. Reader beware.As with all my books, this one is safe, with no cheating, and a HEA guaranteed.
