District Attorney Jenna James is haunted daily by two fears: She’ll make a mistake and someone else will die for it, or someone she loves will commit a crime she can’t ignore. Two district attorneys have been gunned down, and unless her office drops the case against Hector Lopez more will die. As Jenna struggles with her loyalty to a group that saved her life more than once, her law clerk, Grant Benson battles for justice against two of Corpus Christi’s most notorious criminal defense lawyers.There was no doubt in Grant Benson’s mind that Hector Lopez was guilty of aggravated sexual assault, and assault and battery. But his client has a history and Lopez is protected by the Texas cartel. The body count is rising, and his witnesses are disappearing. Before the trial is over, both Grant and Jenna will be forced to ask themselves, is the price of some convictions too high?* * * NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR: No Doubt is the shocking conclusion to Beyond a Reasonable Doubt and Shadows of Doubt. If you haven’t read Books 1 and 2, you may want to before reading this one. In Shadows of Doubt we were left with unanswered questions. Why is Grant Benson called ‘the kid”? Who is he really? Why is FBI Agent Carl Starks’s name the seventh entry in the crazy bomber’s diary? Did he really kill a woman and child and hire the bomber to blow up the house to cover up his crime? And why didn’t the DA’s office prosecute Hector Lopez for the brutal attack and rape of Maria Spozano? All this and more is answered in No Doubt. I hope you enjoy!
