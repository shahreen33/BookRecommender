Do you sense things aren't quite right with your child's school experience? Maybe your child is clearly struggling or, perhaps, your child is doing all right, but you believe something is lacking? Instead of trying to force your child to fit into school, perhaps it is time to consider finding educational options that fully address your child's academic and emotional needs.In "Making the Choice", Corin Barsily Goodwin, Executive Director of the Gifted Homeschoolers Forum (GHF), and Mika Gustavson, MFT, discuss how giftedness and twice exceptionality (gifted plus learning differences or "invisible disabilities") might affect the educational needs of your child. They also consider a variety of options regarding educational choices and the path to making them. Finally, they provide some questions to guide your way along this path.
