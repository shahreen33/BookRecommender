What would you do if you could go back in time and change your past? For Eva Caldwell that question is a no-brainer. After her parents were murdered while she was away at summer camp, Eva was placed into the custody of her abusive uncle and bullied in school. She’d gladly go back and change it all. When her uncle passes, Eva discovers he created a time machine. The problem with the once-hypothetical question becomes clear: changing the course of her past would mean giving up Casey McClellan, her best friend and the girl her heart has belonged to since she was twelve years old. Will Eva choose to save her parents’ lives or take a chance on the love of a lifetime?Cover Artist: Jeanine HenningGenres: Romance / Speculative Fiction
