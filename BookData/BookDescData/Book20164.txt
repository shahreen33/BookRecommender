Charlie Galen’s vivid imagination has transported him places no other kid in New York City—or the world for that matter—has ever been. But even in his wildest dreams, Charlie has never battled an army of furies, gripped the Sands of Time, or spoken with the one person he has always longed to meet. That all begins to change one mysterious night when a series of strange events forces him to question everything he sees and believes, launching him on a journey that neither he, nor any who read his tale, will soon forget. For it is on this grand adventure that a magical world is revealed—a world that just might make all of Charlie’s dreams come true, if only he can unlock its secrets before his deepest fears destroy him.
