My bitter past ruled my life. I was running on empty and didn’t give a damn. I wasn't interested in redemption. Definitely not love.Until now."Cat Porter NAILED it. This was a great, great book. So well written" - Lorelei James, New York Times & USA Today best-selling author"I love this series! Cat Porter is a massively gifted writer! I highly recommend.” - bestselling author Kennedy RyanSixteen years ago I barely survived my husband’s murder, and I promised myself that never again would I surrender my heart. I ran away from our hometown in South Dakota and never looked back. I wasn’t interested in second chances. I didn’t deserve any.But that all changed in one night.Forced to return home, I crashed into Lock, a brooding, sexy stranger. I indulged. No risk. No harm. Wrong. Wrong. Oh, so wrong. He was no stranger. And the past and present blew up in both our faces. Caught in the crossfire of two outlaw bike clubs’ rivalry, our one night of hot and delicious quickly turns cold and ugly. Forced to strike a bargain, I’m a pawn in a dangerous and deadly game. Secrets, lies…ah, but I’m good at those. So why does it hurt so much?Because now I feel things I'd forgotten about, want things I thought I'd cut out of my insides. I see it in Lock’s haunted eyes, feel it in his touch—that same hurt, that same want. Love not only stings when you lose it, when it’s ripped away, but when it first sinks its teeth into you, it can cut just as raw and sting just as deep. Now that sting won’t stop, and I don’t want it to. But the game just got real dirty, and Lock and I are on opposite sides. Will we come out alive? And even if we do, what will be left of our mangled souls?Once I had nothing.Suddenly, I have so damn much to lose.TotallyBooked Blog: Lock & Key - one of their “Favourite Standalones for 2014″EDGy Reviews: Lock & Key - one of their “Top Ten Favorites of 2014″Guilty Pleasures Book Reviews: Lock & Key - an Overall Favorite Book, a Favorite Motorcycle Romance, a Favorite Debut Romance, a Favorite Kick-Ass Heroine / Cat Porter - a Favorite Author and a Break-Through Author.Sassy Lit Chic Reviews LOCK & KEY - one of their “Top 20 Reads of 2014″The Lock & Key series is a TotallyBooked Blog Biker Romances Recommended Read & The Rock Stars of Romance Recommended Biker Book Series #EpicLove #MUSTread**Please note this book has been re-edited since its release in June 2014**The Lock & Key Series:1 - Lock & Key2 - Random & Rare3 - Iron & Bone4 - Blood & Rust*Novella - Lock & Key Christmas*Series spinoff - FuryThe Lock & Key series is a 4 book motorcycle club romance saga with hot alpha anti-heroes.
