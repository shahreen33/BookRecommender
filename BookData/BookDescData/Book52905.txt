In 1905 Albert Einstein published the most famous equation of all time, e=mc², and man’s understanding of the universe was transformed. But how many of us know what Einstein’s theories of relativity actually mean in terms of the world in which we live? Fortunately, Einstein’s inestimable genius extended to an ability to present his ideas cogently. Written in the hope that it would ‘provide a few happy hours of suggestive thought’, Relativity is a surprisingly accessible work, and the essential guide to one of the most fundamental discoveries of modern science.Introduced by Roger Penrose, Professor of Mathematics at the University of OxfordBound in KepheraPrinted and blocked in holographic foil with a design by Jonathan KitchenSet in Palatino224 pages; portrait frontispiece
