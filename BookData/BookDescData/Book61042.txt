Eve lived a very boring, very vanilla life with her boyfriend and two year old daughter. After the douchebag left her, leaving her a penniless single mum, her best friends wedding in Australia came at just the right time. She's missed her childhood friend, Teresa moved to the Aussie sun with her widowed father when the girls were 18, meeting her biker lover out there and now Eve is set to be her Maid of Honor. Instead of having the much needed break she's looking for, she witnesses a crime that puts her life in danger. Her dream vacation just turned into a nightmare, something she has only read about in the books she loves to escape in. Being rescued by Severed MC turns out to be an experience. The clubs VP Gabe aka Angel, could be just the diversion she needs right now but, no matter how hot the tattooed biker is in and out of bed, she still misses her daughter back in England. Book One in a two part story. *** CONTAINS ADULT THEMES AND MATERIAL - OVER 18's ONLY ***
