 bestselling author Cathryn Fox—a deliciously hot Harlequin Dare!Once is always enough…or is it?As someone who picks up the pieces of broken relationships every day, my dating rule is firm: no emotions. But Luca Marino isn’t the kind of guy who plays by the rules. He never was… In our Oxford days, he was gorgeous, gregarious…popular. Too popular to care that he humiliated a shy, overweight girl who worshipped the ground he walked on. Well, I’m a different person now—successful, with the expensive hair, makeup and clothes to match. But Luca…well, he seems exactly the same.Now the man I hate is the best man for my cousin’s luxurious St. Moritz wedding…and it’s time for some red-hot payback.The sex is definitely hot. The wild, sweaty, forget-your-evil-revenge kind that lasts all night. From the moment we touch, raw energy takes over, and I hand over all control. And, oh, I like it. But when I lie to my ailing grandfather and announce I am engaged—to Luca—all hell breaks loose.Just this once, I’ll break my rule. But giving in to Luca once is dangerous enough. What happens if I give in to his terms for a second time…and risk falling hard for the guy I swore to hate?
