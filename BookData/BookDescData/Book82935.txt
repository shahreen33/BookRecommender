 "The whole band...we love doing things together...”  Insecure Mitzi used to have a huge weight problem, and now that she has trimmed down, she feels a bit more confident—confident enough to take on a job as a sexy maid to help pay her bills. She’s a bit nervous her first day until she realizes her client is a guy she had an intense crush on back in the day—her best friend’s much older brother who recently became a major rock star, along with his hot bandmates she remembers banging around in her BFF’s garage years ago.  Untouched Mitzi gets far more than she bargained for when they all want to watch her work and stretch the limit of her duties, hard and without protection!
