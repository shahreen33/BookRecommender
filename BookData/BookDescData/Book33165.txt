In the latest installment of Tedd Arnold's NEW YORK TIMES bestselling Fly Guy series, Buzz has a homework assignment to write a fairy tale and he asks Fly Guy to help. Fly Guy doesn't like to think of himself as some of Buzz's suggestions--an ugly troll, a smelly pig herder--so he becomes a handsome prince instead! Prince Fly Guy flies to a dark castle, fends off a giant, and rescues a beautiful princess. Even reluctant readers will enjoy this fun, zany story about Fly Guy's adventure in a fairy tale!
