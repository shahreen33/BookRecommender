A brand-new series and cast of characters from the mind of Oliver JeffersThe Hueys are small and mischievous, unique compared to the world's other creatures--but hardly unique to one another. You see, each Huey looks the same, thinks the same, and does the same exact things. So you can imagine the chaos when one of them has the idea of knitting a sweater! It seems like a good idea at the time--he is quite proud of it, in fact--but it does make him different from the others. So the rest of the Hueys, in turn, decide that they want to be different too! How? By knitting the exact same sweater, of course!The first in a series of child-and-consumer-friendly books, Oliver Jeffers proves that standing apart can be accomplished even when standing together.
