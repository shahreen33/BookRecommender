Hockey is my life. And it's a great one. There's an endless line of women, and I get to hang with my best friend Oli. Everything is perfect until she shows up. Oli's twin sister, Flynn... hates my guts. I don't blame her. I'm part of one of the worst nights of her life.Now she's next door and seeing her every day is killing me slowly. I wonder if we can ever get back to being friends. The way she looks at me sometimes, well, let's just say my hockey stick isn't the only thing that's feeling hard these days.But if she finds out the secrets I'm keeping, forgiveness will be the last thing on her mind.
