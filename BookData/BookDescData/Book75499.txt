Forty-two year old Helen returns one summer to Zakynthos, the Greek island where her life took a dramatic turn two years earlier. She brings with her Chloe, her sixteen year old daughter, who is fighting demons of her own. Relations between mother and daughter are strained, as they struggle to understand the different ways they are coping with their family’s tragedy. The death of Helen’s husband Philip has left them shattered and seeking comfort at the hotel where they spent their final family holiday all together. But has Helen come to Zakynthos to confront the ghosts of her past, or to revive the affair which nearly tore her family apart once already? For the married hotel owner, Nikos, is the man she nearly left her family for two years before, lost in her all-consuming passion for him. Seeing the love of her life again makes Helen question not only her future, but her past as well. Should she resist her feelings for Nikos, or is he her last chance at happiness? And what if her affair is not the only betrayal lurking in her family’s past? ‘Echoes in the Sand’ is a heart-breaking story of love and loss, and the war between the head and the heart.
