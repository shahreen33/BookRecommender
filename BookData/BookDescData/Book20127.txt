Dai is a shy and quiet high school student. Kane is the young, ruthless, and "handsome as hell" future president of Kane industries. As they clash, a steamy and dangerous relationship develops forcing the two to face rocky and turbulent obstacles from sources outside of their relationship, and of their own creation. Dai falls into Kane's world of high-class hotels and restaurants to late night high stakes poker games with the world's most dangerous underground criminals, funny and outrageous attendants, and the creepy eyes of Kane's even more ruthless and crafty stepfather. Soon Dai discovers that just simply being with the boy who captured his heart is not enough if he ends up dead.
