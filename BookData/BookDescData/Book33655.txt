In New York Times bestselling author Nevada Barr's gripping standalone, a grandmother in her 60s emerges from a mental fog to find she's trapped in an Alzheimer's Unit in a nursing home. How does she convince anyone that she's not actually demented? Her relatives were the ones to commit her, all the legal papers were drawn up, the authorities are on the side of the nursing home, and even she isn't sure she sounds completely sane.
