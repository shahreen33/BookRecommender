There are secrets in my magic…In the Old Lands, nothing is as it seems.Something lurks in the darkness…watching…waiting. I see it moving in the shadows. I hear it whisper in the wind. I sense it following our every step. I feel it on my spine like the caress of fingertips across my skin. Is it Joseph and his army waiting to ambush us again? Or is it just the ancient chaos of this place waiting to suck us in and never let us back out? As I stand here within the darkness staring at the dancing flames, I know our time is up. We have to make our run for it. Now. This was a rescue mission, except now we might need the saving. With Tegan still unconscious, and Tennessee lost to his fear for her, no one knows what to do. All we have is my crazy plan and it might get us all killed.We made it to the balefire….but now, we have to make it back out alive.
  The Wild Witch takes a wild turn for this sharp-witted heroine and swoon-worthy hero. Their epic rollercoaster romance set inside a magical academy is only just getting started! Fans of The Mortal Instruments, Twilight, or Harry Potter will love Chandelle LaVaun’s brand new urban fantasy series!
