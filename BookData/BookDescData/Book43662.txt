You spend your days staring into a computer screen, trying to sell life insurance to young couples with new babies.You spend your nights staring into a computer screen, extracting filth from and injecting bile into the internet.You still live with the same dickhead housemate you went to university with.Your only respite from computer screens are nights spent getting smashed with him at student bars, watching him prance around, trying to pull much younger girls.Your life sucks and you suck at it.One drunken night, you try something new.Something terrible.But something that brings you new energy, new drive, new desires.You start eating the young.
