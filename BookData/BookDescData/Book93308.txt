The 'red Macmillan' Iliad in the edition of W. Leaf, which had served since the 1880s, was replaced in 1978 &amp; '84 by the two-volume edition of M.M. Willcock. Coverage of twelve books in each volume demands concise introduction &amp; commentary, but Willcock is not omissive. He includes, for example, mention of significant aspects of Homeric diction more fully in the early lines of each book, in order that the student may begin on any particular one. The tight compass does not prevent him engaging in, or referring to, problems of composition or text addressed by scholars more advanced than the sixth-formers &amp; undergraduates for whom the edition is intended.--from back cover
