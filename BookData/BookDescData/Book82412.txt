LIGHTSPEED is an online science fiction and fantasy magazine. In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF--and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales.  This month, we have original science fiction by Timothy Mudie ("An Ever-Expanding Flash of Light") and Giovanni De Feo ("Ugo"), along with SF reprints by Marissa Lingen ("Blue Ribbon") and Genevieve Valentine ("Carthago Delenda Est"). Plus, we have original fantasy by Jaymee Goh ("The Last Cheng Beng Gift") and Tony Ballantyne ("A Pound of Darkness, a Quarter of Dreams"), and fantasy reprints by Tamsyn Muir ("The Magician's Apprentice") and Tobias Buckell ("Shoggoths in Traffic"). All that, and of course we also have our usual assortment of author spotlights, along with our book and media review columns, and an interview with Theodora Goss. For our ebook readers, we have a reprint of the novella "Near Zennor," by Elizabeth Hand, and an excerpt from the novel Autonomous, by Annalee Newitz. And our cover this month is by Alan Bao, illustrating "The Last Cheng Beng Gift."
