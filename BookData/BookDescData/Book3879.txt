When Jack meets Edward at a traffic stop, his world is rocked--and not for the better. Edward is the gayest man he's ever seen, and Spring Lake is a small town just getting comfortable with its own new gay couple, Brian Russell and Rush Weston. Unlike Edward, Rush and Brian are big, strapping, manly men. But manly isn't what turns Jack on. It's Edward--everything about the younger man drives Jack wild with desire and the need to control Edward's wild, impetuous spirit. For Edward, his attraction to "bad boys" has been his romantic downfall. His heart's been broken so many times he's lost count. When he meets Jack, Edward falls for the all-American by-the-book lawman, but finds his attempts rebuffed and his pride severely wounded. Jack's straight, or at least says he is, but Edward knows that look in Jack's eyes, he's seen it before from other men. How can a man so right be so wrong? Edward tempts Jack beyond anyone he's ever met and his desire for Edward builds each time he encounters the younger man, until he can no longer deny it or himself. But Edward doesn't want sex on the side, he wants forever. He wants the fairy tale. Can Jack give Edward what he wants or will Jack's fear of being ridiculed for his choice of a partner keep them from their Happily Ever After?
