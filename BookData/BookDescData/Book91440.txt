Third time's the charm...  When another body shows up in Western Woods, Tina is very happy to leave this investigation to Chief Inspector King. There's only one problem: no one knows where she is.  With the law enforcement head missing, and the victim a local witch, the coven of Jupiter is extremely upset. Tina and her friends immediately take action, deciding to solve the murder on their own, and hoping that Chief Enforcer King shows up again sooner rather than later.  But the deeper they get into the investigation, the more the disappearance and the murder seem linked, and the more dangerous things get for the four witches. And Tina might be imagining it, but she's pretty sure Kyran is avoiding her.  Will Tina and her friends get to the bottom of these mysterious happenings before it's too late?  
  Three's a Coven is the third book in the Western Woods mystery series of full-length, humorous paranormal cozy mystery novels.
