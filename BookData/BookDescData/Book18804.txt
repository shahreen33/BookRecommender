Looking for an alpha male in your new adult romance read?    You just found one.    Alexa is just your average college junior, attending classes and piloting Mile High Club charter flights. Boys haven't been on her radar for a couple years after a disastrous breakup with her high school sweetheart. Her plans to focus on school hit a bit of a snag when she meets bad-boy Drake Bennett and he sets his sights on making her his own.  Drake transferred to Blythe College for the rugby team, not for a new assortment of college girls. He's sexy and cocky, and he attracts women like moths to a flame. When he meets Alexa, Drake knows he's met his match. She tries to resist him, but Drake isn't used to taking no for an answer.   This is the first book in the Blythe College series by Amazon Bestselling Author Rochelle Paige. Push the Envelope does not have a cliffhanger. Warning: 18+ due to sexual content.
