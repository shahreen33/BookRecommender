In their western Massachusetts-based restaurant Coco and The Cellar Bar, chefs Unmi Abkin and Roger Taylor create well-balanced, boldly flavoured signature dishes shaped by Abkin’s Korean and Mexican-American upbringing. In Curry &amp; Kimchi, they open their kitchen secrets up to the home cook, sharing their foundational dressings, salsas, broths, and infused oils and the dishes that feature them, through recipes that are delightfully simple to execute and beautifully complex in flavour.Honey Miso Dressing lends a full-bodied taste to Honey Miso Noodle Salad, while Shoyu Ramen Broth (made in an Instant Pot) is the key ingredient in Coco Shoyu Ramen. Other favourites include a Korean-inspired take on Bolognese sauce for Korean Spaghetti and Korean Sloppy Joes, Chow Fun Sauce (for Coriander Shrimp Chow Fun), Scallion Ginger Jam (for Clay Pot Miso Chicken), and Ponzu Sauce (for Miso-Glazed Cod Rice Bowl). Together with vivid restaurant photography that shows elegant plating suggestions, Abkin and Taylor’s recipes will inspire readers to prepare home-cooked meals with remarkable clarity of flavour
