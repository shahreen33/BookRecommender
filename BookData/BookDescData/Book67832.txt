After Jamie and Scot’s wedding, and the first few months of finding their feet as a married couple, Jamie sweeps Scot off for a romantic break at their lodge high in the mountains of Switzerland, and away from everyone else. Jamie plans to try out his new romantic ideas on his beloved husband. This will be their first Christmas together as husband and husband and Jamie intends that his months of meticulous planning will go through without a hitch. It will be a beautiful, peaceful, non-eventful week with just the two of them. Spending time which they both need, alone and separated from their hectic lives back in the real world. Well, that’s the plan. But when does anything in their life go that simple? Two additional house guests arrive unexpectedly on their doorstep only two days into their idyllic break, ladened down with gifts and gossip, plenty of Christmas cheer and strong Italian wine. Oh, and their most recent relationship problems.
