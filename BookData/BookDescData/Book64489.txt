You've met someone new. Sometimes the story doesn't quite add up, and you feel a little rushed, but this person is head over heels in love with you. But is it love—or predation? Red Flags of Love Fraud has the answers. Donna Andersen, who is also author of Lovefraud.com, she says these people are sociopaths. No, a sociopath is not always a deranged serial killer—that's media hype. These people are social predators. They like company, and they really like sex, so sociopaths are always on the hunt for a hookup. This book explains how sociopaths target and pursue romantic relationships. The information is based on more than 2,800 cases that Andersen has collected through Lovefraud.com, and on the results of two Internet surveys completed by Lovefraud readers who loved and lived with these human predators. It's a must-read book for anyone who is looking for a partner—and anyone who is mystified by the partner they have.
