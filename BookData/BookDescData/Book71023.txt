Jordan Fox  From one abusive life to another, I've had more bruised skin than I've had healthy. When My dad found out I was gay in an extremely humiliating way, I wasn't surprised when he nearly killed me. He'd been beating me for as long as I can remember. I wasn't even surprised to find myself in a conversion camp the next day being beat by men I didn’t even know. I was a little surprised to be scooped up by leader and forced into a "relationship" I didn't want. As the years pass, and I'm allowed more freedom, I eventually sneak around and get a job. And then sneak around and leave. The gym is the only place I can hide since Wade doesn't even know I work there, and I start secretly living out of it, hoping like crazy the big, gruff, delicious owner never finds out. Especially since I'm not longer afraid of him, but I'm absolutely terrified of the way he makes me feel.  Langston Bell  The moment I see the beautiful young man huddled under the desk in fear, I know I have to take care of him. So, when a friend of his ex's shows up at the gym, looking for him, I'm more than happy to help hide him. And when a tripped alarm in the middle of the night shows me that the sweet man had nothing and no one, I move him in with me, fully intending to be on my best behavior, especially since I'm like twice his age. But I've never craved another man the way I crave him, and I'm clearly not as strong as I thought I was.  As with all my books, this series is pretty fluffy. Not much angst at all, no cheating and definitely a happy ending! Meant to be a light hearted read to make you laugh… or at least smile.  Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses::
