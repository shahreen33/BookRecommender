Just along King Street at number 159 you will find the old storefront of the Clyde Fans Company. It's been locked up for years now and most people would naturally assume that it's completely abandoned. Look closer. Peer in through the display window into the dimly lit office and there on the far wall you will just be able to make out the black and white photographs of a pair of rather grim looking businessmen: Abraham and Simon Matchcard.If you were to go in furtherâ€”back through that battered safety door and into the living and work spaces of the old building you would pass into the hidden world that has sustained these lonely brothers for more than five decades.In this, the first of two books, you will meet the Matchcard brothers and follow them through their journeys of disappointments, loss, and isolations. Two salesmen who have failed to "close."
