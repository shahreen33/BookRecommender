Schizoaffective disorder: a mental illness in which a person experiences a combination of mood disorder and schizophrenia symptoms.I know about this illness—very well—because I suffer from it. It’s been four years since my diagnosis, and ever since, I’ve been living in a dark hole. Voices constantly invading my thoughts. Hallucinations. All of which force me to question if what I’m experiencing is even reality.But here I am, still hanging on, still breathing and living through it.That is, until he stumbled into my life. Logan Reed. I don’t want any part of him. I’ve pushed him away, but he isn’t easily deterred. I’ve told him I’m different, but he doesn’t care. He’s trying to slowly break me down. I’m trying just as hard not to let him. He doesn’t know how truly damaged I am; what will happen when he does?I know the truth—he’ll never be able to look at me the same way again. Just like everybody else.
