Fool me once, shame on you.Fool me twice, and I'm a damn idiot.That's what he does to me.Ryder. Smith.The first heartbreak is always the hardest to healAnd those wounds get ripped right back open,When he walks back into my life.Seven years,It took seven long and grueling years, To get that cocky, leather-wearing bastard out of my mind.I thought I'd never get over him, never fix what he broke,And now he's back,Every sexy inch of him,The difference is now I'm taking charge.This time he'll be the fool.
