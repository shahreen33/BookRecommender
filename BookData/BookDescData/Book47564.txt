(Brother's best friend, forbidden love, small-town, military second-chance romance.)A promise written on a coaster.A lost night in a dark room.Grayson Cole was my brother’s best friend.He was all of my firsts.Then he went away...Drew Harris was just a kid, a senior in high school, my best friend’s little sister.They said she was too young to know her feelings. I was too old to have them, so I left to join the military.Four years passed. Loss, injury, angry words I can never take back… I’m home, but I’m not the same.Neither is she.Now she’s a woman with flashing blue eyes, long blonde hair, and gorgeous curves.Still, she’s the same sweet smile, the same sassy mouth…I could never say No to her before.I should for her sake. She deserves better than what I’ve become, scarred and damaged. “They told me to stay away from you.I went away to try… God, I tried.Now everything has changed. I’m back, and I’ll do whatever it takes to make you mine…”
