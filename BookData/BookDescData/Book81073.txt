A canine-loving sleuth. A detective barking up the wrong tree. It’s a race against time to follow the scent and find the murderer before someone else ends up dead.  Nikki Green thought muddy paws and furry scuffles were the worst troubles she’d encounter at the local dog park. So, she’s shocked when her client’s German Shepherd sniffs out her friend’s dead body. And her confusion only grows when the hunky detective who helped her through a life-changing experience years ago treats her like a total stranger. But with her friend’s killer on the loose, she has little time to ponder the mystery of his baffling behavior.  Side-by-side with her canine companions, she searches for the killer and discovers her detective pal wasn’t the only one acting strangely.
