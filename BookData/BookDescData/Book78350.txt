Getting married at eighteen wasn't the smartest idea but ... I'd been in love. Bryce, with his perfect words, his money, and all-American good looks. He had pulled me in, and when he spit me out, I'd barely been left alive. Now at twenty two and divorced, I just wanted to build a life for myself on my own terms. Free of fear.  First job. First crappy apartment. First taste of freedom.  Enter Ethan King. The guy from high school I never had a chance with. As the leader of the local motorcycle gang, he's not exactly an outstanding citizen, but he's the one bright spot in my life. He's exactly what I need right now. Until Bryce, who never could accept losing, decides he's not ready to let me go. And if there is one thing I know about that monster, it's that he has no problem destroying everything in my world.  Only this time I have Ethan King. And no one messes with a King.  *Full length- standalone novel with adult sexy scenes. *Dark romance
