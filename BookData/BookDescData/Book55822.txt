Can she dig down under her sassy, sarcastic shell and find true vulnerability inside?  For Gavin Valentine, life has taken a turn. Diagnosed with a medical condition that means he’ll never be cleared to fly again, he loses everything that matters to him, pretty much overnight. The future he’d always seen for himself is gone in a blink.  Can the lone wolf pilot open up enough to let love in, and learn that sometimes the future you never pictured is the one you were meant to have?  *** Standalone romance with HEA and no cliffhanger ***  18+
