2018 Finalist IAN Book of the Year Awards for Historical Fiction and a Bronze Medal Winner for Historical Romance Readers' Favorite Book AwardsEveryone loves a good love story. The stories that make you feel warm all over. The kind that leaves you the slightest bit envious because the story belongs to someone else and not you. The stories that make your heart race and on the edge of pain and pleasure. Pain because your heart hurts and pleasure because your heart hurts. An unlikely combination, yet, that’s the stuff good love stories are made of.Ours could have been like that. We could have made a beautiful love story. But when he was ready for that epic love story, I was afraid to fall in love, too hurt by my past to trust anyone. Then, when I was ready for the epic love story, he was gone. And I was alone. And the only thing I got was the pain. It was time I told him the things that were in my heart but too afraid to say out loud.I wrote the letter I needed to write and prayed it wasn't too late.Dear Charlie,You were right. I was wrong. I've never been more wrong in my life. There - I said it.I’ll say it a million times if you just come back to me. Come back to me. Please! I was so wrong. I do love you. Sophie
