In June 1938, Superman made his debut in Action Comics #1, which also featured his romantic interest--and Clark Kent's journalistic rival--Lois Lane. In the decades since, the intrepid reporter has become an iconic figure almost as recognizable as the Man of Steel himself. Lois has appeared in multiple adaptations, from her own comic book to various films and television shows, and millions of women have seen--and continue to see--her as a role model. Examining Lois Lane: The Scoop on Superman's Sweetheart is the first anthology to explore the many incarnations of this empowering American icon. Chapters analyze the character of Lois Lane in various media through the perspectives of feminism, gender studies, cultural studies, and more. In some discussions she is compared to mythological heroines, while others explain her importance in popular culture. This wide-ranging collection looks at previously neglected aspects of Lois and offers new insights into the evolution of her character. Seventy-five years after Lois Lane's first appearance, this book creates a fascinating picture of the obstacles and decisions faced by her character, whose challenges and accomplishments often reflected those of women over the course of the past century. Examining Lois Lane will be of interest to students and scholars as well as those who grew up reading and watching the many manifestations of Superman's girlfriend.
