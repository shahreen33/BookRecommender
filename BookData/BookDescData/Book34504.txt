Tucked away at the base of the Rocky Mountains lived a little boy with one singular dream: leave this broken and battered home and become someone.Be somebody’s hero.That boy was me—Colby Brooks. Except I’m not that same little boy anymore.My dreams might still be the same, but my reality isn’t.I’m smarter. Stronger. A man.And I learned a long damn time ago, the only way to achieve my dreams was to avoid distractions—at any cost.Focus. Resolve. Determination. But all it took was one single night. One night and my entire life…changed.One night had me colliding head first with the biggest distraction of my life; Rory Oaks.Smart. Charming. Beautiful.Rory changed everything.Quickly, my one-track mind started to bend.Each kiss faded decade-long dreams.And with one single incident, I fly off course.
