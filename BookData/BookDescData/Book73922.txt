So what happens when the greatest evil in the universe decides he wants that army for himself?The power of the ancient gods has returned Darkseid to his former self, but he wants more--he wants the throne of Apokolips back!

That sounds suspiciously like the Amazons!Meanwhile, Wonder Woman's brother Jason has always longed to meet his mother, Hippolyta, but the machinations of the gods have made it impossible. But now, with the barrier between worlds at its thinnest, could they come face-to-face at last? Should Wonder Woman help him return home, if it could lead to the destruction of the Amazons?From superstar writer James Robinson and artist Carlo Pagulayan comes the next great Wonder Woman epic in Wonder Woman Vol. 7! Collects Wonder Woman #38-45.
