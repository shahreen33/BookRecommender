It’s Thanksgiving Break and chores are being handed out. Hadyn, nearly 16 and the oldest of the four Barlow brothers, is told by his father to clear the back acres of their new farm. Hadyn resents life. After losing his mother to cancer and relocating away from the only home he’s ever known, he misses his friends and his Mom. While hacking through a briar patch, a strange rock formation arouses his curiosity. After four mysterious black birds deliver a strange summons, Hadyn and his brother Ewan realize the stone is really a magic Viking runestone. Through this portal, they cross into the ancient world of Karac Tor.Crisis looms. In the Five Dominions of Karac Tor, names are being stolen from the young—literally erased from the sacred Book of Names. Meanwhile, the sorceress Nemesia is spreading darkness from her Tower of Ravens. While Hadyn and Ewan are immediately hailed as Champions sent to help rescue the land, the brothers have a far more simple goal: find their way home—and stay alive! As the seductive call of Nemesia lures them towards despair, the Barlows must discover power and courage they never knew they possessed. Yet even if they survive, will anyone know how to send them back to our world? Or will they be lost forever?
