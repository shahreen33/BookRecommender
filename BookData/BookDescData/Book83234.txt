New writer Brian Buccellato (DETECTIVE COMICS, THE FLASH) and artists Bruno Redondo and Mike S. Miller (BATMAN: ARKHAM UNHINGED) continue to expand the world of the hit video game from the makers of Mortal Kombat in INJUSTICE: GODS AMONG US: YEAR FOUR!    When Superman and the Justice League declared themselves the ultimate authority on planet Earth, only Batman stood against them—but now Batman is defeated. His resistance army has suffered major losses and dwindled to nearly nothing. The man who always has a backup plan for his backup plans has nothing—except for one final, desperate gambit.   The gods of Olympus are real, and they’re none too pleased about Superman and the League making themselves into gods on Earth. With no other options, Batman turns to Ares, the God of War, to enlist the Greek pantheon into the battle with Superman. The Man of Steel may be strong enough to take on a god, but what happens when his closest ally (who happens to be the daughter of Zeus) is turned against him?   Collecting INJUSTICE: GODS AMONG US: YEAR FOUR #1-7.
