It's a reunion--mafia style! Dino, the 10th-generation of the Chiavorone family, and Reborn's former student, brings his squad of goons to pay Tsuna a visit. The explosive little Lambo decides to liven things up a bit by tossing several grenades at the goons. Things quickly escalate as Dino springs into action in a battle of whips versus grenades!
