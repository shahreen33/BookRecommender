At long last, the fifth volume of the award-adjacent webcomic The Order of the Stick is here! Reunited and back doing that whole "saving the world" thing, Roy leads the team to the distant Western Continent, a desert land filled with scheming warlords, creepy death priests, dim-witted bounty hunters, and more—including some heavy-handed coincidences shocking surprises for Haley and Elan! Can Vaarsuvius deal with What Went Down in the last book? Can Belkar pretend to be a contributing member of society? And what about Durkon? He's in this, too, right? All this and more in the mega-ultra-really-shoulda-planned-better-sized continuation of the OOTS story, Blood Runs in the Family! Here's what the book contains: All of the comics from #673 to #946—our biggest book ever! 11 all-new bonus comics scattered throughout the story. Quoth the Familiar, an all-new five-page illustrated poem showing the first meeting between Vaarsuvius and Blackwing. Durkon Turned Undead, the "lost" OOTS strip produced in 2003 as the third OOTS ever but hidden until now. A three-page recap of events to-date by Haley Starshine (with help from a little black bird). Ten pages of author commentary for you to flip past. Updated lettering on every strip with the swanky new dialogue font! A foreward by John Rogers, big-time Hollywood producer and writer of the official Dungeons &amp; Dragons comic by IDW.
