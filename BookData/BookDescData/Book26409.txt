The insta-love.The perfect couple.The enchanted fairy tale.The concept of ‘happily ever after’ on reality TV is beautiful, but it’s complete B.S.I mean, I get the appeal.The One is the most watched reality TV dating show because it sells the idea that two people “randomly” handpicked by producers will fall in love and ride off into the sunset. We are expected to believe that after having a group of women embarrass themselves for the affection of a man on national television, the bachelor and the chosen one fall in love and they live happily ever after. Let’s be honest.Shows like The One are really about fantasy romance and must-see entertainment—not happily ever afters. That’s why the creators and producers don’t show what happens after the exotic getaways, lavish lifestyles, and over-the-top proposals. Even though reality TV relationships never last, they want us to buy into the fairy tale.Truth is… when the cameras stop rolling, the number one killer of reality TV couples is real life.And life just got REAL.
