Things were looking up for Alexandra Carlson. She had finally gotten her life back together again. She’d moved to a wonderful secluded house on a mountainside in Reno, her paintings were beginning to sell, and there was even a hint of romance on the horizon. Then things began to happen. Little things. Anonymous phone calls full of heavy breathing. A broken tree branch outside her bedroom window. Her cat, Winnie—gone without a trace. A moving shadow above the skylight. Surely it was all her imagination…Then one day she picked up the phone and there was somebody there—somebody who knew her childhood nickname. In the background she could hear a scratchy record—an old song that brought dark memories out of the shadows. That night something woke Alexandra out of a sound sleep. This time, the heavy breathing wasn’t coming from the telephone. Someone was in the house with her. And she was at his mercy. In this spine-tingling thriller, Alex and Justin 's steamy relationship adds spice to the electrifying plot.
