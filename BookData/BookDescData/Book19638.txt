Today, only one man stands. He tells the tale of joining his childhood friends in the passionate appeal for Palestinians against Israel’s forceful occupation.  After all these years, his diaspora eyes continue to be haunted by the realities his compatriots face. What is past is dead is a fictional journey into the contentious issue of Palestine and Israel, written with depth of feeling and character. Mohammed Massoud Morsi is an award winning photojournalist his fictional pieces have won recognition worldwide.
