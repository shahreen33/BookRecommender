He’s an older version…and their child is crying from the next room. The days that follow bring more of the same: arriving at a time in her past or alternate future, on her birthday. Dusty is the only constant in all of her travels, anxious to win her over in each timeframe.Seeing a whole new side to him and knowing that they were truly meant to be, she allows herself to finally love him. Knowing she has to have fixed what was wrong, she expects it all to stop; only it doesn’t. Battling her frustrations daily, Kaitlyn desperately searches for the answers that will bring her time traveling to an end.
