In the tradition of Harold and the Purple Crayon, an inventive and charming bedtime story that blends whimsical art and sweet photographic touches. Vincent is a very clever boy. So when the night rolls in like a warm blanket, he unravels it and begins to play. The threads of the night become a violin, an elephant, and even a pirate ship—anything to delay bedtime. But in the end, even Vincent can’t resist resting his eyes and snuggling up in the dark. Good night, Vincent! Whether delighting in bedtime or are afraid of the dark, every child will enjoy this playful and reassuring picture book that entices even the most rambunctious little dreamers to sleep.
