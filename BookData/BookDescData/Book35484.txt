In Hi Bob!, American icon Bob Newhart gets together one-on-one with a handpicked cohort of luminaries in the world of entertainment, whom he happens to be friends with. Bob gets deep with each performer about their aspirations, their careers, how they got started, and how they grew to be where they are today. They make TV shows, movies, or albums, but they all like telling stories. Hi Bob! combines different conversations into themes, covering topics like creativity or failure, while weaving in never-before-heard personal anecdotes among accomplished, famous friends. Enjoy!
