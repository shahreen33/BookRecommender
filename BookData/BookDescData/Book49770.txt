How often in life are we confronted with situations that cause distress and indecision, sometimes even dejection and depression? Where, we wonder, can we find hope and promise? Sometimes the love we extend to another individual does not induce love in return. Unrequited love often leads to heartache, even heartbreak. Where, we ask, can we find the love we seek and need? And what of life hereafter? Can one seek and find peace and promise in the great beyond? The poetry found in this book attempts to address some of these concerns that so often beset and perplex us. Hopefully, in reading these works, readers will find a measure of fulfillment, a path to hope, peace, and promise.
