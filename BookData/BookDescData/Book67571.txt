Doing what’s right made so many things wrong...I had to get Jack - no question. I just didn’t realize bringing him home would require so much trust from everyone.When that trust is strained, we all suffer.I’ll protect what’s mine, but my team’s bonds are being tested. Threats are suddenly everywhere - inside our magical barrier, inside our safe house, and even inside my mind.Our enemies are closing in, and we can’t hide much longer.My men called me Queen once, and now I know what we’re going to need to win this battle.I’m Carlyle Licorne, and I’m ready to claim who I am.
