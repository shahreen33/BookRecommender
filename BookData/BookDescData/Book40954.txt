Her Inconvenient Husband When a riding accident strands socialite Caroline Turner overnight with the new stable manager, she gets the one thing she never wanted—a husband! Marrying the infuriatingly stubborn Duncan McKenna wouldn't have been her first choice, but with her reputation damaged, it's her only option. Still, there's something about the brash, rugged Scotsman that fascinates Caroline. If Duncan wanted to wed a society girl, he would have stayed in Boston with his family and his fortune. He expects Caroline to balk at her new modest lifestyle, but instead the strong-willed beauty seems determined to prove him wrong, making her all the more irksome…and irresistible. The marriage of convenience isn't what Caroline and Duncan planned, but could they be a perfect match?
