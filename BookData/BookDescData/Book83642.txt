On March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport bound for Beijing. Less than an hour after take-off, somewhere over the South China Sea, the plane simply vanished. One eyewitness saw a burning object crash into the sea. But confusing radar signals trace tracked an aircraft taking an erratic course across the Malaysian peninsula, then on to the Andaman Sea. Did it crash there? Or did it fly on to land safely in disputed lands of Central Asia, or the top secret CIA "black site" on Diego Garcia? Two years later, the Australians are still search—at the cost of billions—and have found nothing. Was the search in such a remote place part of a cover-up to distract the world’s attention because the US Navy had, in fact, shot the plane down? The answer must be out there. Or, perhaps, hidden within the pages of the secret files.
