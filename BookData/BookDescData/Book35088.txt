Many people know the story of how Christianity unfolded in Europe over the course of many centuries. Many people also know the story of Martin Luther launching a reform movement in the beginning of the 16th century. In A Pale Horse Rides, you will meet people from the fringes of the empireâ€”barbarians who mysteriously converted and built their faith with nothing to go by but the words of the Bible.This book is the perfect companion to the A Pale Horse Rides DVD series, though it can also be used as a standalone book.
