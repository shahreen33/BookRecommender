A slightly overweight student deals with a treacherous slide into bitterness. All of Emily's friends seem so perfect. They're skinny and pretty, and, of course, are fun and flirty to boot. Especially Leah, who, as Emily remembers it, used to be the chubby girl in school. Now Leah is on her way toward becoming America's next top model. Literally. Why can't I look like her? Emily loathes her slightly overweight body, her insecure personality, and sometimes even her "perfect" friends. As Leah and Becca, another gorgeous friend, discuss the latest fashion trends and "magical thigh-reducing creams," Emily's secret bitterness begins to eat away at her soul. Emily takes drastic measures putting herself in danger of death, which she will only avoid if she comes to terms with the issues weighing down her heavy heart.
