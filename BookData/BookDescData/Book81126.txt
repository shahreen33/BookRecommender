Samantha and Jo are shocked when they come across the dead body of Valda, a newlywed and new resident at Sage Gardens. They had just delivered a basket of Samantha’s welcome muffins to her and her husband earlier in the day when Jo noticed that the woman was wearing a very familiar piece of jewelry. However, Jo cannot remember why it is familiar to her.  Not only is Valda dead, but the jewelry is missing. Jo cannot shake the feeling that the jewelry had something to do with the murder so she does a little digging. The digging lands her amongst some serious criminals, including some familiar faces.  Will the ‘Sage Gardens Sleuths’ manage to navigate their way through the maze of potential suspects and find the murderer? Or will the murderer get away because Jo’s judgement is clouded by someone that holds a special place in her heart?
