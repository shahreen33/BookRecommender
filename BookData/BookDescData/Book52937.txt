The second issue of Europa Sun has landed with a bang! While we were very proud of our debut, we dare say that Issue 2 might have even superseded it! This issue bursts with impassioned love for European ethnic-heritage and makes no bones about it. Our writers share their love of the history and culture of their heritage in cogent and illuminating ways. We explore history both ancient and more recent. Our authors elucidate on issues we face as a culture today while placing it in historical context. We discuss faith from multiple perspectives as to how it pertains to our cultural identity. This issue includes both Christian and pagan writers, including one writer who explains why as a Christian he gets so much value from European native mythos. Another writer explains how Christianity is intertwined with ethnic nationalism for Eastern Europeans. The editor discusses the unbroken survival of European Native Faith, while yet another contributor discusses the shared history and need to come together between Christians and European pagans as we face a common enemy who threatens the culture we both love. But, this issue is not overpowered by religious discussion! We've got explorers, warriors, kings, and lost tribes! In fact, it wasn't intentional, but this issue is jam packed with masculine energy! While, this was not the editor's planned intention, she is not sorry for its happenstance. In a world where Marxist distortion pervades our media and education today and perverts the mainstream view of history, Europa Sun is more than happy to stand up for white Western men and boldly assert that we have a history to be PROUD of!
