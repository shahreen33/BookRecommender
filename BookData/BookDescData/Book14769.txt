Two-time Newbery Award-winning author Katherine Paterson tells the story of Jesus's life with extraordinary clarity and grace, accompanied by paintings as human and reverent as the text."When the people looked at all the sadness and evil in the world, they had trouble believing that God was in charge. 'God's kingdom,' said Jesus, 'is as tiny as the smallest of seeds, but when it is planted it grows into such a huge tree that the birds make their nests in its branches.'" Newbery Medalist & minister's wife Katherine Paterson retells the life of Jesus in simple, beautiful language for all ages, making the story new again through her trademark generosity and compassion. Iconic images from Jesus's life light the text with the same warmth and directness. A perfect gift book!
