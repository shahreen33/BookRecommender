Nocturnal is a collection of words and imagery inspired by darkened skies and sleepless nights. it is a journey of healing and self-discovery whether love stays or leaves. it is dreaming with your eyes wide open while the rest of the world is hiding.-- and when they ask me,  are you afraid of the dark?  i will remind them that  there's nothing to fear  when the night is a reason  we can see how honest  everything shines  while the rest of the world  is hiding.
