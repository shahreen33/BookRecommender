For years John Rourke, ex-CIA Covert Operations Officer, weapons and personal survival expert had planned for just one thing.Survival. For him and his family.The emergency wilderness retreat had been found, fortified and supplied. Now the ultimate crisis was upon them: nuclear strike and Russian invasion.With Rourke half a continent away from family and home.And so began a desperate, epic journey to a home that might not even exist any more, across an America shattered and burning, where murderous bands fought and killed. Killed for food, for clothing, weapons, and even from a sheer lawless lust for destruction.
