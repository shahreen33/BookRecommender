Everyone knows they belong together…except them.Daphne Davidson has a problem. She broke up with her boyfriend a month ago and she still hasn’t found a date to her sister’s upcoming wedding. If she goes solo, she’ll be inundated with sly comments about how she can’t keep a man. They aren’t wrong. She can’t keep a man because she’s never dated the one she really loves—her best friend, Jack Reese.Detective Jack Reese has been secretly in love with Daphne since he knew what love was. Yet she’s never shown any interest in him and he decided being friends was better than nothing. When he finds out that she’s diving into the pit of vipers she calls a family, he’s determined to protect her. Going undercover as Daphne’s date means holding her hand, kissing her lips, and pretending to be in love. The latter part isn’t hard. What’s tough is resisting the urge to claim her.
