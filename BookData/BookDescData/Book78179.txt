Bestselling author Jon Ronson walks the mean streets of America, where he finds real-life modern-day superheroes fighting crime, saving old ladies and runaways, and chasing away drug dealers-all while wearing a mask and a cape. These do-gooding citizens talk the talk and walk the walk of mythical superheroes; the only thing they're missing is actual supernatural powers. "The Amazing Adventures of Phoenix Jones" is a short, inside, intimate look at the world of amateur superheroes and a front-row seat to their adventures. This eBook includes a bonus chapter from "The Psychoath Test."
