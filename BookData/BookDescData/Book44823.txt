The book was re-edited in July 2017, please make sure you refresh the dowload with the newest versionWhat was supposed to be an extended family camping trip turns horribly wrong.  All Liala wanted for her 21st birthday is to reconnect with her long dead mother at the place her parent's met and they used to visit until her death. Despite an old woman's warning the camp of her extended family and friends is eventually set up at a secluded little piece of paradise... and right in the middle of the local were-wolf pack's territory.  Howl is a horror/paranormal/erotica story and contains topics that are not suitable for minors or the fainthearted, such as gore, non-con/dub-con, and borderline interaction.  Publisher's comment: D.S. Wrights returns to what had held us at the edge of our seat reading The Beast And Me and beyond.
