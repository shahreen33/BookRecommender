Drawing on experiences from a misspent youth, she opens a domination dungeon in an outbuilding in her garden and sets herself up as a dominatrix.Whipping, torturing and abusing the wealthy slaves who soon start lining up for her services is surprisingly easy for Emma, especially since she has no sexual contact with her clients. In fact, she believes them all to be sick perverts. The unthinkable happens when she falls in love with one of them – the disturbingly likeable Simon Nel. Fighting her emotions every step of the way, Emma is drawn into a twisted and potentially doomed relationship that will force her to reconsider everything she thought she knew about love, sexuality and power.
