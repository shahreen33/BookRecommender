From USA Today bestselling author Kimberly Knight, comes a short, steamy read that you won't want to put down.  Sensation.  A sacred place free from judgment or inhibitions. The only rule: Ask before you touch.  Sensation is an exclusive black-tie party attended by at least one hundred and fifty of the clubs most privileged members, and held once a month at an undisclosed mansion in Beverly Hills.  You may watch. You may interact. You can come together or you can choose to come alone.  The choice is yours.  Would you like it rough? Would you like to be caressed and worshipped? Or would you simply like to observe?  What do you desire?
