Bane Naked surfer. Habitual pothead. A con, a liar, a thief, and a fraud. Last I heard, he was extorting the rich and screwing their wives for a living. Which is why I'm more than a little surprised to find him at my threshold, looking for my friendship, my services, and most puzzling of all - looking humbled. Thing is, I'm on a boycott. Literally - cut boys from my life. Permanently. Problem is, Bane is not a boy, he is all man, and I'm falling, crashing, drowning in his sweet, perfect lies. Jesse Carter Hot as hell, cold as ice. I wasn't aware of her existence until a fat, juicy deal landed in my lap. She's a part of it, a little plaything to kill some time. She is collateral, a means to an end, and a side bonus for striking a deal with her oil tycoon stepdad. More than anything, Jesse Carter is a tough nut to crack. Little does she know, I have the f--king teeth for it.
