"Great plot and characters. I really enjoyed this author's writing style and will be reading more of her work. I highly recommend this book." Netgalley reviewer "A must read for everyone who loves psychological suspense!!!! Goodreads reviewer  Everyone has secrets, and Rachel Holloway is no exception. She’s worked hard to keep the past where it belongs: dead and buried. And so far, she’s been very successful.  But now the small newspaper where she works wants to produce a podcast on a cold case: the disappearance twelve years ago of little Molly Forster.   Some secrets should never see the light of day, and as far as Rachel is concerned, whatever happened to little Molly is one of them. Rachel has a life now, a boyfriend she loves and a three-year-old daughter she adores, and she will do anything to protect them.  But to do that, no one can ever know that she is Molly Forster.
