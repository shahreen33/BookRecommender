In Jesus’ name we pray; on His team we play! Maybe you’ve been told that you’re one of the most dedicated players on the team. Or maybe that’s what you want to be. When it comes to your dedication to God’s team—the one that matters most—what kind of player would Jesus say you are? Just as an athlete is recruited to play a sport, Jesus recruits you to play in the spiritual game of life. Standards that make a good athlete include strength, confidence, and hard work. What about God’s standards? We can use God’s Word to evaluate the way we choose to live. Every effective team works toward a common goal. The purpose of this Bible study and devotional is to help encourage, inspire, and build committed Christian athletes who desire to consistently follow Christ’s game plan. No more “game-day-only” athletes. Playing on God’s Team is about being an everyday follower of Jesus, on and off the field, in and out of season!
