After reading a scandalous pamphlet entitled SECRETS OF A WEDDING NIGHT, Miss Amelia Templeton cried off from her engagement. But her mother is set on seeing her daughter land a peer before the end of the Season. Amelia will do her duty. This time she has a list of the oldest, and most titled men in the ton who are looking for a wife. She'll marry one of them. But first she needs to get over her fear of a wedding night. She enlists the help of Mr. Thaddeus Hammond, a mere mister who is riddled with scandal, but worse, he's her dead brother's closest friend. Thad has never told the story of what happened the night Amelia's brother died, but he did make her a promise. She issues him a scandalous proposal: spend the night with her to show her the real secrets of a wedding night.
