Gage Ryan was a notorious heartbreaker, on screen and off. A confirmed bachelor, this world-famous actor dashed the hopes of millions of adoring fans when he rejected marriage and commitment: no wedding bells, no baby carriages.  He'd never had cause to consider the alternative, but that all changed the night he met rising star, Morgan Kelly. Too bad her first impression of him was less than favorable.  Although their attraction was instant and mutual, Morgan wasn't interested. Hollywood heartthrobs were trouble. Especially Gage, a man used to women who would do anything for his attention.  Not happening.  But Gage knew how to go after what he wanted, and his desire for Morgan was stronger than anything he'd ever felt before. Powerful enough to make him reconsider his previously held beliefs on love and longevity. He just had to convince her of how serious he was. It was a good thing he was ready for the chase.
