Roselette Horton... Miss Prim and Proper. Arm candy for one of the richest men in Hoffman. Fate had her saving my life. Now I'm indebted to repay the favour.Rose has the biggest stick up her arse. It’s surprising she can even put one foot in front of the other. She has no clue what it means to be living, or who she really is. To the outside world Rose has everything, but to those who pay close attention, it’s nothing short of a well-constructed façade.I’m Finlay Crossley and I’m a simple misfit from the wrong side of the tracks. Until three days ago, I didn't have two cents to rub together. Rose is my opposite in every way, but as the saying goes—‘opposites attract.’ How in the world does a socialite notice a nobody like me? It all happens when a loser becomes a winner.
