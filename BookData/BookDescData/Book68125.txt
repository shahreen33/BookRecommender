ASIN moved from  this editionZuri Primrose hasn't been on a date since her divorce over a year ago. About to turn the big 4-0, she's living the life of a hermit without any sex. Her mother isn't going to let her daughter stay single for long. She's gotten Zuri an invite to a shifter ball where she hopes Zuri will find the man who’s going to screw her into a pretzel and give her a dozen babies. Zuri's sure her mom didn't expect for a shifter to up and toss her over his shoulder and run out. Nope. Mom so did not see that coming.  Savage McKane doesn't do parties. Or people. And he certainly doesn't do fancy clothing. But when his friend, the town sheriff, asks him to help as security for the event, he shows up despite his lack of desire to be there. He didn't expect to find his mate, nor the inability to control his animal, and run off with her. But now that he's got her, he's not going to let her go. His bear is demanding he keep her and Savage is in full agreement.  Zuri and Sav might be complete opposites, but that doesn't stop the love growing between them. Zuri is realizing powerful truths about herself; she can’t live without him. But will she stay alive long enough to tell him? For Sav, nothing is more important than getting his mate to realize his love for her. He didn't run up a mountain with her on his shoulder just to let her walk away. He will happily tear anyone limb from limb who tries to stop him.
