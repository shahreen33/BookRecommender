Sweet and innocent and lost in the woods. It sounds like the start of a fairy tale. But this is no fairy tale and Ash Carson is no knight in shining armour.He brought me to his tumbledown cabin deep in the forest and now he won't let me leave. refusing point blank to open the door until the blizzard dies down.He might be the most handsome man I've ever met and my only hope of survival but he's also infuriatingly stubborn and what's worse, he won't stop staring at me with hunger in his eyes. I know what that look means and I'm so scared, I can hardly move.I don't know what to do. He's just given me two options, leave or stay. If I leave, I'll freeze to death. If I stay? Well, he's warned me what will happen if I stay. He won't listen to reason, he won't argue. He wants my innocence and he's going to take it. The most shocking thing about all of this? I want to let him.
