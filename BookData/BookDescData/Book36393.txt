Callie Jensen has always been a little bit different. She was made fun of for being a math-whiz in school up until she was kidnapped. Growing up in the crime world from a young age, she was turned into a language savant and a hacker-expert. She tried to do what she was told and keep her head down...but...that was easier said than done. Trouble seems to follow her like it's her middle name. Eventually, things come to a head that puts her in the sights of a secret government organization. She finally has some allies in the form of several muscular, irresistibly handsome and talented guys. Callie wonders if she'll be able to find peace at last, but the struggles only keep piling up as she is shuffled around, wondering when or even if she will ever find somewhere she feels like is safe. People whom she thought were safe might not be. And not only that, but her kidnapper is not willing to give her up without a fight, and he shows her all to well that he will go to some very dangerous lengths to get her back.
