As a Marine Lieutenant Colonel, he could take on any mission and succeed. Raising his two godchildren…with her…just might kill him.  Marine Lieutenant Colonel Logan Jackson thought he was too old to start a family at forty-four, but when his two godchildren are left orphaned, he is forced to fulfill the promise he made to their parents. Accustomed to the battlefield, he’s in for a different kind of fight to keep the children from becoming wards of the state, and out of the clutches of people who want access to their inheritance. Then there’s their feisty godmother, who has relegated him to the friend zone, but he wants her so bad he’ll do almost anything to have her. Teagan Williams can safely dangle a Jeep underneath one of the largest helicopters ever made, wrangle her Alzheimer-afflicted mother who enjoys taking walks away from her memory care unit, and yet she still finds time to enjoy her godchildren. When their mother, her best friend, is found dead, she gets the one thing she’s always wanted, a family. Among the dozens of problems that accompany the children, the biggest one is that she’s forced to share them with Logan Jackson, the best man she’d ever known in her life. She can’t allow him to be anything more than friends, though. It’s too risky. A Promise Never Forgotten is the second full length novel in the Never Forgotten trilogy.
