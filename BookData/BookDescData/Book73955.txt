The Prairie: A Tale (1827) is a novel by James Fenimore Cooper, the 3rd novel written by him featuring Natty Bumppo. His fictitious frontier hero Bumppo is never called by his name, but is instead referred to as "the trapper" or "the old man." Chronologically The Prairie is the 5th &amp; final installment of the Leatherstocking Tales, tho it was published before The Pathfinder (1841) &amp; The Deerslayer (1842). It depicts Natty in the final year of his life still proving helpful to people in distress on the American frontier. The book frequently references characters &amp; events from the two books previously published in the Leatherstocking Tales as well as the two which Cooper wouldnâ€™t write for more than ten years. Continuity with The Last of the Mohicans is indicated by the appearance of the grandson of Duncan &amp; Alice Heyward &amp; the noble Pawnee chief Hard Heart, whose name is English for the French nickname for the Delaware, le Coeur-dur.
