A Rapid-Fire Rewrite!  Former Navy SEAL Max Jacobs is fighting a new war—a war for his family. Suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, Max is unable to control his anger, alienating himself from his wife and destroying their marriage. Recruited into black-ops, Max finds new meaning and focus in the one area of life where he doesn’t fail.  Sydney Jacobs just wants the man she married back. But she can’t find him beneath his anger and penchant for fights. After filing for separation, Sydney immerses herself in a human-interest piece for her local newspaper.  Searching for the soldiers behind a string of heroic interventions, Sydney’s life is threatened. And Max is powerless to stop his wife from delving into a danger she cannot fathom. Sydney’s mission to find a happy-ending story might just get her killed.   Nightshade kept me up all night! A tight plot, heartthrob heroes, and description so rich I could hear the jungle noise, feel the heat slide down my back.
