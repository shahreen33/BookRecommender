As with everything else in my life, the descent into Hell was not so simple.   When I jumped into the portal I expected to find the Sins on the other side. I expected to find my people—demons—waiting and ready.   What I found were flames and fire and ash.  The apocalypse hadn’t waited for me. It had already begun.  Hell’s barriers were collapsing in on themselves—making my task of finding the Sins infinitely harder. As the Horsemen and I set out on our journey to find them, we discover that not all is what it seems.  A white-haired assassin once told me to beware of the evil that hides in plain sight.  I should have listened to her.  The fight for Hell has begun, and the duty of saving it lies solely on my shoulders, but to win—to survive—I must unravel the secrets of the past if any of us are to see the future.  I will take what is mine, even if I have to bleed for it.
