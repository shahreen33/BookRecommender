EL James has made $50 million from the Shades of Grey Trilogy. In "The Fifty Shades of Grey Phenomena", best-selling erotic writer Chloë Thurlow reveals the secrets of how it's done. With a point-by-point study of "Fifty Shades of Grey", Thurlow provides insider tips of writing romance erotica. She shows how to create living characters, and how to keep readers glued to the page by "showing" what's happening through action, not "telling" the reader with dull explanation. There are selections from the first Master of Erotica, the Marquis de Sade, and how erotica has changed through the ages; excerpts from Thurlow's own writing; a list of erotic publishers hungry for new material - and lots more. For writers setting out to write romantic erotica, and for established writers who want to add a sharp new tool to their erotic toolbox, "The Fifty Shades of Grey Phenomena" is essential reading. Chloë Thurlow is the author of five acclaimed novels, numerous erotic short stories and essays. "Ms. Thurlow's writing is captivating. The fantasy she builds flows with a hint of conspiracy and I would recommend this book to those who want to read about some of the lesser-known BDSM fetish play." The Romance Reviews, on "A Girl's Adventure", an Xcite Books top-selling title.
