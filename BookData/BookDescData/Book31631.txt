Listening Length: 8 hours and 51 minutesThe Tarzana Hookers are a motley crew of women, all of whom are not afraid to speak their minds. Except Sheila, a timid, anxiety-ridden crocheter in desperate need of money, who sells her beautiful scarves at a local consignment store. When the owner stiffs Sheila, the boisterous ladies rally to her support. Then the shop owner is found dead. Molly Pink ignores the warnings from her homicide-detective boyfriend and sets out with her stitchmates to clear Sheila's name.
