Bridget Jones meets You've Got Mail in this exciting and laugh-out-loud debut for fans of Sophie Kinsella. Twenty-six-year-old Cassy Brookes thinks she has everything under control, but one disastrous morning changes all that. She soon finds herself torn between searching for love and outwitting work-rival, Martin. Then, stuck in a doctor's surgery, Cassy scribbles a message in a puzzle book and when she returns for a check-up she sees someone has replied. Will finding the mystery puzzle-man be the cure to all her problems or will the truth turn out to be a bitter pill to swallow?
