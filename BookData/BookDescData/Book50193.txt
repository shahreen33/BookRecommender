WESWhen I was a kid, my dad was the gardener for the richest man in town. His daughter, Lily Barnes, told me she could never like a guy like me. Then she kissed me and told me it would never happen again. When it happened again, she told me she could never love me because she was going to leave this place, and I would never leave my dad. We were never quite friends, not exactly enemies, and we could never quite stop secretly kissing each other.She never said goodbye before running off to try to make it as an actress. That was her dream, and I wanted her to chase it. Okay, maybe I hated her for it, just a little.Now she’s back, with no money and even more sass. A lot has changed around here…except for my hidden feelings about Lily Barnes.LILYSo, it turns out I’m a terrible actress and now I’m back!When my father offers me a job at his company, I actually think he’s finally decided I’m worthy of one day taking over the family business. Imagine my surprise when I find out that the gardener’s son is the one who’s being groomed to take over, and I’ve been assigned to work for him.Wes Carver has always been rich in confidence and abs, but now he’s rich in everything, including disdain for yours truly.If he thinks I’m not built to work, he’s wrong.If he thinks he can boss me around just because he’s my boss, he’s delusional.If he thinks I’m still the girl who could never love him…I may be a better actress than anyone thought.
