TaraI stopped believing in fairytales after everything I loved was taken from me.I'm an optimist in a raincoat now.Love, relationships, family, they're all a farce.Love left me broken, a shell of the woman I once was. And when my ex-husband takes away my last ray of sunshine, I know it's time to close myself off from the world, that is until Jude Finn.JudeTo hell with 80/20 relationships. Why risk it, when I can avoid it?I rebuilt my life in another country, focusing on my job as a physiotherapist. But then I met Tara Craig, the stubbornest, and most frustrating woman alive.She tests my limits, and as much as I want to keep a distance, I can't,because she reminds of a girl that marked my soul a long time ago.
