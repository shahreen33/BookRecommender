I had everything a woman could want. â€¦My husband, James. The house on the lake.My life. Our perfect life.And then Alex came to visit.The first time I saw my husband's best friend, I didn't like him. Didn't like how James changed when he was around, didn't like how his penetrating eyes followed me everywhere.But that didn't stop me from wanting him. And, surprisingly, James didn't seem to mind.It was meant to be fun. Something the three of us shared for those hot summer weeks Alex stayed with us. Nobody was supposed to fall in or out of love. I didn't need another man, not even one who oozed sex like honey and knew all the secrets I didn't know, the secrets my husband hadn't shared. After all, we had a perfect life.And I loved my husband.But I wasn't the only one.
