Victor Shelton ran from his family's legacy of prophetic dreams at seventeen but finds at twenty-eight that he is unable to run from the nightmares that plague him. Haunted by images of his own death each night he follows the fleeting memory of the town limit's sign in his nightmare to a quaint Colorado town. Beckoned to a forbidding mountain peak with a past riddled by ghost stories and legends, Victor must figure out who is friend or foe. Can he unravel the secrets of the enigmatic citizens of Carver's Corner and solve his own murder before it happens? Perhaps the answers are in the siren song of whatever is calling him to the caves under Maiden's Peak. The song in the darkness urges him on, but whether it is to his death or to his salvation, Victor can't say. All he knows is that once before he had not heeded the call of his dreams and someone had died. He can't let that happen again.
