A new, sexy standalone from #1 New York Times Bestseller, Vi Keeland.When I first encountered Ford Donovan, I had no idea who he was…well, other than the obvious. Young, gorgeous, successful, smart. Did I mention young? If I did, it bears repeating. Ford Donovan was too young for me.Let’s back up to how it all started. My best friend decided I needed to start dating again. So, without my knowledge, she set up a profile for me on a popular dating site—one that invited men ages twenty-one to twenty-seven to apply for a date. Those nicknamed Cunnilingus King were told they’d go straight to the top for consideration. The profile wasn’t supposed to go live. Another point that bears repeating—it wasn’t supposed to. Nevertheless, that’s how I met Ford, and we started messaging. He made me laugh; yet I was adamant that because of his age, we could only be friends. But after weeks of wearing me down, I finally agreed to one date only—my first after twenty years of being with my high school sweetheart. I knew it couldn’t last, but I was curious about him.Though, you know what they say…curiosity kills the cat.My legs wobbled walking into the restaurant.Ford was seated at the bar. When he turned around, he took my breath away.His sexy smile nearly melted my panties. But…he looked so familiar. As I got closer I realized why. He was the son of the neighbor at our family’s summer home. The boy next door.Only now…he was all man. I hadn’t seen him in years.I left the restaurant and planned to put the entire crazy thing behind me. Which I did. Until summer came.And guess who decided to use his family’s summer home this year?
