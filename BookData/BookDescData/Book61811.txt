As the Chief of Pediatric Cardiology at Grady Memorial, Karlee Shae Kinkade deals with hearts all day long-- young ones, and she’s the best at mending them when they’re broken.With a schedule like hers, there’s no time for love. Her patients need her.She’s tried finding it on her own, but love is fickle when time is precious.Instead, she gets that warm, fuzzy feeling that love brings from her patients and her ‘Magic Brew’ at the local coffee shop. They say there’s a love potion in those coffee beans. If there is, put it in an IV bag and hook Karlee up STAT.While she is saving lives and finding cures for heart disease, her friends are getting engaged or married, and some are starting families. Karlee feels her biological clock ticking with no future husband in sight.That is until the hot new Emergency doctor stalks her to find out where the ‘Magic Brew’ comes from.He’s bold and funny, with an accent like James Bond and a smile that will make your heart explode. There are only two things holding her back…he’s a colleague and she isn’t a fan of the hospital rumor mill. She’s seen enough of Grey’s Anatomy to know she doesn’t need that kind of drama in her life.Can Karlee throw caution to the wind and follow what her own heart is telling her?
