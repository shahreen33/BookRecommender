Lenny Oliver's secrets ended his life--lies he dressed up in detailed and occasionally elaborate finery. But only the secret holder is fooled in the long run, as Lenny discovered in a dark alley in the Wall Street neighborhood. Michael McKaybees is a private investigator working in New York's five boroughs. He specializes in money crimes like insurance fraud, with the occasional cheating spouse (his partner's favorite since she thinks all cheaters should be flogged in public). Now, however, he has been forced to expand his investigative work to include homicide. Implicated in his best friend Lenny's death, Michael finds himself entangled in a web carefully woven by someone who wants to destroy him--and there's no doubt he's up to his neck in shit. Then there's his father, Marlowe Black, who has decided now is the right time to show up after an absence of more than three decades. Hell, Michael didn't even know he was still alive. Marlowe's reputation as a combat-hardened PI is well-known among the City's criminal element, making him a hated man. And he, too, is a suspect in Lenny's murder. When McKaybees discovers the body of Lenny's wife, Jill--Michael's childhood sweetheart--hidden in his apartment, murder becomes seriously personal and the need for vengeance demanding.
