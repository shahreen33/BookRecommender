Where do we search to find Happiness and Success? The deep happiness, the fulfilling and peaceful place we all desire. In Foundation Stones to Happiness and Success James Allen shows us where to begin to search and how to start building a strong foundation on which to build our happiness and success."It is wise to know what comes first, and what to do first. To begin anything in the middle or at the end is to make a muddle of it."James Allen was a British philosophical writer known for his inspirational books and poetry and as a pioneer of self-help movement. Allen's practical philosophy for successful living has awakened millions to the discovery that "they themselves are makers of themselves." Allen insists that it is within the power of each person to form his own character and create his own happiness.
