Following the (mis)fortunes of Aeisla, her compatriot Iriel, and their ad hoc band of nubile, Amazonian warrior women, this tale reveals how they are forced to flee their native Aegmund or face bizarre and public erotic punishment. Their passages worked copiously, andÂ they arrive by ship at the kingdom of Oretea. Political scheming, slavery, and perverse punishments ensue in this, the fabulously inventive final part of Aishling Morgan's Maiden saga.
