 She made a deal with a dark god. Now he's come to collect.   When her best friend is mortally wounded, Rhia makes a deal with a dark god to save him. She expects to give up her soul, but he wants something far more binding: Her servitude.  Rhia is made the next Dark Lady--a sorceress who answers only to Aeredus, Lord of Darkness--and is given powers beyond her wildest dreams, along with three sexy, dangerous men to do her bidding.  But an evil god won't ask for mere tribute in his name. He wants the very essence of Good brought to its knees. To avoid being corrupted by the lure of Evil, Rhia will have to be nimble, cunning, and willing to trust a conniving warlock, an oathbreaking paladin, and a brutish half-orc.  It's either that or become utterly seduced by the darkness and lose sight of her old life forever...  Her Dark Guardians is a revere harem (or WhyChoose) medium-burn fantasy romance series. Throughout the series you'll find explicit MF, MFM, MM, and MMF scenes, as well as--most importantly--a heroine who doesn't have to choose between her three (and eventually five!) men.
