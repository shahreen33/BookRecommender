Dragon's Prey Tielle St. Clare " Book 4 in the Shadow of the Dragon series." Captured and put into slavery, it should be a simple thing for Kayla to escape, if only her dragon would cooperate. But the blasted beast-bored with the males at home-sees Kayla's captivity as the perfect opportunity to find her mate. When her dragon finds "the" man for Kayla, he's all wrong. He's too strong, too aggressive and way too grouchy. He's the perfect mercenary but he'll make a rotten husband. Unfortunately, her body-and her dragon-don't care about any of that and while she wants to hate Captain Sixx, she finds herself unable to resist him. For Sixx, getting the pretty little slave as a gift is more irritation than pleasure. What's he supposed to do with her? He's got enough troubles-including a curse and a snotty young warrior preparing to challenge him-now he's got "her" to deal with. Of course, having Kayla chained up in his bedchamber does have its benefits. So now Kayla just has to figure out how to get home, keep Sixx safe from her father's wrath, oh, and tell her lover she's part dragon.
