Top three reasons why sleeping with the enemy is a bad idea...1. She’s my fiercest rival.2. She’s also my fiery ex.3. We’re going up against each other in a stiff competition to win the hottest new client on the market.And yet, I’d like to be up against the wall in a stiff competition to get her to call out my name.Time to double down on my resistance to her tough-as-nails, take-no-prisoners, sexy-as-sin attitude. The same attitude that I find irresistible. That’s the big problem, because in this race to nab the client I run into Haven in the hotel, on the beach, in the guest quarters late at night.Hate sex would be a terrible idea.Except, it’s the complete opposite, and now we can’t keep our hands off each other.
