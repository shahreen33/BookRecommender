Montaigne's Essays, which are at once the most celebrated and the most permanent of his productions, form a magazine out of which such minds as those of Bacon and Shakespeare did not disdain to help themselves; and, indeed, the Frenchman's literary importance largely results from the share which his mind had in influencing other minds, coeval and subsequent.Montaigne's Essays are, in effect, an extended autobiography, the only one ever to be written in this way. Montaigne does not proceed along the line of time; he does not tell us what event succeeded what other. His aim is to present a portrait of himself in a frame of timelessness; to build up from a number of partial sketches the essential man; not as an unchanging being, but as one who retained a core of identity more important as a subject than the events that befell him. Against a brilliant range of subjects--from cannibals to physiognomy--the man is displayed as objectively detached, tireless in his search for truth, and at all times restrained. His essential modesty is revealed nowhere more clearly than in his famous medal with its inscription, Que s√ßais-je? [What do I know?].Cohen's selection of twenty-six essays comprises approximately one-third of the total essays to be found in an un-abridged version.
