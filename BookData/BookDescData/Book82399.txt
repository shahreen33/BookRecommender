Runic Revelation is the second book in the Runic series, a contemporary epic fantasy series set in the world of Doma, where magical engineers called Runics rule the land. They are equaled in power only by Weavers, men and women that can manipulate the very fabric of the universe with their wills.  A week has passed since the Empire was nearly destroyed by the dark god Xanos. Now the leader of the most powerful government in the world, Kalibar must protect his people against Xanos’s undead army. But when an assassin nearly succeeds in murdering Kalibar, he realizes that the Empire stands little chance against Xanos’s enormous power.  With terrorists attacking the city and systematically murdering members of the highest levels of government, Kalibar must find a way to protect his country – and his new family – from an enemy he cannot begin to understand. If he fails, the Empire will be utterly destroyed…and millions of innocent people will perish!
