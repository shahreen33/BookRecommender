BENDING HER TO THE BEAR’S WILLThe human thinks I’m stalking her. Maybe I am. But I’m not the only one.There’s something evil in these woods and it preys on single women. I’m not about to let the sexy scientist fall into its lair. Even if that means holding her prisoner in my cabin. Keeping her where I can see her at all times. Bending her to my bear’s will. Just until the storm passes. Until her research is finished. Then I’ll let her go.I swear.
