A closer look at the last two centuries of the world will im-mediately reveal the presence of a ‘mastermind’ behindthe radical changes around the world, building and fallingof states, countless wars that caused millions of deaths, as well as scourges including communism, wild capitalism, anarchism, Darwinism and the widespread moral decline. Interestingly enough,this structure has been only very rarely named. The name of thiscovert system is the BRITISH DEEP STATE.The British deep state is in fact a mafia organization that is a completely separate entity independent of the British people and the British administration. In fact, it is the biggest enemy of the British people and the British state, represented by the British flag and the British Parliament; it has and is still inflicting great damage on Britain. As a reminder of this fact, the pictures of the British flag and the British Parliament are frequently used throughout the book.It should be remembered that criticism contained in this book isnot targeting the British state, the British government, the Britishflag or the British people. On the contrary, British people are decent,kind, refined people that have always been good friends. The criti-cism is solely directed at the dark structure that brought nothingbut disaster to the whole world, including the British people.This book sheds light on the mentality and practices of this bloodyorganization that devised countless horrible events currently shakingthe world, with a particular focus on its dirty plans for Turkey andthe Turkish people in the last two centuries.The End Times that we are living in now is a surprising time of in-creased atrocities by the said mafia structure. However, these insid-ious plans will surely be foiled with the appearance of Hazrat Mahdi(pbuh).
