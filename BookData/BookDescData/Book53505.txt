Broadway hotshot Nik Kovalenko is a confirmed bachelor.  Ballroom champion Jess Davenport is a bona fide Scrooge.  Last year, they shared a midnight kiss at a New Year’s Eve party that made both of them believe—briefly—in the magic of the holiday season. The magic was cut short when Nik went on tour the next day, but he never stopped thinking about that kiss—or Jess.  When the holidays roll back around, Nik runs into Jess again. He doesn’t want to spend another year pining for the Scrooge who got away, so he tells Jess he’ll stay if she’ll give him a shot at being her Christmas Present.  Jess thinks he’s full of it, but she agrees to three dates. If Nik can make her believe in holiday magic in a place as un-wintery as Los Angeles—and convince her that he’s ready to stick around—she’ll give him a chance. But he won’t know until New Year’s Eve. If she kisses him at midnight, he’ll have his answer…  Praise for Alexis Daria:  “An author who clearly adores the world she’s developed—and the characters she’s matched.”—Sarah MacLean, New York Times&gt; bestselling author, Washington Post  “A charming and authentic voice.”—Sonali Dev, author of A Distant Heart
