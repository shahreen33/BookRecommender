Avery Melrose is used to having it all. So when her boyfriend cheats on her, she reacts like any spoiled rich girl-she freaks out and vandalizes his new truck, Carrie Underwood style. Now she's stuck with 300 hours of community service doing road-side garbage duty.Seth Hunter just got out of prison, and after a few hundred hours picking up litter on the side of the highway, he can finally put his mistakes behind him. If he can string together some kind of existence, maybe it'll be enough to get his sister away from their stepfather, the man who sent Seth to prison in the first place.A romance between these two is doomed from the start. Girls like Avery want castles and white horses, and Seth is no prince charming.But sometimes, being around Avery makes Seth think he could make something of himself. Maybe even be worthy of a girl like her. It's just too bad real life gets in the way first, tearing these two apart before they have any chance of getting to Happily Ever After.
