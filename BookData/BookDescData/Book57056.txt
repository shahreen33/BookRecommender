One of children's literature's most memorable characters returns in this Christmastime companion to the Newbery Medal-winning A Year Down Yonder and Newbery Honor-winning A Long Way from Chicago. The eccentric, larger-than-life Grandma Dowdel is back in this heart-warming tale. Set 20 years after the events of 
  A Year Down Yonder
, it is now 1958 and a new family has moved in next door: a Methodist minister and his wife and kids. Soon Grandma Dowdel will work her particular brand of charm on all of them: ten-year-old Bob Barnhart, who is shy on courage in a town full of bullies; his two fascinating sisters; and even his parents, who are amazed to discover that the last house in town might also be the most vital. As Christmas rolls around, the Barnhart family realizes that theyâ€™ve found a true home, and a neighbor who gives gifts that will last a lifetime.
