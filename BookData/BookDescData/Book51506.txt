The hitman with a heart of gold is back in a thriller that opens with an explosive terrorist attack on San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.
  
 Viral video footage from a terrorist attack in San Francisco reveals that a mob informant thought dead is still alive. FBI Special Agent Charlie Thompson knows just whom to contact to save her witness from a hit: Michael Hendricks, who has lately focused his unusual skill set on infiltrating the Council--a tribunal of the major crime families--and avenging his partner's death. Teaming up with a green but determined tech whiz, Cameron, on the condition she leave him alone after the case, Hendricks reluctantly takes the job. Of course, finding a man desperate to stay hidden is challenging enough without deadly competition, let alone when that competition's shadowy corporate backer is tangled in the terrorist conspiracy playing out around them...
