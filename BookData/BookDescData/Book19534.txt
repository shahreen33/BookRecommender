Persephone has been hiding herself since she was born. Shielded by her mother’s embrace, she doesn’t know who she is, but she knows this isn’t the life she wanted. She is stronger than her mother’s fears, stronger than the maiden Olympus thinks her to be. She was chosen by Gaia herself, and deep inside of her she knows it. Maybe the grieving king of the Underworld can be her chance to prove her value. «I was born the destroyer, not the destroyed.»
