Beth was transformed from a nobody to a somebody, but now she's B-list again.   She -- and everybody else -- got played by Kaia, Kane and Harper.   Nobody can comfort Miranda, who feels so betrayed that she's sworn revenge.   Adam is lashing out at anybody who will listen -- or buy him a drink.   And somebody is stalking Kaia; looks like Reed won't stand for sloppy seconds....   Revenge is the name of the game. And for somebody, it's game over.
