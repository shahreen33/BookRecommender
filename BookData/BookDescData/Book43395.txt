Fresh, sharp and wickedly funny, a tragicomic tale of modern living from the author of SubmarineRay is not a bad guy. Sure, he's just cheated on his heavily pregnant wife. He secretly despises all of his friends. His career as a freelance tech journalist is dismal, and he can't afford any of the hovels that pass for a first-time buyer's house, and he spends his afternoons churning out listicles in his pants. But Ray is about to learn that no matter how low you sink, things can always get worse...Brace yourself for a wickedly funny look at modernity from the comic genius behind Submarine. The Adulterants is a tale of sadistic estate agents and catastrophic open marriages, dysfunctional friendships and internet trolls, underwhelming panic on the streets of London, and one very immature man finally learning to grow up.
