The beer's not the only thing getting tapped. CALLIE I have a secret. It’ll get me fired if my boss ever finds out…which shouldn’t be a problem except for one thing: my coworker, Reid Morgan. He’s cocky, aggravating, and that hot-as-sin mouth simultaneously makes me want to slap him and melt into the mattress. Now that he’s discovered my secret, he’s doing everything in his power to take my job. REIDI have a problem: my pint-size spitfire of a coworker who’s primed to take my promotion. She’s infuriating, sexy as hell, and I just can’t seem to keep my hands off her. Now we’re both vying for the same position…and only one of us can come out on top.
