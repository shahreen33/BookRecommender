Luella, fierce, strong vampire,Falls for a pretty human catchSent on her fiancé's desireTo celebrate they are engaged.This unexpected turnaboutIs doomed to come to a dead end:Her human sweetheart's dead to shroud;Her fiancé's avenged for that;And she is punished for blood treason,Banished into a mortal child,Whose human body is a prisonFor all her powers to bind.Her memories obliterated,She is to find her love at lastWho proves to be too much relatedTo the misfortunes from her past.
