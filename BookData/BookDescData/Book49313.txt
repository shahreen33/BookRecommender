ETHAN WASN'T THE ONLY ONE.  Sam can’t take his eyes of the totem he found in Belize, and he doesn’t dare let anyone else learn it’s in his possession. He knows there’s something special about the stone figurine, even if he can’t quite figure it out.  Until Ezra, a professional pick-pocketer, steals it from him in the Denver airport.  But Ezra has eyes only for the enormous sapphire set into the stone, and she can’t possibly imagine the totem’s true value. So it’s the surprise of a lifetime when she accidentally triggers Sam’s terrible, beastly transformation.  Bouncing between drug dealers and mohawk-wearing psychopaths, Sam and Ezra must find a way to protect the totem—and each other. Can they master their power quickly enough to escape the dragon chasing them, or will they be burnt to a crisp in an avalanche of dragonfire?  GRYPHONS VS DRAGONS is a new paranormal shapeshifter series from Ruby Ryan. There’s steamy romance, exciting action, and no cliffhangers. Each book in the series can be read standalone (although are more enjoyable read in order), and of course each features a Happily Ever After!
