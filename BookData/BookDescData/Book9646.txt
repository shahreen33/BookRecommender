'Have A Nice Weekend' is less the story of two hearts breaking as of time running out…. It is the sound of marital negotiations breaking down. Women will read this book and think, “Exactly! I only want to be noticed, to be loved, to be considered …. It doesn't take much …..” Men will read this and go, “God, I've done that! How many times has she done that to me? By what right …..?” Whatever the requests Will agreed to comply with and then didn't, he is miserable now. Abi was his first girlfriend. When she said she loved him, he was taken by surprise but kind of agreed. They got married, but she made all the arrangements for the wedding. When she became pregnant, it was because she decided it was time and stopped taking precautions, but Will thought Sophie was the most beautiful baby in the world when she was born. However time, stress and misunderstandings took their toll, and now they live apart. Now for the big questions - what have they learned? Does Will care enough to try to put things right, and does Abi care enough to let him?
