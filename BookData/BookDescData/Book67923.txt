Twenty-year-old dancer Abby Williams has only ever felt truly herself while she's onstage. It's the one place she gets the firm direction and focused attention she craves to keep her whimsical thoughts in order. Offstage she feels out of place, forced to give up her girlish treasures and bombarded at every turn with adult responsibilities. But one missed dance cue in front of the intimidating theater owner could take all this away. Summoned to Rufus Kingsolver's office, Abby is terrified the darkly handsome, commanding man is about to end her dream. But Rufus has other ideas. He wants to be her Dom. He wants her to call him Daddy. Abby is shocked, but the spark of curiosity and taboo desire have her wanting more. Under Rufus's firm hand, they explore the erotic depths of their unconventional, yet beautiful, relationship. Abby is falling deeper in love with Rufus and the Little/Dom lifestyle, but it's not long before she comes face-to-face with her darkest fearâ€”judgment from the outside world. Daddy knows best, but what if, this once, he can't protect her?
