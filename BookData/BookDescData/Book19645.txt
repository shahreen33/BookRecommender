This book explores two poles: how American youth are indoctrinated with Zionist mythology and how to intervene in that process by teaching American youth about Palestine. The author argues that because the relationship between Zionist education and the Israel lobby continues to be strong, it is necessary to find a way to correct the misrepresentations that infiltrate Western public culture especially for educators.
