A proud king. A defiant queen. An assassination plot. An ambitious, venomous second-in-command, and a 75-foot-tall gallows going up in the heart of town, built especially for the sage-like guardian of the beautiful orphan girl who would become the new queen. On its surface, this historical book is a true tale of a king and a kingdom, but the story runs much deeper and higher. Though never mentioned by name, God is the supreme King and Hero of Esther’s story, planning His people’s deliverance even before man devised their destruction.
