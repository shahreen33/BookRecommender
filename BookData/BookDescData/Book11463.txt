Eight diverse characters, related by marriage and often travelling together, visit multiple locales across the globe by every means of transportation available.The hilarious stories that arise in this romp around the world feature amateur mind control, mirrored hotel room walls, a 1957 Chevy with holes in the floor, an explosion of ladies’ lingerie, sketchy starfish, topless beaches, Bo Derek's doppelgänger, synchronized pill popping, psychological bar fights, thieving baboons, and sexy giraffes.And the humour is perfectly balanced by Barry Finlay’s philanthropic heart, which beats strong through each journey.
