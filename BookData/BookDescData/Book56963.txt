Join acclaimed author Anthony Peake on a historical, theological, and mystical journey through the history of the out-of-body experience. Beginning with his own unexpected introduction to astral travel, and drawing on fascinating accounts of ordinary people whose consciousness achieved escape velocity from their bodies, Peake digs into cutting-edge research in psychology, neurology, neurochemistry, and quantum physics that holds the potential to illuminate this uncanny phenomenon. He reviews all the pertinent theories, finally tying together all the threads and introducing an astonishing new explanation of his own.
