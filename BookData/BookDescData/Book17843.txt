"Everything about you is a lie."  Freeman Sullivan is a man running out of time. As he submits his final manuscript to his sceptical editor, he tells the story of Professor George Tate, and Celus - his seemingly ageless assistant - as they are expelled from the British Museum and embark on a journey that leaves a wake of irrevocably changed lives.  Because Freeman has realised the Professor's truth - that the walls are thinning and the shadows are lengthening as our world awaits Her arrival.
