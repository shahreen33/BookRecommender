Transform toilet training into an action-packed, fun-filled mission! There comes a time when every toddler must answer the call -- the call of doodie! Their mission: identify the target (the toilet), open fire (pee and poo), and make a clean getaway (wash those hands). With each success, little soldiers move up the ranks, from rookie privates to full-fledged poo-tenants!
