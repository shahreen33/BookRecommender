From the creative team of Amanda Conner, Jimmy Palmiotti and John Timms, this storyline explodes out of the blockbuster DC Universe Rebirth event. Comics’ craziest couple face off in HARLEY QUINN: REBIRTH DELUXE EDITION BOOK 1, a hardcover collection of the first two best-selling paperback volumes. Since relocating from Gotham City to Brooklyn’s Coney Island, Harley Quinn has transformed her apartment building into a haven for freaks, strays and other unstable vigilante antihero-types. With her freak-show friends, bestie Poison Ivy, other bestie Red Tool and the Gang of Harleys by her side, Harley’s ready to face all of Brooklyn’s deadliest threats—from zombie armies and giant robots to punk-rock gangs and department store Santas.  But the one thing she’s not ready for? The return of a certain Mistah J. He’s promising to make amends, but not even Harley would be willing to give that whack job a second chance. Right? Collects #1-13.
