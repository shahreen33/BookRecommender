Truth, knowledge, and ethics are far from the concrete absolutes people often see them as. Rather, truth and morality are relative concepts, caught in a continuous cycle of trial and error. In short, truth continually evolves. Dustin Arand explores the implications of ever-adapting ethics in Truth Evolves. Basing his arguments on evolutionary theory, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind, Arand explains how adaptive truth applies to moral duty, religion, and living a meaningful life. At the center of Arand’s worldview is the virtue of corrigibility, or the ability to correct and adjust one’s thoughts and beliefs. Corrigibility lies at the heart of intellectual honesty and integrity, allowing for the correction of the beliefs that govern our daily lives and the institutions that govern our society. Using accessible, easy-to-understand language, Arand applies corrigibility to major philosophical questions on the nature of knowledge, the relationship between beauty and truth, and the difficult, contentious debate over who—or what—counts as a person. A fascinating exploration into the ephemeral nature of knowledge and ethics, Truth Evolves invites you to consider these deeply personal, deeply human issues.
