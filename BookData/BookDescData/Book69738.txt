When you think of rapture, you think of ecstasy, bliss, elation, and things of that nature. In short, a feeling of intense pleasure or joy. Rush had that. Or rather, Rush has that in the beautiful Alika Collins. Alika brings forth everything he wants in a woman. The two literally crashed into each other’s lives, and their whirlwind love story is safely set on solid ground. But is it really? And if so, for how long? There are certainly things that can disrupt what they have just begun to build.  Recently, Rush was dealt a devastating blow: He has a young daughter who he never knew existed. After this life-shattering secret is exposed, Rush finds out that those close to him are the ones behind it all. Feeling betrayed, he instantly dismisses those individuals from his life. In his mind, their actions were unforgivable and mending fences is not of urgency. At present, his primary goal is finding, and forging a relationship, with his child. Nothing will keep him from doing that.  But while Rush is establishing this new phase of life, things are in disarray in the old life.  For one, someone wants Rush's father dead and will go to great lengths to make it happen. Then there’s the mother of Rush's daughter who wants more than to co-parent. This leaves Alika feeling the strain of it all while trying to remain by his side. Yes, things become chaotic. But, Rush is no stranger to chaos. Hell, he even has a club called Chaos, as a testament to where he's been and what he's made of.  But how much can one person take?  Rapture 2 brings many things to question, but it will be interesting to see how it all turns out in the end. Specifically, which relationships will remain intact, and which ones will be forever altered to the point of no return.
