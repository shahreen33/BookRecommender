In keeping with Michael’s widely respected mentorship of up-and-coming writers, “Fade In: The Making of Star Trek - Insurrection” has been published as a textbook that can also be enjoyed as a coffee table book - full of exclusive, never before seen photos and commentary - for the enjoyment of Star Trek fans around the world. Written by Michael Piller, who has been variously described as a “writer’s writer” and the man who played a major role in saving the Star Trek franchise, here is the very inside story of the writing process that resulted in the franchise’s 1998 film Star Trek: Insurrection. Certainly for Star Trek fans – of which there are legions – and students of film and television, this is a sought-after look at the screenwriting process from concept to final film script through the inclusion of treatments, story meetings, storyboards, and the moving of the Trek characters on the resultant creative chessboard. Fans, hungry for this kind of rare access, may well be thoroughly engrossed in and entertained by the book; whereas students of writing for television and film will definitely benefit from this textbook as not only reference material but also as a bona fide annotated resource on this particular film and/or on the entire Star Trek oeuvre, in general.
