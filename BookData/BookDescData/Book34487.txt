A brand new saga of magic and adventure by #1 New York Times best-selling author Brandon Sanderson.  On the planet of Taldain, the legendary Sand Masters harness arcane powers to manipulate sand in spectacular ways. But when they are slaughtered in a sinister conspiracy, the weakest of their number, Kenton, believes himself to be the only survivor. With enemies closing in on all sides, Kenton forges an unlikely partnership with Khriss -- a mysterious Darksider who hides secrets of her own.  White Sand brings to life a crucial, unpublished part of Brandon Sanderson s sprawling Cosmere universe. The story has been adapted by Rik Hoskin (Mercy Thompson), with art by Julius Gopez and colors by Ross Campbell. Employing powerful imagery and Sanderson s celebrated approach to magical systems, White Sand is a spectacular new saga for lovers of fantasy and adventure."
