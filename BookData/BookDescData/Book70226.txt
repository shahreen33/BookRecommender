"My name is Nyah and I'm a hacker. I know things most people would never believe. Things that shouldn't exist, but do." Seventeen-year-old Nyah Parks is a genius hacker who makes a living by cracking the firewalls of the world's largest corporations. But when the biggest job of her life goes wrong, she's plunged into a desperate situation with only one way out: one last hack that will either save her or kill her. So begins Hacker, a modern-day parable that examines the staggering world around us--the seen and unseen--and reminds us that there's far more to who we are than meets the eye.
