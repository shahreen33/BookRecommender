2012-02-11 14:43:38,I always worry when starting a new book that I've made the wrong decision and should have started a different one. #UnnecessaryStress
2012-02-08 19:33:08,Dislike use of short people to take photos for IDs. Results in awful photos taken from below chin angles. Did we learn nothing from myspace?

2012-01-26 18:45:18,@Marie_Lu I like that your dogs would be so eloquent. If mine saw a UFO I'm pretty sure she'd just be wondering if it tasted like bacon.
2012-01-23 22:24:28,and @TedBob now have a beautiful baby micra. Aw just look at it shine. Desperately need a car jar to wipe away that previously owned smell.

2012-01-11 12:45:23,Having major shoe dilemma - to buy or not to buy. I'm pretty sure the dog is spurring me on to buy. She's frivolous like that.
