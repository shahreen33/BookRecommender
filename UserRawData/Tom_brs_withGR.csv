2015-03-27 23:48:47,@DiscoBabaloo @DragonAgeKeep looks like @iAmSparkkie is hogging all the alcohol :)
2015-03-27 23:38:08,@DiscoBabaloo @DragonAgeKeep who's the blurry one on the right?
2015-03-27 21:47:24,Fed up of non-stop coughing. There's something in the air of this pub that irritates my lungs :( Stupid cold/flu...
2015-03-27 20:27:19,@Derek_Hollan Thanks for all your hard work!
2015-03-27 19:50:28,@rencro aww noo! Thanks for all your hard work! Will miss your funny tweets as the keep.
2015-03-27 15:56:31,@BioMaryKirby how do you tell them all apart?
2015-03-26 23:19:45,@Megin_Akoss let me know what you think of the dlc :)
2015-03-26 22:50:21,Turns out the @DragonAgeKeep are more fanatical about coffee than @Derek_Hollan :)
2015-03-26 21:32:33,@iAmSparkkie what's Pho?
2015-03-26 21:28:28,@iAmSparkkie @DiscoBabaloo  http://t.co/OkoAOVSFF7
2015-03-26 21:20:24,@DragonAgeKeep The suprise is that there's a movie of the Dragon Age Keep.
2015-03-26 21:13:04,@iAmSparkkie @DiscoBabaloo http://t.co/hr0z6zH6yq
2015-03-26 20:04:12,Thanks to people tweeting about it I Thought World of Thedas Vol 2 was out soon. Still due in may. :(
2015-03-26 19:52:38,@iAmSparkkie Loghain must live. No excuses :)
2015-03-26 19:39:45,@rencro I like your reddit username :) So much more truthful than @iAmSparkkie
2015-03-26 19:14:53,@DiscoBabaloo I think you had better hide it from @Derek_Hollan
2015-03-26 17:03:14,@SolidSavvy @iAmSparkkie @Derek_Hollan He would be the one to jump after it though.
2015-03-25 22:35:48,Sick of this cough. Tomorrow's objective is to visit the chemist for something to stop it.
2015-03-25 17:31:30,@DragonAgeKeep can I suggest @iAmSparkkie as a replacement?
2015-03-25 11:12:31,@KalliMuse I can't help but think you are talking in some alien language whenever I see the tweets :P
2015-03-25 10:51:59,@KingMcloud You'll have to take that up with Microsoft and EA
2015-03-25 09:56:58,@KalliMuse ah. Alas I won't spoil myself by decoding that. Thanks anyway
2015-03-25 09:56:10,@KalliMuse interesting lore and a cool story.
2015-03-25 09:55:00,@KalliMuse can you say what that is without spoiling the dlc? :P
2015-03-25 09:52:33,@KalliMuse Would you recommened buying the dlc?
2015-03-24 23:12:15,"@honoel Your welcome :) Oh, I meant in terms of putting PW ads on your site."
2015-03-24 22:19:59,There's really not much point watching Top Gear without Jeremy Clarkson. Thats most of the humour gone
2015-03-24 22:17:35,@Izak_Flash ahh right.
2015-03-24 22:16:34,@honoel I'm really enjoying your webcomic so far! From looking around a majority of webcomics are still using Project Wonderful
2015-03-24 22:11:04,Played Elite: Dangerous (PC) in the last 24 hours. http://t.co/ehdUiYJrNH
2015-03-24 20:56:26,@iAmSparkkie @DragonAgeKeep Ha ha. I wish!
2015-03-24 20:44:07,Why am I the only one who got the flu. &gt;.&lt; It's not very fun coughing away and waking up with a blocked nose.
