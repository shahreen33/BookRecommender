2015-10-12 19:47:38,@KyraMNelson Just been talking about how YA needs to be brought into academia with @IveyAlanaWaters!
2015-10-12 19:44:11,@HannahKateSmith I'll check it out! :) Thanks!
2015-10-12 19:42:38,@musicangel54 @spookyspark @KylieKerosene @TheCrazyWriter1 @mangkunifroggy @RebeccaSky No problem sweetie!
2015-10-12 16:15:26,"@IveyAlanaWaters no, I agree with you! It's so sad."
2015-10-12 14:29:28,"@IveyAlanaWaters That's why my dissertation is about YA, to hopefully bring it more into the academic light."
2015-10-12 14:28:58,@IveyAlanaWaters We're studying Northern Lights  this year - which is great but it's the first I've seen YA acknowledged as worth studying.
2015-10-12 14:27:58,@IveyAlanaWaters I try to see merit in it all. Just because something's aimed at a younger reader doesn't mean the content is less poignant.
