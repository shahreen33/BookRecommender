2016-02-04 22:56:16,@CocoaGoddess Also wondering if it's going to be about the actual saga or the fallout associated with her sharing it. Very curious.
2016-02-04 22:55:46,@CocoaGoddess Since it's based on the Rolling Stone article about the tweets I'm curious as to whether or not she's gonna profit.
2016-02-04 22:53:17,I want to read the Rolling Stone article. I think the movie is gonna end up being less about the actual saga and more her sharing it.

2016-02-04 22:48:28,@Joe_Schmucc I wonder if she sold the rights to her story when she did the Rolling Stone article.
2016-02-04 22:48:07,@Joe_Schmucc Sure as shit hopes so. Although the title is misleading they're basing it on the Rolling Stone article about the tweets.
2016-02-04 22:47:16,@CocoaGoddess It gets worse. James Franco is directing a movie about the RS article about the Zola tweets.
2016-02-04 22:44:11,@wtfrain Do you see this shit? https://t.co/bRVyT3ei8O
2016-02-04 22:43:28,Is the chick who made up/lived the Zola saga getting a check though? That's the real question.
