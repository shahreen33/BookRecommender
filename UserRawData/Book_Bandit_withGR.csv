2015-07-25 02:28:50,@miss_print @andithebookworm I didn't love insurgent - the book. It was almost two slow for a sequel
2015-07-25 02:27:51,@miss_print @andithebookworm especially since I haven't read the last book and kinda already figured out what's going to happen
2015-07-25 02:25:47,@miss_print @andithebookworm I'm perfectly okay with not seeing the last two to be honest
2015-07-25 01:47:23,@andithebookworm it did leave out a lot which was annoying
2015-07-25 01:45:45,@andithebookworm I actually liked the movie but the book was better

2015-07-24 17:07:57,@miss_print I got 23 - I don't know what that says about me but since that's almost 10 years younger than my actual age I'll take it!
2015-07-24 17:05:26,@edenjeangrey I got the same age. I'll take it considering I'm almost 10 years older ha ha ha
