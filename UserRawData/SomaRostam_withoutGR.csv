2015-11-14 15:16:37,@KeepItRealist I am not going to act like I know all the history of Islam. I am just speaking on the aspect of humanity and peace.
2015-11-14 15:15:32,@KeepItRealist I'm not a religious person. I just don't believe it's fair to blame all muslims for the actions of a select few.
2015-11-14 15:14:59,"@KeepItRealist well, it seems like you've read a totally different history of Islam from what we have been taught our whole lives"
2015-11-14 15:09:27,@KeepItRealist the religion that these people are following is not our Islam. Islam forbids killing of even ONE person. Thats my point.
2015-11-14 15:07:12,@mvermi @piersmorgan and how do you know that they aren't what Piers says they are? Have you interviewed them?
2015-11-14 15:02:44,@KeepItRealist we do not associate ourselves with ISIS. Never did. Never will. We are Muslims. They are not.
2015-11-14 15:02:15,"@KeepItRealist I understand that, but that does not make the generalisations that some people are making justifiable..."
