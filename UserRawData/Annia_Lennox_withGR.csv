2014-11-03 03:50:46,Still reading After: She's basically trying to date her dad (cliche much) and I'm pretty sure he has a mental condition-seriously.
2014-11-02 19:21:54,Reading After on wattpad. What the hell is this?
2014-11-02 16:10:59,So many people want to date a doctor or lawyer. I want to date a mechanic so they can take care of my car. Those are real skills.

2014-10-12 20:30:45,It feels like a good day for a Might Ducks marathon. Maybe not D3 because there's a shortage of Emilio.
2014-10-11 00:39:01,RIT plays Clarkson tomorrow. Thinking about coming back just to make fun of Clarkson like the old days.
2014-10-10 22:48:30,Waiting for the #sluhockey game at RIT to start! @StLawrenceU
2014-10-01 01:04:00,About to watch my first episode of Scandal. Equal parts afraid I'll love or hate it. Let's see.
2014-09-16 01:59:23,Have you noticed a lot of #Disney movies have quirky/sassy horses?
2014-09-07 21:10:59,My internet's been out for a whole day. This sucks.
2014-09-05 01:30:36,I just want Frankie gone #BB16
2014-09-02 01:23:34,Is it weird that underage drinking in books makes me uncomfortable?
2014-08-30 17:35:50,There's a snake in my basement. This is why living in the country can be bad sometimes.
2014-08-23 22:47:34,Waiting for #IfIStay to start. Tissues are prepared
2014-08-23 15:34:27,#bbw doesn't have the sweater weather candle. So sad. That's why I came to the mall.
2014-08-17 14:12:04,Just finished #wallbanger by @alice_clayton. Probably the funniest book I've read all year. And made me want zucchini bread. Bad.
2014-08-14 00:35:26,Victoria. Unlikely voice of reason #BB16
2014-08-08 01:49:28,So everyone's just playing Derrick's game. If it's like this again next week I might be done. #BB16
2014-08-08 01:34:32,Do you think the house guests will regretting hating Donny since America loves him? #BB16 I do

2014-08-06 12:17:32,My pre-orders of Ugly Love by @colleenhoover and Opposition by @JLArmentrout have been delayed. Someone hates me. I'm being tortured.
2014-07-30 20:07:34,What are the chances Barnes and Noble would already have copies if Opposition or Ugly Love out?  It's a 20 minute drive.
2014-06-13 22:57:09,Guess I'm going to have to read Delirium next so I can watch this show.
2014-06-09 00:44:53,Trying to paint my nails while watching @xtineMAY's book talk on COHF was probably the biggest mistake I've made in months. Too many laughs!
2014-06-08 03:27:58,Just realized all my youtube messages/notifications were going to my spam folder. So sad.
2014-05-22 23:53:21,Why did I not know there was a new Colleen Hoover book coming out? I can now get out of the book hangover from Maybe Someday.
