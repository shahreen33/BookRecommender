2011-04-04 05:19:58,"With the murder weapon in his possession, the final piece of the jigsaw fell into place."
2011-04-03 21:10:52,Have had such a nice birthday/Mother's Day that it is almost worth being another year older.
2011-04-02 17:04:54,Decided to treat myself to an afternoon watching avocets and great-crested grebes. Feeling really refreshed now and ready to write.
2011-04-01 14:55:21,"Must suspend writing tonight as Peterborough United are on TV. Mind you, that in itself may be a horror show! Entertaining though."
2011-04-01 05:13:18,Happy April everyone!
2011-03-30 18:29:38,I've never had writer's block - it's just that a lot of the time I produce a load of gibberish!
2011-03-30 16:39:51,"For a change I'm going to have a coffee with two sugars. If I had a boat, I'd push it out and set sail to..."

2011-03-29 14:12:23,"Well, 'The Killing' may have finished for now but there's a new French sleuth to replace it - is that really possible, I wonder?"

2011-03-27 21:19:12,"Another weekend may have evaporated into inky blackness, but at least the Census return will show that I once existed."
2011-03-27 11:24:27,"Death by stiletto! Shall I choose Jimmy Choo perhaps, or good old Hush Puppies?"
2011-03-27 10:57:28,"Well, 'The Killing' ended last night on BBC but I'm not sure if I'm any the wiser. Lots of loose ends, I feel. Ah, the second series..."
2011-03-27 10:55:33,"Dull overcast day, typical weekend! Ah well, more time to write I suppose and drink more tea. Must get some Earl Grey."
2011-03-27 06:45:56,Didn't anyone tell the birds that the clocks have changed? They could have had an extra hour sleeping instead of waking me!
2011-03-26 23:29:29,Excellent finale to #thekilling. Danish TV certainly beats our sensational TV
2011-03-26 18:20:04,@Sarah_Lund It's the jumper what did it!
2011-03-26 16:14:41,Chocolate biscuits are brilliant when you want to put some tasty tit-bits into a story.
2011-03-26 15:53:02,Working on second book this afternoon. Not easy since the cat keeps pestering me for food. If he's not careful I'll write him out of book!
2011-03-26 10:33:14,"Well, I had so much chocolate last night I need a hair of the dog. Such a shame I can't save this stash for hubby!"

2011-03-24 21:04:10,One day after the Budget and I'm still confused. What was the point in it? These people don't understand 'skint'!!!

2011-03-20 14:57:00,Last night's 'The Killing'. Why wasn't Meyer protected in hospital? Should have been. And Lund should have waited for him before going in.
2011-03-20 08:00:46,"""Is this your wife?"" I pulled back the sheet. He nodded. ""Yes, that's Emily. Do you have her handbag? She has my car keys."""

2011-03-15 11:43:39,The 'difficult' second book is proving just that: it's 'difficult' to find the time to write it! Drat!
2011-03-14 16:11:04,Exactly what drives our insatiable need for crime fiction? Does it stand up to scrutiny?

2011-03-13 20:30:37,No title yet but have completed first few chapters of Mike Malone number 2. He gets under my skin!
2011-03-13 18:29:46,"Scandinavian crime fiction is wonderfully refreshing, free from the melodrama of some of our own."
2011-03-13 17:02:55,DI Mike Malone must drink fifteen mugs of tea a day. It fine hones the brain for super sleuthing.....
2011-03-13 16:56:25,"Ordinary tea is good for you, as well as all the other fancy sorts. Just make sure you do more than show the bag to the water!"

2011-03-12 07:14:03,Love the front cover! Mike Malone will soon be making his first appearance in public.
2011-03-11 20:44:17,There aren't many things nicer than a nice cup of tea - and a biscuit or three to dunk in it. The diet starts tomorrow.
