2017-06-03 22:35:07,Don't use the N word. Burn it. Bury it.
2017-06-03 22:34:43,Being called N Word makes me see red and just annihilate the person daring to speak it. The pain is something that can never be understood.
2017-06-03 22:33:38,As a nurse I've been called the N-word by patients with dementia and those that have no dementia. It hurts either way.
2017-06-03 22:32:46,The N-word in any variation is a disgusting and derogatory term that should not be used. It is full of pain and hurt.
2017-06-03 22:29:18,After seeing Wonder Woman I am ready for Storm to have her own movie. She needs and deserves it.
2017-06-03 22:28:44,Wonder Woman and Storm have always been my favorite female super heroes. The empowerment they represent is just amazing.
