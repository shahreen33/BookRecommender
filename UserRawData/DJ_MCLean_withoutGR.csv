2013-11-07 12:22:33,@aj_colley that's what the commercials are saying. Could it be because the Colts are on at the same time on Fox?

2011-11-29 18:17:27,"@Goatsncrows Verizon is good too, I think. I went with AT&T because it was easy at the time and I was able guilt them into free stuff."
2011-11-29 18:04:41,"Snow in the forecast? Not like Yellowstone, though. I probably won't need the x-country skis."
2011-11-29 18:01:22,"@Goatsncrows sounds like my experience with Alltel. I know some people have had bad luck, but I have been happy with AT&T so far."

2011-11-28 22:15:29,"@LisaACOTA I think it synchs with Amazon, and the library only authorizes it for 14 days - then it un-syncs."
2011-11-28 22:13:33,@AmazingDossett Welcome back!
2011-11-28 22:12:20,"@LisaACOTA Yes - says I can renew as long as no one else has it on hold (they have limited digital copies, it seems)"

2011-11-27 22:01:50,Is there any way both these teams can lose? That would be the only satisfying result. #Patriots #Eagles
