2016-07-07 16:37:12,@crys_leach it's when the turmoil happens more often than not that bothers me. Esp if they just got together at the end of the first book!
2016-07-07 16:36:30,@WriteAsRain_ conflict doesn't have to be with the main couple. There can be outside obstacles that challenge them but they work together
2016-07-07 16:17:46,@goreadabookblog would love for that to be the case more often!
2016-07-07 16:17:17,@Kat_thebooknerd don't have to agree! I just wish it wasn't always that way
2016-07-07 16:12:25,@Kat_thebooknerd there is plenty of other things keeping the plot moving
2016-07-07 16:12:12,"@Kat_thebooknerd I'm not saying no arguments, but typically the couple is at odds or separated for whole books. It's annoying. Plus"
2016-07-07 16:11:37,"@crys_leach yeah, it was more of a rhetorical question because I get that, but dramatics can be elsewhere with a fantasy series"
2016-07-07 16:11:00,@Kat_thebooknerd would like something different. Something so shippable because they are a team!
2016-07-07 16:10:38,@Kat_thebooknerd but how often does that happen? Conflict between couples happens in nearly every 2nd and/or 3rd book in a fantasy series
2016-07-07 16:07:20,"I'd love to see more of that, that's all. In a series especially."
2016-07-07 16:05:52,"Don't they realize so many of us read for swoon, and of everything else is crazy, just have a freaking cute and supportive couple?!"
2016-07-07 16:05:17,Why do authors - esp fantasy - feel the need to have their couples separate and/or fight later in the series? Why can't they just BE?

2016-05-17 20:55:03,@xoxoKellyNina but you have multiple messages when you directly call out people for not liking triangles
2016-05-17 20:46:57,@xoxoKellyNina so now you agree you are shaming readers like me?
2016-05-17 20:45:13,That doesn't mean I can't hate reading about it! That I want OTP and HEA in my books.
2016-05-17 20:43:15,Want to talk about real life? I am freaking DIVORCED. And guess what? I want to marry again! So this is happening in my own life!

2016-05-17 20:35:45,@xoxoKellyNina my point is that I don't care if it's realistic. There are things I like to read and things I don't. Just like ANY reader

2016-01-19 20:36:39,@mizgillianberry and I think we all have trusted bloggers whose reviews we trust or whose tastes align with ours. Nothing wrong with that!
2016-01-19 20:35:36,@literaryetc that's something that definitely rubs me the wrong way. I just don't see the point in reviewing for that purpose.
2016-01-19 20:34:46,@crys_leach same with me and reviewing a book with a love triangle LOL
2016-01-19 20:34:02,"@mizgillianberry (and I know there's a difference between reviewing only 4 and 5 star books, and actually rating EVERY BOOK OMG 5 stars lol)"

2016-01-19 20:29:10,@mizgillianberry close with. But it's the same principle for someone who always gives 5 stars. Doesn't mean I don't like them or respect
2016-01-19 20:28:37,@mizgillianberry I was thinking about mentioning that as well. And it's not like I can think of all these bloggers and what authors they are
2016-01-19 19:02:02,@tonyaleeh will someone really be honest if they're THAT close with the author?

2016-01-19 18:19:24,"just think that the author/blogger line has been crossed farther than that with others, and so I just can't trust those reviews."
