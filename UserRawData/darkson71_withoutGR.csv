2011-10-20 19:14:29,"@IMPACTWRESTLING And that's why tyou're never be on par with WWE.  A fantastic main event, ruined by a bullshit finish.  Looked crap = crap."
2011-08-31 16:50:35,"@chrisbevan_bbc Boring - as a Man Utd fan, nothing happening, nor likely to happen. Not sure if that's a bad thing or not! #bbcfootball"
2011-08-31 16:32:17,@howardnurse Honestly expecting any deals?  I thought SAF and above were adamant that their window was over...
2011-08-31 16:27:48,"So, did Wes ever actually board a plane to the UK? #bbcfootball"

2011-08-31 12:01:43,"Am I right in think Hargreaves' doesn't have to sign for anyone today, as he's a free Agent?  #BBCFootball"
2011-06-16 21:09:16,Loving the sounds of @Seasick_Steve - it's now got me listening to blues of last.fm.
2011-03-17 20:24:04,"#r1moremoyles  TUUUNNNNEEEEEEEE!!!!  Good call - c'mon Chris and Dave, you can do it!"

2010-10-13 22:16:30,One week since some silly bitch totalled my car. Time to start looking for a new one. :(
2010-10-09 06:59:54,"Spiky in 2 hours.  Not sure taking 'Zons is a good idea, but what the hell!"
2010-08-31 07:57:04,After an interesting week of emails ref the ARBBL '11 figure... I could use a holiday!
2010-08-20 14:47:36,Out to buy a clothes airer - what an exciting life I lead... [yawn!]
2010-08-19 21:25:16,@BenPatterson1 Jeez...
2010-08-19 21:16:08,@BenPatterson1 Gotta make PK&Q next year.  (This will sound wrong but...) anyone I knew?
2010-08-19 21:06:48,@BenPatterson1 So the idea we had for this year has probably been put on hold until the ARBBL
2010-08-19 21:06:21,"@BenPatterson1  It was going to be, but for a while we were unsure if we were going, then one of the lad's has moved to Germany for a year."
2010-08-19 20:58:01,"Maybe Vamps, maybe DEs, maybe HEs."
2010-08-19 20:57:36,"Yep, though no idea with what team yet!"
2010-08-19 20:53:51,"But Impact's working on a different fig, so all's not lost."
2010-08-19 20:53:33,"Nope, apart from abuse my admin power on TFF. ;)"
2010-08-19 20:48:34,"@BenPatterson1 (minus an optional that hadn't been decided on, but included in email)."
2010-08-19 20:48:29,"@BenPatterson1 but have now released a ""concept"" that is almost exactly what I requested"
2010-08-19 20:48:06,"@BenPatterson1 Impact passed on next year's ARBBL fig, but suggested RJ.  They never replied."
2010-08-19 20:42:22,@BenPatterson1 Just arseholes.  IP/concept thieves - this is just the first time it's directly affected me.
2010-08-19 20:36:24,@BenPatterson1 But still crap?  Aren't you Eurobowling? Or is that after Geordiebowl?
2010-08-19 20:32:59,C'mon Trazponzor (or however you spell it!)
2010-08-19 20:29:13,@BenPatterson1 Not much. You?
