2014-03-31 20:11:10,@neilant actually by definition it is evidence.  You are the one with blind faith.
2014-03-31 18:53:08,@neilant http://t.co/1Raa3H4zeL
2014-03-31 18:44:09,@neilant It's called historical evidence.  Would you like a book or a whole library to read?
2014-03-31 18:28:33,"@neilant you think scholars haven't evaluated the historical evidence for each religion? If so, that's true arrogance."
2014-03-31 18:05:52,@neilant choosing to debate the two most likely options is not unreasonable.  No coherent debates could take place otherwise!

2014-03-31 15:13:08,@neilant most of what you say is frankly logically incoherent. It is not ignorance to couch the debate in atheism v theism.

2014-03-31 14:57:33,@neilant I know you just refused to read a book I offered to purchase for you. In fact you just dismissed it out of hand.
2014-03-31 14:51:31,"@neilant I was an outspoken atheist for 10 years but, unlike you, I actually extensively read both sides with an open mind."
2014-03-31 14:48:20,"@neilant No, atheists state it is unreasonable to believe in a God who doesn't create a paradise but they also want freedom = contradictory."

2014-03-31 14:05:59,"@neilant @ColsonCenter yes, of course, and, again, that was in the very title of the post."
2014-03-31 13:48:25,@neilant @ColsonCenter I am speaking about the criticism of the Christian God that EVERY new atheist has undertaken and it is contradictory.
2014-03-31 13:47:50,"@neilant @ColsonCenter I have addressed their criticism in belief elsewhere.  In this post, I am doing something else."
2014-03-31 13:46:11,@neilant @ColsonCenter You're completely missing the point. I know they don't believe in god (that's in the title of the post).
2014-03-31 13:45:34,"@neilant @ColsonCenter that, of course, is J.L. Mackie's old argument that was refuted by Alvin Plantinga."
