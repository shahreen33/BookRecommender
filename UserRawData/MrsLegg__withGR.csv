2017-02-15 09:41:47,Every little twinge in my body got me like 'this is it! Am I in labour?! The wait is over' and then a bit fat NOTHING
2017-02-15 09:40:13,"Bean, im giving you your eviction notice. If you're not out of the womb by next Tuesday further action will be taken! 🤣"
2017-02-15 09:27:47,@lizzgeorgia you are a bit cray cray! Dunno how you're coping!!

2017-01-31 00:25:27,Why am I still awake when I don't feel well? Because I had about 8483937473 cat naps today and I've not exerted enough energy to need sleep🙃

2017-01-30 23:42:35,Might have to make a quick dash to the kitchen for some toast because I am so bloody hungry!
2017-01-30 23:42:04,Pregnancy is annoying because I eat my dinner and feel like I'm gonna burst then 30 mins later I'm as hungry as a horse again!!!
2017-01-30 13:58:04,Can someone make me a chicken dinner with sweet potato mash please and lots of gravy 👍🏻

2017-01-24 10:00:33,Im at that stage in pregnancy now where there is nothing I can do to make myself comfortable in bed. This bump is rock solid now 🤰🏼
2017-01-21 13:17:16,@PandoraStruggle I only wear it on one wrist but have managed to do it on both. Took some trial and error but can do it quick as a flash now

2017-01-13 22:01:07,@kateltmarler WHAAAAAT?! I even double checked with the midwife because I love them so much and she said I could get food poisoning!
2017-01-13 21:59:38,@kateltmarler no they told me I wasn't allowed any soft serve ice cream whilst pregnant coz of the bacteria in the machines

2017-01-03 09:13:42,@lizzgeorgia are we not supposed to sleep on our right side??

2016-12-01 17:39:12,@_RyanLegg yeah but you didn't have to xx
2016-12-01 17:38:22,"@_RyanLegg you sorted out the bathroom, the bedroom. Organised our new car, replacement tyres. So much! You are the best xxxx"
2016-12-01 14:52:20,Okay maybe that's a bit of an overstatement... I wish I had made plans
2016-12-01 14:51:54,"Also, I always look forward to my days off, then I have them and I'm so bored I wish I was back at work 😂"
2016-12-01 14:51:24,"Need to go into town, but I'm too lazy. Do you see my problem?"
2016-12-01 14:49:49,He completely tidied the bathroom (the bath was full of junk that I didn't know where to put) and he's sorted out our bedroom. True love 💝
2016-12-01 14:49:11,My husband is literally the best one there ever was @_RyanLegg 😘
2016-12-01 14:48:10,"And I say stroke, because it didn't feel like a kick, it felt like a hand stroking my belly. The little cutie!"
2016-12-01 14:47:43,"I got a bit hormonal earlier, and I swear Bean knew because it was like s/he gave me a little stroke as if to be like it's okay Mum 👶🏼😘"
2016-12-01 14:29:05,Boiler still isn't working properly. That shower was like playing Russian roulette 😨
2016-12-01 13:38:43,@kateltmarler evil! Although no idea when we are going to be able to do ours as I'm working all weekend and ryan is on lates today &amp; tomoz 😭

2016-11-29 23:32:07,Why does Bean think it's play time?? 👶🏼🤔
2016-11-29 21:01:27,In need of a serious hair cut. My hair looks like it's been dragged through a bush 😫
2016-11-29 13:55:54,@lizzgeorgia i held his nose but must have squeezed it too hard as he woke up all huffy at me 😂
2016-11-28 23:15:07,Ryan has also started snoring in the last few weeks and it's driving me crazyyyyyy 😵
2016-11-28 23:11:12,Also why am I still wide awake? 😟
2016-11-28 23:03:28,Plus he is radiating the same amount of heat as the sun and it's unbearable 😨
2016-11-28 23:03:03,I need my space!
2016-11-28 23:02:56,Having a king size bed is pretty pointless when your husband chooses to sleep directly next to you...
2016-11-27 21:26:30,Tesco express is open though... but can I be bothered to drive there 🤔
2016-11-27 21:17:03,"I really want some chocolate and the shops are shut, do you see my problem?"
2016-11-27 21:16:37,140 characters is deffo. It enough for a tweet. Give us 10 more characters and I'll be a happier tweeter 😁
2016-11-27 21:16:05,"Why do I find it outrageous that shops close early on a Sunday when it's my day off, yet find it ridiculous that we have to work when I'm in"

2016-11-17 10:23:59,"To clarify, I was not late to my apt. They are just taking their sweet time to see me..."
2016-11-17 10:23:11,Why is it okay for healthcare providers to take 10 years to see you but if you're 2 mins late you get told off??
2016-11-17 09:04:30,"Ha hmm a positive body day today! At least being pregnant means no wobbly belly. Stretched to the max, it looks airbrushed 😅"
2016-11-17 08:59:48,@kateltmarler yes!!! Or generally instead of genuinely... or off instead of 'of' like come on people!!!!
2016-11-16 22:24:22,People who cannot spell simple words really irritate me 😖
2016-11-16 09:46:59,Or maybe I've just got gestational diabetes from the amount of sweets I've been eating 😅
2016-11-16 09:46:14,"Pregnant life means needing a wee every five minutes, even if you've literally just been 😩"

2016-11-01 09:16:25,@lizzgeorgia that's why I refused to pay a tenner for it lol xx
2016-11-01 08:54:19,"@lizzgeorgia I wasn't paying a tenner for a slot, even then it would mean waiting between 12&amp;6 🙄"
2016-11-01 08:50:25,@lizzgeorgia the volume bothers me because ryan is deaf and doesn't hear it and it goes on forever and I have to kick him lol
2016-11-01 08:29:55,Feel like I've got a bowling ball stuffed up my tummy and it's about to burst open. #pregnancyproblems
2016-11-01 08:18:24,@lizzgeorgia give it the sniff test. Is it a best before or use before?

2016-05-25 22:35:50,@meganrhianne yes!!!!!! I've been thinking this for ages! The amount of times I delete and redo a tweet 🙄
2016-05-25 22:35:01,@lizzgeorgia you go get 'em girl! What shift you on tomorrow?
2016-05-25 22:34:27,I know the alphabet and he was spelling the words out to me then showing me the actions. Was amazing to be able to communicate like that!
2016-05-25 22:33:59,A deaf and dumb man has joined our church. So at tonight's meeting he was teaching me sign language. We were able to communicate because...
2016-05-25 22:31:18,On a Twitter binge atm 🙃
2016-05-25 22:30:43,That last tweet was meant to say 'told you there wouldn't be any stupid corrections' do you see what I'm dealing with here?!
2016-05-25 22:30:15,Told you there wouldn't be Amy's typos corrections!
2016-05-25 22:29:53,I'm hunrgy but it's too late to eat and we don't have any snacks for me to nibble on :(
2016-05-25 22:28:56,@lizzgeorgia in that case you crank that heating up full whack! Pamper yourself gurl!
2016-05-25 22:26:12,Sod's law everything will be typed perfectly but we will see...
2016-05-25 22:25:55,I'll try to give you an example with my next tweet. I won't correct a single word so you can see what's been happening.
2016-05-25 22:25:30,How long until my new phone learns what autocorrects it needs to do. So many random words popping up!
2016-05-25 22:24:23,@lizzgeorgia put another layer on 😜
2016-05-25 22:22:32,I have to mute the tv when the intro comes on though because that music just gives me the major creeps
2016-05-25 22:21:39,Ok so I've watched two episodes of American Horror story now. In one sense it creeps me the flap out on the other I want to watch them all 👀
2016-05-25 14:13:45,@emmawakers ah man. How embarrassing! 🙈
2016-05-25 14:11:25,@emmawakers how did you do it?

2016-05-23 21:10:28,About to start watching American Horror Story 💀
2016-05-23 19:58:10,Made me realise what a boring person I am when my answer was eating and watching tv #whoops
2016-05-23 19:57:32,The other day someone asked me what my hobbies were and I just want into panic mode
2016-05-23 19:32:29,So I was thinking I wanna start a scrap book. But then I remembered I don't really take any pictures and when I do I don't print them out 🙃
2016-05-23 07:52:39,Why do I keep having such weird dreams lately?!
2016-05-22 19:40:05,Am I watching the same show as the judges?! All of these acts have been CRAP #BGT
2016-05-22 16:47:19,The mother in laws sharks teeth stash puts  me to shame! Although she has been collecting them… https://t.co/K1cPzVwppy

2016-05-20 20:05:46,"Buried is literally my worst nightmare! That's why I wanna get cremated, just incase I wasn't dead when they put me in the coffin 😳"
2016-05-20 19:51:07,I hate films that do this to me!!!!!!
2016-05-20 19:12:17,@emmawakers I am just about coping. My heart rate just keeps rising!
2016-05-20 18:43:44,I also keep forgetting to breathe 😨
2016-05-20 18:40:46,10 mins in and I can already feel my heartbeat increasing 😬
2016-05-20 18:40:28,@lizzgeorgia where did you learn that?! So cool!
2016-05-20 18:39:45,Watching 'Buried'. Considering I'm claustrophobic not too sure how well this is going to go...
2016-05-19 22:23:40,No cracked screen but still making typos 😑
2016-05-19 21:54:49,@LucyAndLydia i used to do that with my cousin! Find a field and go sit in it and eat the ice cream!
2016-05-19 21:54:18,Although it does give my cramp in my hands when I hold it 😂
2016-05-19 21:54:02,How have I waited this king to upgrade to an iPhone 6? Loving the bigger screen already!
2016-05-18 06:38:45,@emmawakers dammit! Insta stalking it is then 😏

2016-05-17 20:47:23,Tbf after the 12 years of having phones this is the first time I have ever smashed one and that's pretty good going for a clumsy person
2016-05-17 20:46:27,"New phone has been ordered, also a bomb or off case so I never smash a phone again"
2016-05-17 20:34:56,@emmawakers did I miss it?! ☹️
2016-05-17 20:31:15,One of life's hardest decisions is choosing a new case for your new phone 😩
2016-05-17 17:08:51,Because let's face it. I was mistyping without the cracked screen and I can barely see what im typing with this new mess
2016-05-17 17:08:01,Also all my tweets are likely to have typos until I get a new phone...
2016-05-17 17:07:38,Keep forgetting that I ruined my phone screen and having a melt down when I see it 😩
2016-05-17 15:27:05,Ah ma gaaaad! 😳 https://t.co/7YYEPIEQ0i
2016-05-16 12:58:22,I have just smashed my first ever iPhone. Considering how clumsy I am in surprised this didn't happen sooner...
