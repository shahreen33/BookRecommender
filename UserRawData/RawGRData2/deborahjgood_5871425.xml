  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Princess Diarist&lt;/i&gt; is Carrie Fisher’s intimate, hilarious and revealing recollection of what happened behind the scenes on one of the most famous film sets of all time, the first &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Carrie Fisher recently discovered the journals she kept during the filming of the first &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; movie, she was astonished to see what they had preserved—plaintive love poems, unbridled musings with youthful naiveté, and a vulnerability that she barely recognized. Today, her fame as an author, actress, and pop-culture icon is indisputable, but in 1977, Carrie Fisher was just a (sort-of) regular teenager. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these excerpts from her handwritten notebooks, &lt;i&gt;The Princess Diarist&lt;/i&gt; is Fisher’s intimate and revealing recollection of what happened on one of the most famous film sets of all time—and what developed behind the scenes. And today, as she reprises her most iconic role for the latest Star Wars trilogy, Fisher also ponders the joys and insanity of celebrity, and the absurdity of a life spawned by Hollywood royalty, only to be surpassed by her own outer-space royalty. Laugh-out-loud hilarious and endlessly quotable, &lt;i&gt;The Princess Diarist&lt;/i&gt; brims with the candor and introspection of a diary while offering shrewd insight into the type of stardom that few will ever experience.</description>

      <![CDATA[Makes me want to re-watch all of the Star Wars movies. This is real folks--the real Carrie telling us in her own voice (and that of her daughter's--reading the diaries) about her affair with Harrison, her struggles with drugs and alcohol and money, and her take on Comic-con shows. I truly enjoyed...]]>

  <description>Margaret Atwood puts the human heart to the ultimate test in an utterly brilliant new novel that is as visionary as The Handmaid's Tale and as richly imagined as The Blind Assassin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stan and Charmaine are a married couple trying to stay afloat in the midst of an economic and social collapse. Job loss has forced them to live in their car, leaving them vulnerable to roving gangs. They desperately need to turn their situation around - and fast. The Positron Project in the town of Consilience seems to be the answer to their prayers. No one is unemployed and everyone gets a comfortable, clean house to live in... for six months out of the year. On alternating months, residents of Consilience must leave their homes and function as inmates in the Positron prison system. Once their month of service in the prison is completed, they can return to their "civilian" homes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, this doesn't seem like too much of a sacrifice to make in order to have a roof over one's head and food to eat. But when Charmaine becomes romantically involved with the man who lives in their house during the months when she and Stan are in the prison, a series of troubling events unfolds, putting Stan's life in danger. With each passing day, Positron looks less like a prayer answered and more like a chilling prophecy fulfilled.</description>

  <description>The #1 New York Times Bestseller. Set amid the civil rights movement, the never-before-told true story of NASA’s African-American female mathematicians who played a crucial role in America’s space program. Before Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, a group of professionals worked as ‘Human Computers’, calculating the flight paths that would enable these historic achievements. Among these were a coterie of bright, talented African-American women. Segregated from their white counterparts, these ‘coloured computers’ used pencil and paper to write the equations that would launch rockets and astronauts, into space. Moving from World War II through NASA’s golden age, touching on the civil rights era, the Space Race, the Cold War and the women’s rights movement, ‘Hidden Figures’ interweaves a rich history of mankind’s greatest adventure with the intimate stories of five courageous women whose work forever changed the world.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;“Dear Tommie: Have you ever wondered about who you are?”&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The letter that turns Tommie McCloud’s world upside down arrives from a stranger only days after her father’s death. The woman who wrote it claims that Tommie is her daughter—and that she was kidnapped as a baby thirty-one years ago.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tommie wants to believe it’s all a hoax, but suddenly a girl who grew up on a Texas ranch finds herself linked to a horrific past: the slaughter of a family in Chicago, the murder of an Oklahoma beauty queen, and the kidnapping of a little girl named Adriana. Tommie races along a twisting, nightmarish path while an unseen stalker is determined to keep old secrets locked inside the dementia-battered brain of the woman who Tommie always thought was her real mother. With everything she has ever believed in question, and no one she can trust, Tommie must discover the truth about the girl who vanished—and the very real threats that still remain.</description>

  <description>From award-winning novelist Wendy Webb comes a spine-tingling mystery about family secrets set in a big, old haunted house on Lake Superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace Alban has spent twenty years away from her childhood home, the stately Alban House, for reasons she would rather forget. But when her mother's unexpected death brings Grace and her teen-age daughter home, she finds more haunting the halls and passageways of Alban House than her own personal demons. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long-buried family secrets, a packet of old love letters and a lost manuscript plunge Grace into a decades-old mystery about a scandalous party at Alban House, when a world-famous author took his own life and Grace's aunt disappeared without a trace. The night has been shrouded in secrecy by the powerful Alban family for all of these years, and Grace realizes her family secrets tangle and twist as darkly as the secret passages of Alban House. Her mother was intending to tell the truth about that night to a reporter on the very day she died - could it have been murder? Or was she a victim of the supposed Alban curse? With the help of the disarmingly kind--and attractive—Reverend Matthew Parker, Grace must uncover the truth about her home and its curse before she and her daughter become the next victims.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the  &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of  &lt;i&gt;Midwives&lt;/i&gt; and  &lt;i&gt;The Sandcastle Girls &lt;/i&gt; comes the spellbinding tale of a party gone horribly wrong: two men lie dead in a suburban living room; two women are on the run from police; and a marriage is ripping apart at the seams.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   When Richard Chapman offers to host his younger brother's bachelor party, he expects a certain amount of debauchery. He sends his wife, Kristin, and young daughter off to his mother-in-law's for the weekend, and he opens his Westchester home to his brother's friends and their hired entertainment. What he does not expect is this: bacchanalian drunkenness, a dangerously intimate moment in his guest bedroom, and two naked women stabbing and killing their Russian bodyguards before driving off into the night. In the aftermath, Richard's life rapidly spirals into a nightmare. The police throw him out of his home, now a crime scene; his investment banking firm puts him on indefinite leave; and his wife finds herself unable to forgive him for the moment he shared with a dark-haired girl in the guest room. But the dark-haired girl, Alexandra, faces a much graver danger. In one breathless, violent night, she is free, running to escape the police who will arrest her and the gangsters who will kill her in a heartbeat. A captivating, chilling story about shame and scandal, &lt;i&gt;The Guest Room&lt;/i&gt; is a riveting novel from one of our greatest storytellers.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;You don't have to live overwhelmed by stuff--you can get rid of clutter for good!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the world seems to be in love with the idea of tiny houses and minimalism, many of us simply can't purge it all and start from nothing. Yet a home with too much stuff is a home that is difficult to maintain, so where do we begin? Add in paralyzing emotional attachments and constant life challenges, and it can feel almost impossible to make real decluttering progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Decluttering at the Speed of Life&lt;/em&gt;, decluttering expert and author Dana White identifies the mind-sets and emotional challenges that make it difficult to declutter. Then, in her signature humorous approach, she provides workable solutions to break through these struggles and get clutter out--for good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But more than simply offering strategies, Dana dives deep into how to implement them, no matter the reader's clutter level or emotional resistance to decluttering. She helps identify procrasticlutter--the stuff that will get done eventually so it doesn't seem urgent--as well as how to make progress when there's no time to declutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sections of the book include&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why You Need This Book (You Know Why)&lt;br /&gt;Your Unique Home&lt;br /&gt;Decluttering in the Midst of Real Life&lt;br /&gt;Change Your Mind, Change Your Home&lt;br /&gt;Breaking Through Your Decluttering Delusions&lt;br /&gt;Working It Out Room by Room&lt;br /&gt;Helping Others Declutter&lt;br /&gt;Real Life Goes On (and On)&lt;br /&gt;As long as we're living and breathing, new clutter will appear. The good news is that decluttering can get easier, become more natural, and require significantly fewer hours, less emotional bandwidth, and little to no sweat to keep going.</description>

  <description>Although Scott Carey doesn’t look any different, he’s been steadily losing weight. There are a couple of other odd things, too. He weighs the same in his clothes and out of them, no matter how heavy they are. Scott doesn’t want to be poked and prodded. He mostly just wants someone else to know, and he trusts Doctor Bob Ellis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the small town of Castle Rock, the setting of many of King’s most iconic stories, Scott is engaged in a low grade—but escalating—battle with the lesbians next door whose dog regularly drops his business on Scott’s lawn. One of the women is friendly; the other, cold as ice. Both are trying to launch a new restaurant, but the people of Castle Rock want no part of a gay married couple, and the place is in trouble. When Scott finally understands the prejudices they face–including his own—he tries to help. Unlikely alliances, the annual foot race, and the mystery of Scott’s affliction bring out the best in people who have indulged the worst in themselves and others.</description>

  <description>When the police started asking questions, Jean Taylor turned into a different woman. One who enabled her and her husband to carry on, when more bad things began to happen...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that woman’s husband died last week. And Jean doesn’t have to be her anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s a lot Jean hasn’t said over the years about the crime her husband was suspected of committing. She was too busy being the perfect wife, standing by her man while living with the accusing glares and the anonymous harassment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there’s no reason to stay quiet. There are people who want to hear her story. They want to know what it was like living with that man. She can tell them that there were secrets. There always are in a marriage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth—that’s all anyone wants. But the one lesson Jean has learned in the last few years is that she can make people believe anything…</description>

  <description>When you read this book, you will make many assumptions.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume you are reading about a jealous ex-wife.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume she is obsessed with her replacement – a beautiful, younger woman who is about to marry the man they both love. &lt;br /&gt;You will assume you know the anatomy of this tangled love triangle.&lt;br /&gt;Assume nothing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twisted and deliciously chilling, Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen's &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; exposes the secret complexities of an enviable marriage - and the dangerous truths we ignore in the name of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read between the lies. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I thought this was a "summer read"--a love story sort of book, but it is so much more. The book twists and turns even on the very last page (or at least the epilogue). Highly recommended! I look forward to reading other novels by these authors.]]>

      <![CDATA[What an interesting book. Part foodie book, part thriller/mystery book. I listened to the audiobook, but it would be interesting to see the recipes in print. From the epilogue, I guess this is based loosely on a real story, but not necessarily of the author's involvement in such. I'm waiting to s...]]>

  <description>The remoter parts of the English Fens are forlorn, lost and damp even in the height of summer. At Iyot Lock, a large decaying house, two young cousins, Leonora and Edward are parked for the summer with their ageing spinster aunt and her cruel housekeeper. At first the unpleasantness and petty meannesses appear simply spiteful, calculated to destroy Edward's equanimity. But when spoilt Leonora is not given the birthday present of a specific dolly that she wants, affairs inexorably take a much darker turn with terrifying, life destroying, consequences for everyone.</description>

  <description>Mick Garris, J. Kenner, Kealan Patrick Burke, Del James, and Bentley Little pry open a sarcophagus of horror and dread in &lt;i&gt;Dark Screams: Volume Five, &lt;/i&gt;from Brian James Freeman and Richard Chizmar of the esteemed Cemetery Dance Publications.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;EVERYTHING YOU’VE ALWAYS WANTED by Mick Garris&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It was supposed to be the night of his life: a celebration of his one hit slasher flick. But the price of admission is higher than this has-been filmmaker ever could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;THE ONE AND ONLY by J. Kenner&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When he was seven, Will Underwood’s nanny told him she had the Sight. Years later, a broken heart sends him to New Orleans . . . but it’s fate that leads him to Madame Darkling’s Voodoo Emporium.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;THE LAND OF SUNSHINE by Kealan Patrick Burke&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Although she was mute long before the affair that nearly wrecked their marriage, her silence has tortured her husband ever since. Now he will seek out what he has lost—or be driven mad by remorse.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;MECHANICAL GRATITUDE by Del James&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Arnold loves his ’68 Camaro almost as much as he loves his wife, and he’s willing to do anything to protect them both—especially after hearing strange noises coming from his garage.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;THE PLAYHOUSE by Bentley Little&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A real-estate agent is drawn into a children’s playhouse behind an abandoned property she’s trying to sell—and finds herself strangely reluctant to leave.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;My name is Amber Reynolds. There are three things you should know about me:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;1. I’m in a coma.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;2. My husband doesn’t love me anymore.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;3. Sometimes I lie.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amber wakes up in a hospital. She can’t move. She can’t speak. She can’t open her eyes. She can hear everyone around her, but they have no idea. Amber doesn’t remember what happened, but she has a suspicion her husband had something to do with it. Alternating between her paralyzed present, the week before her accident, and a series of childhood diaries from twenty years ago, this brilliant psychological thriller asks: Is something really a lie if you believe it's the truth?</description>

  &lt;i&gt;If only she'd said no...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Katherine&lt;/b&gt; knew she’d had too many drinks, but they were only going a short distance. And as &lt;b&gt;Eve&lt;/b&gt; pointed out, it was late, there was no traffic anyway... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Katherine would do anything to turn back the clock. &lt;b&gt;If anyone ever found out about the accident, it would ruin Katherine’s life&lt;/b&gt;. But no one needs to know because Eve was there too, and she’s going to help make it all go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except &lt;b&gt;something's not quite right with Eve&lt;/b&gt;, and by the time Katherine realizes that…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's too late.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;She thought they had the perfect marriage... &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tamra&lt;/b&gt; never dreamed she would marry someone like &lt;b&gt;Mike Mitchell&lt;/b&gt;: handsome, rich, a wonderful husband... until she finds out that Mike is having an affair.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, and Mike Mitchell should have remembered that before he made a fool of her. &lt;br /&gt;Because &lt;b&gt;Tamra knows something about Mike. Something he did. Something evil.&lt;/b&gt; And she was prepared to carry the secret to her grave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not anymore. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, Mike’s daughter Madison has come to visit for a few days, and Madison doesn’t like Tamra. Well, that's too bad, because Tamra doesn’t have time to argue. She’s too busy ruining Mike’s life while remaining, on the surface at least, the perfect, loyal wife.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when Tamra's plan spirals out of control, she finds that things are not what they seem. &lt;br /&gt;And now, it's too late.</description>

  <description>"&lt;b&gt;Great plot and characters.&lt;/b&gt; I really enjoyed this author's writing style and will be reading more of her work. &lt;b&gt;I highly recommend this book.&lt;/b&gt;" &lt;i&gt;Netgalley reviewer&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"&lt;b&gt;A must read for everyone who loves psychological suspense!!!!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Goodreads reviewer&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everyone has secrets, and Rachel Holloway is no exception.&lt;/b&gt; She’s worked hard to keep the past where it belongs: dead and buried. And so far, she’s been very successful. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But now the small newspaper where she works wants to produce a podcast on a cold case: &lt;b&gt;the disappearance twelve years ago of little Molly Forster.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Some secrets should never see the light of day, and as far as Rachel is concerned, whatever happened to little Molly is one of them. Rachel has a life now, a boyfriend she loves and a three-year-old daughter she adores, and she will do anything to protect them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But to do that, &lt;b&gt;no one can ever know that she &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; Molly Forster.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Cassidy Blake's parents are The Inspecters, a (somewhat inept) ghost-hunting team. But Cass herself can REALLY see ghosts. In fact, her best friend, Jacob, just happens to be one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When The Inspecters head to ultra-haunted Edinburgh, Scotland, for their new TV show, Cass—and Jacob—come along. In Scotland, Cass is surrounded by ghosts, not all of them friendly. Then she meets Lara, a girl who can also see the dead. But Lara tells Cassidy that as an In-betweener, their job is to send ghosts permanently beyond the Veil. Cass isn't sure about her new mission, but she does know the sinister Red Raven haunting the city doesn't belong in her world. Cassidy's powers will draw her into an epic fight that stretches through the worlds of the living and the dead, in order to save herself.</description>

  <description>James T. Costa takes readers on a journey from Darwin’s childhood through his voyage on the HMS &lt;em&gt;Beagle&lt;/em&gt;, where his ideas on evolution began, and on to Down House, his bustling home of forty years. Using his garden and greenhouse, the surrounding meadows and woodlands, and even the cellar and hallways of his home-turned-field-station, Darwin tested ideas of his landmark theory of evolution through an astonishing array of experiments without using specialized equipment. From those results, he plumbed the laws of nature and drew evidence for the revolutionary arguments of &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; and other watershed works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unique perspective introduces us to an enthusiastic correspondent, collaborator, and, especially, an incorrigible observer and experimenter. And it includes eighteen experiments for home, school, or garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finalist for the 2018 AAAS/Subaru SB Prizes for Excellence in Science Books.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a powerhouse of a book. Experiments at the end that you just want to go out into your backyard and do (but I was reading it in winter), and interesting facts about Darwin's life and strategies for his "experimentizing". It's long--but well worth getting to the end.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; National Book Award finalist Sy Montgomery reflects on the personalities and quirks of 13 animals--her friends--who have profoundly affected her in this stunning, poetic, and life-affirming memoir featuring illustrations by Rebecca Green.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Understanding someone who belongs to another species can be transformative. No one knows this better than author, naturalist, and adventurer Sy Montgomery. To research her books, Sy has traveled the world and encountered some of the planet's rarest and most beautiful animals. From tarantulas to tigers, Sy's life continually intersects with and is informed by the creatures she meets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This restorative memoir reflects on the personalities and quirks of thirteen animals--Sy's friends--and the truths revealed by their grace. It also explores vast themes: the otherness and sameness of people and animals; the various ways we learn to love and become empathetic; how we find our passion; how we create our families; coping with loss and despair; gratitude; forgiveness; and most of all, how to be a good creature in the world.</description>

Recruit three heroes, ordinary humans capable of extraordinary things, and change the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safa Patel is an elite police officer, on duty when Downing Street comes under terrorist attack.

  <description>After the end of her marriage, Kate Granger has retreated to her parents’ home on Lake Superior to pull herself together—only to discover the body of a murdered woman washed into the shallows. Tucked in the folds of the woman’s curiously vintage gown is an infant, as cold and at peace as its mother. No one can identify the woman. Except for Kate. She’s seen her before. In her dreams…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hundred years ago, a love story ended in tragedy, its mysteries left unsolved. It’s time for the lake to give up its secrets. As each mystery unravels, it pulls Kate deeper into the eddy of a haunting folktale that has been handed down in whispers over generations. Now, it’s Kate’s turn to listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the drowned woman reaches out from the grave, Kate reaches back. They must come together, if only in dreams, to right the sinister wrongs of the past.</description>

  <description>David Sedaris's beloved holiday collection is new again with six more pieces, including a never before published story. Along with such favorites&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;as the diaries of a Macy's elf and the annals of two very competitive families, are Sedaris's tales of tardy trick-or-treaters ("Us and Them"); the difficulties of explaining the Easter Bunny to the French ("Jesus Shaves"); what to do when you've been locked out in a snowstorm ("Let It Snow"); the puzzling Christmas traditions of other nations ("Six to Eight Black Men"); what Halloween at the medical examiner's looks like ("The Monster Mash"); and a barnyard secret Santa scheme gone awry ("Cow and Turkey").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what your favorite holiday, you won't want to miss celebrating it with the author who has been called "one of the funniest writers alive" (&lt;i&gt;Economist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;).&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Michael Crichton's recently discovered novel—an adventure set in the Wild West during the golden age of fossil hunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 1876. Warring Indian tribes still populate America's western territories, even as lawless gold-rush towns begin to mark the landscape, and two paleontologists pillage the Wild West, hunting for dinosaur fossils while surveilling, deceiving, and sabotaging each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Into this treacherous territory plunges William Johnson, a student who has joined world-renowned paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh on his latest expedition. But when Marsh becomes convinced that William is spying for his nemesis, Edwin Drinker Cope, he abandons him in Cheyenne, Wyoming, a locus of crime and vice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William joins forces with Cope and soon stumbles upon a discovery of historic proportions. With this extraordinary treasure, however, comes exceptional danger, and Johnson's newfound resilience will be sorely tested..</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Bram Stoker Award nominee Ronald Malfi comes a brilliantly chilling novel of childhood revisited, memories resurrected, and fears reborn…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Laurie was a little girl, she was forbidden to enter the room at the top of the stairs. It was one of many rules imposed by her cold, distant father. Now, in a final act of desperation, her father has exorcised his demons. But when Laurie returns to claim the estate with her husband and ten-year-old daughter, it’s as if the past refuses to die. She feels it lurking in the broken moldings, sees it staring from an empty picture frame, hears it laughing in the moldy greenhouse deep in the woods…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, Laurie thinks she’s imagining things. But when she meets her daughter’s new playmate, Abigail, she can’t help but notice her uncanny resemblance to another little girl who used to live next door. Who &lt;i&gt;died&lt;/i&gt; next door. With each passing day, Laurie’s uneasiness grows stronger, her thoughts more disturbing. Like her father, is she slowly losing her mind? Or is something truly unspeakable happening to those sweet little girls?&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>A Best Book of the Year (&lt;i&gt;Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This "sinister thriller" (&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;) from bestselling author Lisa Unger, "one of the brightest stars in the game," (Dennis Lehane) is "mesmerizing and unnerving from its first pages to its stunner of an ending." (Megan Abbott, author of The Fever)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darkness has a way of creeping up when Ian is with Priss. Even when they were kids, playing in the woods of their small Upstate New York town, he could feel it. Still, Priss was his best friend, his salvation from the bullies who called him “loser” and “fatboy”…and from his family’s deadly secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that they’ve both escaped to New York City, Ian no longer inhabits the tortured shell of his childhood. He is a talented and successful graphic novelist, and Priss…Priss is still trouble. The booze, the drugs, the sex—Ian is growing tired of late nights together trying to keep the past at bay. Especially now that he’s met sweet, beautiful Megan, whose love makes him want to change for the better. But Priss doesn’t like change. Change makes her angry. And when Priss is angry, terrible things begin to happen…</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lisa Unger comes the second of three short stories about a psychic medium and the strange secrets she begins to uncover--for better or for worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years after Eloise Montgomery discovers her psychic abilities, she is a full-fledged working psychic, with a partner and a business. Now, in &lt;i&gt;The Burning Girl&lt;/i&gt;, she's discovering some disturbing things: secrets about her genealogy that are, perhaps, best left in the past; that her granddaughter Finley has powers of her own; and that not all of Eloise's visitors actually &lt;i&gt;want &lt;/i&gt;to be helped. Some of them are just looking for trouble...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing with the same taut prose that earned her critical acclaim for her explosive thriller &lt;i&gt;Beautiful Lies&lt;/i&gt;, Lisa Unger delivers a spellbinding story that will leave you wanting more.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Three Sisters &lt;/i&gt;is the third and final short story in a gripping tale from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lisa Unger, "an accomplished pro" (&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Eloise's granddaughter, twenty-year-old Finley, comes to live with her, Eloise's abilities start to change--things seem to be getting easier. Her load is lighter, and rather than chasing down people she needs, they are coming to her. She teams up with detective Jones Cooper to help a desperate father bring his daughter's killer to justice. Meanwhile, Finley, who is developing gifts of her own, has bigger problems than she's willing to admit. Will Eloise help Finley and others see the difference between justice and revenge, or will things spiral out of control first?</description>

  <description>THEN&lt;br /&gt;She was fifteen, her mother's golden girl. She had her whole life ahead of her. And then, in the blink of an eye, Ellie was gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW &lt;br /&gt;It’s been ten years since Ellie disappeared, but Laurel has never given up hope of finding her daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then one day a charming and charismatic stranger called Floyd walks into a café and sweeps Laurel off her feet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before too long she’s staying the night at this house and being introduced to his nine year old daughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy is precocious and pretty - and meeting her completely takes Laurel's breath away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Poppy is the spitting image of Ellie when she was that age. And now all those unanswered questions that have haunted Laurel come flooding back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened to Ellie? Where did she go? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who still has secrets to hide?</description>

  <description>Town doctor, Jude Southerland asked Autumn Maddox to marry him and she said yes. The dress has been bought, the church reserved, and the band booked. Happily ever after here they come. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when the couple gets an unexpected surprise, plans have to change, leaving the whole town wondering if they will make it to the altar on time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Feels Like Family is Book 2.5 in the Southerland series and while it is a fun story on its own, readers may enjoy it more if it is read after Loving Bailey and before Practical Arrangement.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Twenty-six years ago Hannah had her eye shot out. Now she wants justice. But is she blind to the truth?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christopher J. Yates’s cult hit &lt;i&gt;Black Chalk&lt;/i&gt; introduced that rare writerly talent: a literary writer who could write a plot with the intricacy of a brilliant mental puzzle, and with characters so absorbing that readers are immediately gripped. Yates’s new book does not disappoint. &lt;i&gt;Grist Mill Road&lt;/i&gt; is a dark, twisted, and expertly plotted Rashomon-style tale. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 1982; the setting, an Edenic hamlet some ninety miles north of New York City. There, among the craggy rock cliffs and glacial ponds of timeworn mountains, three friends—Patrick, Matthew, and Hannah—are bound together by a terrible and seemingly senseless crime. Twenty-six years later, in New York City, living lives their younger selves never could have predicted, the three meet again—with even more devastating results.</description>

  <description>It was only ever meant to be a game played by six best friends in their first year at Oxford University; a game of consequences, silly forfeits, and childish dares. But then the game changed: The stakes grew higher and the dares more personal and more humiliating, finally evolving into a vicious struggle with unpredictable and tragic results. Now, fourteen years later, the remaining players must meet again for the final round. Who knows better than your best friends what would break you?</description>

  <description>Knowledge is a big subject, says Stuart Firestein, but ignorance is a bigger one. And it is ignorance--not knowledge--that is the true engine of science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of us have a false impression of science as a surefire, deliberate, step-by-step method for finding things out and getting things done. In fact, says Firestein, more often than not, science is like looking for a black cat in a dark room, and there may not be a cat in the room. The process is more hit-or-miss than you might imagine, with much stumbling and groping after phantoms. But it is exactly this "not knowing," this puzzling over thorny questions or inexplicable data, that gets researchers into the lab early and keeps them there late, the thing that propels them, the very driving force of science. Firestein shows how scientists use ignorance to program their work, to identify what should be done, what the next steps are, and where they should concentrate their energies. And he includes a catalog of how scientists use ignorance, consciously or unconsciously--a remarkable range of approaches that includes looking for connections to other research, revisiting apparently settled questions, using small questions to get at big ones, and tackling a problem simply out of curiosity. The book concludes with four case histories--in cognitive psychology, theoretical physics, astronomy, and neuroscience--that provide a feel for the nuts and bolts of ignorance, the day-to-day battle that goes on in scientific laboratories and in scientific minds with questions that range from the quotidian to the profound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turning the conventional idea about science on its head, &lt;em&gt;Ignorance&lt;/em&gt; opens a new window on the true nature of research. It is a must-read for anyone curious about science.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>She’s your best friend.&lt;br /&gt;She knows all your secrets.&lt;br /&gt;That’s why she’s so dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;A single mother's life is turned upside down when her best friend vanishes in this chilling debut thriller in the vein of &lt;i&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Girl on the Train&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts with a simple favor—an ordinary kindness mothers do for one another. When her best friend, Emily, asks Stephanie to pick up her son Nicky after school, she happily says yes. Nicky and her son, Miles, are classmates and best friends, and the five-year-olds love being together—just like she and Emily. A widow and stay-at-home mommy blogger living in woodsy suburban Connecticut, Stephanie was lonely until she met Emily, a sophisticated PR executive whose job in Manhattan demands so much of her time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Emily doesn’t come back. She doesn’t answer calls or return texts. Stephanie knows something is terribly wrong—Emily would never leave Nicky, no matter what the police say. Terrified, she reaches out to her blog readers for help. She also reaches out to Emily’s husband, the handsome, reticent Sean, offering emotional support. It’s the least she can do for her best friend. Then, she and Sean receive shocking news. Emily is dead. The nightmare of her disappearance is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or is it? Because soon, Stephanie will begin to see that nothing—not friendship, love, or even an ordinary favor—is as simple as it seems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Simple Favor&lt;/i&gt; is a remarkable tale of psychological suspense—a clever and twisting free-fall of a ride filled with betrayals and reversals, twists and turns, secrets and revelations, love and loyalty, murder and revenge. Darcey Bell masterfully ratchets up the tension in a taut, unsettling, and completely absorbing story that holds you in its grip until the final page.</description>

  <description>CONTENT WARNING: If you are a reader of Summer Prescott’s Cozy Mysteries, please be advised that this book depicts the actions and mindset of a serial killer, contains some adult language and adult circumstances. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tim and Susannah have ordinary lives on the surface, he’s a mortician for whom death is a serious business, and she’s a chef who really knows her way around a knife, and if the neighbors in their small Midwestern town knew of her dark hobby, they’d run for the hills. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Raised by an apathetic mother and a cruel father, Susannah was bullied and pushed to her breaking point long before she met mild-mannered Tim, and learned to channel her murderous impulses into a strange form of art, which keeps her clueless husband safe…for now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As strange events occur, and Susannah’s eccentric behavior becomes more dynamic, Tim starts to wonder about his wife. Will he be too perceptive for his own good? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This twisted, psychological, serial killer thriller will sear your psyche and rattle your soul. Buckle up, you’re in for a terrifying ride.</description>

  <description>Ghost Stories of an Antiquary By M. R. James Eight classics by great Edwardian scholar and storyteller. "Number Thirteen," "The Mezzotint," "Canon Alberic's Scrapbook," more. Renowned for their wit, erudition and suspense, these stories are each masterfully constructed and represent a high achievement in the ghost genre. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works. To ensure a high quality product, each title has been meticulously hand curated by our staff. Our philosophy has been guided by a desire to provide the reader with a book that is as close as possible to ownership of the original work. We hope that you will enjoy this wonderful classic work, and that for you it becomes an enriching experience.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Introducing IKIGAI: find your passions and live with joy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ikigai is a Japanese phenomenon commonly understood as “your reason to get up in the morning.” Ikigai can be small moments: the morning air, a cup of coffee, a compliment. It can also be deep convictions: a fulfilling job, lasting friendships, balanced health. Whether big or small, your ikigai is the path to success and happiness in your own life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author Ken Mogi introduces five pillars of ikigai to help you make the most of each day and become your most authentic self:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. &lt;b&gt;starting small&lt;/b&gt; &amp;gt; focus on the details&lt;br /&gt;2. &lt;b&gt;releasing yourself&lt;/b&gt; &amp;gt; accept who you are&lt;br /&gt;3. &lt;b&gt;harmony and sustainability&lt;/b&gt; &amp;gt; rely on others&lt;br /&gt;4. &lt;b&gt;the joy of little things&lt;/b&gt; &amp;gt; appreciate sensory pleasure&lt;br /&gt;5. &lt;b&gt;being in the here and now&lt;/b&gt; &amp;gt; find your flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaving together insights from Japanese history, philosophy, and modern culture, plus stories from renowned sushi chef Jiro Ono, anime filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, and others, Mogi skillfully shows the way to awaken your ikigai.</description>

  <description>Reeling from a painful break-up, English instructor and avid book lover Wesley Smith is haunted by his ex-girlfriend's parting shot: "Why can't you just read off the computer like everyone else?" He buys an e-book reader out of spite, but soon finds he can use the device to glimpse realities he had never before imagined, discovering literary riches beyond his wildest dreams...and all-too-human tragedies that surpass his most terrible nightmares.</description>

  <description>First published in 1959, Shirley Jackson's &lt;i&gt;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/i&gt; has been hailed as a perfect work of unnerving terror. It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of a "haunting"; Theodora, the lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powers—and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This eerie ghost story, from Richard Matheson, the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Hell House&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;I Am Legend&lt;/i&gt;, inspired the acclaimed 1999 film starring Kevin Bacon. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Wallace lived an ordinary life, until a chance event awakened psychic abilities he never knew he possessed. Now he's hearing the private thoughts of the people around him-and learning shocking secrets he never wanted to know. But as Tom's existence becomes a waking nightmare, even greater jolts are in store as he becomes the unwilling recipient of a compelling message from beyond the grave!</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;What Dreams May Come&lt;/i&gt; is a winner of the AudioFile Earphones Award, one of AudioFile’s Best Fantasy Audiobooks of 2009, and a New York Times best-selling novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens to us after we die? Chris Nielsen had no idea, until an unexpected accident cut his life short, separating him from his beloved wife, Annie. Now Chris must discover the true nature of life after death. But even Heaven is not complete without Annie, and the divided soul mates will do anything to reach each other across the boundaries between life and death. When tragedy threatens to divide them forever, Chris risks his very soul to save Annie from an eternity of despair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on a wealth of research into the subject of life after death, this powerful story of the boundaries of existence and the love that transcends them was the basis for the Oscar-winning film starring Robin Williams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copyright 2009, Blackstone Audio</description>

      <![CDATA[Wow, wow, wow...I did not realize what this book was about when I started listening to it. I simply picked another Richard Matheson book because I was "reading down his list". This is probably one of the most unusual stories I have read in a long time. It's based in fact or at least research done...]]>

  <description>Robert Neville is the last living man on Earth... but he is not alone. Every other man, woman and child on the planet has succumbed to the vampire plague, and they are hungry for Neville's blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By day he is the hunter, stalking the undead through the ruins of civilisation.

  <description>"A fast-moving, eerie...tale set on Halloween night. Eight costumed boys running to meet their friend Pipkin at the haunted house outside town encounter instead the huge and cadaverous Mr. Moundshroud. As Pipkin scrambles to join them, he is swept away by a dark Something, and Moundshroud leads the boys on the tail of a kite through time and space to search the past for their friend and the meaning of Halloween. After witnessing a funeral procession in ancient Egypt, cavemen discovering fire, Druid rites, the persecution of witches in the Dark Ages, and the gargoyles of Notre Dame, they catch up with the elusive Pipkin in the catacombs of Mexico, where each boy gives one year from the end of his life to save Pipkin's. Enhanced by appropriately haunting black-and-white drawings."--Booklist</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Runaway Species: How human creativity remakes the world&lt;/i&gt; is a deep-dive into the creative mind, a celebration of the human spirit, and a vision of how humanity can improve our future by understanding and embracing our ability to innovate. Anthony Brandt and David Eagleman rifle through the inventions of human society like paleontologists ransacking the fossil record. Exploring examples from Apollo 13 to Pablo Picasso, they seek to answer the question: what lies at the heart of humanity's ability--and drive--to create? If you took a snapshot of any animal species' behavior, from apes to barnacles, and contrasted it with the same species 10,000 years ago, they'd all be carrying on pretty much as usual (and if they aren't, it's likely due to human influence). Humanity, on the other hand, would be nearly unrecognizable. Above all else, our drive to create is what makes us unique among all living things. Yet where does this all creation, innovation, and change come from? Why us? And if we better understand this -cognitive software-, can we harness it more responsibly to improve our lives, schools, businesses and institutions? Brandt and Eagleman examine hundreds of examples of human creativity through dramatic storytelling and stunning images in this beautiful, full-color volume. By drawing out what creative acts have in common and viewing them through the lens of cutting-edge neuroscience, they uncover the essential elements of this critical human ability, and encourage a more creative future for all of us.</description>

  <description>These presentations explain the basis of conflicts in some of the world's most politically sensitive areas. Many of these regions are in today's headlines, and tensions recently have become violent in virtually all of them. But these presentations are not about today's headlines. Rather, they explain the centuries of developments and conflicts that reveal how and why today's problems occur.</description>

  <description>A Gen-X librarian's snarky, laugh-out-loud funny, deeply moving collection of love letters and break-up notes to the books in her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Librarians spend their lives weeding--not weeds but books! Books that have reached the end of their shelf life, both literally and figuratively. They remove the books that patrons no longer check out. And they put back the books they treasure. Annie Spence, who has a decade of experience as a Midwestern librarian, does this not only at her Michigan library but also at home, for her neighbors, at cocktail parties—everywhere. In &lt;i&gt;Dear Fahrenheit 451&lt;/i&gt;, she addresses those books directly. We read her love letters to &lt;i&gt;The Goldfinch&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Matilda&lt;/i&gt;, as well as her snarky break-ups with &lt;i&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dear John&lt;/i&gt;. Her notes to &lt;i&gt;The Virgin Suicides&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Time Traveler’s Wife&lt;/i&gt; feel like classics, sure to strike a powerful chord with readers. Through the lens of the books in her life, Annie comments on everything from women’s psychology to gay culture to health to poverty to childhood aspirations. Hilarious, compassionate, and wise, &lt;i&gt;Dear Fahrenheit 451&lt;/i&gt; is the consummate book-lover's birthday present, stocking stuffer, holiday gift, and all-purpose humor book.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;Raymond Chandler meets Jonathan Lethem in this wickedly entertaining debut featuring Mark Genevich, Narcoleptic Detective&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mark Genevich is a South Boston P.I. with a little problem: he's narcoleptic, and he suffers from the most severe symptoms, including hypnogogic hallucinations. These waking dreams wreak havoc for a guy who depends on real-life clues to make his living.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clients haven't exactly been beating down the door when Mark meets Jennifer Times - daughter of the powerful local D.A. and a contestant on American Star -who walks into his office with an outlandish story about a man who stole her fingers. He awakes from his latest hallucination alone, but on his desk is a manila envelope containing risque photos of Jennifer. Are the pictures real, and if so, is Mark hunting a blackmailer, or worse?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wildly imaginative and with a pitch-perfect voice, &lt;i&gt;The Little Sleep&lt;/i&gt; is the first in a new series that casts a fresh eye on the rigors of detective work, and introduces a character who has a lot to prove - if only he can stay awake long enough to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A family is shaken to its core after the mysterious disappearance of a teenage boy in this eerie tale, a blend of literary fiction, psychological suspense, and supernatural horror from the author of &lt;i&gt;A Head Full of Ghosts&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late one summer night, Elizabeth Sanderson receives the devastating news that every mother fears: her fourteen-year-old son, Tommy, has vanished without a trace in the woods of a local park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search isn’t yielding any answers, and Elizabeth and her young daughter, Kate, struggle to comprehend his disappearance. Feeling helpless and alone, their sorrow is compounded by anger and frustration. The local and state police haven’t uncovered any leads. Josh and Luis, the friends who were with Tommy last, may not be telling the whole truth about that night in Borderland State Park, when they were supposedly hanging out at a landmark the local teens have renamed Devil’s Rock— rumored to be cursed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in an all-too-real nightmare, riddled with worry, pain, and guilt, Elizabeth is wholly unprepared for the strange series of events that follow. She believes a ghostly shadow of Tommy materializes in her bedroom, while Kate and other local residents claim to see a shadow peering through their own windows in the dead of night. Then, random pages torn from Tommy’s journal begin to mysteriously appear—entries that reveal an introverted teenager obsessed with the phantasmagoric; the loss of his father, killed in a drunk-driving accident a decade earlier; a folktale involving the devil and the woods of Borderland; and a horrific incident that Tommy believed connected them all and changes everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the search grows more desperate, and the implications of what happened becomes more haunting and sinister, no one is prepared for the shocking truth about that night and Tommy’s disappearance at Devil’s Rock.</description>

  <description>‘It is stripped off - the paper - in great patches . . . The colour is repellent . . . In the places where it isn’t faded and where the sun is just so - I can see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to skulk about . . .’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the author’s own experiences, 'The Yellow Wallpaper' is the chilling tale of a woman driven to the brink of insanity by the ‘rest cure’ prescribed after the birth of her child. Isolated in a crumbling colonial mansion, in a room with bars on the windows, the tortuous pattern of the yellow wallpaper winds its way into the recesses of her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Perkins Gilman was America’s leading feminist intellectual of the early twentieth century. In addition to her masterpiece 'The Yellow Wallpaper', this new edition includes a selection of her best short fiction and extracts from her autobiography.</description>

  <description>The lives of the Barretts, a normal suburban New England family, are torn apart when fourteen-year-old Marjorie begins to display signs of acute schizophrenia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To her parents' despair, the doctors are unable to stop Marjorie's descent into madness. As their stable home devolves into a house of horrors, they reluctantly turn to a local Catholic priest for help. Father Wanderly suggests an exorcism; he believes the vulnerable teenager is the victim of demonic possession. He also contacts a production company that is eager to document the Barretts' plight. With John, Marjorie's father, out of work for more than a year and the medical bills looming, the family agrees to be filmed, and soon find themselves the unwitting stars of The Possession, a hit reality television show. When events in the Barrett household explode in tragedy, the show and the shocking incidents it captures become the stuff of urban legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen years later, a bestselling writer interviews Marjorie's younger sister, Merry. As she recalls those long ago events that took place when she was just eight years old, long-buried secrets and painful memories that clash with what was broadcast on television begin to surface--and a mind-bending tale of psychological horror is unleashed, raising vexing questions about memory and reality, science and religion, and the very nature of evil.</description>

  <description>Stephen King, Kelley Armstrong, Bill Pronzini, Simon Clark, and Ramsey Campbell are the first contributors to a mind-bending new series of short-story collections that push the boundaries of horror and dark suspense to the bleeding edge. From Brian James Freeman and Richard Chizmar of the acclaimed Cemetery Dance Publications, &lt;i&gt;Dark Screams: Volume One &lt;/i&gt;reaches across genres to take readers beyond the precipice of mortal toil and into the glimmering void of irreality and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WEEDS by Stephen King&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When a meteorite lands on his property, Jordy Verrill envisions an easy payday. Unfortunately for Jordy, this is no ordinary rock—and the uncompromising force inside has found its first target.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE PRICE YOU PAY by Kelley Armstrong&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Never pay more than you owe.&lt;/i&gt; Sounds like easy advice to follow. But for Kara and her childhood friend Ingrid, some debts can never be repaid . . . especially those tendered in blood.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MAGIC EYES by Bill Pronzini&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Edward James Tolliver has found a weary sort of asylum among the insane. He knows he’s not one of them—but how can he tell anyone about the invaders without sounding that way?&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MURDER IN CHAINS by Simon Clark&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Imagine awaking to find yourself in an underground vault, chained by the neck to a murderous lunatic, a grunting goliath who seems more animal than man. What would you do to save yourself?&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE WATCHED by Ramsey Campbell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Little Jimmy gets a glimpse of the cold truth when he finds out that it’s not always what you see that can get you into trouble; it’s who &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; what you see.</description>

Especially with an anthology that features the classic stories "Children of the Corn," "The Lawnmower Man," "Graveyard Shift," "The Mangler," and "Sometimes They Come Back"-which were all made into hit horror films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Unbearable suspense."

  <description>Roland and his tet have just returned to the path of the Beam when they discover that they are being followed by a group of inexperienced trackers. The trackers are from the town of Calla Bryn Sturgis, and they desperately need the help of gunslingers. Once every generation, a band of masked riders known as the Wolves gallop out of the dark land of Thunderclap to steal one half of all the twins born in the Callas. When the children are returned, they are roont, or mentally and physically ruined. In less than a month, the Wolves will raid again. In exchange for Roland’s aid, Father Callahan—a priest originally from our world—offers to give Roland a powerful but evil seeing sphere, a sinister globe called Black Thirteen which he has hidden below the floorboards of his church. Not only must Roland and his tet discover a way to defeat the invincible Wolves, but they must also return to New York so that they can save our world’s incarnation of the Dark Tower from the machinations of the evil Sombra Corporation.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A kayak accident during a South American adventure takes one woman to heaven — where she experienced God’s peace, joy, and angels — and back to life again. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; In 1999 in the Los Rios region of southern Chile, orthopedic surgeon, devoted wife, and loving mother Dr. Mary Neal drowned in a kayak accident. While cascading down a waterfall, her kayak became pinned at the bottom and she was immediately and completely submerged. Despite the rescue efforts of her companions, Mary was underwater for too long, and as a result, died.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;To Heaven and Back&lt;/i&gt; is Mary’s remarkable story of her life’s spiritual journey and what happened as she moved from life to death to eternal life, and back again. Detailing her feelings and surroundings in heaven, her communication with angels, and her deep sense of sadness when she realized it wasn’t her time, Mary shares the captivating experience of her modern-day miracle. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Mary’s life has been forever changed by her newfound understanding of her purpose on earth, her awareness of God, her closer relationship with Jesus, and her personal spiritual journey suddenly enhanced by a first-hand experience in heaven.  &lt;i&gt;To Heaven and Back&lt;/i&gt; will reacquaint you with the hope, wonder, and promise of heaven, while enriching you own faith and walk with God.</description>

  <description>Like the spellbinding psychological suspense in The Girl on the Train and Luckiest Girl Alive, Megan Miranda’s novel is a nail-biting, breathtaking story about the disappearances of two young women—a decade apart—told in reverse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been ten years since Nicolette Farrell left her rural hometown after her best friend, Corinne, disappeared from Cooley Ridge without a trace. Back again to tie up loose ends and care for her ailing father, Nic is soon plunged into a shocking drama that reawakens Corinne’s case and breaks open old wounds long since stitched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decade-old investigation focused on Nic, her brother Daniel, boyfriend Tyler, and Corinne’s boyfriend Jackson. Since then, only Nic has left Cooley Ridge. Daniel and his wife, Laura, are expecting a baby; Jackson works at the town bar; and Tyler is dating Annaleise Carter, Nic’s younger neighbor and the group’s alibi the night Corinne disappeared. Then, within days of Nic’s return, Annaleise goes missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told backwards—Day 15 to Day 1—from the time Annaleise goes missing, Nic works to unravel the truth about her younger neighbor’s disappearance, revealing shocking truths about her friends, her family, and what really happened to Corinne that night ten years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like nothing you’ve ever read before, All the Missing Girls delivers in all the right ways. With twists and turns that lead down dark alleys and dead ends, you may think you’re walking a familiar path, but then Megan Miranda turns it all upside down and inside out and leaves us wondering just how far we would be willing to go to protect those we love.</description>

  <description>The author of &lt;i&gt;The Pocket Wife&lt;/i&gt; explores the dark side of love, marriage, and infidelity in this sizzling novel of psychological suspense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everybody’s luck runs out. This time it could be theirs . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn’t safe. That’s what Joe tells her when he ends their affair—moments before their car skids off an icy road in a blinding snowstorm and hits a tree. Desperate to keep her life intact—her job, her husband, and her precious daughter, Lily—Dorrie will do everything she can to protect herself, even if it means walking away from the wreckage. Dorrie has always been a good actress, pretending to be someone else: the dutiful daughter, the satisfied wife, the woman who can handle anything. Now she’s going to put on the most challenging performance of her life. But details about the accident leave her feeling uneasy and afraid. Why didn’t Joe’s airbag work? Why was his car door open before the EMTs arrived? And now suddenly someone is calling her from her dead lover’s burner phone. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe’s death has left his wife in free fall as well. Karen knew Joe was cheating—she found some suspicious e-mails. Trying to cope with grief is devastating enough without the constant fear that has overtaken her—this feeling she can’t shake that someone is watching her. And with Joe gone and the kids grown, she’s vulnerable . . . and on her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insurance investigator Maggie Devlin is suspicious of the latest claim that’s landed on her desk—a man dying on an icy road shortly after buying a lucrative life insurance policy. Maggie doesn’t believe in coincidences. The former cop knows that things—and people—are never what they seem to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the fates of these three women become more tightly entwined, layers of lies and deception begin to peel away, pushing them dangerously to the edge . . . closer to each other . . . to a terrifying truth . . . to a shocking end.</description>

  <description>According to RT Book Reviews, "an emotionally moving, captivating story that is the perfect book club pick." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When former DC journalist Abigail Wolff attempts to rehabilitate her career, she finds herself at the heart of a US army cover-up involving the death of a soldier in Afghanistan -- with unspeakable emotional consequences for one family. As the story of what happened comes to light, Abigail will do anything to write it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more evidence she stumbles upon in the case, the fewer people it seems she can trust, including her own father, a retired army general. And she certainly never expected to fall in love with the slain soldier's brother, Gabe, a bitter man struggling to hold his family together. The investigation eventually leads her to an impossible choice, one of unrelenting sacrifice to protect those she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the buried truths and betrayals, questions of family loyalty and redemption, Abigail's search is, most of all, a desperate grasp at carrying on and coping -- and seeking hope in the impossible.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Even the perfect marriage has its dark side… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iris and Will's marriage is as close to perfect as it can be: a large house in a nice Atlanta neighborhood, rewarding careers and the excitement of trying for their first baby. But on the morning Will leaves for a business trip to Orlando, Iris's happy world comes to an abrupt halt. Another plane headed for Seattle has crashed into a field, killing everyone on board, and according to the airline, Will was one of the passengers on this plane. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grief-stricken and confused, Iris is convinced it all must be a huge misunderstanding. But as time passes and there is still no sign of Will, she reluctantly accepts that he is gone. Still, Iris needs answers. Why did Will lie about where he was going? What is in Seattle? And what else has he lied about? As Iris sets off on a desperate quest to find out what her husband was keeping from her, the answers she receives will shock her to her very core.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In 2003, sixteen-year-old Rebecca Winter disappeared.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She'd been enjoying her teenage summer break: working at a fast-food restaurant, crushing on an older boy and shoplifting with her best friend. Mysteriously ominous things began to happen—blood in the bed, periods of blackouts, a feeling of being watched—though Bec remained oblivious of what was to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eleven years later she is replaced.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young woman, desperate after being arrested, claims to be the decade-missing Bec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon the imposter is living Bec's life. Sleeping in her bed. Hugging her mother and father. Learning her best friends' names. Playing with her twin brothers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Bec's welcoming family and enthusiastic friends are not quite as they seem. As the imposter dodges the detective investigating her case, she begins to delve into the life of the real Bec Winter—and soon realizes that whoever took Bec is still at large, and that she is in imminent danger.</description>

  <description>For popular high school senior Samantha Kingston, February 12—"Cupid Day"—should be one big party, a day of valentines and roses and the privileges that come with being at the top of the social pyramid. And it is … until she dies in a terrible accident that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, she still wakes up the next morning. In fact, Sam lives the last day of her life seven times, until she realizes that by making even the slightest changes, she may hold more power than she ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Before I Fall&lt;/i&gt; is now a major motion picture Zoey Deutch, Halston Sage, and Kian Lawley. Named to numerous state reading lists, the novel was also recognized as a Best Book of the Year by Amazon.com, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, The Daily Beast, NPR, and &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The second book in &lt;b&gt;C. S. Lewis's&lt;/b&gt; acclaimed Space Trilogy, which also includes &lt;i&gt;Out of the Silent Planet&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;That Hideous Strength&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Perelandra&lt;/i&gt; continues the adventures of the extraordinary Dr. Ransom. Pitted against the most destructive of human weaknesses, temptation, the great man must battle evil on a new planet — Perelandra — when it is invaded by a dark force. Will Perelandra succumb to this malevolent being, who strives to create a new world order and who must destroy an old and beautiful civilization to do so? Or will it throw off the yoke of corruption and achieve a spiritual perfection as yet unknown to man? The outcome of Dr. Ransom's mighty struggle alone will determine the fate of this peace-loving planet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It leads to the open moor...or does it? Once again Aslan has a task for the children, and Narnia needs them.

  <description>Lucy and Edmund, with their dreadful cousin Eustace, get magically pulled into a painting of a ship at sea. That ship is the Dawn Treader, and on board is Caspian, King of Narnia. He and his companions, including Reepicheep, the valiant warrior mouse, are searching for seven lost lords of Narnia, and their voyage will take them to the edge of the world. Their adventures include being captured by slave traders, a much-too-close encounter with a dragon, and visits to many enchanted islands, including the place where dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This edition follows the original numbering scheme. More recent publishers have re-numbered the volumes so that the books are ordered chronologically. This was reportedly the author's preference. Other editions number this book as #5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please respect the title as printed.</description>

  <description>Nestled deep in Litchfield Hills, Connecticut, a 1790 farmhouse sits near the epicenter of a paranormal commotion. The family that resides there regularly encounters its own ancestors and strangers--human and  non-human--who seemingly occupy the same physical space in our world while remaining in their own, parallel worlds. When famous ghost hunters Ed and Lorraine Warren investigated, they dubbed it "Ghost Central."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's your chance to unlock and experience the private diary of farmhouse resident Donna Fillie. This amazing record spans five decades and recounts a parade of uncanny occurrences, including:&lt;br /&gt;Notes from old friends who insist they didn't deliver them&lt;br /&gt;A grandson playing with an invisible--but very real--friend&lt;br /&gt;Donna awakening to phenomena at precisely 12:42 a.m., an eerie correspondence to her house number, 1242&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This compelling work includes many other unexplainable details of a wide variety of phenomena that frequently occur in this otherwise normal area of Connecticut, which may also be the site of a secret military base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading The Haunted House Diaries, you will undoubtedly wonder: Are our assumptions about the paranormal all wrong?</description>

  <description>Hillary Rodham Clinton’s inside account of the crises, choices, and challenges she faced during her four years as America’s 67th Secretary of State, and how those experiences drive her view of the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“All of us face hard choices in our lives,” Hillary Rodham Clinton writes at the start of this personal chronicle of years at the center of world events. “Life is about making such choices. Our choices and how we handle them shape the people we become.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the aftermath of her 2008 presidential run, she expected to return to representing New York in the United States Senate. To her surprise, her former rival for the Democratic Party nomination, newly elected President Barack Obama, asked her to serve in his administration as Secretary of State. This memoir is the story of the four extraordinary and historic years that followed, and the hard choices that she and her colleagues confronted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secretary Clinton and President Obama had to decide how to repair fractured alliances, wind down two wars, and address a global financial crisis. They faced a rising competitor in China, growing threats from Iran and North Korea, and revolutions across the Middle East. Along the way, they grappled with some of the toughest dilemmas of US foreign policy, especially the decision to send Americans into harm’s way, from Afghanistan to Libya to the hunt for Osama bin Laden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of her tenure, Secretary Clinton had visited 112 countries, traveled nearly one million miles, and gained a truly global perspective on many of the major trends reshaping the landscape of the twenty-first century, from economic inequality to climate change to revolutions in energy, communications, and health. Drawing on conversations with numerous leaders and experts, Secretary Clinton offers her views on what it will take for the United States to compete and thrive in an interdependent world. She makes a passionate case for human rights and the full participation in society of women, youth, and LGBT people. An astute eyewitness to decades of social change, she distinguishes the trendlines from the headlines and describes the progress occurring throughout the world, day after day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secretary Clinton’s descriptions of diplomatic conversations at the highest levels offer readers a master class in international relations, as does her analysis of how we can best use “smart power” to deliver security and prosperity in a rapidly changing world—one in which America remains the indispensable nation.</description>

  <description>What &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; happened to Laughs in the Wind?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When Anne Mitchell was 11 years old, something happened to her that erased the whole first decade of her life.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-five years later, she has come home to reclaim her past. Oh, she gets it. She understands that something profoundly evil lurks in the swirling purple haze of her amnesia. Fear of facing that secret held her hostage. Like a schoolyard bully, it twisted her arm behind her back and forced her to accept that her life began in the dirt beside the ditch where the family station wagon burned like hell had opened up a crack in the world right there in the back seat. For 25 years, she was enslaved by what she called the "Boogie Man"-- images from her lost childhood that appeared in the shadows behind her reflection in mirrors and wine glasses, haunted her dreams and attacked her in screaming night terrors. Then the monster shattered her career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Anne saw him in her dying mother's eyes. With her last breath, Susan Mitchell begged for her daughter's forgiveness. She didn't mean for it to happen, she gasped, but she'll burn in hell for what she did all the same. What did her mother &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt;? Anne has to know. So she has come home to a small Texas prairie town to live with her crazy grandmother in the rambling old house where she grew up to take her stand against the Boogie Man. But Anne isn't really prepared for how expensive remembering might be. The cost of her memories could very well be her sanity.  Each new revelation loosens Anne's grip on reality. Surely her crazy grandmother didn't do &lt;i&gt;THAT&lt;/i&gt; to Anne's beloved parakeet! Yes, the old woman DID! No ... actually, she didn't. The horror that attacks her in the garage--it can't possibly be real...can it? And most important: what happened to the little girl with a face like a china doll whose name was Laughs in the Wind? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Boogie Man knows. He also knows Anne's here. He knows it's showtime. And he knows what she doesn't--that Anne might very well have to pay for her past with her future, that the cost of remembering could be her life.</description>

  <description>In the spirit of &lt;em&gt;Barack Obama: Son of Promise, Child of Hope &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Amelia and Eleanor Go for a Ride &lt;/em&gt;comes an inspiring portrait of Hillary Rodham Clinton: a girl who fought to make a difference—and paved the way for women everywhere—from Michelle Markel and LeUyen Pham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 1950s, it was a man’s world. Girls weren’t supposed to act smart, tough, or ambitious. Even though, deep inside, they may have felt that way. And then along came Hillary. Brave, brilliant, and unstoppable, she was out to change the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They said a woman couldn’t be a mother and a lawyer. Hillary was both. They said a woman shouldn’t be too strong or too smart. Hillary was fearlessly herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn’t matter what people said—she was born to lead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With illustrations packed full of historical figures and details, this gorgeous and informative picture book biography is perfect for every budding leader. Includes a timeline, artist’s note, and bibliography.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump has a plan to make America great again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;President Obama has been a disaster for this country. He's wrecked our economy, saddled our children with debt, and gone around the world &lt;i&gt;apologizing&lt;/i&gt; for America--as if the greatest nation in the world needed to apologize for being the land of opportunity and freedom that we were before Obama became president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, America looks like a broken country--stripped of jobs, stripped of wealth, stripped of respect. And what does President Obama do about it? He plays nice with the very same foreign governments who are eager to watch America burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can't go on. And if Donald J. Trump has anything to say about it, it won't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his blockbuster book, &lt;i&gt;Time to Get Tough&lt;/i&gt;, Trump has the answers America has been looking for, including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to &lt;b&gt;finally&lt;/b&gt; secure our border and fix our immigration overflow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to create American jobs by forcing Communist China into truly fair trade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to retire our debt without endangering long-established programs--like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--that millions of Americans depend on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to undo the fraud of Obamanomics and the disaster of Obamacare&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blunt, straightforward, and honest, it's all trademark Trump, setting out a common sense agenda to restore American prosperity and make our nation respected once again.</description>

  <description>Four brides. One Dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tale of faith, redemption, and timeless love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte owns a chic Birmingham bridal boutique. Dressing brides for their big day is her gift . . . and her passion. But with her own wedding day approaching, why can't she find the perfect dress...or feel certain she should marry Tim?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Charlotte discovers a vintage dress in a battered trunk at an estate sale. It looks brand-new-shimmering with pearls and satin, hand-stitched and timeless in its design. But where did it come from? Who wore it? Who welded the lock shut and tucked the dog tags in that little sachet? Who left it in the basement for a ten-year-old girl? And what about the mysterious man in the purple vest who insists the dress had been "redeemed."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte's search for the gown's history-and its new bride-begins as a distraction from her sputtering love life. But it takes on a life of its own as she comes to know the women who have worn the dress. Emily from 1912. Mary Grace from 1939. Hillary from 1968. Each with her own story of promise, pain, and destiny. And each with something unique to share. For woven within the threads of the beautiful hundred-year-old gown is the truth about Charlotte's heritage, the power of courage and faith, and the timeless beauty of finding true love.</description>

  <description>From the Pulitzer Prize-winning, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Emperor of All Maladies&lt;/i&gt;—a magnificent history of the gene and a response to the defining question of the future: What becomes of being human when we learn to “read” and “write” our own genetic information?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Siddhartha Mukherjee has a written a biography of the gene as deft, brilliant, and illuminating as his extraordinarily successful biography of cancer. Weaving science, social history, and personal narrative to tell us the story of one of the most important conceptual breakthroughs of modern times, Mukherjee animates the quest to understand human heredity and its surprising influence on our lives, personalities, identities, fates, and choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the narrative, the story of Mukherjee’s own family—with its tragic and bewildering history of mental illness—cuts like a bright, red line, reminding us of the many questions that hang over our ability to translate the science of genetics from the laboratory to the real world. In superb prose and with an instinct for the dramatic scene, he describes the centuries of research and experimentation—from Aristotle and Pythagoras to Mendel and Darwin, from Boveri and Morgan to Crick, Watson and Franklin, all the way through the revolutionary twenty-first century innovators who mapped the human genome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; said of &lt;i&gt;The Emperor of All Maladies&lt;/i&gt;, “It’s hard to think of many books for a general audience that have rendered any area of modern science and technology with such intelligence, accessibility, and compassion…An extraordinary achievement.” Riveting, revelatory, and magisterial history of a scientific idea coming to life, and an essential preparation for the moral complexity introduced by our ability to create or “write” the human genome, &lt;i&gt;The Gene&lt;/i&gt; is a must-read for everyone concerned about the definition and future of humanity. This is the most crucial science of our time, intimately explained by a master.</description>

  <description>By identifying the structure of DNA, the molecule of life, Francis Crick and James Watson revolutionized biochemistry &amp;amp; won themselves a Nobel Prize. At the time, Watson was only 24, a young scientist hungry to make his mark. His uncompromisingly honest account of the heady days of their thrilling sprint against other world-class researchers to solve one of science's greatest mysteries gives a dazzlingly clear picture of a world of brilliant scientists with great gifts, very human ambitions &amp;amp; bitter rivalries. With humility unspoiled by false modesty, Watson relates his &amp;amp; Crick's desperate efforts to beat Linus Pauling to the Holy Grail of life sciences, the identification of the basic building block of life. Never has a scientist been so truthful in capturing in words the flavor of his work.</description>

  <description>BLOOD AND SMOKE : THREE SHORT STORIES FROM THE MASTER OF MODERN FICTION AVAILABLE ONLY AS AN AUDIOBOOK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three Stories Includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lunch at the Gotham Cafe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1408&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the Deathroom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen King has forced us to confront our greatest fears. He has guided us through the depths of our imagination to places we never would have ventured alone. Now, in Blood and Smoke, he takes us inside a world of yearning and paranoia, isolation and addiction. It is the world of the smoker.In this audio-only collection, the now politically incorrect habit plays a key role in the fates of three different men in three unabridged stories of unfiltered suspense.In, &lt;b&gt;"Lunch at the Gotham Cafe,"&lt;/b&gt; Steve Davis is suffering through intense withdrawal -- from both nicotine and his wife. His desperation for a cigarette and for his ex are almost too much to bear, but that's nothing compared to the horrors that await him at a trendy Manhattan restaurant.In, &lt;b&gt;"1408,"&lt;/b&gt; Mike Enslin, bestselling author of true ghost stories, decides to spend the night in New York City's most haunted hotel room. But he must live to write about it without the help of his ex best-friends, his trusty smokes.And in, &lt;b&gt;"In the Deathroom,"&lt;/b&gt; a man named Fletcher is held captive in a South American stronghold. His captors will use any tortuous means necessary to extract the information they want from him. His only hope lies with his last request -- one last cigarette, please.A cartonfull of chills and thrills, Blood and Smoke is classic Stephen King. The most mesmerizing storyteller of our time is at his inventive and compelling best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read by the Author&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, Blood and Smoke has only been published as an audiobook, the stories themselves can be found in Stephen King's publication of, &lt;b&gt;"Everything's Eventual."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 Audio CDs / 3 Hours 30 mins (Approx)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~</description>

  <description>The Shadow Over Innsmouth and The Whisperer in Darkness are counted amongst H.P. Lovecraft's most popular stories. In the first we are transported to the decrepit coastal town of Innsmouth, whose amphibian-like citizens betray a dark and sinister secret... The second takes us to Vermont, where a university professor becomes embroiled in a mind-bending, celestial mystery after strange things are seen floating in the rivers... Dark, brooding and suspenseful, this is Lovecraft at his very best.</description>

  <description>Widely recognized as the godmother of modern herbalism, Rosemary Gladstar is renowned worldwide for her inspired teaching and trustworthy knowledge of healing herbs. With Medicinal Herbs: A Beginner's Guide, Gladstar offers a fresh introduction for a new generation of gardeners and natural health and self-sufficiency enthusiasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty-three of the most common and versatile healing plants are profiled in depth to get the budding herbalist off on the right foot. Readers will learn how to grow, harvest, prepare, and use each herb. Step-by-step instructions explain how to prepare herbal teas, salves, syrups, tinctures, oils, and liniments to stock the home medicine chest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple recipes explore each plant's healing qualities - aloe lotion for poison ivy, dandelion-burdock tincture for sluggish digestion, and lavender-lemon balm tea for stress relief. Gladstar shows how easy it is to make safe, all-natural, low-cost healing remedies for common ailments.</description>

  <description>100,000 years ago, at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Sapiens&lt;/i&gt;, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power ... and our future.</description>

  <description>In this new novel, beloved bestselling author Elizabeth Berg weaves a beautifully written and richly resonant story of a mother and daughter in emotional transit. Helen Ames–recently widowed, coping with loss and grief, unable to do the work that has always sustained her–is beginning to depend far too much on her twenty-seven-year-old daughter, Tessa, and is meddling in her life, offering unsolicited and unwelcome advice. Helen’s problems are compounded by her shocking discovery that her mild-mannered and loyal husband was apparently leading a double life. The Ameses had painstakingly saved for a happy retirement, but that money disappeared in several large withdrawals made by Helen’s husband before he died. In order to support herself and garner a measure of much needed independence, Helen takes an unusual job that ends up offering far more than she had anticipated. And then a phone call from a stranger sets Helen on a surprising path of discovery that causes both mother and daughter to reassess what they thought they knew about each other, themselves, and what really makes a home and a family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.</description>

She knows it will wait at the same signal each time, overlooking a row of back gardens. She’s even started to feel like she knows the people who live in one of the houses. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. If only Rachel could be that happy. And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Now Rachel has a chance to become a part of the lives she’s only watched from afar. Now they’ll see; she’s much more than just the girl on the train...</description>

      <![CDATA[Well written-I listened to the audio version which was well done with British accents and all! I like when I can't figure out the mystery until near the end, and this was the case for this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it. No spoilers-you have to read it to figure it out!]]>

  <description>From the award-winning, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;NOS4A2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Heart-Shaped Box&lt;/em&gt; comes a chilling novel about a worldwide pandemic of spontaneous combustion that threatens to reduce civilization to ashes and a band of improbable heroes who battle to save it, led by one powerful and enigmatic man known as the Fireman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fireman is coming. Stay cool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one knows exactly when it began or where it originated. A terrifying new plague is spreading like wildfire across the country, striking cities one by one: Boston, Detroit, Seattle. The doctors call it Draco Incendia Trychophyton. To everyone else it’s Dragonscale, a highly contagious, deadly spore that marks its hosts with beautiful black and gold marks across their bodies—before causing them to burst into flames. Millions are infected; blazes erupt everywhere. There is no antidote. No one is safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harper Grayson, a compassionate, dedicated nurse as pragmatic as Mary Poppins, treated hundreds of infected patients before her hospital burned to the ground. Now she’s discovered the telltale gold-flecked marks on her skin. When the outbreak first began, she and her husband, Jakob, had made a pact: they would take matters into their own hands if they became infected. To Jakob’s dismay, Harper wants to live—at least until the fetus she is carrying comes to term. At the hospital, she witnessed infected mothers give birth to healthy babies and believes hers will be fine too. . . if she can live long enough to deliver the child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced that his do-gooding wife has made him sick, Jakob becomes unhinged, and eventually abandons her as their placid New England community collapses in terror. The chaos gives rise to ruthless Cremation Squads—armed, self-appointed posses roaming the streets and woods to exterminate those who they believe carry the spore. But Harper isn’t as alone as she fears: a mysterious and compelling stranger she briefly met at the hospital, a man in a dirty yellow fire fighter’s jacket, carrying a hooked iron bar, straddles the abyss between insanity and death. Known as The Fireman, he strolls the ruins of New Hampshire, a madman afflicted with Dragonscale who has learned to control the fire within himself, using it as a shield to protect the hunted . . . and as a weapon to avenge the wronged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the desperate season to come, as the world burns out of control, Harper must learn the Fireman’s secrets before her life—and that of her unborn child—goes up in smoke.</description>

  <description>Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate—a life and a role that she has never challenged... until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister—and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A provocative novel that raises some important ethical issues, &lt;i&gt;My Sister's Keeper&lt;/i&gt; is the story of one family's struggle for survival at all human costs and a stunning parable for all time.</description>

  <description>Mitch Albom creates a magical world through his love of music in this remarkable new novel about the power of talent to change our lives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the epic story of Frankie Presto—the greatest guitar player who ever lived—and the six lives he changed with his six magical blue strings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankie, born in a burning church, abandoned as an infant, and raised by a music teacher in a small Spanish town, until war rips his life apart. At nine years old, he is sent to America in the bottom of a boat. His only possession is an old guitar and six precious strings. His amazing journey weaves him through the musical landscape of the 1940s, ’50s and ’60s, with his stunning playing and singing talent affecting numerous stars (Duke Ellington, Hank Williams, Elvis Presley) until, as if predestined, he becomes a pop star himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He makes records. He is adored. But Frankie Presto’s gift is also his burden, as he realizes the power of the strings his teacher gave him, and how, through his music, he can actually affect people’s lives. At the height of his popularity, tortured by his biggest mistake, he vanishes. His legend grows. Only decades later, having finally healed his heart, does Frankie reappearjust before his spectacular death—to change one last life. With the Spirit of Music as our guide, we glimpse into the lives that were changed by one man whose strings could touch the music—and the magic—in each of us.</description>

      <![CDATA[Not my favorite Mitch Albom novel, but that is perhaps because it is not what I expected. It is still very enjoyable, starting from the death of Frankie Presto, and moving back and forth in Frankie's life, integrating music, family relationships, and the fragility of life. Good book overall.]]>

  <description>For more than a decade, Jenna Metcalf has never stopped thinking about her mother, Alice, who mysteriously disappeared in the wake of a tragic accident. Refusing to believe she was abandoned, Jenna searches for her mother regularly online and pores over the pages of Alice’s old journals. A scientist who studied grief among elephants, Alice wrote mostly of her research among the animals she loved, yet Jenna hopes the entries will provide a clue to her mother’s whereabouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jenna’s memories dovetail with the events in her mother’s journals, the story races to a mesmerizing finish.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In her bestselling memoirs Ruth Reichl has long illuminated the theme of how food defines us, and never more so than in her dazzling fiction debut about sisters, family ties, and a young woman who must finally let go of guilt and grief to embrace her own true gifts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billie Breslin has traveled far from her California home to take a job at Delicious, the most iconic food magazine in New York and, thus, the world. When the publication is summarily shut down, the colorful staff, who have become an extended family for Billie, must pick up their lives and move on. Not Billie, though. She is offered a new job: staying behind in the magazine's deserted downtown mansion offices to uphold the "Delicious Guarantee"-a public relations hotline for complaints and recipe inquiries-until further notice. What she doesn't know is that this boring, lonely job will be the portal to a life-changing discovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delicious! carries the reader to the colorful world of downtown New York restaurateurs and artisanal purveyors, and from the lively food shop in Little Italy where Billie works on weekends to a hidden room in the magazine's library where she discovers the letters of Lulu Swan, a plucky twelve-year-old, who wrote to the legendary chef James Beard during World War II. Lulu's letters lead Billie to a deeper understanding of history (and the history of food), but most important, Lulu's courage in the face of loss inspires Billie to come to terms with her own issues-the panic attacks that occur every time she even thinks about cooking, the truth about the big sister she adored, and her ability to open her heart to love.</description>

  <description>Fen Dexter's quiet life on the idyllic California coast is interrupted one stormy night when a blood-covered man shows up on her doorstep, claiming to have had a car accident. He tells her that he is on his way to San Francisco to help the police solve the murder of his fiancée. Unable to make it to the hospital because of the storm, he stays the night at Fen's, and the attraction between them is obvious. The next morning he heads to the hospital where Fen's niece, Vivi, is an ER doctor. Vivi is treating the most recent target of a serial killer whose signature move is to leave a note saying "Please Don't Tell" taped across his victim's mouths. When Fen's mysterious stranger comes to Vivi to have his wounds stitched she agrees to set him up to talk with the police about his fiancée. Who is this man, really? What does he want with Fen and her family? And will they live long enough to uncover the truth? Told with Elizabeth Adler's knack for terrific female characters and breathtaking twists, &lt;i&gt;Please Don't Tell &lt;/i&gt;will keep you guessing, right up to the end.</description>

  <description>For nearly two decades, since the publication of her iconic first novel, &lt;i&gt;The Good Mother,&lt;/i&gt; Sue Miller has distinguished herself as one of our most elegant and widely celebrated chroniclers of family life, with a singular gift for laying bare the interior lives of her characters. In each of her novels, Miller has written with exquisite precision about the experience of grace in daily life–the sudden, epiphanic recognition of the extraordinary amid the ordinary–as well as the sharp and unexpected motions of the human heart away from it, toward an unruly netherworld of upheaval and desire. But never before have Miller’s powers been keener or more transfixing than they are in &lt;i&gt;Lost in the Forest,&lt;/i&gt; a novel set in the vineyards of Northern California that tells the story of a young girl who, in the wake of a tragic accident, seeks solace in a damaging love affair with a much older man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eva, a divorced and happily remarried mother of three, runs a small bookstore in a town north of San Francisco. When her second husband, John, is killed in a car accident, her family’s fragile peace is once again overtaken by loss. Emily, the eldest, must grapple with newfound independence and responsibility. Theo, the youngest, can only begin to fathom his father’s death. But for Daisy, the middle child, John’s absence opens up a world of bewilderment, exposing her at the onset of adolescence to the chaos and instability that hover just beyond the safety of parental love. In her sorrow, Daisy embarks on a harrowing sexual odyssey, a journey that will cast her even farther out onto the harsh promontory of adulthood and lost hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With astonishing sensuality and immediacy, &lt;i&gt;Lost in the Forest&lt;/i&gt; moves through the most intimate realms of domestic life, from grief and sex to adolescence and marriage. It is a stunning, kaleidoscopic evocation of a family in crisis, written with delicacy and masterful care. For her lifelong fans and those just discovering Sue Miller for the first time, here is a rich and gorgeously layered tale of a family breaking apart and coming back together again: Sue Miller at her inimitable best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The bestselling memoirist shows how saving a dog can sometimes help you save yourself. &lt;/b&gt;Julie Klam writes about dogs with a rollicking wit and a radiating warmth-as no other writer can. In her bestselling memoir &lt;i&gt;You Had Me at Woof,&lt;/i&gt; she shared the secrets of happiness she learned as an occasionally frazzled but always devoted owner of Boston terriers. Now, with the same enchanting, pop culture-infused amalgam of humor and poignancy that reached the &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Today&lt;/i&gt; show and won the hearts of readers across the country, she returns with more humorous insight into life with canine companions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Klam focuses here on dog rescue, and its healing power not only for the dogs who are cared for and able to find good homes, but also for the people who bond with these animals. Klam became involved with rescue after years as an owner of purebred dogs. She was looking for a way to help and participate in a community, but she never imagined just how much she would receive in return. The dogs she has rescued through the years have filled her life with laughter and contentment, sorrow and frustration, and they have made certain that she never has a dull moment. Along the way, she has collected stories from friends who have also found that guiding dogs to nurturing homes made their own lives richer. These experiences, which show us that even in our smallest gestures we can make a big difference, inspired &lt;i&gt;Love at First Bark&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>In an unnamed South American country, a world-renowned soprano sings at a birthday party in honor of a visiting Japanese industrial titan. Alas, in the opening sequence, a ragtag band of 18 terrorists enters the vice-presidential mansion through the air conditioning ducts. Their quarry is the president, who has unfortunately stayed home to watch a favorite soap opera. And thus, from the beginning, things go awry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the hostages are Russian, Italian, and French diplomatic types. Swiss Red Cross negotiator oachim Messner comes and goes, wrangling over terms and demands. Days stretch into weeks, the weeks into months. Joined by no common language except music, the 58 international hostages and their captors forge unexpected bonds. Time stands still, priorities rearrange themselves. Ultimately, of course, something has to give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hearing opera sung live for the first time, a young priest reflects: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; Never had he thought, never once, that such a woman existed, one who stood so close to God that God's own voice poured from her. How far she must have gone inside herself to call up that voice. It was as if the voice came from the center part of the earth and by the sheer effort and diligence of her will she had pulled it up through the dirt and rock and through the floorboards of the house, up into her feet, where it pulled through her, reaching, lifting, warmed by her, and then out of the white lily of her throat and straight to God in heaven. &lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I can understand where some of the reviews are coming from in saying that the book is "slow", but I think that is because it is a study in human psychology, at some level. What would you do if you had time to explore something else--such as singing, or learning a new language, or falling in love?...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It’s the end of the line.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WICKED has taken everything from Thomas: his life, his memories, and now his only friends—the Gladers. But it’s finally over. The trials are complete, after one final test.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Will anyone survive?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What WICKED doesn’t know is that Thomas remembers far more than they think. And it’s enough to prove that he can’t believe a word of what they say.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The truth will be terrifying.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thomas beat the Maze. He survived the Scorch. He’ll risk anything to save his friends. But the truth might be what ends it all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The time for lies is over.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Scholastic's next multi-platform mega-event begins here! History is broken, and three kids must travel back in time to set it right! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When best friends Dak Smyth and Sera Froste stumble upon the secret of time travel -- a hand-held device known as the Infinity Ring -- they're swept up in a centuries-long secret war for the fate of mankind. Recruited by the Hystorians, a secret society that dates back to Aristotle, the kids learn that history has gone disastrously off course.Now it's up to Dak, Sera, and teenage Hystorian-in-training Riq to travel back in time to fix the Great Breaks . . . and to save Dak's missing parents while they're at it. First stop: Spain, 1492, where a sailor named Christopher Columbus is about to be thrown overboard in a deadly mutiny!</description>

  <description>Ignatius Perrish spent the night drunk and doing terrible things. He woke up the next morning with a thunderous hangover, a raging headache . . . and a pair of horns growing from his temples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first Ig thought the horns were a hallucination, the product of a mind damaged by rage and grief. He had spent the last year in a lonely, private purgatory, following the death of his beloved, Merrin Williams, who was raped and murdered under inexplicable circumstances. A mental breakdown would have been the most natural thing in the world. But there was nothing natural about the horns, which were all too real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the righteous Ig had enjoyed the life of the blessed: born into privilege, the second son of a renowned musician and younger brother of a rising late-night TV star, he had security, wealth, and a place in his community. Ig had it &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;, and more—he had Merrin and a love founded on shared daydreams, mutual daring, and unlikely midsummer magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Merrin's death damned all that. The only suspect in the crime, Ig was never charged or tried. And he was never cleared. In the court of public opinion in Gideon, New Hampshire, Ig is and always will be guilty because his rich and connected parents pulled strings to make the investigation go away. Nothing Ig can do, nothing he can say, matters. Everyone, it seems, including God, has abandoned him. Everyone, that is, but the devil inside. . . .</description>

  <description>Curtis Sittenfeld, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;American Wife &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; Prep, &lt;/i&gt;returns with a mesmerizing novel of family and identity, loyalty and deception, and the delicate line between truth and belief.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From an early age, Kate and her identical twin sister, Violet, knew that they were unlike everyone else. Kate and Vi were born with peculiar “senses”—innate psychic abilities concerning future events and other people’s secrets. Though Vi embraced her visions, Kate did her best to hide them.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, years later, their different paths have led them both back to their hometown of St. Louis. Vi has pursued an eccentric career as a psychic medium, while Kate, a devoted wife and mother, has settled down in the suburbs to raise her two young children. But when a minor earthquake hits in the middle of the night, the normal life Kate has always wished for begins to shift. After Vi goes on television to share a premonition that another, more devastating earthquake will soon hit the St. Louis area, Kate is mortified. Equally troubling, however, is her fear that Vi may be right. As the date of the predicted earthquake quickly approaches, Kate is forced to reconcile her fraught relationship with her sister and to face truths about herself she’s long tried to deny.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Funny, haunting, and thought-provoking, &lt;i&gt;Sisterland&lt;/i&gt; is a beautifully written novel of the obligation we have toward others, and the responsibility we take for ourselves. With her deep empathy, keen wisdom, and unerring talent for finding the extraordinary moments in our everyday lives, Curtis Sittenfeld is one of the most exceptional voices in literary fiction today.</description>

  <description>Every city has secrets. But none as terrible as this. His name is Deucalion, a tattooed man of mysterious origin, a sleight-of-reality artist who’s traveled the centuries with a secret worse than death. He arrives as a serial killer stalks the streets, a killer who carefully selects his victims for the humanity that is missing in himself. Detective Carson O’Connor is cool, cynical, and every bit as tough as she looks. Her partner Michael Maddison would back her up all the way to Hell itself–and that just may be where this case ends up. For the no-nonsense O’Connor is suddenly talking about an ages-old conspiracy, a near immortal race of beings, and killers that are more—and less—than human. Soon it will be clear that as crazy as she sounds, the truth is even more ominous. For their quarry isn’t merely a homicidal maniac—but his deranged maker.</description>

  <description>In a small New England town, in the early 60s, a shadow falls over a small boy playing with his toy soldiers. Jamie Morton looks up to see a striking man, the new minister. Charles Jacobs, along with his beautiful wife, will transform the local church. The men and boys are all a bit in love with Mrs Jacobs; the women and girls – including Jamie’s mother and beloved sister – feel the same about Reverend Jacobs. With Jamie, the Reverend shares a deeper bond, based on their fascination with simple experiments in electricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then tragedy strikes the Jacobs family; the preacher curses God, mocking all religious belief, and is banished from the shocked town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie has demons of his own. In his mid-thirties, he is living a nomadic lifestyle of bar-band rock and roll. Addicted to heroin, stranded, desperate, he sees Jacobs again – a showman on stage, creating dazzling ‘portraits in lightning’ – and their meeting has profound consequences for both men. Their bond becomes a pact beyond even the Devil’s devising, and Jamie discovers that &lt;i&gt;revival&lt;/i&gt; has many meanings. Because for every cure there is a price…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rich and disturbing novel spans five decades on its way to the most terrifying conclusion Stephen King has ever written. It’s a masterpiece from King, in the great American tradition of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe.</description>

  <description>The hilarious and heartfelt chronicle of a woman learning the secrets of love, health, and happiness from some very surprising teachers: her dogs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julie Klam was thirty, single, and working as a part-time clerk in an insurance company, wondering if she would ever meet the man she could spend the rest of her life with. And then it happened. She met the irresistible Otto, her first in a long line of Boston terriers, and fell instantly in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;You Had Me at Woof&lt;/i&gt; is the often hilarious and always sincere story of how one woman discovered life's most important lessons from her relationships with her canine companions. From Otto, Julie realized what it might feel like to find "the one." She learned to share her home, her heart, and her limited resources with another, and she found an authentic friend in the process. But that was just the beginning. Over the years her brood has grown to one husband, one daughter, and several Boston terriers. And although she had much to learn about how to care for them-walks at 2 a.m., vet visits, behavior problems-she was surprised and delighted to find that her dogs had more wisdom to convey to her than she had ever dreamed. And caring for them has made her a better person-and completely and utterly opened her heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riotously funny and unexpectedly poignant, &lt;i&gt;You Had Me at Woof&lt;/i&gt; recounts the hidden surprises, pleasures, and revelations of letting any mutt, beagle, terrier, or bulldog go charging through your world.</description>

  <description>What if you could ask C. S. Lewis his thoughts on some of the most difficult questions of life? If you could, the result would be Dr. Alister McGrath's provocative and perceptive book, &lt;i&gt;If I Had Lunch with C. S. Lewis.&lt;/i&gt; Best-selling author, prominent academic, and sought-after speaker, Dr. McGrath sees C. S. Lewis as the perfect conversation companion for the persistent meaning-of-life questions everyone asks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes Lewis a good dialogue partner is that his mind traveled through a wide and varied terrain: from atheism of his early life to his conversion later in life; from his rational skepticism to his appreciation of value of human desires and imagination; from his role as a Christian apologist during World War II to his growth as a celebrated author of classic children's literature. The questions Lewis pondered persist today: Does life have meaning? Does God exist? Can reason and imagination be reconciled? Why does God allow suffering?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let McGrath be your insightful guide to an intriguing conversation with Lewis about the ultimate questions.</description>

      <![CDATA[I had a hard time keeping my interest in this book. It is good, but perhaps a little over the top with religious overtones, versus the story line of a "magical" 7th son of a 7th son. The historical background, with modifications of US history is interesting in that the things that are changed are...]]>

  <description>Blending literature and memoir, Ann Patchett, author of &lt;em&gt;State of  Wonder, Run,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bel Canto,&lt;/em&gt; examines her deepest commitments — to writing, family, friends, dogs, books, and her husband — creating a resonant portrait of a life in &lt;em&gt;This is the Story of a Happy Marriage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage&lt;/em&gt; takes us into the very real world of Ann Patchett’s life. Stretching from her childhood to the present day, from a disastrous early marriage to a later happy one, it covers a multitude of topics, including relationships with family and friends, and charts the hard work and joy of writing, and the unexpected thrill of opening a bookstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she shares stories of the people, places, ideals, and art to which she has remained indelibly committed, Ann Patchett brings into focus the large experiences and small moments that have shaped her as a daughter, wife, and writer.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Leaving Time &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Paige has only a few vivid memories of her mother, who abandoned her at five years old. Now, having left her father behind in Chicago for dreams of art school and marriage to an ambitious young doctor, she finds herself with a child of her own. But her mother's absence and shameful memories of her past force her to doubt whether she could ever be capable of bringing joy and meaning into the life of her child, gifts her own mother never gave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Harvesting the Heart&lt;/i&gt; is written with astonishing clarity and evocative detail, convincing in its depiction of emotional pain, love, and vulnerability, and recalls the writing of Alice Hoffman and Kristin Hannah. Out of Paige's struggle to find wholeness, Jodi Picoult crafts an absorbing novel peopled by richly drawn characters, and explores motherhood with a power and depth only she is capable of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A brilliant, moving examination of motherhood, brimming with detail and emotion.” —&lt;i&gt;Richmond Times-Dispatch&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Jodi Picoult explores the fragile ground of ambivalent motherhood in her lush second novel. This story belongs to… the lucky reader.” —&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>THE FIRST MAJOR WORK IN NEARLY A DECADE BY ONE OF THE WORLD’S GREAT THINKERS—A MARVELOUSLY CONCISE BOOK WITH NEW ANSWERS TO THE ULTIMATE QUESTIONS OF LIFE&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent “grand design” of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion—or does science offer another explanation? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meet—if only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Grand Design&lt;/i&gt; they explain that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the “top-down” approach to cosmology that Hawking and &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it, rather than that history creates us. The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the “multiverse”—the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality, posing a “model-dependent” theory of reality as the best we can hope to find. And they conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete “theory of everything.” If confirmed, they write, it will be the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, and the ultimate triumph of human reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A succinct, startling, and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems, &lt;i&gt;The Grand Design&lt;/i&gt; is a book that will inform—and provoke—like no other.'</description>

  <description>In the ten years since its publication in 1988, Stephen Hawking's classic work has become a landmark volume in scientific writing, with more than nine million copies in forty languages sold worldwide. That edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book, including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which probed back in time to within 300,000 years of the universe's beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected. Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these observations, as well as his own recent research, Professor Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book, written an entirely new chapter on wormholes and time travel, and updated the chapters throughout.</description>

  <description>Coralie Sardie is the daughter of the sinister impresario behind The Museum of Extraordinary Things, a Coney Island boardwalk freak show that thrills the masses. An exceptional swimmer, Coralie appears as the Mermaid in her father’s “museum,” alongside performers like the Wolfman, the Butterfly Girl, and a one-hundred-year-old turtle. One night Coralie stumbles upon a striking young man taking pictures of moonlit trees in the woods off the Hudson River. The dashing photographer is Eddie Cohen, a Russian immigrant who has run away from his father’s Lower East Side Orthodox community and his job as a tailor’s apprentice. When Eddie photographs the devastation on the streets of New York following the infamous Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, he becomes embroiled in the suspicious mystery behind a young woman’s disappearance and ignites the heart of Coralie.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A rollicking, globe-trotting adventure with a twist: a four-legged heroine you won't soon forget&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elsie Bovary is a cow, and a pretty happy one at that-her long, lazy days are spent eating, napping, and chatting with her best friend, Mallory. One night, Elsie and Mallory sneak out of their pasture; but while Mallory is interested in flirting with the neighboring bulls, Elsie finds herself drawn to the farmhouse. Through the window, she sees the farmer's family gathered around a bright Box God-and what the Box God reveals about something called an "industrial meat farm" shakes Elsie's understanding of her world to its core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's only one solution: escape to a better, safer world. And so a motley crew is formed: Elsie; Jerry-excuse me, Shalom-a cranky, Torah-reading pig who's recently converted to Judaism; and Tom, a suave (in his own mind, at least) turkey who can't fly, but who &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; work an iPhone with his beak. Toting stolen passports and slapdash human disguises, they head for the airport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elsie is our wise-cracking, pop-culture-reference-dropping, slyly witty narrator; Tom-who does eventually learn to fly (sort of)-dispenses psychiatric advice in a fake German accent; and Shalom, rejected by his adopted people in Jerusalem, ends up unexpectedly uniting Israelis and Palestinians. David Duchovny's charismatic creatures point the way toward a mutual understanding and acceptance that the world desperately needs.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bored with her marriage, a psychoanalyst’s wife embarks on a wild, life-changing affair&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After five years, Isadora Wing has come to a crossroads in her marriage: Should she and her husband stay together or get divorced? Accompanying her husband to an analysts’ conference in Vienna, she ditches him and strikes out on her own, crisscrossing Europe in search of a man who can inspire uninhibited passion. But, as she comes to learn, liberation and happiness are not necessarily the same thing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A literary sensation when first published in 1973, &lt;i&gt;Fear of Flying&lt;/i&gt; established Erica Jong as one of her generation’s foremost voices on sex and feminism. Nearly four decades later, the novel has lost none of its insight, verve, or jaw-dropping wit.</description>

  <description>From the best-selling author of While I Was Gone and The Senator's Wife, a superb new novel about a family and a community tested when an arsonist begins setting fire to the homes of the summer people in a small New England town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Troubled by the feeling that she belongs nowhere after working in East Africa for 15 years, Frankie Rowley has come home-home to the small New Hampshire town of Pomeroy and the farmhouse where her family has always summered. On her first night back, a house up the road burns to the ground. Is it an accident, or arson? Over the weeks that follow, as Frankie comes to recognize her father's slow failing and her mother's desperation, another house burns, and then another, always the homes of summer people. These frightening events, and the deep social fault lines that open in the town as a result, are observed and reported on by Bud Jacobs, a former political journalist, who has bought the local paper and moved to Pomeroy in an attempt to find a kind of home himself. As this compelling book unfolds, as Bud and Frankie begin an unexpected, passionate affair, arson upends a trusting small community where people have never before bothered to lock their doors; and Frankie and Bud bring wholly different perspectives to the questions of who truly owns the land, who belongs in the town, and how, or even whether, newcomers can make a real home there.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Solving the Maze was supposed to be the end. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Thomas was sure that escape from the Maze would mean freedom for him and the Gladers. But WICKED isn’t done yet. Phase Two has just begun. The Scorch. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;There are no rules. There is no help. You either make it or you die.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The Gladers have two weeks to cross through the Scorch—the most burned-out section of the world. And WICKED has made sure to adjust the variables and stack the odds against them. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Friendships will be tested. Loyalties will be broken. All bets are off. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; There are others now. Their survival depends on the Gladers’ destruction—and they’re determined to survive.</description>

  <description>In What I Had Before I Had You by Sarah Cornwell, a woman must face the truth about her past in this luminous, evocative literary novel of parents and children, guilt and forgiveness, memory and magical thinking, set in the faded, gritty world of the New Jersey Shore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olivia was only fifteen the summer she left her hometown of Ocean Vista. Two decades later, on a visit with her children, her nine-year-old son Daniel, recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, disappears. Olivia's search for him sparks tender and painful memories of her past--of her fiercely loving and secretive mother, Myla, an erratic and beautiful psychic, and the discovery of heartbreaking secrets that shattered her world.</description>

  <description>With the end of summer closing in and a steamy Labor Day weekend looming in the town of Holton Mills, New Hampshire, thirteen-year-old Henry—lonely, friendless, not too good at sports—spends most of his time watching television, reading, and daydreaming about the soft skin and budding bodies of his female classmates. For company Henry has his long-divorced mother, Adele—a onetime dancer whose summer project was to teach him how to foxtrot; his hamster, Joe; and awkward Saturday-night outings to Friendly's with his estranged father and new stepfamily. As much as he tries, Henry knows that even with his jokes and his "Husband for a Day" coupon, he still can't make his emotionally fragile mother happy. Adele has a secret that makes it hard for her to leave their house, and seems to possess an irreparably broken heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all that changes on the Thursday before Labor Day, when a mysterious bleeding man named Frank approaches Henry and asks for a hand. Over the next five days, Henry will learn some of life's most valuable lessons: how to throw a baseball, the secret to perfect piecrust, the breathless pain of jealousy, the power of betrayal, and the importance of putting others—especially those we love—above ourselves. And the knowledge that real love is worth waiting for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a manner evoking Ian McEwan's Atonement and Nick Hornby's About a Boy, acclaimed author Joyce Maynard weaves a beautiful, poignant tale of love, sex, adolescence, and devastating treachery as seen through the eyes of a young teenage boy—and the man he later becomes—looking back at an unexpected encounter that begins one single long, hot, life-altering weekend.</description>

  <description>A rookie paramedic pulls a young woman alive from her totaled car, a first rescue that begins a lifelong tangle of love and wreckage. Sheila Arsenault is a gorgeous enigma--streetwise and tough-talking, with haunted eyes, fierce desires, and a never-look-back determination. Peter Webster, as straight an arrow as they come, falls for her instantly and entirely. Soon Sheila and Peter are embroiled in an intense love affair, married, and parents to a baby daughter. Like the crash that brought them together, it all happened so fast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you ever really save another person? Eighteen years later, Sheila is long gone and Peter is raising their daughter, Rowan, alone. But Rowan is veering dangerously off track, and for the first time in their ordered existence together, Webster fears for her future. His work shows him daily every danger the world contains, how wrong everything can go in a second. All the love a father can give a daughter is suddenly not enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheila's sudden return may be a godsend--or it may be exactly the wrong moment for a lifetime of questions and anger and longing to surface anew. What tore a young family apart? Is there even worse damage ahead? The questions lifted up in Anita Shreve's utterly enthralling new novel are deep and lasting, and this is a novel that could only have been written by a master of the human heart.</description>

  <description>“What are my qualifications to write this book? None really. So why should you read it? Here’s why: I’m a little fat. If a thin guy were to write about a love of food and eating I’d highly recommend that you do not read his book.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bacon. McDonalds. Cinnabon. Hot Pockets. Kale. Stand-up comedian and author Jim Gaffigan has made his career rhapsodizing over the most treasured dishes of the American diet (“choking on bacon is like getting murdered by your lover”) and decrying the worst offenders (“kale is the early morning of foods”). Fans flocked to his New York Times bestselling book Dad is Fat to hear him riff on fatherhood but now, in his second book, he will give them what they really crave—hundreds of pages of his thoughts on all things culinary(ish). Insights such as: why he believes coconut water was invented to get people to stop drinking coconut water, why pretzel bread is #3 on his most important inventions of humankind (behind the wheel and the computer), and the answer to the age-old question “which animal is more delicious: the pig, the cow, or the bacon cheeseburger?”</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From one of our most accomplished and widely admired historians-a revelatory portrait of Benjamin Franklin's youngest sister, whose obscurity and poverty were matched only by her brother's fame and wealth but who, like him, was a passionate reader, a gifted writer, and an astonishingly shrewd political commentator.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a life that has never been examined before: that of the sister of one of the most remarkable men of their time, living unknown to the world at large, but a constant presence and influence in her brother's life through their correspondence (he wrote more letters to her than to anyone else). Making use of an astonishing cache of little-studied material, including documents, objects, and portraits only just discovered, Jill Lepore brings Jane Franklin to life in a way that illuminates not only this one extraordinary woman but an entire world. Lepore's life of Jane Franklin, with its strikingly original vantage on Benjamin Franklin, is at once a wholly different account of the founding and one of the great untold stories of American history and letters.</description>

  <description>Jossey-Bass Guides to Online Teaching and Learning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learning Online with Games, Simulations, and Virtual Worlds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strategies for Online Instruction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clark Aldrich&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learning Online with Games, Simulations, and Virtual Worlds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The infusion of games, simulations, and virtual worlds into online learning can be a transforming experience for both the instructor and the student. This practical guide, written by education game expert Clark Aldrich, shows faculty members and instructional designers how to identify opportunities for building games, simulations, and virtual environments into the curriculum; how to successfully incorporate these interactive environments to enhance student learning; and how to measure the learning outcomes. It also discusses how to build institutional support for using and financing more complex simulations. The book includes frameworks, tips, case studies and other real examples, and resources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for Learning Online with Games, Simulations, and Virtual Worlds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Clark Aldrich provides powerful insights into the dynamic arena of games, simulations, and virtual worlds in a simultaneously entertaining and serious manner as only he can. If you are involved with educating anyone, from your own children to classrooms full of students, you need to devour this book."&lt;br /&gt; -- Karl Kapp, assistant director, Institute for Interactive Technologies, Bloomsburg University&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"At a time when the technologies for e-learning are evolving faster than most people can follow, Aldrich successfully bridges the perceptual gap between virtual worlds, digital games, and educational simulations, and provides educators with all they really need to use this technology to enhance and enrich their e-learning experiences."&lt;br /&gt; -- Katrin Becker, instructor, Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, Mount Royal College, and adjunct professor of education, University of Calgary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I consider this a must-read for anyone engaged in or contemplating using these tools in their classrooms or designing their own tools."&lt;br /&gt; -- Rick Van Sant, professor of learning and technology, Ferris State University</description>

  <description>How much of an impact can an animal have? How many lives can one cat touch? How is it possible for an abandoned kitten to transform a small library, save a classic American town, and eventually become famous around the world? You can't even begin to answer those questions until you hear the charming story of Dewey Readmore Books, the beloved library cat of Spencer, Iowa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dewey's story starts in the worst possible way. Only a few weeks old, on the coldest night of the year, he was stuffed into the returned book slot at the Spencer Public Library. He was found the next working by library director Vicki Myron, a single mother who had survived the loss of her family farm, a breast cancer scare, and an alcoholic husband. Dewey won her heart, and the hearts of the staff, by pulling himself up and hobbling on frostbitten feet to nudge each of hem in a gesture of thanks and love. For the next nineteen years, he never stopped charming the people of Spencer with this enthusiasm, warmth, humility (for a cat), and, above all, his sixth sense about who needed him most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As his fame grew from town to town, then state to state, and finally, amazingly, worldwide, Dewey became more than just a friend; he became a source of pride for an extraordinary Heartland farming town pulling its way slowly back from the greatest crisis in its long history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The twins of prophecy have been divided—the end has begun.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alcatraz&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although their ally Dr. John Dee has been declared &lt;i&gt;utlaga&lt;/i&gt;, Machiavelli and Billy the Kid will follow the plans the Elders have laid before them: they will loose the monsters of Alcatraz on the city of San Francisco, thereby triggering the end of the human race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Danu Talis:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shadowrealm that Scatty and Joan of Arc have entered is far more dangerous than they could ever have imagined. And they haven't landed here by chance—the warriors were called for a reason. So were Saint-Germain, Palamedes, and Shakespeare. The group was summoned because they must travel back int time to Danu Talis to destroy it. For the island of Danu Talis, known in humani myth as the lost city of Atlantis, must fall if the modern world is to exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;San Francisco&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end is finally near. Josh Newman has chosen a side, and he will not stand with his sister, Sophie, or with the Alchemyst, Nicholas Flamel. He will fight alongside Dee and the mysterious Virginia Dare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless Sophie can find her twin before the battle begins, all is lost—forever.</description>

  <description>Michael Scott’s first-ever exclusive ebook short story delves into the world of the bestselling series The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel and offers readers a never-before-seen lost story—the story of two warriors who would become sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joan of Arc was not burned at the stake in Rouen, France in 1431. She was rescued from certain death by Scathach the Warrior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth about that day is revealed in the last will and testament of William of York, and it will leave you wondering: does Joan of Arc still walk the earth?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;San Francisco:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh and Sophie Newman are finally home. And they're both more confused than ever about their future. Neither of them has mastered the magics they'll need to protect themselves, they've lost Scatty, and they're still being pursued by Dr. John Dee. Most disturbing of all, however, is that now they must ask themselves, can they trust Nicholas Flamel? Can they trust anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alcatraz:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Dee underestimated Perenelle Flamel's power. Alcatraz could not hold her, Nereus was no match for her, and she was able to align herself with the most unlikely of allies. But she wasn't the only one being held on the island. Behind the prison's bars and protective sigils were a menagerie of monsters, and now Machiavelli has come to Alcatraz to loose them on San Francisco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perenelle might be powerful, but each day she weakens, and even with Nicholas back at her side, a battle of this size could be too much for her. Nicholas and Perenelle must fight to protect the city, but the effort will probably kill them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;London:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been unable to regain the two final pages of the Codex, Dee has failed his Elder and is now an outlaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Magician has a plan. With the Codex and the creatures on Alcatraz, he can control the world. All he needs is the help of the Archons. But for his plan to work, he must raise the Mother of the Gods from the dead. For that, he'll have to train a necromancer.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Book Three in the &lt;/i&gt;New York Times &lt;i&gt;bestselling series.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicholas Flamel's heart almost broke as he watched his beloved Paris crumble before him. The city was destroyed by Dee and Machiavelli, but Flamel played his own role in the destruction. Sophie and Josh Newman show every sign of being the twins of prophecy, and Flamel had to protect them and the pages from the Dark Elders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Nicholas grows weaker with each passing day. Perenelle is still trapped in Alcatraz, and now that Scatty has gone missing, the group is without protection. Except for Clarent—the twin sword to Excalibur. But Clarent’s power is unthinkable, its evil making it nearly impossible to use without its darkness seeping into the soul of whoever wields it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If he hopes to defeat Dee, Nicholas must find an Elder who can teach Josh and Sophie the third elemental magic—Water Magic. The problem? The only one who can do that is Gilgamesh, and he is quite, quite insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Home for Nicholas Flamel. Only this homecoming is anything but sweet. Perenelle is still locked up back in Alcatraz and Paris is teeming with enemies. Niccolo Machiavelli, immortal author and celebrated art collector, is working for Dee. He’s after them, and time is running out for Nicholas and Perenelle. For every day spent without the Book of Abraham the Mage, they age one year-their magic becoming weaker and their bodies more frail. For Flamel, the Prophecy is becoming more and more clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s time for Sophie to learn the second elemental magic: Fire Magic. And there’s only one man who can teach it to her: Flamel’s old student, the Comte de Saint-Germain-alchemist, magician, and rock star. Josh and Sophie Newman are the world’s only hope-if they don’t turn on each other first.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover edition exists &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7739134.here" title="here" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicholas Flamel was born in Paris on 28 September 1330. Nearly seven hundred years later, he is acknowledged as the greatest Alchemyst of his day. It is said that he discovered the secret of eternal life. The records show that he died in 1418. But his tomb is empty and Nicholas Flamel lives. The secret of eternal life is hidden within the book he protects - the Book of Abraham the Mage. It's the most powerful book that has ever existed. In the wrong hands, it will destroy the world. And that's exactly what Dr. John Dee plans to do when he steals it. Humankind won't know what's happening until it's too late. And if the prophecy is right, Sophie and Josh Newman are the only ones with the power to save the world as we know it. Sometimes legends are true. And Sophie and Josh Newman are about to find themselves in the middle of the greatest legend of all time.</description>

  <description>Months after the Waterless Flood pandemic has wiped out most of humanity, Toby and Ren have rescued their friend Amanda from the vicious Painballers. They return to the MaddAddamite cob house, which is being fortified against man and giant Pigoon alike. Accompanying them are the Crakers, the gentle, quasi-human species engineered by the brilliant but deceased Crake. While their reluctant prophet, Jimmy -- Crake's one-time friend -- recovers from a debilitating fever, it's left to Toby to narrate the Craker theology, with Crake as Creator. She must also deal with cultural misunderstandings, terrible coffee, and her jealousy over her lover, Zeb.&lt;br /&gt;     Meanwhile, Zeb searches for Adam One, founder of the God's Gardeners, the pacifist green religion from which Zeb broke years ago to lead the MaddAddamites in active resistance against the destructive CorpSeCorps. Now, under threat of an imminent Painballer attack, the MaddAddamites must fight back with the aid of their newfound allies, some of whom have four trotters.&lt;br /&gt;     At the centre, is the extraordinary story of Zeb's past, which involves a lost brother, a hidden murder, a bear, and a bizarre act of revenge.&lt;br /&gt;    Combining adventure, humour, romance, superb storytelling, and an imagination that is at once dazzlingly inventive and grounded in a recognizable world, &lt;i&gt;MaddAddam&lt;/i&gt; is vintage Margaret Atwood, and a moving and dramatic conclusion to her internationally celebrated dystopian trilogy.</description>

  <description>For the past five years, Hayley Kincain and her father, Andy, have been on the road, never staying long in one place as he struggles to escape the demons that have tortured him since his return from Iraq. Now they are back in the town where he grew up so Hayley can attend school. Perhaps, for the first time, Hayley can have a normal life, put aside her own painful memories, even have a relationship with Finn, the hot guy who obviously likes her but is hiding secrets of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Will being back home help Andy’s PTSD, or will his terrible memories drag him to the edge of hell, and drugs push him over? &lt;i&gt;The Impossible Knife of Memory&lt;/i&gt; is Laurie Halse Anderson at her finest: compelling, surprising, and impossible to put down.</description>

  <description>One recent December, at age 53, John Kralik found his life at a terrible, frightening low: his small law firm was failing; he was struggling through a painful second divorce; he had grown distant from his two older children and was afraid he might lose contact with his young daughter; he was living in a tiny apartment where he froze in the winter and baked in the summer; he was 40 pounds overweight; his girlfriend had just broken up with him; and overall, his dearest life dreams--including hopes of upholding idealistic legal principles and of becoming a judge--seemed to have slipped beyond his reach. Then, during a desperate walk in the hills on New Year's Day, John was struck by the belief that his life might become at least tolerable if, instead of focusing on what he didn't have, he could find some way to be grateful for what he had. Inspired by a beautiful, simple note his ex-girlfriend had sent to thank him for his Christmas gift, John imagined that he might find a way to feel grateful by writing thank-you notes. To keep himself going, he set himself a goal--come what may--of writing 365 thank-you notes in the coming year. One by one, day after day, he began to handwrite thank yous--for gifts or kindnesses he'd received from loved ones and coworkers, from past business associates and current foes, from college friends and doctors and store clerks and handymen and neighbors, and anyone, really, absolutely anyone, who'd done him a good turn, however large or small. Immediately after he'd sent his very first notes, significant and surprising benefits began to come John's way--from financial gain to true friendship, from weight loss to inner peace. While John wrote his notes, the economy collapsed, the bank across the street from his office failed, but thank-you note by thank-you note, John's whole life turned around. &lt;em&gt;365 Thank Yous&lt;/em&gt; is a rare memoir: its touching, immediately accessible message--and benefits--come to readers from the plainspoken storytelling of an ordinary man. Kralik sets a believable, doable example of how to live a miraculously good life. To read &lt;em&gt;365 Thank Yous&lt;/em&gt; is to be changed.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Reconstructing Amelia&lt;/i&gt;, the stunning debut novel from Kimberly McCreight, Kate's in the middle of the biggest meeting of her career when she gets the telephone call from Grace Hall, her daughter’s exclusive private school in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Amelia has been suspended, effective immediately, and Kate must come get her daughter—now. But Kate’s stress over leaving work quickly turns to panic when she arrives at the school and finds it surrounded by police officers, fire trucks, and an ambulance. By then it’s already too late for Amelia. And for Kate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An academic overachiever despondent over getting caught cheating has jumped to her death. At least that’s the story Grace Hall tells Kate. And clouded as she is by her guilt and grief, it is the one she forces herself to believe. Until she gets an anonymous text: She didn’t jump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reconstructing Amelia&lt;/i&gt; is about secret first loves, old friendships, and an all-girls club steeped in tradition. But, most of all, it’s the story of how far a mother will go to vindicate the memory of a daughter whose life she couldn’t save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of Gillian Flynn's &lt;i&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/i&gt; will find &lt;i&gt;Reconstructing Amelia&lt;/i&gt; just as gripping and surprising.</description>

  <description>Do you ever really know your mother, your daughter, the people in your family? In this rich and rewarding new novel by the beloved bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Talk Before Sleep&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Pull of the Moon&lt;/i&gt;, a reunion between two sisters and their mother reveals how the secrets and complexities of the past have shaped the lives of the women in a family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ginny Young is on a plane, en route to see her mother, whom she hasn't seen or spoken to for thirty-five years. She thinks back to the summer of 1958, when she and her sister, Sharla, were young girls. At that time, a series of dramatic events--beginning with the arrival of a mysterious and sensual next-door neighbor--divided the family, separating the sisters from their mother. Moving back and forth in time between the girl she once was and the woman she's become, Ginny at last confronts painful choices that occur in almost any woman's life, and learns surprising truths about the people she thought she knew best. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emotional honesty and a true understanding of people and relationships are combined in this moving and deeply satisfying new book by the novelist who "writes with humor and a big heart about resilience, love and hope. And the transcendence that redeems" (Andre Dubus).</description>

  <description>Follow Gregor in the fourth enthralling adventure in Suzanne Collins' New York Times bestselling Underland Chronicles -- with gorgeous new cover art coming July 1st! &lt;br /&gt;In Book 4 of the bestselling Underland Chronicles, Gregor is drawn ever deeper into a brewing crisis. For generations, rats have run the mice out of whatever lands they've claimed, keeping them constantly on the move. But now the mice are disappearing and the young queen Luxa is determined to find out why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gregor and Boots join Luxa on a simple fact-finding mission. But when the true fate of the mice is revealed, it is something far more sinister than they had imagined -- and it points the way to the final prophecy Gregor has yet to fulfill. His abilities are put to the test in this suspenseful, action-packed penultimate installment of Suzanne Collins's thrilling Underland Chronicles.</description>

  <description>This eerie tale of psychological horror sees the real inhabitants of turn-of-the-century Princeton fall under the influence of a supernatural power. New Jersey, 1905: soon-to-be commander-in-chief Woodrow Wilson is president of Princeton University. On a nearby farm, Socialist author Upton Sinclair, enjoying the success of his novel &lt;i&gt;The Jungle,&lt;/i&gt; has taken up residence with his family. This is a quiet, bookish community - elite, intellectual and indisputably privileged. But when a savage lynching in a nearby town is hushed up, a horrifying chain of events is initiated - until it becomes apparent that the families of Princeton have been beset by a powerful curse. The Devil has come to this little town and not a soul will be spared. 'The Accursed' marks new territory for the masterful Joyce Carol Oates - narrated with her unmistakable psychological insight, it combines beautifully transporting historical detail with chilling fantastical elements to stunning effect.</description>

  <description>Hailed for its coiled eroticism and the moral claims it makes upon the reader, this mesmerizing novel is a story of love and secrets, horror and compassion, unfolding against the haunted landscape of postwar Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he falls ill on his way home from school, fifteen-year-old Michael Berg is rescued by Hanna, a woman twice his age. In time she becomes his lover—then she inexplicably disappears. When Michael next sees her, he is a young law student, and she is on trial for a hideous crime. As he watches her refuse to defend her innocence, Michael gradually realizes that Hanna may be guarding a secret she considers more shameful than murder.</description>

  <description>Burning Bright follows the Kellaway family as they leave behind tragedy in rural Dorset and come to late 18th-century London. As they move in next door to the radical painter/poet William Blake, and take up work for a near-by circus impresario, the youngest family member gets to know a girl his age. Embodying opposite characteristics — Maggie Butterfield is a dark-haired, streetwise extrovert, Jem Kellaway a quiet blond introvert — the children form a strong bond while getting to know their unusual neighbor and his wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set against the backdrop of a city nervous of the revolution gone sour across the Channel in France, &lt;i&gt;Burning Bright&lt;/i&gt; explores the states of innocence and experience just as Blake takes on similar themes in his best-known poems, Songs of Innocence and of Experience.</description>

  <description>Winner of the 2000 Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Discover Great New Writers Award! Alex Award winner! Tracy Chevalier transports readers to a bygone time and place in this richly imagined portrait of the young woman who inspired one of Vermeer's most celebrated paintings. History and fiction merge seamlessly in this luminous novel about artistic vision and sensual awakening. Girl with a Pearl Earring tells the story of sixteen-year-old Griet, whose life is transformed by her brief encounter with genius...even as she herself is immortalized in canvas and oil.</description>

  <description>The action and adventure continue for Gregor in this stunning fantasy from Suzanne Collins, bestselling author of the Hunger Games. New cover art coming July 1st! &lt;br /&gt;Gregor swears he will never return to the Underland, that strange world below New York City. But he is a key player in another prophecy, this one about an ominous white rat called the Bane. The Underlanders know there is only one way to lure Gregor back to their world: by kidnapping his little sister, Boots.&lt;br /&gt;Now Gregor's quest reunites him with his bat, Ares, and the rebellious princess Luxa. They descend into the dangerous Waterway in search of the Bane. If Gregor does not fulfill the prophecy, his life, and the Underland, will never be the same.</description>

      <![CDATA[Well, almost finished. I was listening to the audio CD of the book and the last two tracks of the last CD are scratched and won't work in the car or computer. I'm getting the book today to finish what is probably 1/2 of a chapter at most. Great book and looking forward to the rest in the series.]]>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;This irresistible first novel tells the story of a quiet boy who embarks on a dangerous quest in order to fulfill his destiny—and find his father—in a strange world beneath New York City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Gregor falls through a grate in the laundry room of his apartment building, he hurtles into the dark Underland, where spiders, rats, cockroaches coexist uneasily with humans. This world is on the brink of war, and Gregor's arrival is no accident. A prophecy foretells that Gregor has a role to play in the Underland's uncertain future. Gregor wants no part of it -- until he realizes it's the only way to solve the mystery of his father's disappearance. Reluctantly, Gregor embarks on a dangerous adventure that will change both him and the Underland forever.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>From Lisa Tucker, the critically acclaimed author of "Once Upon a Day" and "The Song Reader," comes an extraordinary novel about the way we live now: the choices we make and the decisions we let life make for us.Matthew and Amelia were once in love and planning to raise a family together, but a decade later, they have become professional enemies. To Amelia, who has dedicated her life to medical ethics, Matthew's job as a high-powered pharmaceutical executive has turned him into a heartless person who doesn't care about anything but money. Now they're kept in balance only by Matthew's best and oldest friend, Ben, a rising science superstar -- and Amelia's new boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That balance begins to crumble one night when, coming home to his upscale Philadelphia loft, Matthew finds himself on a desolate bridge face-to-face with a boy screaming for help. Homeless for most of his life, ten-year-old Danny is as streetwise as he is world-weary, and his desperation to save his three-year-old sister means he will do whatever it takes to get Matthew's help. What follows is an escalating game of one-upmanship between Matthew, Amelia, and Danny, as all three players struggle to defend what is most important to them -- and are ultimately forced to reconsider what they truly want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dazzlingly written with a riveting story that will resonate with readers everywhere, Lisa Tucker's "The Cure for Modern Life" is a smart, humorous, big-hearted novel about what it means in the twenty-first century to be responsible, to care about other people, and to do the right thing.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this fable, the first man on earth to count the hours becomes Father Time.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inventor of the world's first clock is punished for trying to measure God's greatest gift. He is banished to a cave for centuries and forced to listen to the voices of all who come after him seeking more days, more years. Eventually, with his soul nearly broken, Father Time is granted his freedom, along with a magical hourglass and a mission: a chance to redeem himself by teaching two earthly people the true meaning of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He returns to our world - now dominated by the hour-counting he so innocently began - and commences a journey with two unlikely partners: one a teenage girl who is about to give up on life, the other a wealthy old businessman who wants to live forever. To save himself, he must save them both. And stop the world to do so.</description>

  <description>The year 1984 has come and gone, but George Orwell's prophetic, nightmarish vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is timelier than ever. &lt;i&gt;1984&lt;/i&gt; is still the great modern classic of "negative utopia"—a startlingly original and haunting novel that creates an imaginary world that is completely convincing, from the first sentence to the last four words. No one can deny the novel's hold on the imaginations of whole generations, or the power of its admonitions—a power that seems to grow, not lessen, with the passage of time.</description>

  <description>The hero-narrator of &lt;i&gt;The Catcher in the Rye&lt;/i&gt; is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt;'s 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.</description>

  <description>The Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression, a book that galvanized—and sometimes outraged—millions of readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First published in 1939, Steinbeck’s Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression chronicles the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and tells the story of one Oklahoma farm family, the Joads—driven from their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man’s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman’s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck’s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics.</description>

  <description>The compelling story of two outsiders striving to find their place in an unforgiving world. Drifters in search of work, George and his simple-minded friend Lennie have nothing in the world except each other and a dream--a dream that one day they will have some land of their own. Eventually they find work on a ranch in California’s Salinas Valley, but their hopes are doomed as Lennie, struggling against extreme cruelty, misunderstanding and feelings of jealousy, becomes a victim of his own strength. Tackling universal themes such as the friendship of a shared vision, and giving voice to America’s lonely and dispossessed, &lt;i&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/i&gt; has proved one of Steinbeck’s most popular works, achieving success as a novel, a Broadway play and three acclaimed films.</description>

  <description>When suburban Claudia Kincaid decides to run away, she knows she doesn’t just want to run from somewhere, she wants to run to somewhere — to a place that is comfortable, beautiful, and, preferably, elegant. She chooses the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Knowing her younger brother Jamie has money and thus can help her with a serious cash-flow problem, she invites him along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once settled into the museum, Claudia and Jamie find themselves caught up in the mystery of an angel statue that the museum purchased at auction for a bargain price of $225. The statue is possibly an early work of the Renaissance master, Michelangelo, and therefore worth millions. Is it? Or isn’t it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claudia is determined to find out. Her quest leads her to Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, the remarkable old woman who sold the statue, and to some equally remarkable discoveries about herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Delve into &lt;i&gt;The Scarlet Letter&lt;/i&gt;, Nathaniel Hawthorne's meditation on human alienation and its effect on the soul in this story set in seventeenth-century Massachusetts and be dazzled by literature.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In Nathaniel Hawthorne's dark novel, &lt;i&gt;The Scarlet Letter&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;a single sinful act ruins the lives of three people&lt;/b&gt;. None more so than Hester Prynne, a young, beautiful, and dignified woman, who conceived a child out of wedlock and receives the public punishment of having to always wear &lt;b&gt;a scarlet "A" on her clothing&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; She refuses to reveal the father of her child, which could lighten her sentence. Her husband, the aptly-named Roger Chillingworth, who Hester thought had died in a shipwreck but was actually being held captive by Native Americans, &lt;b&gt;arrives at the exact moment&lt;/b&gt; of her deepest public shaming and vows to get &lt;b&gt;revenge&lt;/b&gt;. Her lover, Arthur Dimmesdale, remains safely unidentified, but is wracked with guilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Though originally published in 1850, the story is &lt;b&gt;set in seventeenth-century Massachusetts&lt;/b&gt; among Hawthorne's Puritan ancestors. In &lt;i&gt;The Scarlet Letter&lt;/i&gt;, he created a story that &lt;b&gt;highlighted both their weaknesses and their strengths&lt;/b&gt;. His knowledge of their beliefs and his admiration for their way of life was balanced by his concerns about their rigid and oppressive rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Complete and unabridged&lt;/b&gt;, this elegantly designed, clothbound edition features an elastic closure and a new introduction by Mike Lee Davis.</description>

  <description>Eleven-year-old Owen Meany, playing in a Little League baseball game in Gravesend, New Hampshire, hits a foul ball and kills his best friend's mother. Owen doesn't believe in accidents; he believes he is God's instrument. What happens to Owen after that 1953 foul is both extraordinary and terrifying. At moments a comic, self-deluded victim, but in the end the principal, tragic actor in a divine plan, Owen Meany is the most heartbreaking hero John Irving has yet created.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;You can find an alternative cover edition for this ISBN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33805355-dracula" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34810834-dracula" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A rich selection of background and source materials is provided in three areas: Contexts includes probable inspirations for Dracula in the earlier works of James Malcolm Rymer and Emily Gerard. Also included are a discussion of Stoker's working notes for the novel and "Dracula's Guest," the original opening chapter to Dracula. Reviews and Reactions reprints five early reviews of the novel. "Dramatic and Film Variations" focuses on theater and film adaptations of Dracula, two indications of the novel's unwavering appeal. David J. Skal, Gregory A. Waller, and Nina Auerbach offer their varied perspectives. Checklists of both dramatic and film adaptations are included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Criticism collects seven theoretical interpretations of Dracula by Phyllis A. Roth, Carol A. Senf, Franco Moretti, Christopher Craft, Bram Dijkstra, Stephen D. Arata, and Talia Schaffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Chronology and a Selected Bibliography are included.</description>

  <description>In what may be Dickens's best novel, humble, orphaned Pip is apprenticed to the dirty work of the forge but dares to dream of becoming a gentleman — and one day, under sudden and enigmatic circumstances, he finds himself in possession of "great expectations." In this gripping tale of crime and guilt, revenge and reward, the compelling characters include Magwitch, the fearful and fearsome convict; Estella, whose beauty is excelled only by her haughtiness; and the embittered Miss Havisham, an eccentric jilted bride.</description>

  <description>The last novel Ernest Hemingway saw published, The Old Man and the Sea has proved itself to be one of the enduring works of American fiction. It is the story of an old Cuban fisherman and his supreme ordeal: a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. Using the simple, powerful language of a fable, Hemingway takes the timeless themes of courage in the face of defeat and personal triumph won from loss and transforms them into a magnificent twentieth-century classic.</description>

  <description>A literary sensation and runaway bestseller, this brilliant debut novel presents with seamless authenticity and exquisite lyricism the true confessions of one of Japan's most celebrated geisha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Memoirs of a Geisha&lt;/i&gt;, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion. It is a unique and triumphant work of fiction - at once romantic, erotic, suspenseful - and completely unforgettable.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;This is an adaptation. For the editions of the original book, see &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6324090-alice-s-adventures-in-wonderland" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (commonly shortened to Alice in Wonderland) is an 1865 novel written by English mathematician Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells of a girl named Alice falling through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children. It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre. Its narrative course and structure, characters and imagery have been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working as a lady's companion, the heroine of &lt;i&gt;Rebecca&lt;/i&gt; learns her place. Her future looks bleak until, on a trip to the South of France, she meets Max de Winter, a handsome widower whose sudden proposal of marriage takes her by surprise. She accepts, but whisked from glamorous Monte Carlo to the ominous and brooding Manderley, the new Mrs de Winter finds Max a changed man. And the memory of his dead wife Rebecca is forever kept alive by the forbidding housekeeper, Mrs Danvers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not since Jane Eyre has a heroine faced such difficulty with the Other Woman. An international bestseller that has never gone out of print, &lt;i&gt;Rebecca&lt;/i&gt; is the haunting story of a young girl consumed by love and the struggle to find her identity.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/i&gt; is a classic. With over a million copies sold in the UK alone, it is hailed as one of the all-time 'greats' of literature, inspiring generations of readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in the deep American South between the wars, it is the tale of Celie, a young black girl born into poverty and segregation. Raped repeatedly by the man she calls 'father', she has two children taken away from her, is separated from her beloved sister Nettie and is trapped into an ugly marriage. But then she meets the glamorous Shug Avery, singer and magic-maker - a woman who has taken charge of her own destiny. Gradually, Celie discovers the power and joy of her own spirit, freeing her from her past and reuniting her with those she loves.</description>

  <description>The beloved American classic about a young girl's coming-of-age at the turn of the century, Betty Smith's &lt;i&gt;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&lt;/i&gt; is a poignant and moving tale filled with compassion and cruelty, laughter and heartache, crowded with life and people and incident. The story of young, sensitive, and idealistic Francie Nolan and her bittersweet formative years in the slums of Williamsburg has enchanted and inspired millions of readers for more than sixty years. By turns overwhelming, sublime, heartbreaking, and uplifting, the daily experiences of the unforgettable Nolans are raw with honesty and tenderly threaded with family connectedness -- in a work of literary art that brilliantly captures a unique time and place as well as incredibly rich moments of universal experience.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;You can find the redesigned cover of this edition &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30231339-wuthering-heights" rel="nofollow"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This best-selling Norton Critical Edition is based on the 1847 first edition of the novel. For the Fourth Edition, the editor has collated the 1847 text with several modern editions and has corrected a number of variants, including accidentals. The text is accompanied by entirely new explanatory annotations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New to the fourth Edition are twelve of Emily Bronte's letters regarding the publication of the 1847 edition of Wuthering Heights as well as the evolution of the 1850 edition, prose and poetry selections by the author, four reviews of the novel, and poetry selections by the author, four reviews of the novel, and Edward Chitham's insightful and informative chronology of the creative process behind the beloved work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five major critical interpretations of Wuthering Heights are included, three of them new to the Fourth Edition. A Stuart Daley considers the importance of chronology in the novel. J. Hillis Miller examines Wuthering Heights's problems of genre and critical reputation. Sandra M. Gilbert assesses the role of Victorian Christianity plays in the novel, while Martha Nussbaum traces the novel's romanticism. Finally, Lin Haire-Sargeant scrutinizes the role of Heathcliff in film adaptations of Wuthering Heights. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Chronology and updated Selected Bibliography are also included.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Mary Shelley&lt;/b&gt; began writing &lt;i&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/i&gt; when she was only eighteen. At once a Gothic thriller, a passionate romance, and a cautionary tale about the dangers of science, &lt;i&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of committed science student Victor Frankenstein. Obsessed with discovering the cause of generation and life and bestowing animation upon lifeless matter, Frankenstein assembles a human being from stolen body parts but; upon bringing it to life, he recoils in horror at the creature's hideousness. Tormented by isolation and loneliness, the once-innocent creature turns to evil and unleashes a campaign of murderous revenge against his creator, Frankenstein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/i&gt;, an instant bestseller and an important ancestor of both the horror and science fiction genres, not only tells a terrifying story, but also raises profound, disturbing questions about the very nature of life and the place of humankind within the cosmos: What does it mean to be human? What responsibilities do we have to each other? How far can we go in tampering with Nature? In our age, filled with news of organ donation genetic engineering, and bio-terrorism, these questions are more relevant than ever.</description>

  <description>As soon as Anne Shirley arrives at the snug white farmhouse called Green Gables, she is sure she wants to stay forever . . . but will the Cuthberts send her back to to the orphanage? Anne knows she's not what they expected—a skinny girl with fiery red hair and a temper to match. If only she can convince them to let her stay, she'll try very hard not to keep rushing headlong into scrapes and blurting out the first thing that comes to her mind. Anne is not like anyone else, the Cuthberts agree; she is special—a girl with an enormous imagination. This orphan girl dreams of the day when she can call herself Anne of Green Gables.</description>

  <description>One night on the heath, the brave and respected general Macbeth encounters three witches who foretell that he will become king of Scotland. At first sceptical, he’s urged on by the ruthless, single-minded ambitions of Lady Macbeth, who suffers none of her husband’s doubt. But seeing the prophecy through to the bloody end leads them both spiralling into paranoia, tyranny, madness, and murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shocking tragedy - a violent caution to those seeking power for its own sake - is, to this day, one of Shakespeare’s most popular and influential masterpieces.</description>

  <description>Among Shakespeare's plays, "Hamlet" is considered by many his masterpiece. Among actors, the role of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, is considered the jewel in the crown of a triumphant theatrical career. Now Kenneth Branagh plays the leading role and co-directs a brillant ensemble performance. Three generations of legendary leading actors, many of whom first assembled for the Oscar-winning film "Henry V", gather here to perform the rarely heard complete version of the play. This clear, subtly nuanced, stunning dramatization, presented by The Renaissance Theatre Company in association with "Bbc" Broadcasting, features such luminaries as Sir John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, Emma Thompson and Christopher Ravenscroft. It combines a full cast with stirring music and sound effects to bring this magnificent Shakespearen classic vividly to life. Revealing new riches with each listening, this production of "Hamlet" is an invaluable aid for students, teachers and all true lovers of Shakespeare - a recording to be treasured for decades to come.</description>

  <description>This beloved book by E. B. White, author of Stuart Little and The Trumpet of the Swan, is a classic of children's literature that is "just about perfect." This high-quality paperback features vibrant illustrations colorized by Rosemary Wells!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Pig. Humble. Radiant. These are the words in Charlotte's Web, high up in Zuckerman's barn. Charlotte's spiderweb tells of her feelings for a little pig named Wilbur, who simply wants a friend. They also express the love of a girl named Fern, who saved Wilbur's life when he was born the runt of his litter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E. B. White's Newbery Honor Book is a tender novel of friendship, love, life, and death that will continue to be enjoyed by generations to come. This edition contains newly color illustrations by Garth Williams, the acclaimed illustrator of E. B. White's Stuart Little and Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House series, among many other books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--harpercollins.com</description>
