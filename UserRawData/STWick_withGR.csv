2015-10-07 14:32:56,@Beester_02 In case you were wondering....neither was fun at all. Not one bit. I don't recommend either.
2015-10-07 14:31:27,@Beester_02 Yep.
2015-10-07 14:30:45,@Beester_02 Sorry to hear your career as a professional pole dancer was cut short. At least you were able to shimmy into your current job.
2015-10-07 14:28:27,"@Beester_02 yeah....Did that with my Achilles tendon and appendix instead. Fortunately, not at the same time. 😀"
2015-10-07 14:25:45,@Beester_02 Experienced that for a while...sorry to hear about the severity of your back.
2015-10-07 14:20:38,@Beester_02 Yeah. Happened 16 years ago. Feeling really good now though.
2015-10-07 14:18:16,@Beester_02 Ahhhh. And I thought I'd been rough with my body. Dude! I think you need more bubble wrap!
2015-10-07 14:16:21,"@Beester_02 That does sound like fun....but then, you do know how to have fun."
2015-10-07 14:14:47,@Beester_02 I've had a herniated disc and tendon damage but I found rowing feels good on my back. Guessing results would vary though.
2015-10-07 14:13:08,"@Beester_02 It is a great overall exercise, but yeah, you'd probably want to check with a doctor if you have medical issues."
2015-10-07 14:05:26,"@Beester_02 Sorry. With the meds I'm on, you probably don't want my blood anyway... 😀"

2015-10-07 03:13:04,"@Beester_02 And yes, though they lost, they loved playing and want to play again. 😀"
2015-10-07 03:11:20,@Beester_02 They can't learn if I don't play the game right.
2015-10-07 03:10:47,@Beester_02 I want them to learn. Learn to win. Learn from losing. Already they were working out new strategies.
2015-10-07 03:03:04,"@Beester_02 It took a bit, but I ended up conquering the entire world. Next game I'm sure will be much harder. They're quick learners. 😀"
2015-10-07 03:00:46,"@Beester_02 yeah. By the time they decided to gang up on me, I had just over half the world conquered...and enough armies to hold them off."
2015-10-07 02:32:59,@Beester_02 So this wasn't a typical case?
2015-10-07 02:29:45,@Beester_02 I hope you have a chance to relax this evening. I finished a game of Risk with the kids. Watching AL Wild Card game right now.
2015-10-07 02:23:18,@Beester_02 are you working on it tonight or is that tomorrow's work?
2015-10-07 02:17:10,@Beester_02 Sounds like a stressful job...

2015-10-07 02:11:32,@Beester_02 I'm guessing it was better than yours.

2015-10-06 21:20:07,@Mark__Lawrence And I wonder if it's in part more language usage/ slang rather than actual author's home country.

2015-10-06 21:01:28,@Mark__Lawrence have even heard some readers prefer authors from certain countries (I don't understand that one).
2015-10-06 21:00:08,"@Mark__Lawrence perhaps authors are more well known in home country, publicity greater in home country, book signings, author visits etc.."
2015-10-06 20:50:44,@G_R_Matthews yep.

2015-10-06 20:43:53,@G_R_Matthews thanks. I figured you might be busy with top 10. I was happy to be honorable mention for SPFBO. Met lots of great new authors.
2015-10-06 20:41:32,"@G_R_Matthews @Mark__Lawrence I've had more US sales, with UK second, though Australia makes a good showing."
