2011-12-22 23:49:26,"@shaun_wilkinson if leo really was pushing erik out because he was threatened, so what? can you blame him? his show was just like leos."
2011-12-22 23:46:40,@torontomario lol ya seriously. its not professional at all the create a montage video against your old boss lol. be an adult and move on
2011-12-22 23:45:45,@shaun_wilkinson yes i did watch it all. i saw a boss praising an employee who was trying something new and doing good at it. thats all.

2011-12-22 23:40:25,@shaun_wilkinson i know what you mean. but lets b honest. erik was not that good. his show was ok. but he wasnt going anywhere
2011-12-22 23:39:44,@shaun_wilkinson ya its deff more complicated than we know. who knows what really goes on there. but i dont think erik was a real threat.
2011-12-22 23:32:27,"@shaun_wilkinson i just commented on eriks new vid, suggesting to refrain from those types of vids, and he blocked me lol wth is that about."
2011-12-22 23:29:29,@shaun_wilkinson ya true. his show was good. but i'm worried he let leo's praise get to his head. he's fresh in the game compared to some
