2014-04-26 07:22:00,@tom_marzipan I thought the point of castle's  character is that he hasn't actually grown up!
2014-04-25 22:20:09,@tom_marzipan I thought the writing was pretty good in s4 and made up for all loss of chemistry between main two. Might need a break soon.
2014-04-25 21:58:09,@tom_marzipan Plus nothing beats the SPN convention episode. SPN does self-referential better than anyone else!
