2012-03-26 18:53:01,Just finished Uncharted Drake's Fortune. Found 25 out of 60 treaures. Ending was traumatizing. I do not want to go back to find more treaure
2012-03-26 00:39:05,James Cameron reaches an all time low &amp; Mad Men might reach an all time high. Now I know how extremophiles feel. @MadMen @JimCameron
2012-03-25 22:50:30,At Part 15 of Uncharted Drake's Fortune &amp; the game's become sadly predictable. Luckily Mad Men in a little over two hours. Can you dig it?
2012-03-24 21:40:20,Finally found Elena! Those coconut chocolae chip cookies did their job. But who the heck is Eddy? I need more coconut chocolate cookies!!!!!

2012-03-24 16:36:20,Told Ira if he got only A's he'd get a PS3. He did it so we're in a Drakeathon. 1st time bribery has ever worked on him! it's a game changer

2012-02-26 21:03:31,"@MythPhD The other movies I saw were very labored in parts, but Midnight flowed thru out & I was expecting Midnight to be the most labored!"
2012-02-26 07:34:38,"And the winner is.. definitely Midnight in Paris - it was delightful, witty, clever, and very canny. Did I mention it's hilarious in parts?"
2012-02-26 05:03:17,The Artist was quite fun. Main actor very charismatic. And happy ending is a plus with this bunch of films. Now on to Woody Allen land.
2012-02-26 03:10:49,Still traumatized by the dinner. It was truly bad. Waiting for The Artist. Ending with Woody Allen is starting to look better and better

2012-02-25 23:57:02,Next is Extremely Loud. So far Hugo as fan fiction vs Help's racism as character flaw -- Help wins
2012-02-25 21:20:29,Got my popcorn! The help starts in two minutes. Hugo was all about the Georges.
2012-02-25 18:57:41,About to start 12 hr movie marathon. Hugo is first. I was advised to do popcorn during the 2nd movie.

2009-07-05 01:01:50,Watching V (always go for something resistancy July 4th; last year RiffTrax Independence Day). Metaphors are too clunky but gotta love Diana

2009-04-16 02:37:46,@ChrisBoese The two are traditionally divided...don't blame me I'm just the messenger. FYI I do not distinguish between terror and crime
2009-04-15 12:19:26,@ChrisBoese I thought a terrorist is political (fighting for a cause) and a pirate is economic (trying to make a buck).
