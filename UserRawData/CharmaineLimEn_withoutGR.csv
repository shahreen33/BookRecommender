2016-08-18 12:37:41,@BiancaHabana hahaha probably cause I'm 19 and single with no history of dating
2016-08-18 12:20:46,@BiancaHabana it seems like many people are lowkey invested in my love life
2016-08-18 03:08:47,Really want to sleep because I'm tired but I also want to stay up to talk to my BGF
2016-08-18 01:57:55,Looking for new phone cases for my new phone and I'm realizing how difficult it is to only choose one
2016-08-18 00:50:53,I've been super tired lately and I think it's cause I've been socializing with our host. I'm not used to this much talking on a normal day
2016-08-17 22:30:30,And overheard my mom's friend talking about me having an arranged marriage for reasons unknown
2016-08-17 22:30:01,"Been told that my future boyfriend needs to bring me to Venice because gondola rides are romantic, had my relationship status questioned"
2016-08-17 22:29:09,"So far today, I've been escorted to the dining table in a really formal fashion, arms links and all"
2016-08-17 17:32:48,There are no Pokemon near me and I'm sad
2016-08-17 15:59:22,"Okay, but the real couple goal in life should be to look as happy as puppies do when they see each other. That's love in the purest form"

2016-08-17 14:17:14,I'm literally sitting in one of the most perfect reading/writing spots ever https://t.co/hJM6KgiJUj
2016-08-17 03:01:17,One of the things I really have to do tomorrow is continue/finish reading the book I need to finish before school starts
2016-08-17 02:57:52,"I'm so tired, and it's just barely 11pm. Probs gonna pass out in the next hour or so"
2016-08-16 21:51:08,"Stuck on the train. There's some kind of delay, but no one knows what it is. Yay! Not like we're already 1 hour late"
2016-08-16 18:14:35,When you suddenly revisit an old friendship that didn't end well and both of you are unsure of how much good this does
2016-08-16 12:45:33,Why is it that I dreamt about cutting my hair last night?
2016-08-16 04:46:42,@BiancaHabana I love sleeping puppies
2016-08-16 03:53:11,"My skin is like ""Nope"" about me being in the US. So far, I've broken out pretty badly"
2016-08-16 03:22:32,I'm super tired and so ready for bed. I haven't even done anything interesting today

2016-08-15 04:41:37,"Also, I'm still so behind on my Watch Later list. I have yet to watch videos that were uploaded in April/May HAHAHAHAHAHA"

2016-08-15 02:10:16,HAHAHAHAHA I'm so bad with technology. My BGF and I don't know how to text each other now that I have a new Whatsapp number
2016-08-15 02:01:15,@BiancaHabana I never even finished my first glass of champagne
2016-08-14 23:50:13,When you walk so much in 4 hours that you hatch your 5km Pokemon egg that was at 3.7km previously
2016-08-14 22:53:15,The problem with being in a different time zone from my best friends is having to wait for them to wake up to respond to my texts/Snaps
2016-08-14 20:04:37,Has been a pretty good day in New York so far. I already caught 4 new Pokemon
2016-08-14 19:01:15,"@BiancaHabana ahahaha I don't like champagne. Never tried beer, but Hayden said it was similar to that weird sparkling coffee"
2016-08-14 19:00:17,@BiancaHabana wow dude your tolerance is significantly higher than mine
2016-08-14 13:53:02,"@BiancaHabana what kind? So far, all I know is I don't like champagne, but I like cider"
2016-08-14 13:45:55,@BiancaHabana omg what? You tried alcohol?
2016-08-14 13:43:44,"@BiancaHabana interestingly, none of them were white. All the white guys weren't that cute"
2016-08-14 13:42:23,"@BiancaHabana it's okay, I think one of those guys might not have been straight AHAHAHAHAA"
2016-08-14 13:41:23,When you wake up to 80 Whatsapp messages and 72 are from the guy you like üòè

2016-08-14 02:01:25,@BiancaHabana bruh I AM single watchu talking about?
2016-08-14 01:57:22,I think it's cute when a guy admits to putting more effort into his appearance in order to impress you
2016-08-14 01:56:23,Tfw one of your best friends says your letter is perhaps the most special piece of writing he's ever received
2016-08-14 01:54:54,I've been separated from my best friends for 24 hours and it's already so difficult for me to accept that I have 9 more months to go
2016-08-14 01:53:27,@BiancaHabana AHAHAHAHAHA dude why are we even allowed on the Internet?
2016-08-14 00:53:26,"@BiancaHabana yeah, dude, I don't know how other people separate from their friends so easily. How did last year's seniors do this?"
2016-08-13 23:17:26,@BiancaHabana basically when we live together https://t.co/UKBQDsYd4A
2016-08-13 23:15:21,@BiancaHabana I miss you https://t.co/uvTcNNvmoi
2016-08-12 22:50:31,"I'm gonna cry so much today, I might not have enough tears in me"
2016-08-12 22:18:25,How the heck am I supposed to say goodbye to the people I've been closest to for the past 3-6 years? How is that even possible?
2016-08-12 22:17:38,@BiancaHabana this might make us both feel a little better https://t.co/MshPzQiKrp
2016-08-12 22:16:51,@BiancaHabana I totally know the feeling
2016-08-12 09:44:36,Heading to see some of my friends for the last time in a year. Not ready for this. I'm lowkey nervous and scared

2016-08-11 17:29:13,"Okay, I've written 3 letters so far. I could probably squeeze in another one before I go to bed"
2016-08-11 17:04:07,I've been writing goodbye letters for the past 4 hours. Someone help me before I get too emotional and down in a puddle of my own tears

2016-08-10 16:54:11,Cue me talking about romance for an hour
2016-08-10 16:53:50,"Turns out that guys assume I don't like romance or romantic things because of my straightforward, blunt, practical personality"
2016-08-10 16:51:41,@BiancaHabana ahahaha it got mine wrong
2016-08-09 19:06:54,"I mean, I could push through it, but it would be around 5:00-5:30AM by the time I finish and I can't afford that. Not right now"
2016-08-09 19:06:10,Sleep has won. I'm gonna wake up early to finish the last 139 pages instead. I'm currently at the point where the story stopped making sense

2016-08-09 06:56:24,I actually quite like the new Goodreads layout. It does feel easier to use

2016-08-08 18:07:09,"I'm suddenly inspired to write something, but I don't know exactly what. All I know is that it's contemporary/romance"

2016-08-06 15:00:36,I sometimes say really random stuff when I'm tired
2016-08-06 09:50:48,I'm so tired now. Gonna sleep early tonight cause I have another full day tomorrow
2016-08-06 08:20:11,BUT I did get to see 2 dogs and I got to pet one of them!!
2016-08-06 08:16:55,It was a decently successful day of hiking. We didn't end up swimming bc there were a lot of people and a couple eating each other's faces üò≥

2016-08-04 09:36:29,The only plus side of me being sick is that I finally finished my first official coloring page

2016-08-03 18:37:18,My BGF just found out about my visit to the hospital in February that happened because I coughed too hard. And here I thought I had told him

2016-08-03 02:28:27,"@instagram I used Instagram so much more when it was chronological. Now, it's annoying to use and I hardly want to open it"
2016-08-03 02:27:17,@instagram why add stories? We have @Snapchat for that already. Please just go back to showing our feed chronologically

2016-08-01 17:18:07,@BiancaHabana I found a website that allows two people to watch movies at the same time. We can do movie dates even when I'm gone üòä
2016-08-01 16:21:00,"So, I have a sore throat. I'm pretty sure it's mostly from my dad, but it could also be because my BGF is sick and we sat together at church"
2016-08-01 10:24:07,"Sigh, and so it happens. My second goodbye before I leave"
2016-08-01 02:01:37,Funny how some guys actually care so much about you and want to know more about you while others can't be bothered to get past the surface
2016-07-31 17:16:45,"Learned that if I die and it's too inconvenient for him, my other BGF won't attend my funeral. I'd have to pay him to go. Great friendship"

2016-06-30 03:10:43,"Unless I read and finish a book today, I'll be finishing this quarter having read 5,000+ pages"

2016-06-29 17:19:52,"Just remembered that I wanted to film tonight. Instead, I got caught up with my book. Don't know if that's a good or bad thing"
2016-06-29 16:21:56,Are breakups as dramatic in real life as they are in fiction?
2016-06-29 16:05:15,The fact that I can relate to Lola and the Boy Next Door on a strange level is compelling me to finish it tonight
2016-06-29 15:02:27,Wrote my first short story that doesn't contain character names or descriptions
2016-06-29 14:15:05,There's something so nice about picking up a physical book after reading several ebooks üòä
2016-06-29 08:31:01,I think I might film tonight. Cross your fingers that it'll actually happen
2016-06-29 01:32:45,@BiancaHabana oh my. I never knew he was such an awkward dancer
2016-06-28 17:40:43,I think tomorrow might be a Disney movie marathon kind of day
2016-06-28 16:47:38,Which also means that I should finally film and upload something again. It's been about a month since anything has gone up on my channel
2016-06-28 16:47:10,"I think I'm ending June having read 3 books, but that's okay because I read 7 books in May"
2016-06-28 16:45:21,It's a strange thing to know that most people are more invested in my love life than I am. I just want ice cream üç¶
2016-06-28 11:39:29,@BiancaHabana ty for being so chill
2016-06-28 11:23:26,Now I can finish binge watching Jane the Virgin without feeling guilty
2016-06-28 11:23:04,"Finished my second novel today! It has a really crappy ending and needs a lot of work, but it's done!!"
2016-06-28 05:26:26,"Kinda want to read, but also kinda want to finish Jane the Virgin"
2016-06-27 18:00:51,It would seem that things turned out differently from what I expected
2016-06-27 17:54:53,"@ApriliusBrooks okay, I didn't cry, but I loved every bit of this book ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
2016-06-27 15:58:15,FRICK I just realized I'm turning 19 in 2 weeks. I'm not prepared for this. Someone make it stop
2016-06-27 14:46:10,Basically forcing my best guy friend to listen to Hamilton so I can make references around him and have someone in my life who understands
2016-06-27 14:17:27,Had one of the nicest conversations in awhile today
2016-06-27 13:45:42,Can I have all of them? https://t.co/o3Ooeuajsi
2016-06-27 10:17:24,@ApriliusBrooks I'm reading Everything Everything and I'm not ready for this book to end. Why is it going by so quickly?
2016-06-27 09:13:21,It's so hot outside. I actually watched my ice cream sag and melt 10 seconds after I got it
2016-06-27 04:58:50,@BiancaHabana that could actually be the tagline!!
2016-06-27 04:57:16,@BiancaHabana I will happily endorse this book 100% until I die
2016-06-27 04:56:01,@BiancaHabana YES and in a way that is because it's legitimately true and not a cop-out from the characters
2016-06-27 04:53:29,@BiancaHabana YES OH MY GOSH YES LET THE PLATONIC FRIENDSHIPS RAIN/REIGN
2016-06-27 04:53:07,"But then again, it means I can survive without them. This is why I'm good at recognizing people's outlines from a certain distance"
2016-06-27 04:52:01,"After getting glasses, I've started wondering how I survived the past few years without them"
2016-06-27 04:51:08,"@BiancaHabana YES PLEASE! End the book with ""Dude, you're basically my sibling. You're part of the family."""
2016-06-27 04:47:51,@BiancaHabana please do. There really aren't enough books about platonic friendships with zero romance involved
2016-06-27 04:45:59,@BiancaHabana dude what if you're the John Green of friendship quotes???
2016-06-27 04:39:58,"@BiancaHabana i feel like this tweet is the friend version of ""You have a choice of who hurts you in this world"""

2016-06-26 12:59:03,It's 9pm and I'm ready for bed. I know this because this is my second attempt at this tweet due to a typo in my previous attempt
2016-06-26 10:09:25,The nap definitely made things better. What could possibly go wrong when I fall asleep to Hamilton?
2016-06-26 09:05:22,Let's see if a nap makes things better or worse
2016-06-26 08:55:22,I'm way too sleep-deprived from being around people. And so much physical contact
2016-06-25 06:32:33,Yes please https://t.co/wjLmwYLzwr
2016-06-25 03:43:35,I need to stop having discussions with my guy friends about dating and romance

2016-06-24 16:55:08,Why did I just have a conversation with a guy friend about dating by using only fishing metaphors?
2016-06-24 16:41:40,I just realized I haven't listened to Hamilton in about a week. What's wrong with me???? Clearly something is very wrong here
2016-06-24 16:39:41,Thank you to the guy friend who just reminded me of all the Doctor Who monsters I should be afraid of as an introvert going to bed
2016-06-24 16:14:05,"Got my guy friend to watch Love Rosie, which is great because he loves unrealistic love stories"
2016-06-24 14:54:56,"It's 11pm and I'm exhausted. The only time I left the house was for dinner, so I have no idea why I'm so tired"
2016-06-24 14:10:15,It's kind of hard when I have that one guy friend who can be really adorable and is really attractive but doesn't know it
2016-06-24 10:06:03,"Why does Disney have a habit of making me so attracted to their animated animals? Simba, Robin Hood, Nick Wilde. Why, Disney, why?"

2016-06-23 02:32:21,@BiancaHabana hahaha it's pretty obvious
2016-06-22 17:53:29,He's also the only guy who ever texts me about romance related anime or shows. And the only guy who recommends me romance anime ü§î
2016-06-22 17:52:24,"A guy friend started texting me randomly at midnight about k-dramas, which led to a discussion about romance and ended with sarcasm"
2016-06-22 15:19:18,I've spent my whole day being WAYYY more invested in a fictional character's love life because mine is quite dull
2016-06-21 18:34:22,Just finished Lost Girls by @WriteAngie and I can't believe the rollercoaster of emotions she put me through. Can't wait to read Play Dead

2016-06-21 03:28:19,My phone screen will be fixed in about 1 and a half hours! This means I can stop having to press the top of the screen to look at pictures
2016-06-20 18:05:20,The number of people who support this ship just grew by another person. I think they'll need a bigger boat
2016-06-20 18:01:05,I'm just going to count down all the things I have going on this week and cross them out like a checklist as I complete them
2016-06-20 18:00:05,Really hope my phone can be fixed tomorrow
2016-06-20 17:46:28,"It's always great to catch up with that one best friend whom you don't talk to often, but when you do, it's like no time has passed"
2016-06-20 09:12:51,Dear No One by @ToriKelly describes me perfectly
2016-06-20 03:37:13,Time to start binge-watching Jane the Virgin again
2016-06-19 17:25:04,Sometimes I really wish I were more extroverted so I could have the energy to see/be around/deal with people
2016-06-19 17:17:43,I'm really not the subtle type. As confirmed by my BGF when he pointed out that I straight up told one of my best friends that I liked him
2016-06-19 17:12:40,"Actually, a really big part of me wants to cancel all my plans this week except for one because that one is really important"
2016-06-19 17:11:29,"Part of me is legitimately thinking of not showing up, faking sickness, or just plain saying I don't want to go at all. But that's rude"

2016-04-04 14:33:37,Is it a law or something that female Shadowhunters need to have insanely long hair? Doesn't it affect their ability to fight?
2016-04-04 14:17:22,Who tf is Lydia Branwell and what has she done with Inquisitor Herondale? #Shadowhunters
2016-04-04 14:05:44,@BiancaHabana LOOK AT THE PUGGY! https://t.co/WnPcgMebxc
2016-04-04 14:03:29,@BiancaHabana @SincerelyTumblr i love this puppy!
2016-04-04 13:57:09,I just uploaded a new video to @YouTube: Quarterly Wrap-Up | Jan-March 2016 https://t.co/EUZQFGZwsx
2016-04-04 13:39:51,Here's my wrap-up from Jan-March! https://t.co/3Vsaj8tHvl
2016-04-04 13:13:27,"@BiancaHabana hahaha it's okay, mine is hilarious"
2016-04-04 13:12:55,@BiancaHabana oh gosh
2016-04-04 12:26:37,Magnus Bane is basically my favorite thing about Shadowhunters
2016-04-04 12:25:21,"@BiancaHabana this is fairly accurate for you, unlike mine"
2016-04-04 11:22:13,"@BiancaHabana HAHAHAHAHA I LOVE THIS. I feel like I should frame it or something! ""Every man's perfect girl"" HAHAHAHAHA"
2016-04-04 08:39:39,"Big question: Why do Clary and Izzy wear stilettos to fight, run, and all that? I'd be terrified of breaking my own legs"
2016-04-04 08:13:24,"Nevermind, I'm watching episode 3 of Shadowhunters because it's entertainingly bad"
2016-04-04 06:39:20,@BiancaHabana @BabyAnimalPics HAHAHAHAHAHA
2016-04-04 06:21:36,I can't do this. Shadowhunters is the worst thing I've seen in a long time. I'm quitting the show
2016-04-04 06:12:45,Why are Jace and Clary casually holding hands while going to meet the Silent Brothers? #Shadowhunters
2016-04-04 06:11:00,@BiancaHabana I think we need this cat https://t.co/sGkUvmfLux
2016-04-04 06:08:12,"The only up side is Valentine and Magnus Bane. Once again, I'm more interested in the villain and the guy with questionable intentions"
2016-04-04 06:07:06,"If I thought that City of Bones was bad, Shadowhunters is worse. The second episode is on the verge of disgustingly terrible"
2016-04-03 15:01:03,"Okay, if Operation Re-Enter Dream doesn't work tonight, we're moving on to Operation Have A New Dream With Hot Guy tomorrow night"
2016-04-03 14:58:00,"Yeah, this can be pretty accurate https://t.co/oqdiwgU6AH"
2016-04-03 13:36:51,"I have 4 videos filmed and ready to be edited, but I'm too tired to edit any of them rn. So, I'll have something up tomorrow instead"
2016-04-03 13:10:28,I've decided to start taking naps at the MC on Sundays while the guys do...whatever it is they do. I might as well catch up on sleep
2016-04-03 05:04:16,"@readbyzoe i try to envision what I want to write before I start, then I just let it all flow. My fingers take over"
2016-04-03 02:16:57,@BiancaHabana hahaha maybe I should retake the test
2016-04-03 02:15:32,@BiancaHabana but you're both ENFP and I'm ISTJ
2016-04-03 02:02:28,This is yet another one of those times when I just need to hibernate with books &amp; Netflix because people are too stressful to deal with
2016-04-03 02:00:07,"On another note, I've had 5 mentally/emotionally exhausting days in the past 3ish weeks and I feel like I'm about to have another one"
2016-04-03 01:57:44,I keep failing at Operation Re-enter Dream. It's making me consider Operation Have A New Dream With Hot Guy
2016-04-03 01:55:27,"@BiancaHabana wait, we're complete opposites? I thought you were the middle ground between me and Kasia üòï"
2016-04-02 18:01:17,"Can we please take a moment (actually, take several) to appreciate this?  Taken from @rainbowrowell https://t.co/ZFiTlEcKsz"
2016-04-02 17:57:47,"If you think that getting soap in your eye hurts, wait until you get facial exfoliator in your eye"

2016-04-02 06:43:26,Starting my first writing session of #CampNaNoWriMo. Hopefully this goes well 'cause I'm already behind due to not writing yesterday
2016-04-02 03:46:18,"Operation Re-Enter Dream failed again last night, but it's okay because I dreamt about the Tenth Doctor #Whovian"
2016-04-01 18:46:17,"Night 4 of Operation Re-enter Dream  Guys, this is getting serious. I've created a codename for my emotional obsession with this dream"
2016-04-01 18:23:36,My introversion percentage ranges from 70% to ambivert depending on the day and my mood
2016-04-01 17:18:42,"I don't understand how some people love cuddling and all that. Sometimes, just hearing about physical touch makes me highly uncomfortable üòï"
2016-04-01 16:56:49,@BiancaHabana @SoDamnTrue Hahahahaha I can TOTALLY see this happening. Graduation pics with burrito
2016-04-01 16:03:16,@BiancaHabana his everything is so tiny and cute!!!!
2016-04-01 16:02:32,"No one should be surprised that I almost always prefer dogs and fictional people to real, human beings. Not even remotely surprised"
2016-04-01 15:57:24,@BiancaHabana @BabyAnimalPics poor baby! I just want to give him hugs and cuddles
2016-04-01 14:39:53,"Neither of us realized how much we needed it until halfway through, and it was probably one of the best conversations I've had in awhile"
2016-04-01 14:39:00,Spent 3 hours talking my one of my best friends over dinner and it was the highlight of my week. It was so great for both of us to just talk
2016-04-01 14:35:57,@BiancaHabana !!!! https://t.co/ISODAmNLWn
2016-04-01 14:33:47,So Operation Re-enter Dream failed again last night. Gonna try again tonight. I think I'm too emotionally invested in this dream
2016-04-01 14:32:16,@BiancaHabana NO AND I'M LEGIT SO UPSET. Why am I so emotionally invested in a dream?
2016-03-31 19:12:37,"Let's hope that this works, because I'm still thinking of that dream and that guy *crosses fingers* Third time's the charm?"
2016-03-31 19:11:21,"This time, I have a different method. Think of what I was thinking of before falling asleep that night. With any luck, that'll work"
2016-03-31 19:10:36,Trying this again. Attempting to re-enter my dream from Tuesday to see where that relationships ends up and to see that guy again
2016-03-31 17:51:37,"#CampNaNoWriMo has started and I'm not writing. Well, I am, but I'm journaling, not writing my book. I'll do that in the morning"
2016-03-31 17:33:24,@KristinaHorner thank you! Good luck on your novel too!
2016-03-31 17:03:18,The awkwardness radiating from Barry and Kara at the same time is pure gold
2016-03-31 16:50:09,@BiancaHabana we gotta break our record of 27 days
2016-03-31 16:48:57,@KristinaHorner @CampNaNoWriMo I'm doing it!
