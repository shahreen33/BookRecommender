2013-06-18 20:11:27,"Hee hee, I'm at 64k now. Hurtling towards my targeted halfway point. #writing"
2013-06-17 20:15:49,@LBartoszek I confess I'm only about 100 pages in. I keep getting distracted. :)
2013-06-17 17:44:52,"Turns out my document was corrupt. Lucky for me I had a back-up, otherwise I would have lost more than half my work! D:"
2013-06-16 19:27:38,Having problems with Word. It shows I have 60k clocked up but is only showing half of what I've written. #whatthehell
2013-06-16 07:34:39,@LBartoszek My Saturday night was filled with music and me wondering how the hell to blag my way through a concert. :P
2013-06-15 13:58:03,Time to get ready for Concert No. 2. Now to find something to wear again... Probably the same ensemble as last week. #lazy
2013-06-11 20:18:41,Nothing like a day-long migraine to wear you out. #hateheadaches
2013-06-08 18:05:15,Having a break from writing today. Gonna sit and play me some FF3.
2013-06-08 16:48:42,"Wow, the concert went really well! I got to sit at a 'reserved' table and everything! It was awesome!"
2013-06-08 08:42:14,"All dressed and ready for the concert this afternoon. Wearing black pants and white t-shirt with a black bow. Smart, at any rate."
2013-06-08 06:05:36,@1WishAway I need a paragraph. A sentence is too short and I can easily be distracted. Once I write a paragraph I know I'm on a roll. :D
2013-06-07 20:07:00,Only got 735 words written today. Had a mood dip today so not in the mood to write. Bedtime now. #sleep
2013-06-07 19:42:35,@LBartoszek That is somewhat more passable. :)
2013-06-07 19:37:02,@LBartoszek Personally I have a weakness for checkered shirts. I love them. :D
2013-06-07 19:25:39,@LBartoszek Pretty? @_@ Who is this person of whom you speak? XD And I can't help but prefer wearing black.
2013-06-07 19:17:01,"@LBartoszek And the only blue shirt I have is a t-shirt, which really isn't suitable. XD"
2013-06-07 19:16:33,@LBartoszek My work clothes pass as my general day wear and going out wear. I only buy stuff that can pass as all three. :)
2013-06-07 18:37:54,"It'll likely be my work pants and a black shirt, like the male members. I don't see why I should wear a 'summer dress' because I'm a woman!"
2013-06-07 18:35:05,I'm absolutely not wearing a dress to the concert tomorrow. Let's see what's in the wardrobe I can get away with...
2013-06-06 20:48:29,"Day 31 and I wrote 2,895 words. I'm impressed that I'm managing to hit my targets lately! :D #writing"

2012-07-04 20:37:09,"@LBartoszek Yup, all going well. Can't play as well as everyone else of course but I can do a bit. Now to improve and catch up! :)"
2012-07-04 16:59:52,Tonight's my second session with the orchestra. The conductor asked that as many people as possible turn up tonight. I wonder why? :)
2012-07-04 06:48:14,"Curse you, writer's block! Go away already!!!"
2012-07-03 16:52:19,"@HetaliaOfficial My favourite moment is England's plan to get America horribly drunk, only to get drunk himself! Season 1 but still classic!"
2012-07-02 06:09:59,*laughs* Oh yeah... I approve of this. http://t.co/e1lyOjUU
2012-07-02 06:04:50,Another early rise... this time 3am. But I managed to doze between 5 and 6... Just wish I could get rid of this writer's block...
2012-07-01 18:55:10,Sometimes you just gotta put a man in his place. &gt;:3
2012-07-01 18:46:11,"@xCatherineHx Anytime, hope you feel a bit better. :)"
2012-07-01 18:41:34,"RT @daraobriain: I mean, I'm just amazed somebody hasn't started #fiftyshadesofGay yet. Not suggesting anyone should, btw."
2012-07-01 18:39:37,@xCatherineHx You won't let anyone down. Everyone will be proud no matter what. :)
2012-07-01 18:36:28,"@xCatherineHx Don't let anyone pressurise you, Catherine, and don't feel scared. *hugs*"
2012-06-29 05:55:51,"@TrudiCanavan When it comes to planning out your novels, do you usually start with characters, world planning or the plot?"
2012-06-28 19:30:47,@HetaliaOfficial I'm still waiting for Season 3 to come out over here. :( One month to go.
2012-06-28 19:27:51,"So I'm a Grade 1 violinist, working towards my Grade 2, and to be given a crash course in Grade 3... BRING IT ON!!!"
2012-06-28 06:35:42,Well I went to Phoenix Strings orchestra for the first time last night. I had fun! Will I be going next week? Yes!
2012-06-27 06:02:28,At last! My writer's block appears to be lifting! I've written 600 words this morning! Huzzah! Still short of the 2k I normally do but hey!
2012-06-26 06:45:49,"The accursed writer's block is still with me. Averaging about 100 words a day. On another note, 100th post! :)"
2012-06-25 20:19:44,Woot! I called the conductor of Phoenix Strings and I'm invited to attend the rehearsal on Wednesday to have a look-see! :)
2012-06-25 17:18:10,"@cazbarbie @xCatherineHx - aww, hope you two feel better soon!"
2012-06-24 18:09:55,Maybe one of these days I'll get on with some writing.
2012-06-24 18:08:26,@LBartoszek Ooo! Sounds interesting. I can't wait to see it! :)
2012-06-23 17:45:35,Decisions between what you know you should do but you don't want to do. -_-
2012-06-23 12:43:30,I could also be playing #PhoenixWright.
2012-06-23 12:38:46,"Gah, so many things to do. Do I practice my violin or do some writing? I also wish this migraine would go away. XD"
2012-06-23 12:37:48,@NickyBenedetti Very simple. We swap for things like cola. Caffeine rush. :)
2012-06-22 18:56:52,Heya! I loved the Abhorsen trilogy! @garthnix
2012-06-22 18:34:11,"Gah, I don't know what to do..."
2012-06-21 17:20:53,"I need to call the guy from the orchestra, but I'm just so nervous... Maybe I'll wait one more day."
2012-06-21 17:19:55,"Wow, what an interesting design for a building! @LBartoszek"
2012-06-18 20:14:08,"Plushies... good to cuddle, but they don't quite fill the void. I need a giant plushie."

2012-06-17 09:37:34,At last my obsession with reading is starting to subdue. Perhaps next week I can get on with some writing. :)
2012-06-16 18:08:44,"Ugh, curse you anxiety. Breathe deeply and slowly they say... that just makes me worse!!!"
2012-06-15 21:25:53,"Love how people are so nice to the England team when they win, yet turn to bitches if they lose. I feel sorry for the players. XD"

2012-06-13 19:57:57,@xCatherineHx I have faith in your ability to do well. :)
2012-06-13 19:53:20,"Hi, I just finished reading the Black Magician trilogy. I loved it. I adore Dannyl. Now reading Age of the Five. Loving it! @TrudiCanavan"

2012-06-12 17:07:54,Well that's the Black Magician trilogy out of the way. Now onto the Age of the Five trilogy. :)
2012-06-12 17:07:08,"@xCatherineHx Sleeping, no contest. :)"
2012-06-06 20:19:08,@InheritanceCP I whole-heartedly agree. Dark chocolate is the best. :)
2012-06-05 18:21:47,@LBartoszek It is spring in our minds. And the mind is a very powerful thing. :)
2012-06-05 18:21:08,@GemmaWilshaw I believe it is under discussion. Optioning is where they purchase the rights to make a film if a decision is agreed.

2012-06-04 20:50:54,@xCatherineHx better than the key skills IT exam.That was just insulting. I wanted to put 'how stupid do you think I am' as my answer.

2012-04-29 08:55:08,Hey Lou! Thanks so much for the bag and the manga! I've already finished reading the first volume! It's so sweet! :) @LBartoszek
2012-04-27 20:00:24,I'm not far off completing my Final Fantasy 8 novel. Just a few chapters to go. I will certainly finish it in May. :) Then it's Crisis Core!
2012-04-27 19:37:59,My teacher's gonna speak to the conductor of Phoenix Strings to see if he will accept a Grade 1 player. He usually just takes Grade 3 up.
2012-04-27 19:37:04,Got a reply from the BSO. They accept only Grade 5 and up. :(
2012-04-27 19:34:05,@PianoGuys I love it! It's fantastic! Yet I was expecting a dramatic face-off with Piano vs Cello. Instead you left us on a cliffhanger! :)
2012-04-23 19:12:26,I earned a star at my violin lesson today for playing a piece perfectly. Whoo-hoo!
2012-04-22 17:48:07,"@LBartoszek Oh, I've done that a few times..."
2012-04-20 20:39:57,I just sent an email to the Blackpool Symphony Orchestra. Far too soon but it's worth asking!
2012-04-20 20:03:46,"Further, it would help if I had someone I could practice with. There's nothing like motivation than someone who shares your interest..."
2012-04-20 20:00:24,Seriously need to get some practice in on my violin this weekend. I'll never make Grade 2 if I keep skipping practice!
2012-04-19 20:54:09,"Well, it's time I made myself a hot chocolate, grabbed my book and snuggled down for the night."
2012-04-19 20:47:37,"Whew, that's another chapter done with. Almost at the end of this story! :) The end is in sight!"
2012-04-18 19:39:00,@LBartoszek @gemmawilshaw I would advise waiting until the issue of the Falklands has blown over for a bit. :)
2012-04-18 19:34:52,"@LBartoszek @gemmawilshaw This does not surprise me, seeing as how you've been to so many countries. Any countries you HAVEN'T been to?"
2012-04-18 19:31:01,"@GemmaWilshaw Yes, that sounds good. And don't forget we need to plan that spa day, too!"
2012-04-18 19:26:36,"@LBartoszek @GemmaWilshaw What, just by spinning a globe and then stopping it? :o I still wanna go to Italy someday."

2012-04-18 19:16:41,@LBartoszek Don't worry about the timing; I don't mind such things. :) I hope you enjoy Morocco.

2012-03-22 14:19:02,@LBartoszek Thanks. I did the exam. I messed up a little on one of my pieces because the bow was shaking but overall I think I did well!
2012-03-22 14:18:18,"@LBartoszek Depends. Do you fight and break up, and then kiss and make up? Do you really want to stay or go?"
