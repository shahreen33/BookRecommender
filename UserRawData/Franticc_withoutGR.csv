2012-06-06 02:12:32,About to scan some film from today and enjoying my first @3floyds Alpha King. Good day was good.
2012-06-04 21:25:37,Won $30 on scratch off tickets and found Gursky's MoMA catalog at half-price books. Yay today. :D
2012-06-04 08:14:57,"Also, if you didn't watch Saved by the Bell then your childhood is meaningless."
2012-06-04 08:14:24,Anyone who follows my tumblr is getting a heaping dose of Saved by the Bell reblogs. Because all of you need Zack and Kelly on a moped.
2012-06-04 00:38:35,"Mom is watching a Miley Cyrus movie. Somehow still compelled to keep watching. Soundtrack had Ra Ra Riot and Feist. That makes it ok, right?"
2012-06-03 22:09:30,My willpower to edit these photos is being overpowered by desire to dance around like an idiot to Sidewalk Safari
2012-06-03 20:11:32,Online window shopping for cameras and waiting to get a call from the neighbors for a quick photo thingy they need help with.
2012-06-03 02:47:07,Why did they try Teen-Line twice on this show? First time it was a terrible idea. The second time it's not much better. #SavedByTheBell
2012-06-02 20:28:17,That being said I'm not doing too terrible for my first time trying to photograph soccer. Dem kids run fast.
2012-06-02 20:27:50,Shit I think I have over 1000 images to sort through today.
2012-06-02 20:22:55,@alexandragarey Thankfully just one night but one of the longest nights of my time at Ringling to say the least.
2012-06-02 19:57:18,@alexandragarey Agreed. Hardest thing ever was sitting with Nicole in the hospital last year but you do what you have to for loved ones.
2012-06-02 19:17:38,"Bought a frame at Wal-Mart to put graduation pictures in, and got a new pretty lady to scan too! :D #stealingfacesfrombitches"
2012-06-02 15:30:18,Some of the soccer moms had better equipment than I did today. What do you need L series glass for soccer mom? Gimme dat lens. #broke
2012-06-02 03:32:46,"At least I won't be playing ALL night, I do have work in the morning. (or I could just stay up until i have work and then sleep later)"
2012-06-02 03:28:46,Now that I have CS Suite and MS Office set up on my computer so I can do work...TIME TO INSTALL SIMS 3 AGAIN.
2012-06-02 01:54:12,Also have to be there at 8AM. Oh the things I will do for money.
2012-06-02 01:53:19,"Another small shoot lined up for tomorrow, hopefully things will pick up quickly."
2012-06-02 00:01:22,Okay seriously mom I know you hear the phone beeping at you it's right next to your head. Hang the fuck up.
2012-06-01 16:11:55,Picked up my iMac last night. Can finally stop editing photos on my 4 year old MBP.
2012-05-31 16:43:26,Well the rain finally showed up. Wonder how long this will last. Good day to stay in and forever job hunt.
2012-05-31 04:54:02,"@LeftHandBrewing Found a place with the Milk Stout Nitro on tap tonight, really glad I tried it! Love the sawtooth too. LEFTIES UNITE!"

2012-05-31 01:36:21,Accidentally at trivia night at a bar that I have never been to before. Really really like this place.
2012-05-30 22:23:43,"Well shit, won $29 on $8 worth of lottery tickets today. That's something!"

2012-05-29 22:28:33,@nicolehates FUCKYEAH FREE MONEY.
2012-05-29 19:11:15,Holy crap found two bottles of alpine spring at binnys in highland park. One for me and one for my dad since it is his birthday. :D

2012-05-29 02:43:23,"Somehow Lisa buying expensive clothes = ""You're a great designer!"" Last thing I remember her making from scratch were friendship bracelets."

2012-05-28 19:44:54,"Traveling by plane, train, and automobile today. Headed downtown for funtimes with @CanonMistress !"
2012-05-28 18:22:43,Lol right before takeoff got switched to an empty row by the flight attendant. Now I just have to wait to grab my bag from 5 rows back :/
2012-05-28 16:06:25,So fucking glad I am sitting aisle seat today. This woman is crazy and I cannot wait to get the fuck away from her.
2012-05-28 16:05:06,Sitting next to oversized passenger with oversized luggage. Good luck getting that bag out from under your seat.
2012-05-28 15:49:29,Looking forward to returning home and getting back to work on important things...like finishing saved by the bell and tweeting about it.
2012-05-28 15:48:15,To my left and right at the gate today: lady with an Afro who also bought an overpriced sandwich and hipster kid reading Lovecraft.
2012-05-28 15:45:36,"@Kylogram glad you're thinking of me in your drunken stupor, darling. ;) and yeah, that will get you real drunk real quick."
2012-05-28 15:44:02,That being said paying $10 for a sandwich is totally not cool. That's what happens when the terminal has only one food vendor.
2012-05-28 15:40:27,Flying @Delta between LGA and ORD is seriously the easiest flying experience I've ever had.
2012-05-24 21:02:21,@CicAndDesist the none of the faucets are working!
2012-05-23 04:54:25,"Watching Chopped with @DensetsuFirefox, getting hungry again."
2012-05-22 18:17:56,"@Kylogram nah, I waited until she saw me to tweet about it. :P"
2012-05-22 18:09:59,Lolwhoops hopped on a plane to NY today to surprise @DensetsuFirefox :D
2012-05-22 03:12:29,Only in the 90's is it acceptable for someone to wear a dress with puffy rainbow sleeves.
2012-05-22 03:05:54,That being said these kids had quite the senior year of high school. Or at least their weekends and breaks were exciting.
2012-05-22 03:04:40,"They must have gotten really bored when they wrote this season, it's all of the really weird plot lines."
2012-05-22 03:02:50,But hey it's 90's television! AND THE REASON TO BE CHARITABLE IS SO ZACK GETS THE GIRL. #SavedByTheBell
2012-05-22 03:02:27,"Not that the charitable acts are a bad thing, but there's something unrealistic about asking someone to move in the day after meeting them."

2012-05-22 02:34:09,@lalamb81 That's the way it should be! I'm still waiting for my foodie friend to get back in town so I can search these places out.
2012-05-22 02:21:19,"@lalamb81 http://t.co/3SGUFRqR Also click over to the menu tab, they have some crazy things."
2012-05-22 02:14:58,@alexandragarey There's nothing wrong with this. Also just found out there's a poutine restaurant in Chicago. Need to find it soon. #foodie
2012-05-20 23:22:47,@nicolehates My mom thought mine was sharpied on when she first saw it. Now I think she doesn't care anymore.
2012-05-20 22:48:51,I feel so gross and sweaty right now. It's days like these when I miss having central A/C. 90º and all I have is a window fan. Awesome.
2012-05-20 22:42:15,"Handed out a bunch of biz cards to the parents, hopefully get some response from that."
2012-05-20 22:40:18,Spent the past two hours photographing golfers and their kids on the range. Went straight to 7-eleven for water and a tallboy.
2012-05-20 19:28:03,"First freelance shoot for the summer today. Hopefully the first of many, I could use the money while I search for permanent employment."
2012-05-20 04:37:05,"I love how stupidly anal Brody is. I do enjoy the label he has for eateries outside the foodcourt, autonomous unit for mid mall snacking."

2012-05-20 04:29:14,And now time for Mallrats. There's something weirdly comfortable about a movie set entirely in a shopping mall.
2012-05-20 01:25:02,"@lalamb81 That's okay, near the end of the semester I was drinking Sam Adams with my lunchables."
2012-05-19 23:54:19,Backing up all of my recent work. Need to be more regular with this in the future but I might as well before freelance shoot tomorrow.
2012-05-19 20:20:52,Hoooooly shit I am excited about Chris Ware's new book now. #comicscon
2012-05-19 19:32:54,"So ready for this webcast. Daniel Clowes, Seth, Charles Burns, and Chris WIck all on one stage at the same time = HELL YES. #comicscon"
2012-05-19 18:43:02,We've been on a first name basis with the cook here for years and for that same reason he makes sure to give us way too much food.
2012-05-19 18:42:03,Howdy duty burger at niles grill = reason why a fried egg makes sense on a burger. Also reminded me why I don't do this every week.

2012-05-18 22:52:38,@SailorHarlot Hahahaha he is gonna be so jelly
2012-05-18 21:30:09,"Today is awesome. Met artists I really admire, hanging outside of a nice bakery with my @argotea mate latte. Perfect afternoon. :D"
2012-05-18 20:05:01,@alexandragarey Living by red line would be ideal IMHO. Purple is mainly for suburbanites like myself but it runs rush trains to the loop.
2012-05-18 20:02:09,@lalamb81 @alexandragarey Lakeview is also a really nice neighborhood to hang out in. Red/Brown/Purple stops within as far as trains.
2012-05-18 19:56:10,@CicAndDesist CONGRATS CICI!!!! See you back on the homefront soon?
2012-05-18 19:03:01,@alexandragarey pretty much I would focus on north side.
2012-05-18 19:02:22,@alexandragarey Inside the city lakeview/Lincoln park/wicker park. I am looking at suburbs because they're cheaper and commutable.
2012-05-18 07:41:53,SHIT. Just realized that the new Menchies is going to be right by the gelato place we like. #firstworldproblems
2012-05-18 03:14:19,Sending out my membership application for a local photography gallery tomorrow...wish me luck! Gallery representation would be nifty. :D
2012-05-18 02:03:27,Also saw a clone of Britney and K-fed at the Dominick's tonight. Kinda scary. Also lol in a few years kids won't know who k-fed is...
2012-05-18 02:02:38,Apparently not open yet but coming soon...maybe there will be people around to go with me when it does open up. #foreveralone

2012-05-17 03:35:07,LOL they totally just made Wayne's World references on Saved by the Bell. Lisa has dates lined up with Wayne and Garth. PARTY ON LISA!
2012-05-17 01:10:04,Seriously. Why do we still have three phones in this house that can knock out our wireless signal. This is ridiculous.
2012-05-15 09:03:58,LOL all I tweet about now is what I'm watching. In that respect this summer has been super productive! Just need to finish Office and Archer
2012-05-15 08:38:02,"This past year has been the season of stupid plot twists in every show that I watch. Whatever, at least Andy and Erin are back together."
2012-05-15 08:37:23,"Also finally catching up on all of the Office I missed out on while I was at school, and seriously what the fuck are they all thinking?"
2012-05-15 08:36:50,Didn't pass out on the couch watching TV tonight! That's a first for me since I've been home.
2012-05-15 02:56:11,"@alexandragarey @nicolehates SHIT I need to get on that soon too, I'll have CS6 soon but I don't want to install it on my laptop..."
2012-05-15 02:53:33,@lalamb81 SO GOOD. I watched that one way too many times when it was on Netflix because I had nothing else going on that summer.
2012-05-14 16:47:05,"@CanonMistress I know how that goes, but it does make you even more grateful for the ones that do give you love back."
2012-05-14 05:24:30,Lolwhoops nevermind plans went through and I am feeling much better. Also tipsy.
2012-05-14 02:46:42,Starting to wonder if I'm still going out tonight...:/ I wish people were better with actually picking times for plans...

2012-05-13 03:04:37,This episode is about a chess tournament. And Screech is worried because his competition is a Russian chess genius.

2012-05-09 20:58:45,I just love how our Internet gets knocked out whenever someone is on our phone line because the wireless signals conflict.
2012-05-09 08:23:32,In theory I will get a call tomorrow to confirm that it's mine. I suppose calling at 3AM to ask about it was kinda silly...
