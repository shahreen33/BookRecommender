  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the first book in a brilliant new fantasy series, books that aren't finished by their authors reside in the Library of the Unwritten in Hell, and it is up to the Librarian to track down any restless characters who emerge from those unfinished stories.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many years ago, Claire was named Head Librarian of the Unwritten Wing-- a neutral space in Hell where all the stories unfinished by their authors reside. Her job consists mainly of repairing and organizing books, but also of keeping an eye on restless stories that risk materializing as characters and escaping the library. When a Hero escapes from his book and goes in search of his author, Claire must track and capture him with the help of former muse and current assistant Brevity and nervous demon courier Leto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what should have been a simple retrieval goes horrifyingly wrong when the terrifyingly angelic Ramiel attacks them, convinced that they hold the Devil's Bible. The text of the Devil's Bible is a powerful weapon in the power struggle between Heaven and Hell, so it falls to the librarians to find a book with the power to reshape the boundaries between Heaven, Hell....and Earth.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What happens when America's First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius—his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casey McQuiston's Red, White &amp;amp; Royal Blue proves: true love isn't always diplomatic.</description>

  <description>With this outrageous new novel, China Miéville has written one of the strangest, funniest, and flat-out scariest books you will read this—or any other—year. The London that comes to life in &lt;i&gt;Kraken&lt;/i&gt; is a weird metropolis awash in secret currents of myth and magic, where criminals, police, cultists, and wizards are locked in a war to bring about—or prevent—the End of All Things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Darwin Centre at London’s Natural History Museum, Billy Harrow, a cephalopod specialist, is conducting a tour whose climax is meant to be the Centre’s prize specimen of a rare &lt;i&gt;Architeuthis dux&lt;/i&gt;—better known as the Giant Squid. But Billy’s tour takes an unexpected turn when the squid suddenly and impossibly vanishes into thin air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Billy soon discovers, this is the precipitating act in a struggle to the death between mysterious but powerful forces in a London whose existence he has been blissfully ignorant of until now, a city whose denizens—human and otherwise—are adept in magic and murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is the Congregation of God Kraken, a sect of squid worshippers whose roots go back to the dawn of humanity—and beyond. There is the criminal mastermind known as the Tattoo, a merciless maniac inked onto the flesh of a hapless victim. There is the FSRC—the Fundamentalist and Sect-Related Crime Unit—a branch of London’s finest that fights sorcery with sorcery. There is Wati, a spirit from ancient Egypt who leads a ragtag union of magical familiars. There are the Londonmancers, who read the future in the city’s entrails. There is Grisamentum, London’s greatest wizard, whose shadow lingers long after his death. And then there is Goss and Subby, an ageless old man and a cretinous boy who, together, constitute a terrifying—yet darkly charismatic—demonic duo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them—and others—are in pursuit of Billy, who inadvertently holds the key to the missing squid, an embryonic god whose powers, properly harnessed, can destroy all that is, was, and ever shall be.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In a community that isn't always understanding, an HIV-positive teen must navigate fear, disclosure, and radical self-acceptance when she falls in love--and lust--for the first time. Powerful and uplifting, Full Disclosure will speak to fans of Angie Thomas and Nicola Yoon. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simone Garcia-Hampton is starting over at a new school, and this time things will be different. She's making real friends, making a name for herself as student director of Rent, and making a play for Miles, the guy who makes her melt every time he walks into a room. The last thing she wants is for word to get out that she's HIV-positive, because last time . . . well, last time things got ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping her viral load under control is easy, but keeping her diagnosis under wraps is not so simple. As Simone and Miles start going out for real--shy kisses escalating into much more--she feels an uneasiness that goes beyond butterflies. She knows she has to tell him that she's positive, especially if sex is a possibility, but she's terrified of how he'll react! And then she finds an anonymous note in her locker: I know you have HIV. You have until Thanksgiving to stop hanging out with Miles. Or everyone else will know too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simone's first instinct is to protect her secret at all costs, but as she gains a deeper understanding of the prejudice and fear in her community, she begins to wonder if the only way to rise above is to face the haters head-on...</description>

  <description>The convent views Sybella, naturally skilled in the arts of both death and seduction, as one of their most dangerous weapons. But those assassin's skills are little comfort when the convent returns her home to the life that nearly drove her mad. And while Sybella is a weapon of justice wrought by the god of death himself, he must give her a reason to live. When she discovers an unexpected ally imprisoned in the dungeons, will a daughter of Death find something other than vengeance to live for?</description>

  <description>Side characters can be heroes too in this charming and fast-paced adventure that is The Land of Stories meets The Phantom Tollbooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indira has been a character-in-waiting her entire life. So she can't believe her luck when she's finally chosen to travel to Fable and study at the renowned Protagonist Preparatory, a school known for producing the best heroes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Indira's dreams of achieving hero status don't exactly go as planned. A failed audition lands her in the school's side-character track, and her best efforts to prove advisors--famous characters like Alice from Wonderland and Professor Darcy--wrong are constantly sabotaged. Indira is starting to feel like an evil antagonist might be to blame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the danger spreads, Indira discovers all of Fable is under siege. With her friends Maxi and Phoenix by her side, she pieces together clues that will reveal who is behind the dark magic threatening them all. But the more Indira uncovers, the more doubt she feels about her place in this world of stories. After all, can a side character really save the day?</description>

  <description>The crew of the Prometheus is intent on taking down the world’s clock towers so that time can run freely. Now captives, Colton, Daphne, and the others have a stark choice: join the Prometheus’s cause, or fight back in any small way they can and face the consequences. But Zavier, leader of the terrorists, has a bigger plan—to bring back the lost god of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As new threats emerge, loyalties must shift. No matter where the Prometheus goes—Prague, Austria, India—nowhere is safe, and every second ticks closer toward the eleventh hour. Walking the line between villainy and heroism, each will have to choose what's most important: saving those you love at the expense of the many, or making impossible sacrifices for the sake of a better world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Hell has come to collect…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…but Gisele Walker has no plans to pay the debt.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a half-demon paranormal bounty hunter, Gisele is used to flirting with death, but stealing a curio and opening a portal to Hell’s demon court is more than your average day job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, she’s partnered with an infuriatingly handsome demon, Shade, who has more levels of grey than she can count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who can she trust to help save the city as Baltimore burns to the ground and ghouls roam the streets?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a white-hot attraction burning between them and secrets blocking their path, Gisele must face her past and venture into the twisted heart of the demon royal court.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with no memory of her past…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…will she be able to save their future?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you like Ilona Andrews, Kim Harrison, Nalini Singh, Karen Marie Moning, Michael Anderle, K. F. Breene, or Shayne Silvers, you’ll walk comfortably inside the pages of this paranormal fantasy world from Writers Guild of America nominee and RWA Golden Heart finalist Megan Starks!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Starks doesn’t waste a moment launching readers into the heady, paranormal world of her action-packed debut. The complex mythology and feisty characters will hold readers’ attention. An enjoyable fantasy from an author with a lot of promise.” – Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Virgin Suicides&lt;/i&gt; in this dystopic feminist revenge fantasy about three sisters on an isolated island, raised to fear men&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King has tenderly staked out a territory for his wife and three daughters, Grace, Lia, and Sky. He has laid the barbed wire; he has anchored the buoys in the water; he has marked out a clear message: Do not enter. Or viewed from another angle: Not safe to leave. Here women are protected from the chaos and violence of men on the mainland. The cult-like rituals and therapies they endure fortify them from the spreading toxicity of a degrading world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when their father, the only man they’ve ever seen, disappears, they retreat further inward until the day three strange men wash ashore. Over the span of one blistering hot week, a psychological cat-and-mouse game plays out. Sexual tensions and sibling rivalries flare as the sisters confront the amorphous threat the strangers represent. Can they survive the men?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A haunting, riveting debut about the capacity for violence and the potency of female desire, &lt;i&gt;The Water Cure&lt;/i&gt; both devastates and astonishes as it reflects our own world back at us.</description>

  <description>Dark, irreverent, and truly innovative, the speculative stories in Homesick meditate on the theme of home and our estrangement from it, and what happens when the familiar suddenly shifts into the uncanny. In stories that foreground queer relationships and transgender or nonbinary characters, Cipri delivers the origin story for a superhero team comprised of murdered girls; a housecleaner discovering an impossible ocean in her least-favorite clients’ house; a man haunted by keys that appear suddenly in his throat; and a team of scientists and activists discovering the remains of a long-extinct species of intelligent weasels. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the spirit of Laura van den Berg, Emily Geminder, Chaya Bhuvaneswar, and other winners of the Dzanc Short Story Collection Prize, Nino Cipri’s debut collection announces the arrival of a brilliant and wonderfully unpredictable writer with a gift for turning the short story on its ear.</description>

  <description>IN SPACE EVERYONE CAN HEAR YOU SING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A century ago, the Sentience Wars tore the galaxy apart and nearly ended the entire concept of intelligent space-faring life. In the aftermath, a curious tradition was invented-something to cheer up everyone who was left and bring the shattered worlds together in the spirit of peace, unity, and understanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once every cycle, the civilizations gather for the Metagalactic Grand Prix - part gladiatorial contest, part beauty pageant, part concert extravaganza, and part continuation of the wars of the past. Instead of competing in orbital combat, the powerful species that survived face off in a competition of song, dance, or whatever can be physically performed in an intergalactic talent show. The stakes are high for this new game, and everyone is forced to compete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, though, humankind has discovered the enormous universe. And while they expected to discover a grand drama of diplomacy, gunships, wormholes, and stoic councils of aliens, they have instead found glitter, lipstick and electric guitars. Mankind will not get to fight for its destiny - they must sing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A one-hit-wonder band of human musicians, dancers and roadies from London - Decibel Jones and the Absolute Zeroes - have been chosen to represent Earth on the greatest stage in the galaxy. And the fate of their species lies in their ability to rock.</description>

  <description>Shy Ken Kaneki is thrilled to go on a date with the beautiful Rize. But it turns out that she’s only interested in his body—eating it, that is. When a morally questionable rescue transforms him into the first half-human half-Ghoul hybrid, Ken is drawn into the dark and violent world of Ghouls, which exists alongside our own.</description>

  <description>He signed up to fight with visions of honour and glory, of fighting for king and country, of making his family proud at long last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on a battlefield during the Great War, Robert Jones is shot, and wonders how it all went so very wrong, and how things could possibly get any worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He'll soon find out. When the attacking enemy starts to shapeshift into a nightmarish demonic force, Jones finds himself fighting an impossible war against an enemy that shouldn't exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy Remic's &lt;i&gt;A Song for No Man's Land&lt;/i&gt; is the first in an ongoing series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"&lt;i&gt;The Orchid Throne&lt;/i&gt; is a captivating and sensual fantasy romance you won’t want to miss! High stakes. Remarkable worldbuilding. Unique and compelling characters. A slow-burn romance that’ll make you combust.” — Amanda Bouchet, &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of The Kingmaker Chronicles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"&lt;i&gt;The Orchid Throne&lt;/i&gt; captures from the first page and doesn't let go as Jeffe Kennedy weaves a timeless tale of love and survival amidst a lush backdrop teeming greed and deceit. You will fall for Lia and Con and root for them with every breath you take. This is a book that will linger in your thoughts for a very long time."- Darynda Jones, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the world of Forgotten Empires from award winning author Jeffe Kennedy that begins with The Orchid Throne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A PRISONER OF FATE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Queen of the island kingdom of Calanthe, Euthalia will do anything to keep her people free—and her secrets safe—from the mad tyrant who rules the mainland. Guided by a magic ring of her father’s, Lia plays the political game with the cronies the emperor sends to her island. In her heart, she knows that it’s up to her to save herself from her fate as the emperor’s bride. But in her dreams, she sees a man, one with the power to build a better world—a man whose spirit is as strong, and whose passion is as fierce as her own…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A PRINCE AMONG MEN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conrí, former Crown Prince of Oriel, has built an army to overthrow the emperor. But he needs the fabled Abiding Ring to succeed. The ring that Euthalia holds so dear to her heart. When the two banished rulers meet face to face, neither can deny the flames of rebellion that flicker in their eyes—nor the fires of desire that draw them together. But in this broken world of shattered kingdoms, can they ever really trust each other? Can their fiery alliance defeat the shadows of evil that threaten to engulf their hearts and souls?</description>

  <description>A journalist by trade, who now suffers from an immune deficiency developed while researching this book, presents personal accounts of what happened to the people of Belarus after the nuclear reactor accident in 1986, and the fear, anger, and uncertainty that they still live with. The Nobel Prize in Literature 2015 was awarded to Svetlana Alexievich "for her polyphonic writings, a monument to suffering and courage in our time."</description>

  <description>It is winter in Area X, the mysterious wilderness that has defied explanation for thirty years, rebuffing expedition after expedition, refusing to reveal its secrets. As Area X expands, the agency tasked with investigating and overseeing it—the Southern Reach—has collapsed on itself in confusion. Now one last, desperate team crosses the border, determined to reach a remote island that may hold the answers they've been seeking. If they fail, the outer world is in peril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;Acceptance&lt;/em&gt; tunnels ever deeper into the circumstances surrounding the creation of Area X—what initiated this unnatural upheaval? Among the many who have tried, who has gotten close to understanding Area X—and who may have been corrupted by it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this last installment of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach trilogy, the mysteries of Area X may be solved, but their consequences and implications are no less profound—or terrifying.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The bone-chilling, hair-raising second installment of the Southern Reach Trilogy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After thirty years, the only human engagement with Area X—a seemingly malevolent landscape surrounded by an invisible border and mysteriously wiped clean of all signs of civilization—has been a series of expeditions overseen by a government agency so secret it has almost been forgotten: the Southern Reach. Following the tumultuous twelfth expedition chronicled in &lt;i&gt;Annihilation&lt;/i&gt;, the agency is in complete disarray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Rodríguez (aka "Control") is the Southern Reach's newly appointed head. Working with a distrustful but desperate team, a series of frustrating interrogations, a cache of hidden notes, and hours of profoundly troubling video footage, Control begins to penetrate the secrets of Area X. But with each discovery he must confront disturbing truths about himself and the agency he's pledged to serve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Authority&lt;/i&gt;, the second volume of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach trilogy, Area X's most disturbing questions are answered . . . but the answers are far from reassuring.</description>

  <description>When a tragic accident takes the life of 17-year-old Raven Roth's foster mom—and Raven's memory—she moves to New Orleans to recover and finish her senior year of high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting over isn't easy. Raven remembers everyday stuff like how to solve math equations and make pasta, but she can't remember her favorite song or who she was before the accident. And when impossible things start happening, Raven begins to think it might even be better not to know who she was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as she grows closer to her new friends, her foster sister, Max, and Tommy Torres, a guy who accepts her for who she is now, Raven has to decide if she's ready to face what's buried in the past... and the darkness building inside her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Kami Garcia and first-time graphic novel artist Gabriel Picolo comes this riveting tale of finding the strength to face who you are and learning to trust others—and yourself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A startling, moving, and innovative memoir from the National Book Award Finalist for Fiction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years Carmen Maria Machado has struggled to articulate her experiences in an abusive same-sex relationship. In this extraordinarily candid and radically inventive memoir, Machado tackles a dark and difficult subject with wit, inventiveness and an inquiring spirit, as she uses a series of narrative tropes—including classic horror themes—to create an entirely unique piece of work which is destined to become an instant classic.</description>

  <description>Clock mechanic Danny Hart knows he's being watched. But by whom, or what, remains a mystery. To make matters worse, clock towers have begun falling in India, though time hasn't Stopped yet. He'd hoped after reuniting with his father and exploring his relationship with Colton, he'd have some time to settle into his new life. Instead, he's asked to investigate the attacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After inspecting some of the fallen Indian towers, he realizes the British occupation may be sparking more than just attacks. And as Danny and Colton unravel more secrets about their past, they find themselves on a dark and dangerous path--one from which they may never return.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The city of Elendhaven sulks on the edge of the ocean. Wracked by plague, abandoned by the South, stripped of industry and left to die. But not everything dies so easily. A thing without a name stalks the city, a thing shaped like a man, with a dark heart and long pale fingers yearning to wrap around throats. A monster who cannot die. His frail master sends him out on errands, twisting him with magic, crafting a plan too cruel to name, while the monster’s heart grows fonder and colder and more cunning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These monsters of Elendhaven will have their revenge on everyone who wronged the city, even if they have to burn the world to do it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this sequel to the instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Furyborn&lt;/i&gt;, two queens, separated by a thousand years, connected by secrets and lies, must continue their fight amid deadly plots and unthinkable betrayals that will test their strength—and their hearts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rielle Dardenne has been anointed Sun Queen, but her trials are far from over. The Gate keeping the angels at bay is falling. To repair it, Rielle must collect the seven hidden castings of the saints. Meanwhile, to help her prince and love Audric protect Celdaria, Rielle must spy on the angel Corien—but his promises of freedom and power may prove too tempting to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Centuries later, Eliana Ferracora grapples with her new reality: She is the Sun Queen, humanity's long-awaited savior. But fear of corruption—fear of becoming another Rielle—keeps Eliana's power dangerous and unpredictable. Hunted by all, racing against time to save her dying friend Navi, Eliana must decide how to wear a crown she never wanted—by embracing her mother's power, or rejecting it forever.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Let the Right One In&lt;/i&gt; Takes Top Honors at Tribeca Film Festival!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is autumn 1981 when the inconceivable comes to Blackeberg, a suburb in Sweden. The body of a teenage boy is found, emptied of blood, the murder rumored to be part of a ritual killing. Twelve-year-old Oskar is personally hoping that revenge has come at long last---revenge for the bullying he endures at school, day after day.&lt;p&gt;But the murder is not the most important thing on his mind. A new girl has moved in next door---a girl who has never seen a Rubik's Cube before, but who can solve it at once. There is something wrong with her, though, something odd. And she only comes out at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Sweeping top honors at film festivals all over the globe, director Tomas Alfredsson's film of &lt;i&gt;Let the Right One In&lt;/i&gt; has received the same kind of spectacular raves that have been lavished on the book. American readers of vampire fiction will be thrilled!</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A crucial, genre-bending tale, equal parts Ned Vizzini and Patrick Ness, about the life-saving power of friendship.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solomon and Ash both experienced a traumatic event when they were twelve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ash lost all memory of that event when she fell from Solomon’s treehouse. Since then, Solomon has retreated further and further into a world he seems to have created in his own mind. One that insulates him from reality, but crawls with foes and monsters . . . in both animal and human form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Solomon slips further into the place he calls Darkside, Ash realizes her only chance to free her best friend from his pain is to recall exactly what happened that day in his backyard and face the truth—together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fearless and profound, Sam J. Miller’s follow up to his award-winning debut novel, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Starving,&lt;/em&gt; spins an intimate and impactful tale that will linger with readers.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was such a really good retelling of <i>Peter Pan</i>. It mixes mythology with a little bit of <i>Lord of the Flies</i>. The attention to the darker details and how a child could descend into being both Pan's hunter and plaything was delectable. Such a good take on this mythos and the right length too.]]>

  <description>Ivy Gamble has never wanted to be magic. She is perfectly happy with her life—she has an almost-sustainable career as a private investigator, and an empty apartment, and a slight drinking problem. It's a great life and she doesn't wish she was like her estranged sister, the magically gifted professor Tabitha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Ivy is hired to investigate the gruesome murder of a faculty member at Tabitha’s private academy, the stalwart detective starts to lose herself in the case, the life she could have had, and the answer to the mystery that seems just out of her reach.</description>

  <description>A speculative thriller in the vein of &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Power&lt;/i&gt;. Optioned by Universal and Elizabeth Banks to be a major motion picture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SURVIVE THE YEAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one speaks of the grace year. It’s forbidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Garner County, girls are told they have the power to lure grown men from their beds, to drive women mad with jealousy. They believe their very skin emits a powerful aphrodisiac, the potent essence of youth, of a girl on the edge of womanhood. That’s why they’re banished for their sixteenth year, to release their magic into the wild so they can return purified and ready for marriage. But not all of them will make it home alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Tierney James dreams of a better life—a society that doesn’t pit friend against friend or woman against woman, but as her own grace year draws near, she quickly realizes that it’s not just the brutal elements they must fear. It’s not even the poachers in the woods, men who are waiting for a chance to grab one of the girls in order to make a fortune on the black market. Their greatest threat may very well be each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With sharp prose and gritty realism, &lt;i&gt;The Grace Year&lt;/i&gt; examines the complex and sometimes twisted relationships between girls, the women they eventually become, and the difficult decisions they make in-between.</description>

  <description>When the world sees Frey, they think they see her twin sister Rafi. Frey was raised to be Rafi's double, and now she's taken on the role . . . without anyone else knowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her goal? To destroy the forces that created her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with the world watching and a rebellion rising, Frey is forced into a detour. Suddenly she is stranded on her own in Paz, a city where many of the citizens attempt to regulate their emotions through an interface on their arms. Paz is an easy place to get lost . . . and also an easy place to lose yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the city comes under a catastrophic attack, Frey must leave the shadows and enter the chaos of warfare - because there is no other way for her to find her missing sister and have her revenge against her murderous father.</description>

  <description>THE LESSON explores the nature of belief, the impact of colonialism, and asks how far are we willing to go for progress? Breaking ground as one of the first science fiction novels set in the Virgin Islands, THE LESSON is not only a thought-provoking literary work, delving deeply into allegorical themes of colonialism, but also vividly draws the community of Charlotte Amalie, wherefrom the author hails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An alien ship rests over Water Island. For five years the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands have lived with the Ynaa, a race of super-advanced aliens on a research mission they will not fully disclose. They are benevolent in many ways but meet any act of aggression with disproportional wrath. This has led to a strained relationship between the Ynaa and the local Virgin Islanders and a peace that cannot last. A year after the death of a young boy at the hands of an Ynaa, three families find themselves at the center of the inevitable conflict, witness and victim to events that will touch everyone and teach a terrible lesson.</description>

  <description>As a young mercenary, Richard followed a mysterious Magician on a quest to steal a treasure from a demon and overthrow a king. The two men started their journey as strangers, became lovers along the way, and ended as master and loyal soldier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years later, that kingdom is steadily falling into ruin and Richard has realized that time and power have twisted the Magician into more monster than man - children disappear nightly into his dungeons and the only things that leave are terrible creatures crafted in the shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save his own daughter, Richard flees into the desert wastes where magic boils beneath the sand and monsters walk the dunes in the shape of men. He will return to the burning heart of the desert and restore the demon's treasure, or die in the trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Richard doesn't know is that Ana is the key to the Magician's plans and he and his favorite monster will lay waste to the world to get her back.</description>

  <description>Katsa has been able to kill a man with her bare hands since she was eight—she’s a Graceling, one of the rare people in her land born with an extreme skill. As niece of the king, she should be able to live a life of privilege, but Graced as she is with killing, she is forced to work as the king’s thug. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She never expects to fall in love with beautiful Prince Po. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She never expects to learn the truth behind her Grace—or the terrible secret that lies hidden far away . . . a secret that could destroy all seven kingdoms with words alone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With elegant, evocative prose and a cast of unforgettable characters, debut author Kristin Cashore creates a mesmerizing world, a death-defying adventure, and a heart-racing romance that will consume you, hold you captive, and leave you wanting more.</description>

  <description>A contemporary YA novel that examines rape culture through alternating perspectives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex Craft knows how to kill someone. And she doesn’t feel bad about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years ago, when her older sister, Anna, was murdered and the killer walked free, Alex uncaged the language she knows best—the language of violence. While her own crime goes unpunished, Alex knows she can’t be trusted among other people. Not with Jack, the star athlete who wants to really know her but still feels guilty over the role he played the night Anna’s body was discovered. And not with Peekay, the preacher’s kid with a defiant streak who befriends Alex while they volunteer at an animal shelter. Not anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their senior year unfolds, Alex’s darker nature breaks out, setting these three teens on a collision course that will change their lives forever.</description>

  <description>Trouble is haunting Cassidy Blake . . . even more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She (plus her ghost best friend, Jacob, of course) are in Paris, where Cass's parents are filming their TV show about the world's most haunted cities. Sure, it's fun eating croissants and seeing the Eiffel Tower, but there's true ghostly danger lurking beneath Paris, in the creepy underground Catacombs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Cass accidentally awakens a frighteningly strong spirit, she must rely on her still-growing skills as a ghosthunter -- and turn to friends both old and new to help her unravel a mystery. But time is running out, and the spirit is only growing stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if Cass fails, the force she's unleashed could haunt the city forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two time-traveling agents from warring futures, working their way through the past, begin to exchange letters—and fall in love in this thrilling and romantic book from award-winning authors Amal-El Mohtar and Max Gladstone.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the ashes of a dying world, an agent of the Commandant finds a letter. It reads: &lt;i&gt;Burn before reading. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus begins an unlikely correspondence between two rival agents hellbent on securing the best possible future for their warring factions. Now, what began as a taunt, a battlefield boast, grows into something more. Something epic. Something romantic. Something that could change the past and the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except the discovery of their bond would mean death for each of them. There’s still a war going on, after all. And someone has to win that war. That’s how war works. Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cowritten by two beloved and award-winning sci-fi writers, &lt;i&gt;This Is How You Lose the Time War &lt;/i&gt;is an epic love story spanning time and space.</description>

  <description>A thrilling, atmospheric debut with the intensive drive of &lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gravity&lt;/em&gt; and the creeping dread of &lt;em&gt;Annihilation,&lt;/em&gt; in which a caver on a foreign planet finds herself on a terrifying psychological and emotional journey for survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Gyre Price lied her way into this expedition, she thought she’d be mapping mineral deposits, and that her biggest problems would be cave collapses and gear malfunctions. She also thought that the fat paycheck—enough to get her off-planet and on the trail of her mother—meant she’d get a skilled surface team, monitoring her suit and environment, keeping her safe. Keeping her sane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, she got Em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Em sees nothing wrong with controlling Gyre’s body with drugs or withholding critical information to “ensure the smooth operation” of her expedition. Em knows all about Gyre’s falsified credentials, and has no qualms using them as a leash—and a lash. And Em has secrets, too . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Gyre descends, little inconsistencies—missing supplies, unexpected changes in the route, and, worst of all, shifts in Em’s motivations—drive her out of her depths. Lost and disoriented, Gyre finds her sense of control giving way to paranoia and anger. On her own in this mysterious, deadly place, surrounded by darkness and the unknown, Gyre must overcome more than just the dangerous terrain and the Tunneler which calls underground its home if she wants to make it out alive—she must confront the ghosts in her own head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how come she can't shake the feeling she’s being followed?</description>

  <description>Despite the rumors about Port Lewis, Michael Gates doesn’t expect the house he rents with his sister on Foxglove Lane to be haunted. An eerie meeting with Victor Lewellyn, the resident witch-turned-demon who is bound to the property by dark magic, changes his mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael isn’t looking to start a relationship with anyone, let alone someone like Victor, but the intense attraction between them can’t be ignored. As he dives into the world of magical drug rings, demons, witches, and necromancers, Michael also grapples with the complicated past he left behind in Arizona.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A relationship might not be what he wants, but it sparks something in him he didn’t realize he needs—the chance to heal.</description>

Awkward and plain, steady and dependable. Weighed down by tragedy and hungry for love she’s sure she’ll never find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoey: the pariah. Luckless and lonely, hurting but hiding it. Aching with grief and dreaming of vanished girls. Maybe she’s broken—or maybe everyone else is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Val: the queen bee. Gorgeous and privileged, ruthless and regal. Words like silk and eyes like knives, a heart made of secrets and a mouth full of lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their stories come together on the island of Sawkill Rock, where gleaming horses graze in rolling pastures and cold waves crash against black cliffs. Where kids whisper the legend of an insidious monster at parties and around campfires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where girls have been disappearing for decades, stolen away by a ravenous evil no one has dared to fight… until now.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An Amazon Best Book of the Month! A captivating and powerful exploration of the opioid crisis—the deadliest drug epidemic in American history—through the eyes of a college-bound softball star. Edgar Award-winning author Mindy McGinnis delivers a visceral and necessary novel about addiction, family, friendship, and hope. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a car crash sidelines Mickey just before softball season, she has to find a way to hold on to her spot as the catcher for a team expected to make a historic tournament run. Behind the plate is the only place she’s ever felt comfortable, and the painkillers she’s been prescribed can help her get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pills do more than take away pain; they make her feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a new circle of friends—fellow injured athletes, others with just time to kill—Mickey finds peaceful acceptance, and people with whom words come easily, even if it is just the pills loosening her tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the pressure to be Mickey Catalan heightens, her need increases, and it becomes less about pain and more about want, something that could send her spiraling out of control.</description>

  <description>Port Lewis, a coastal town perched on the Washington cliffs, is home to Crescent Cafe, a slew of micro-breweries, a downtown packed with antique boutiques, and violent, ancient storms. Thunder shakes rooftops and lightning cuts through dark skies, but Liam Montgomery has never been afraid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night, Liam hears the scream of a kelpie, a Water horse whose cry foretells the beginning of a prophecy. Kelpies have not set foot on shore for decades, but as Liam digs into his magic and his family’s history, he uncovers a mysterious secret that could ripple into the lives of everyone around him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liam’s tea-leaves spells out murder. The life of someone he loves is on the line. An unwelcome kelpie speaks in riddles. The Queen of Water demands a sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Montgomery name is soaked in blood and secrets. Liam’s fate is sealed, but he’ll do whatever it takes to change it—even if it risks his circle, his magic, and his life.</description>

  <description>Ambassador Mahit Dzmare arrives in the center of the multi-system Teixcalaanli Empire only to discover that her predecessor, the previous ambassador from their small but fiercely independent mining Station, has died. But no one will admit that his death wasn't an accident—or that Mahit might be next to die, during a time of political instability in the highest echelons of the imperial court.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Mahit must discover who is behind the murder, rescue herself, and save her Station from Teixcalaan's unceasing expansion—all while navigating an alien culture that is all too seductive, engaging in intrigues of her own, and hiding a deadly technological secret—one that might spell the end of her Station and her way of life—or rescue it from annihilation.</description>

  <description>At twenty-three, Poe Montgomery is going nowhere. He still lives in his father’s basement and spends most of his time tagging with his friends. When an arrest lands him in debt, Poe accepts the front desk job at Permanent Ink, the tattoo shop owned by his father’s best friend, Jericho McAslan. Jericho is nearly twice Poe’s age, but with his ink and prematurely graying hair, he quickly takes the starring role in Poe’s hottest fantasies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jericho is known for his ability to transform poorly designed tattoos into works of art, but he was once as aimless and misdirected as Poe. Wanting to pay it forward the way someone once did for him, Jericho makes Poe his apprentice and is determined to keep things strictly professional. Easier said than done when Poe makes his interest—and his daddy kink—abundantly clear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jericho can’t resist Poe or their intense chemistry for long. But between the age gap, tension with Poe’s father, and Poe’s best friend calling him a sellout, they’ll need to ensure they’re both on the same page before they can rewrite their rocky start into something permanent.</description>

  <description>It's been eighteen months since the Raxter School for Girls was put under quarantine. Since the Tox hit and pulled Hetty's life out from under her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started slow. First the teachers died one by one. Then it began to infect the students, turning their bodies strange and foreign. Now, cut off from the rest of the world and left to fend for themselves on their island home, the girls don't dare wander outside the school's fence, where the Tox has made the woods wild and dangerous. They wait for the cure they were promised as the Tox seeps into everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Byatt goes missing, Hetty will do anything to find her, even if it means breaking quarantine and braving the horrors that lie beyond the fence. And when she does, Hetty learns that there's more to their story, to their life at Raxter, than she could have ever thought true.</description>

  <description>The first time the Nightmares came, it nearly cost Alice her life. Now she's trained to battle monstrous creatures in the dark dream realm known as Wonderland with magic weapons and hardcore fighting skills. Yet even warriors have a curfew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life in real-world Atlanta isn't always so simple, as Alice juggles an overprotective mom, a high-maintenance best friend, and a slipping GPA. Keeping the Nightmares at bay is turning into a full-time job. But when Alice's handsome and mysterious mentor is poisoned, she has to find the antidote by venturing deeper into Wonderland than she’s ever gone before. And she'll need to use everything she's learned in both worlds to keep from losing her head . . . literally.</description>

  <description>When Molly, home alone with her two young children, hears footsteps in the living room, she tries to convince herself it’s the sleep deprivation. She’s been hearing things these days. Startling at loud noises. Imagining the worst-case scenario. It’s what mothers do, she knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But then the footsteps come again, and she catches a glimpse of movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Suddenly Molly finds herself face-to-face with an intruder who knows far too much about her and her family. As she attempts to protect those she loves most, Molly must also acknowledge her own frailty. Molly slips down an existential rabbit hole where she must confront the dualities of motherhood: the ecstasy and the dread; the languor and the ferocity; the banality and the transcendence as the book hurtles toward a mind-bending conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;The Need&lt;/i&gt;, Helen Phillips has created a subversive, speculative thriller that comes to life through blazing, arresting prose and gorgeous, haunting imagery. Anointed as one of the most exciting fiction writers working today, &lt;i&gt;The Need&lt;/i&gt; is a glorious celebration of the bizarre and beautiful nature of our everyday lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A corrupted city. A dark dream of power.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke is a prisoner, condemned for a murder he didn’t commit. Abi is a fugitive, desperate to free him before magic breaks his mind. But as the Jardines tighten their grip on a turbulent Britain, brother and sister face a fight greater than their own.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;New alliances and old feuds will remake the nation, leaving Abi and Luke questioning everything – and everyone – they know. And as Silyen Jardine hungers for the forgotten Skill of the legendary Wonder King, the country’s darkest hour approaches. Freedom and knowledge both come at a cost. So who will pay the price?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The residents of a sleepy mountain town are rocked by troubling visions of an alternate reality in this dazzling debut that combines the family-driven suspense of Celeste Ng’s &lt;em&gt;Little Fires Everywhere&lt;/em&gt; with the inventive storytelling of &lt;em&gt;The Immortalists&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the quiet haven of Clearing, Oregon, four neighbors find their lives upended when they begin to see themselves in parallel realities. Ginny, a devoted surgeon whose work often takes precedence over her family, has a baffling vision of a beautiful co-worker in Ginny’s own bed and begins to doubt the solidity of her marriage. Ginny’s husband, Mark, a wildlife scientist, sees a vision that suggests impending devastation and grows increasingly paranoid, threatening the safety of his wife and son. Samara, a young woman desperately mourning the recent death of her mother and questioning why her father seems to be coping with such ease, witnesses an apparition of her mother healthy and vibrant and wonders about the secrets her parents may have kept from her. Cass, a brilliant scholar struggling with the demands of new motherhood, catches a glimpse of herself pregnant again, just as she’s on the brink of returning to the project that could define her career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first the visions are relatively benign, but they grow increasingly disturbing—and, in some cases, frightening. When a natural disaster threatens Clearing, it becomes obvious that the visions were not what they first seemed and that the town will never be the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There is an alternate cover edition for this ASIN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35109786-truthwitch" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In a continent on the edge of war, two witches hold its fate in their hands.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young witches Safiya and Iseult have a habit of finding trouble. After clashing with a powerful Guildmaster and his ruthless Bloodwitch bodyguard, the friends are forced to flee their home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safi must avoid capture at all costs as she's a rare Truthwitch, able to discern truth from lies. Many would kill for her magic, so Safi must keep it hidden - lest she be used in the struggle between empires. And Iseult's true powers are hidden even from herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a chance encounter at Court, Safi meets Prince Merik and makes him a reluctant ally. However, his help may not slow down the Bloodwitch now hot on the girls' heels. All Safi and Iseult want is their freedom, but danger lies ahead. With war coming, treaties breaking and a magical contagion sweeping the land, the friends will have to fight emperors and mercenaries alike. For some will stop at nothing to get their hands on a Truthwitch.</description>

  <description>Rice Moore is just beginning to think his troubles are behind him. He’s found a job protecting a remote forest preserve in Virginian Appalachia where his main responsibilities include tracking wildlife and refurbishing cabins. It’s hard work, and totally solitary—perfect to hide away from the Mexican drug cartels he betrayed back in Arizona. But when Rice finds the carcass of a bear killed on the grounds, the quiet solitude he’s so desperately sought is suddenly at risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More bears are killed on the preserve and Rice’s obsession with catching the poachers escalates, leading to hostile altercations with the locals and attention from both the law and Rice’s employers. Partnering with his predecessor, a scientist who hopes to continue her research on the preserve, Rice puts into motion a plan that could expose the poachers but risks revealing his own whereabouts to the dangerous people he was running from in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James McLaughlin expertly brings the beauty and danger of Appalachia to life. The result is an elemental, slow burn of a novel—one that will haunt you long after you turn the final page.</description>

  <description>At the Medio School for Girls, distinguished young women are trained for one of two roles in their polarized society. Depending on her specialization, a graduate will one day run a husband’s household or raise his children, but both are promised a life of comfort and luxury, far from the frequent political uprisings of the lower class. Daniela Vargas is the school’s top student, but her bright future depends upon no one discovering her darkest secret—that her pedigree is a lie. Her parents sacrificed everything to obtain forged identification papers so Dani could rise above her station. Now that her marriage to an important politico’s son is fast approaching, she must keep the truth hidden or be sent back to the fringes of society, where famine and poverty rule supreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On her graduation night, Dani seems to be in the clear, despite the surprises that unfold. But nothing prepares her for all the difficult choices she must make, especially when she is asked to spy for a resistance group desperately fighting to bring equality to Medio. Will Dani cling to the privilege her parents fought to win for her, or to give up everything she’s strived for in pursuit of a free Medio—and a chance at a forbidden love?</description>

  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer? </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The prize-winning, bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Boy, Snow, Bird&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; returns with a bewitching and inventive novel&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Influenced by the mysterious place gingerbread holds in classic children's stories—equal parts wholesome and uncanny, from the tantalizing witch's house in "Hansel and Gretel" to the man-shaped confection who one day decides to run as fast as he can—beloved novelist Helen Oyeyemi invites readers into a delightful tale of a surprising family legacy, in which the inheritance is a recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perdita Lee may appear to be your average British schoolgirl; Harriet Lee may seem just a working mother trying to penetrate the school social hierarchy; but there are signs that they might not be as normal as they think they are. For one thing, they share a gold-painted, seventh-floor walk-up apartment with some surprisingly verbal vegetation. And then there's the gingerbread they make. Londoners may find themselves able to take or leave it, but it's very popular in Druh�strana, the far-away (and, according to Wikipedia, non-existent) land of Harriet Lee's early youth. In fact, the world's truest lover of the Lee family gingerbread is Harriet's charismatic childhood friend, Gretel Kercheval—a figure who seems to have had a hand in everything (good or bad) that has happened to Harriet since they met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decades later, when teenaged Perdita sets out to find her mother's long-lost friend, it prompts a new telling of Harriet's story. As the book follows the Lees through encounters with jealousy, ambition, family grudges, work, wealth, and real estate, gingerbread seems to be the one thing that reliably holds a constant value. Endlessly surprising and satisfying, written with Helen Oyeyemi's inimitable style and imagination, it is a true feast for the reader.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When six clones join Emmaline’s prestigious boarding school, she must confront the heartbreak of seeing her dead best friend’s face each day in class.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Similars are all anyone can talk about at the elite Darkwood Academy. Who are these six clones? What are the odds that all of them would be Darkwood students? Who is the madman who broke the law to create them? Emma couldn't care less. Her best friend, Oliver, died over the summer and all she can think about is how to get through her junior year without him. Then she comes face-to-heartbreaking-face with Levi—Oliver's exact DNA replica and one of the Similars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma wants nothing to do with the Similars, but she keeps getting pulled deeper and deeper into their clique, uncovering dark truths about the clones and her prestigious school along the way. But no one can be trusted…not even the boy she is falling for who has Oliver's face.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Second in K. A. Doore's high fantasy adventure series the Chronicles of Ghadid, a determined assassin travels to the heart of the Empire in pursuit of a powerful mark, for fans of Robin Hobb, Sarah J. Maas, and S. A. Chakraborty&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thana has a huge reputation to live up to as daughter of the Serpent, who rules over Ghadid’s secret clan of assassins. Opportunity to prove herself arrives when Thana accepts her first contract on Heru, a dangerous foreign diplomat with the ability to bind a person’s soul under his control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She may be in over her head, especially when Heru is targeted by a rival sorcerer who sends hordes of the undead to attack them both. When Heru flees, Thana has no choice than to pursue him across the sands to the Empire that intends to capture Ghadid inside its iron grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A stranger in a strange city, Thana’s only ally is Mo, a healer who may be too noble for her own good. Meanwhile, otherworldly and political dangers lurk around every corner, and even more sinister plans are uncovered which could lead to worldwide devastation. Can Thana rise to the challenge—even if it means facing off against an ancient evil?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past quarter century, Seth Godin has taught and inspired millions of entrepreneurs, marketers, leaders, and fans from all walks of life, via his blog, online courses, lectures, and bestselling books. He is the inventor of countless ideas and phrases that have made their way into mainstream business language, from &lt;i&gt;Permission Marketing&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;Purple Cow&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;Tribes&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;The Dip&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, for the first time, Godin offers the core of his marketing wisdom in one accessible, timeless package. At the heart of his approach is a big idea: Great marketers don't use consumers to solve their company's problem; they use marketing to solve other people's problems. They don't just make noise; they make the world better. Truly powerful marketing is grounded in empathy, generosity, and emotional labour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book teaches you how to identify your smallest viable audience; draw on the right signals and signs to position your offering; build trust and permission with your target market; speak to the narratives your audience tells themselves about status, affiliation, and dominance; spot opportunities to create and release tension; and give people the tools to achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's time for marketers to stop lying, spamming, and feeling guilty about their work. It's time to stop confusing social media metrics with true connections. It's time to stop wasting money on stolen attention that won't pay off in the long run. &lt;i&gt;This is Marketing &lt;/i&gt;offers a better approach that will still apply for decades to come, no matter how the tactics of marketing continue to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the sequel to the acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Beasts Made of Night&lt;/i&gt;, Taj has escaped Kos, but Queen Karima will go to any means necessary—including using the most deadly magic—to track him down.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taj is headed west, but the consequences of leaving Kos behind confront him at every turn. Innocent civilians flee to refugee camps as Karima's dark magic continues to descend on the city. Taj must return, but first he needs a plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Arzu's help, Taj and Aliya make it to the village of her ancestors, home of the tastahlik—sin-eaters with Taj's same ability to both battle and call forth sins. As Taj comes to terms with his new magic, he realizes there are two very different groups of tastahlik—one using their powers for good, the other for more selfish ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aliya is struggling with her own unique capabilities. She's immersed in her work to uncover the secret to Karima's magic, but her health begins to mysteriously deteriorate. With the help of a local western mage, Aliya uncovers her true destiny—a future she's not sure she wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Taj and Aliya explore their feelings for each other and Arzu connects with her homeland, the local westerners begin to question Taj's true identity. Karima is on his heels, sending dark warnings to the little village where he's hiding. Taj will have to go back and face her before she sends her mostly deadly weapon—Taj's former best friend, Bo.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A stunning conclusion to the sci-fi romance duology by writing duo Krista &amp;amp; Becca Ritchie, &lt;i&gt;The Last Hope&lt;/i&gt; is filled with twists and turns you'll never see coming.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sacrifice all you have to survive.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imprisoned for weeks on an enemy starcraft, Franny, Court, and Mykal have sat with an unfathomable revelation. But as they fight to stay alive, escaping prison means trusting a young mysterious stranger. He knows everything about their lost histories, and when answers aren’t given freely, the bonded trio are forced to join a mission. One that will determine the fate of humanity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legend says, a baby—the first of her species—has the power to cloak and teleport planets. Tasked with retrieving the infant, Court fears the baby is just a myth, and if they fail, they’ll never find the truth about their origins. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Court and Mykal grow closer, their linked bond becomes harder to hide, and dynamics change when Franny begins to fall for someone new. Vulnerable and with no choice, the hunt for the baby sends the trio on a dangerous path to Saltare-1: a water world where their enemies can’t die and survival comes at a high cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Go Nagai’s groundbreaking horror classic that inspired the genre for decades.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hordes of demons, once thought entombed forever in the underworld, have now returned to Earth. Evil and corruption begin to seep into our world, as demons seize human hosts. Mankind’s only hope for salvation is to use the demons’ power against them–and only a pure-hearted man like Fudo Akira can do so without losing his humanity. Once little more than a crybaby, Akira now wields the terrible power of a devil, yet holds the innocent soul of a man–Devilman!</description>

  <description>Five years ago, Evelyn and Philippa Hapwell cowered from air strikes in a London bomb shelter. But that night took a turn when the sisters were transported to another realm called the Woodlands. In a forest kingdom populated by creatures out of myth and legend, they found temporary refuge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they finally returned to London, nothing had changed at all—nothing, except themselves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Ev spends her days sneaking into the woods outside her boarding school, wishing for the Woodlands. Overcome with longing, she is desperate to return no matter what it takes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philippa, on the other hand, is determined to find a place in this world. She shields herself behind a flawless exterior and countless friends, and moves to America to escape the memory of what was. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Evelyn goes missing, Philippa must confront the depth of her sister’s despair and the painful truths they’ve been running from. As the weeks unfold, Philippa wonders if Ev truly did find a way home, or if the weight of their worlds pulled her under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Content Warnings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Light Between Worlds portrays characters dealing with depression, self-harm, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation, illness and disordered eating, and the loss of a loved one. It refers to possible suicide, contains scenes of violence and war, and brief mentions may be unsettling to readers with emetophobia. If you have any questions about these warnings, or require more details, please don’t hesitate to get in touch via the contact page on the author's website.</description>

  <description>A desperate princess, a magical traveler, and a watch that binds them together with the fate of a dying world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vi Solaris is the heir to an Empire she’s barely seen. Her parents sacrificed a life with her to quell a rebellion and secure peace with a political alliance. Now, three years past when her wardship should’ve ended, Vi will do anything to be reunited with her family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Empire is faltering beneath the burden of political infighting and a deadly plague. Yet, Vi can’t help but wonder if her inability to control her magic is the true reason her parents haven’t brought her home. Suspicion becomes reality when she unleashes powers she’s not supposed to have. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powers that might well cost her the throne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Vi fights to get her magic under control, a mysterious stranger appears from across the world. He holds the keys to unlocking her full potential, but the knowledge has an unspeakable price — some truths, once seen, cannot be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All eyes are on her and Vi must make the hardest choice of her life: Play by the rules and claim her throne. Or, break them and save the world.</description>

  <description>The searing follow-up to 2018’s most celebrated fantasy debut – THE POPPY WAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the aftermath of the Third Poppy War, shaman and warrior Rin is on the run: haunted by the atrocity she committed to end the war, addicted to opium, and hiding from the murderous commands of her vengeful god, the fiery Phoenix. Her only reason for living is to get revenge on the traitorous Empress who sold out Nikan to their enemies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no other options, Rin joins forces with the powerful Dragon Warlord, who has a plan to conquer Nikan, unseat the Empress, and create a new Republic. Rin throws herself into his war. After all, making war is all she knows how to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Empress is a more powerful foe than she appears, and the Dragon Warlord’s motivations are not as democratic as they seem. The more Rin learns, the more she fears her love for Nikan will drive her away from every ally and lead her to rely more and more on the Phoenix’s deadly power. Because there is nothing she won’t sacrifice for her country and her vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sequel to R.F. Kuang’s acclaimed debut THE POPPY WAR, THE DRAGON REPUBLIC combines the history of 20th-century China with a gripping world of gods and monsters, to devastating effect.</description>

  <description>In Her Body and Other Parties, Carmen Maria Machado blithely demolishes the arbitrary borders between psychological realism and science fiction, comedy and horror, fantasy and fabulism. While her work has earned her comparisons to Karen Russell and Kelly Link, she has a voice that is all her own. In this electric and provocative debut, Machado bends genre to shape startling narratives that map the realities of women's lives and the violence visited upon their bodies. A wife refuses her husband's entreaties to remove the green ribbon from around her neck. A woman recounts her sexual encounters as a plague slowly consumes humanity. A salesclerk in a mall makes a horrifying discovery within the seams of the store's prom dresses. One woman's surgery-induced weight loss results in an unwanted houseguest. And in the bravura novella "Especially Heinous," Machado reimagines every episode of Law &amp;amp; Order: Special Victims Unit, a show we naively assumed had shown it all, generating a phantasmagoric police procedural full of doppelgangers, ghosts, and girls with bells for eyes.</description>

  <description>In these stories, Jemisin sharply examines modern society, infusing magic into the mundane, and drawing deft parallels in the fantasy realms of her imagination. Dragons and hateful spirits haunt the flooded city of New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. In a parallel universe, a utopian society watches our world, trying to learn from our mistakes. A black mother in the Jim Crow south must figure out how to save her daughter from a fey offering impossible promises. And in the Hugo award-nominated short story “The City Born Great,” a young street kid fights to give birth to an old metropolis’s soul.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;S. A. Chakraborty continues the sweeping adventure begun in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The City of Brass&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; conjuring a world where djinn summon flames with the snap of a finger and waters run deep with old magic; where blood can be dangerous as any spell, and a clever con artist from Cairo will alter the fate of a kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nahri’s life changed forever the moment she accidentally summoned Dara, a formidable, mysterious djinn, during one of her schemes. Whisked from her home in Cairo, she was thrust into the dazzling royal court of Daevabad—and quickly discovered she would need all her grifter instincts to survive there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with Daevabad entrenched in the dark aftermath of a devastating battle, Nahri must forge a new path for herself. But even as she embraces her heritage and the power it holds, she knows she’s been trapped in a gilded cage, watched by a king who rules from the throne that once belonged to her family—and one misstep will doom her tribe..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Ali has been exiled for daring to defy his father. Hunted by assassins, adrift on the unforgiving copper sands of his ancestral land, he is forced to rely on the frightening abilities the marid—the unpredictable water spirits—have gifted him. But in doing so, he threatens to unearth a terrible secret his family has long kept buried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a new century approaches and the djinn gather within Daevabad's towering brass walls for celebrations, a threat brews unseen in the desolate north. It’s a force that would bring a storm of fire straight to the city’s gates . . . and one that seeks the aid of a warrior trapped between worlds, torn between a violent duty he can never escape and a peace he fears he will never deserve.</description>

  <description>In the walled city of Kos, corrupt mages can magically call forth sin from a sinner in the form of sin-beasts – lethal creatures spawned from feelings of guilt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taj is the most talented of the aki, young sin-eaters indentured by the mages to slay the sin-beasts. But Taj’s livelihood comes at a terrible cost. When he kills a sin-beast, a tattoo of the beast appears on his skin while the guilt of committing the sin appears on his mind. Most aki are driven mad by the process, but 17-year-old Taj is cocky and desperate to provide for his family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Taj is called to eat a sin of a royal, he’s suddenly thrust into the center of a dark conspiracy to destroy Kos. Now Taj must fight to save the princess that he loves – and his own life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gritty Nigerian-influenced fantasy.</description>

He and a crew of hired mercenaries are there to monitor &lt;i&gt;Cyclo&lt;/i&gt; as she expires, and the payment for the suicide mission will mean Fenn's sister is able to live. But when he meets Hana, he's not sure how to save them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As &lt;i&gt;Cyclo&lt;/i&gt; grows sicker by the day, they unearth more secrets about the ship and the crew. But the more time they spend together, the more Hana and Fenn realize that falling for each other is what could ultimately kill them both.</description>

  <description>Fantastic Beasts meets Assassin's Creed in this epic, gripping fantasy romance from debut author Maxym M. Martineau.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exiled beast charmer Leena Edenfrell is in deep trouble. Empty pockets forced her to sell her beloved magical beasts on the black market—an offense punishable by death—and now there's a price on her head. With the realm's most talented murderer-for-hire nipping at her heels, Leena makes him an offer he can't refuse: powerful mythical creatures in exchange for her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only it were that simple. Unbeknownst to Leena, the undying ones are bound by magic to complete their contracts, and Noc cannot risk his brotherhood of assassins...not even to save the woman he can no longer live without.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year old Anna Arden was once just the magically barren girl from an elite Luminate family. Now she has broken the Binding—and Praetheria, the creatures held captive by the spell, wreak havoc across Europe. Lower-class citizens have access to magic for the first time, while other Luminates lose theirs forever. Austria and Hungary are at odds once more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Arden did not know breaking the Binding would break the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna thought the Praetheria were on her side, content and grateful to be free from the Binding. She thought her cousin Matyas's blood sacrifice to the disarm the spell would bring peace, equality, justice. She thought her future looked like a society that would let her love a Romani boy, Gabor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with the Monarchy breathing down her neck and the Praetheria intimidating her at every turn, it seems the conspiracies have only just begun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As threat of war sweeps the region, Anna quickly discovers she can't solve everything on her own. Now there's only one other person who might be able to save the country before war breaks out. The one person Anna was sure she'd never see again. A bandit. A fellow outlaw. A man known as the King of Crows. &lt;i&gt;Matyas.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In an effort to reinvigorate the paranormal investigation genre -- and his career -- Killian McKay makes the decision to livestream a ghost hunt in the house where he had his first supernatural encounter as a kid. To make sure things get interesting, he hires a witch to stir up the spirits in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the witch, Lady Ivana, turns out to be a handsome, muscular, genderfluid man named Ivan, Killian quickly realizes he underestimated just how interesting things can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivan is the real deal, a witch with herbs and spells and magic, and he knows more about ghosts than Killian ever hoped to learn. Killian wants to know everything Ivan knows, and he wants to know everything about Ivan ... but first, they have to survive the night.</description>

  <description>Tomorrow, on the beach, Baru Cormorant will look up from the sand of her home and see red sails on the horizon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Empire of Masks is coming, armed with coin and ink, doctrine and compass, soap and lies. They'll conquer Baru’s island, rewrite her culture, criminalize her customs, and dispose of one of her fathers. But Baru is patient. She'll swallow her hate, prove her talent, and join the Masquerade. She will learn the secrets of empire. She’ll be exactly what they need. And she'll claw her way high enough up the rungs of power to set her people free.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a final test of her loyalty, the Masquerade will send Baru to bring order to distant Aurdwynn, a snakepit of rebels, informants, and seditious dukes. Aurdwynn kills everyone who tries to rule it. To survive, Baru will need to untangle this land’s intricate web of treachery - and conceal her attraction to the dangerously fascinating Duchess Tain Hu.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Baru is a savant in games of power, as ruthless in her tactics as she is fixated on her goals. In the calculus of her schemes, all ledgers must be balanced, and the price of liberation paid in full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Eli Ever and Victor Vale were only medical students when their mutual discovery that near-death experiences can, under the right conditions, manifest extraordinary abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were best friends, and rivals, and then enemies. They were dead, then alive, and then---Eli killed Victor, once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so he thought---but Sydney Clarke felt otherwise, and used her own superpower to tip the scales. Now, a trio hides in the shadows, while another takes advantages of post-death life to take over the city of Merit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there can be life after death—will there be calm after vengeance, or will chaos rule?</description>

  <description>Achilles, "the best of all the Greeks," son of the cruel sea goddess Thetis and the legendary king Peleus, is strong, swift, and beautiful irresistible to all who meet him. Patroclus is an awkward young prince, exiled from his homeland after an act of shocking violence. Brought together by chance, they forge an inseparable bond, despite risking the gods' wrath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are trained by the centaur Chiron in the arts of war and medicine, but when word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, all the heroes of Greece are called upon to lay siege to Troy in her name. Seduced by the promise of a glorious destiny, Achilles joins their cause, and torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus follows. Little do they know that the cruel Fates will test them both as never before and demand a terrible sacrifice.</description>

  <description>BOY Novak turns twenty and decides to try for a brand-new life. Flax Hill, Massachusetts, isn’t exactly a welcoming town, but it does have the virtue of being the last stop on the bus route she took from New York. Flax Hill is also the hometown of Arturo Whitman –- craftsman, widower, and father of Snow. SNOW is mild-mannered, radiant and deeply cherished –- exactly the sort of little girl Boy never was, and Boy is utterly beguiled by her. If Snow displays a certain inscrutability at times, that’s simply a characteristic she shares with her father, harmless until Boy gives birth to Snow’s sister, Bird. When BIRD is born Boy is forced to re-evaluate the image Arturo’s family have presented to her, and Boy, Snow and Bird are broken apart. Sparkling with wit and vibrancy, &lt;i&gt;Boy, Snow, Bird&lt;/i&gt; is a deeply moving novel about three women and the strange connection between them. It confirms Helen Oyeyemi’s place as one of the most original and dynamic literary voices of her generation.</description>

  <description>"The tension builds page by page to a stunning climax . . . I doubt that I will ever forget it." - Whitley Strieber, author of The Hunger and The Wolfen &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"[O]ne of the most impressive explorations of a vampire mind ever written . . . a novel of considerable suspense . . . compelling and deeply original." - Darrell Schweitzer, Encyclopedia of the Vampire &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They are cool to the touch and alluringly beautiful in their ageless youth. Their laughter seduces, their brilliance beguiles. They guard the secrets of science and history, and the answers to the mysteries of life and death lie within their vastly superior knowledge. In centuries past, they were known as the Illuminati. They are the vampire. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dr. John Gladstone, a scientist in Victorian London, is thrust into their world after his carriage runs over a young man of angelic beauty named Niccolo. When Niccolo kidnaps Gladstone's child and vanishes, the doctor must go in pursuit, with the help of his daughter, Ursula, who is enticed by the lure of eternal life, and Lady Hespeth, whose demure exterior hides a dangerous obsession. Why are the vampires taking children, and what is the connection to Gladstone's experiments with a deadly virus? And how can he possibly prevail against a race of immortal beings with power and intelligence infinitely beyond his own? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Michael Talbot's The Delicate Dependency (1982) is often cited as one of the best vampire novels ever written. This highly anticipated new edition, the first since the book's original publication, includes a new foreword by Jillian Venters.</description>

  <description>A missing girl on a journey of revenge. A &lt;i&gt;Serial&lt;/i&gt;―like podcast following the clues she's left behind. And an ending you won't be able to stop talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadie hasn't had an easy life. Growing up on her own, she's been raising her sister Mattie in an isolated small town, trying her best to provide a normal life and keep their heads above water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Mattie is found dead, Sadie's entire world crumbles. After a somewhat botched police investigation, Sadie is determined to bring her sister's killer to justice and hits the road following a few meager clues to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When West McCray―a radio personality working on a segment about small, forgotten towns in America―overhears Sadie's story at a local gas station, he becomes obsessed with finding the missing girl. He starts his own podcast as he tracks Sadie's journey, trying to figure out what happened, hoping to find her before it's too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtney Summers has written the breakout book of her career. Sadie is propulsive and harrowing and will keep you riveted until the last page.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;My first time getting it in the butt was kind of weird. I think it's going to be weird for everyone's first time, though.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Jack Rothman. He's seventeen and loves partying, makeup and boys - sometimes all at the same time. His sex life makes him &lt;i&gt;the &lt;/i&gt;hot topic for the high school gossip machine. But who cares? Like Jack always says, 'it could be worse'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He doesn't actually expect that to come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after Jack starts writing an online sex advice column, the mysterious love letters he's been getting take a turn for the creepy. Jack's secret admirer knows everything: where he's hanging out, who he's sleeping with, who his mum is dating. They claim they love Jack, but not his unashamedly queer lifestyle. They need him to curb his sexuality, or they'll force him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the pressure mounts, Jack must unmask his stalker before their obsession becomes genuinely dangerous...</description>

  <description>In a freezing world, where everyone knows the day they will die, three teens break all odds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Franny Bluecastle, a tough city teen, dreams of dying in opulence, to see wealth she’s never known. Like the entire world, she believes it’s impossible to dodge a deathday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the day she does. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Court Icecastle knows wealth. He also knows pain. Spending five years in Vorkter Prison, a fortress of ice and suffering, he dreams of life beyond the people that haunt him and the world that imprisoned him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mykal Kickfall fights for those he loves. The rugged Hinterlander shares a frustrating yet unbreakable connection with Court—which only grows more lawless and chaotic as their senses and emotions connect with Franny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the threat of people learning they’ve dodged their deathdays, they must flee their planet to survive. But to do so, all three will have to hide their shared bond as they vie for a highly sought after spot in the newest mission to space. Against thousands of people far smarter, who’ll live longer, and never fear death the way that they do.</description>

  <description>Welcome to a world where nightmarish creatures reign supreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five hundred years ago, Jack made a deal with the devil. It’s difficult for him to remember much about his mortal days. So, he focuses on fulfilling his sentence as a Lantern—one of the watchmen who guard the portals to the Otherworld, a realm crawling with every nightmarish creature imaginable. Jack has spent centuries jumping from town to town, ensuring that nary a mortal—or not-so-mortal—soul slips past him. That is, until he meets beautiful Ember O’Dare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen, stubborn, and a natural-born witch, Ember feels a strong pull to the Otherworld. Undeterred by Jack’s warnings, she crosses into the forbidden plane with the help of a mysterious and debonair vampire—and the chase through a dazzling, dangerous world is on. Jack must do everything in his power to get Ember back where she belongs before both the earthly and unearthly worlds descend into chaos.</description>

  <description>Two brothers.&lt;br /&gt;Seven vices.&lt;br /&gt;One demonic possession.&lt;br /&gt;Can this relationship survive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Auben Mutze has more vices than he can deal with—six to be exact—each branded down his arm for all the world to see. They mark him as a lesser twin in society, as inferior, but there’s no way he’ll let that define him. Intelligent and outgoing, Auben’s spirited antics make him popular among the other students at his underprivileged high school. So what if he’s envious of his twin Kasim, whose single vice brand is a ticket to a better life, one that likely won’t involve Auben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The twins’ strained relationship threatens to snap when Auben starts hearing voices that speak to his dangerous side—encouraging him to perform evil deeds that go beyond innocent mischief. Lechery, deceit, and vanity run rampant. And then there are the inexplicable blood cravings. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the southern tip of an African continent that could have been, demons get up to no good during the time of year when temperatures dip and temptations rise. Auben needs to rid himself of these maddening voices before they cause him to lose track of time. To lose his mind. And to lose his . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TEMPER</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The full inside story of the breathtaking rise and shocking collapse of a multibillion-dollar startup, by the prize-winning journalist who first broke the story and pursued it to the end in the face of pressure and threats from the CEO and her lawyers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was widely seen as the female Steve Jobs: a brilliant Stanford dropout whose startup "unicorn" promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine that would make blood tests significantly faster and easier. Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at $9 billion, putting Holmes's worth at an estimated $4.7 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn't work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, Holmes had been misleading investors, FDA officials, and her own employees. When Carreyrou, working at &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal,&lt;/i&gt; got a tip from a former Theranos employee and started asking questions, both Carreyrou and the &lt;i&gt;Journal&lt;/i&gt; were threatened with lawsuits. Undaunted, the newspaper ran the first of dozens of Theranos articles in late 2015. By early 2017, the company's value was zero and Holmes faced potential legal action from the government and her investors. Here is the riveting story of the biggest corporate fraud since Enron, a disturbing cautionary tale set amid the bold promises and gold-rush frenzy of Silicon Valley.</description>

  <description>On the search for a cup of coffee before the guest lecture he's giving, Tom spies a tired, half-frozen young man who looks even more need of coffee than him. On impulse, he buys the man a cup—but an attempt to strike up conversation ends in the young man walking off, seemingly put off by Tom Walford—the tabloids’ favourite billionaire—buying him coffee. But when he reappears in Tom's lecture, all Tom knows is that he doesn't want the man slipping away a second time.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Agreeing to dinner with a man he only knows from internet gossip columns isn't the wisest decision Cin's ever made, but he wants to like the infamous Tom Walford and he can't do that if he doesn't give the man a fair chance to be likeable. Which he is, almost frustratingly so, to the point Cin wishes maybe he hadn't been so fair because he never had any intention of getting attached to Tom, who seems to come from a world far too different from his own for anything between them to last. Little does Cin know, they’ve got a lot more in common than he imagines—including their shared discomfort with their assigned genders, and all the complications that go with it.</description>

  <description>After her family is killed by corrupt warlord Aric Athair and his bloodthirsty army of Bullets, Caledonia Styx is left to chart her own course on the dangerous and deadly seas. She captains her ship, the &lt;i&gt;Mors Navis&lt;/i&gt;, with a crew of girls and women just like her, who have lost their families and homes because of Aric and his men. The crew has one mission: stay alive, and take down Aric's armed and armored fleet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Caledonia's best friend and second-in-command barely survives an attack thanks to help from a Bullet looking to defect, Caledonia finds herself questioning whether to let him join their crew. Is this boy the key to taking down Aric Athair once and for all . . . or will he threaten everything the women of the &lt;i&gt;Mors Navis&lt;/i&gt; have worked for?</description>

  <description>The biggest lie of all is the story you think you already know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The del Cisne girls have never just been sisters; they’re also rivals, Blanca as obedient and graceful as Roja is vicious and manipulative. They know that, because of a generations-old spell, their family is bound to a bevy of swans deep in the woods. They know that, one day, the swans will pull them into a dangerous game that will leave one of them a girl, and trap the other in the body of a swan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when two local boys become drawn into the game, the swans’ spell intertwines with the strange and unpredictable magic lacing the woods, and all four of their fates depend on facing truths that could either save or destroy them. Blanca &amp;amp; Roja is the captivating story of sisters, friendship, love, hatred, and the price we pay to protect our hearts.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“Takes a slice of mid-twentieth-century Americana and exposes it as an utter and ongoing gender inequality nightmare. Electric, tense, horrifying, and a righteously angry yowl.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;—Paul Tremblay, author of &lt;i&gt;A Head Full of Ghosts&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Cabin at the End of the World&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At seventeen, June Hardie is everything a young woman in 1951 shouldn’t be—independent, rebellious, a dreamer. June longs to travel, to attend college and to write the dark science fiction stories that consume her waking hours. But her parents only care about making June a better young woman. Her mother grooms her to be a perfect little homemaker while her father pushes her to marry his business partner’s domineering son. When June resists, her whole world is shattered—suburbia isn’t the only prison for &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; women…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June’s parents commit her to Burrow Place Asylum, aka the Institution. With its sickening conditions, terrifying staff and brutal “medical treatments,” the Institution preys on June’s darkest secrets and deepest fears. And she’s not alone. The Institution terrorizes June’s fragile roommate, Eleanor, and the other women locked away within its crumbling walls. Those who dare speak up disappear…or worse. Trapped between a gruesome reality and increasingly sinister hallucinations, June isn’t sure where her nightmares end and real life begins. But she does know one thing: in order to survive, she must destroy the Institution before it finally claims them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Nightingale is a beautifully constructed novel featuring out-of-this-world suspense, a classic Stephen King vibe and an edge all its own. If that wasn't enough, its powerful portrayal of gender roles and feminism makes it all too timely and important.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;—Courtney Summers, author of &lt;i&gt;Sadie&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;This Is Not a Test&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Magically gifted aristocrats rule--and commoners are doomed to serve. But a rebellion threatens the old order. The dystopian trilogy that began with &lt;i&gt;Gilded Cage&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tarnished City&lt;/i&gt; concludes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world where the lower classes must endure ten years of forced service to unfairly advantaged, magically powered rulers, a teenage boy dreams of rebellion, his older sister yearns for love and knowledge, and a dangerous young aristocrat seeks to remake the world with his dark gifts. In &lt;i&gt;Bright Ruin&lt;/i&gt;, the final book in the trilogy set in modern-day England, our heroes will lead a revolution that will transform--or destroy--the world.</description>

  <description>What happens when ideas presented as science lead us in the wrong direction? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History is filled with brilliant ideas that gave rise to disaster, and this book explores the most fascinating—and significant—missteps: from opium's heyday as the pain reliever of choice to recognition of opioids as a major cause of death in the U.S.; from the rise of trans fats as the golden ingredient for tastier, cheaper food to the heart disease epidemic that followed; and from the cries to ban DDT for the sake of the environment to an epidemic-level rise in world malaria. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are today's sins of science—as deplorable as mistaken past ideas about advocating racial purity or using lobotomies as a cure for mental illness. These unwitting errors add up to seven lessons both cautionary and profound, narrated by renowned author and speaker Paul A. Offit. Offit uses these lessons to investigate how we can separate good science from bad, using some of today's most controversial creations—e-cigarettes, GMOs, drug treatments for ADHD—as case studies. For every "Aha!" moment that should have been an "Oh no," this book is an engrossing account of how science has been misused disastrously—and how we can learn to use its power for good.</description>

  <description>Damen is a warrior hero to his people, and the rightful heir to the throne of Akielos, but when his half brother seizes power, Damen is captured, stripped of his identity, and sent to serve the prince of an enemy nation as a pleasure slave.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Beautiful, manipulative and deadly, his new master Prince Laurent epitomizes the worst of the court at Vere. But in the lethal political web of the Veretian court, nothing is as it seems, and when Damen finds himself caught up in a play for the throne, he must work together with Laurent to survive and save his country.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; For Damen, there is just one rule: never, ever reveal his true identity. Because the one man Damen needs is the one man who has more reason to hate him than anyone else . . . &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A darkly hilarious contemporary realistic young adult novel about growing up and finding your place in the world, perfect for fans of &lt;em&gt;Me and Earl and the Dying Girl&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Running With Scissors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dario Heyward knows one thing: He’s never going back to Moldavia Studios, the iconic castle that served as the set, studio, and home to the cast and crew of dozens of cult classic B-horror movies. It’s been three years since Dario’s even seen the place, after getting legally emancipated from his father, the infamous director of Moldavia’s creature features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Dario’s brother invites him home to a mysterious ceremony involving his father and a tribute to his first film—&lt;em&gt;The Curse of the Mummy’s Tongue&lt;/em&gt;. Dario swears his homecoming will be a one-time visit. A way for him to get closure on his past—and reunite with Hayley, his first love and costar of &lt;em&gt;Zombie Children of the Harvest Sun,&lt;/em&gt; a production fraught with real-life tragedy—and say good-bye for good. But the unthinkable happens—Dario gets sucked back into the twisted world of Moldavia and the horrors, both real and imagined, he’s left there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only months to rescue the sinking studio and everyone who has built their lives there, Dario must confront the demons of his past—and the uncertainties of his future. But can he escape the place that’s haunted him his whole life?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;The Assistants&lt;/i&gt; comes another gutsy book about the importance of women taking the reins—except this time, when it comes to finding sexuality, pleasure, and love sometimes where you least expect it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie Daniels is a perfection-seeking 28-year-old lawyer living the New York dream. She’s engaged to charming art curator Paul Michael, has successfully made her way up the ladder at a multinational law firm and has a hold on apartments in Soho and the West Village. Suffice it to say, she has come a long way from her Kentucky upbringing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the rug is swept from under Katie when she is suddenly dumped by her fiance, Paul Michael, leaving her devastated and completely lost. On a whim, she agrees to have a drink with Cassidy Price-a self-assured, sexually promiscuous woman she meets at work. The two form a newfound friendship, which soon brings into question everything Katie thought she knew about sex—and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;When Katie Met Cassidy&lt;/i&gt; is a romantic comedy that explores how, as a culture, while we may have come a long way in terms of gender equality, a woman’s capacity for an entitlement to sexual pleasure still remain entirely taboo. This novel tackles the question: Why, when it comes to female sexuality, are so few women figuring out what they want and then going out and doing it?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Daughter of immortals.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Princess Diana longs to prove herself to her legendary warrior sisters. But when the opportunity finally comes, she throws away her chance at glory and breaks Amazon law—risking exile—to save a mortal. Diana will soon learn that she has rescued no ordinary girl, and that with this single brave act, she may have doomed the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Daughter of death.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alia Keralis just wanted to escape her overprotective brother with a semester at sea. She doesn’t know she is being hunted by people who think her very existence could spark a world war. When a bomb detonates aboard her ship, Alia is rescued by a mysterious girl of extraordinary strength and forced to confront a horrible truth: Alia is a Warbringer—a direct descendant of the infamous Helen of Troy, fated to bring about an age of bloodshed and misery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Together.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two girls will face an army of enemies—mortal and divine—determined to either destroy or possess the Warbringer. Tested beyond the bounds of their abilities, Diana and Alia must find a way to unleash hidden strengths and forge an unlikely alliance. Because if they have any hope of saving both their worlds, they will have to stand side by side against the tide of war.</description>

  <description>Sean Suh is done with killing. After serving three years in a psychiatric prison, he’s determined to stay away from temptation. But he can't resist Annabelle--beautiful, confident, incandescent Annabelle--who alone can see past the monster to the man inside. The man he's desperately trying to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Annabelle disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean is sure she’s been kidnapped—he witnessed her being taken first hand—but the police are convinced that Sean himself is at the centre of this crime. And he must admit, his illness has caused him to “lose time” before. What if there’s more to what happened then he’s able to remember?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though haunted by the fear that it might be better for Annabelle if he never finds her, Sean can’t bring himself to let go of her without a fight. To save her, he’ll have to do more than confront his own demons… He'll have to let them loose.</description>

  <description>Victor and Eli started out as college roommates--brilliant, arrogant, lonely boys who recognized the same sharpness and ambition in each other. In their senior year, a shared research interest in adrenaline, near-death experiences, and seemingly supernatural events reveals an intriguing possibility: that under the right conditions, someone could develop extraordinary abilities. But when their thesis moves from the academic to the experimental, things go horribly wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years later, Victor breaks out of prison, determined to catch up to his old friend (now foe), aided by a young girl whose reserved nature obscures a stunning ability. Meanwhile, Eli is on a mission to eradicate every other super-powered person that he can find--aside from his sidekick, an enigmatic woman with an unbreakable will. Armed with terrible power on both sides, driven by the memory of betrayal and loss, the archnemeses have set a course for revenge--but who will be left alive at the end?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Vicious&lt;/i&gt;, V. E. Schwab brings to life a gritty comic-book-style world in vivid prose: a world where gaining superpowers doesn't automatically lead to heroism, and a time when allegiances are called into question.</description>

  <description>This fourth entry and prequel tells the story of Lundy, a very serious young girl who would rather study and dream than become a respectable housewife and live up to the expectations of the world around her. As well she should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she finds a doorway to a world founded on logic and reason, riddles and lies, she thinks she's found her paradise. Alas, everything costs at the goblin market, and when her time there is drawing to a close, she makes the kind of bargain that never plays out well.</description>

  <description>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child—not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power—the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.</description>

  <description>The people of Uztar have long looked to the sky with hope and wonder. Nothing in their world is more revered than the birds of prey and no one more honored than the falconers who call them to their fists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brysen strives to be a great falconer--while his twin sister, Kylee, rejects her ancient gifts for the sport and wishes to be free of falconry. She's nearly made it out, too, but a war is rolling toward their home in the Six Villages, and no bird or falconer will be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together the twins must journey into the treacherous mountains to trap the Ghost Eagle, the greatest of the Uztari birds and a solitary killer. Brysen goes for the boy he loves and the glory he's long craved, and Kylee to atone for her past and to protect her brother's future. But both are hunted by those who seek one thing: power.</description>

  <description>A young adult fiction anthology of 15 stories featuring contemporary, historical, and futuristic stories featuring witchy heroines who are diverse in race, class, sexuality, religion, geography, and era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Are you a good witch or a bad witch?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glinda the Good Witch. Elphaba the Wicked Witch. Willow. Sabrina. Gemma Doyle. The Mayfair Witches. Ursula the Sea Witch. Morgan le Fey. The three weird sisters from &lt;i&gt;Macbeth&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History tells us women accused of witchcraft were often outsiders: educated, independent, unmarried, unwilling to fall in line with traditional societal expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold. Powerful. Rebellious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bruja’s traditional love spell has unexpected results. A witch’s healing hands begin to take life instead of giving it when she ignores her attraction to a fellow witch. In a terrifying future, women are captured by a cabal of men crying witchcraft and the one true witch among them must fight to free them all. In a desolate past, three orphaned sisters prophesize for a murderous king. Somewhere in the present, a teen girl just wants to kiss a boy without causing a hurricane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From good witches to bad witches, to witches who are a bit of both, this is an anthology of diverse witchy tales from a collection of diverse, feminist authors. The collective strength of women working together—magically or mundanely--has long frightened society, to the point that women’s rights are challenged, legislated against, and denied all over the world. &lt;i&gt;Toil &amp;amp; Trouble&lt;/i&gt; delves deep into the truly diverse mythology of witchcraft from many cultures and feminist points of view, to create modern and unique tales of witchery that have yet to be explored.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gideon the Ninth &lt;/i&gt;is the most fun you'll ever have with a skeleton.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emperor needs necromancers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ninth Necromancer needs a swordswoman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gideon has a sword, some dirty magazines, and no more time for undead bullshit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamsyn Muir's &lt;i&gt;Gideon the Ninth&lt;/i&gt; unveils a solar system of swordplay, cut-throat politics, and lesbian necromancers. Her characters leap off the page, as skillfully animated as necromantic skeletons. The result is a heart-pounding epic science fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought up by unfriendly, ossifying nuns, ancient retainers, and countless skeletons, Gideon is ready to abandon a life of servitude and an afterlife as a reanimated corpse. She packs up her sword, her shoes, and her dirty magazines, and prepares to launch her daring escape. But her childhood nemesis won't set her free without a service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House and bone witch extraordinaire, has been summoned into action. The Emperor has invited the heirs to each of his loyal Houses to a deadly trial of wits and skill. If Harrowhark succeeds she will become an immortal, all-powerful servant of the Resurrection, but no necromancer can ascend without their cavalier. Without Gideon's sword, Harrow will fail, and the Ninth House will die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, some things are better left dead.</description>

  <description>When Rin aced the Keju, the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies, it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn’t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin’s guardians, who believed they’d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegard, the most elite military school in Nikan, was even more surprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But surprises aren’t always good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power—an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive—and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rin’s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A novice assassin is on the hunt for someone killing their own in K. A. Doore's &lt;i&gt;The Perfect Assassin&lt;/i&gt;, a breakout high fantasy beginning the Chronicles of Ghadid series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Divine justice is written in blood.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so Amastan has been taught. As a new assassin in the Basbowen family, he’s already having second thoughts about taking a life. A scarcity of contracts ends up being just what he needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until, unexpectedly, Amastan finds the body of a very important drum chief. Until, impossibly, Basbowen’s finest start showing up dead, with their murderous jaan running wild in the dusty streets of Ghadid. Until, inevitably, Amastan is ordered to solve these murders, before the family gets blamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every life has its price, but when the tables are turned, Amastan must find this perfect assassin or be their next target.</description>

  <description>Seventh-grader Tristan Strong feels anything but strong ever since he failed to save his best friend when they were in a bus accident together. All he has left of Eddie is the journal his friend wrote stories in. Tristan is dreading the month he’s going to spend on his grandparents’ farm in Alabama, where he’s being sent to heal from the tragedy. But on his first night there, a sticky creature shows up in his bedroom and steals Eddie’s journal. Tristan chases after it-–is that a doll?-–and a tug-of-war ensues between them underneath a Bottle Tree. In a last attempt to wrestle the journal out of the creature’s hands, Tristan punches the tree, accidentally ripping open a chasm into the MidPass, a volatile place with a burning sea, haunted bone ships, and iron monsters that are hunting the inhabitants of this world. Tristan finds himself in the middle of a battle that has left black American gods John Henry and Brer Rabbit exhausted. In order to get back home, Tristan and these new allies will need to entice the god Anansi, the Weaver, to come out of hiding and seal the hole in the sky. But bartering with the trickster Anansi always comes at a price. Can Tristan save this world before he loses more of the things he loves?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Gods meddle in the fates of men, men play with the fates of gods, and a pretender must be cast down from the throne in this breathtaking first fantasy novel from Ann Leckie, New York Times bestselling author and winner of the Hugo, Nebula, and Arthur C. Clarke Awards.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For centuries, the kingdom of Iraden has been protected by the god known as the Raven. He watches over his territory from atop a tower in the powerful port of Vastai. His will is enacted through the Raven's Lease, a human ruler chosen by the god himself. His magic is sustained via the blood sacrifice that every Lease must offer. And under the Raven's watch, the city flourishes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the power of the Raven is weakening. A usurper has claimed the throne. The kingdom borders are tested by invaders who long for the prosperity that Vastai boasts. And they have made their own alliances with other gods.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is into this unrest that the warrior Eolo--aide to Mawat, the true Lease--arrives. And in seeking to help Mawat reclaim his city, Eolo discovers that the Raven's Tower holds a secret. Its foundations conceal a dark history that has been waiting to reveal itself...and to set in motion a chain of events that could destroy Iraden forever.</description>

  <description>Fatima lives in the city of Noor, a thriving stop along the Silk Road. There the music of myriad languages fills the air, and people of all faiths weave their lives together. However, the city bears scars of its recent past, when the chaotic tribe of Shayateen djinn slaughtered its entire population -- except for Fatima and two other humans. Now ruled by a new maharajah, Noor is protected from the Shayateen by the Ifrit, djinn of order and reason, and by their commander, Zulfikar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when one of the most potent of the Ifrit dies, Fatima is changed in ways she cannot fathom, ways that scare even those who love her. Oud in hand, Fatima is drawn into the intrigues of the maharajah and his sister, the affairs of Zulfikar and the djinn, and the dangers of a magical battlefield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nafiza Azad weaves an immersive tale of magic and the importance of names; fiercely independent women; and, perhaps most importantly, the work for harmony within a city of a thousand cultures and cadences.</description>

  <description>Born in 1937 in a port city a thousand miles north of Shanghai, Adeline Yen Mah was the youngest child of an affluent Chinese family who enjoyed rare privileges during a time of political and cultural upheaval. But wealth and position could not shield Adeline from a childhood of appalling emotional abuse at the hands of a cruel and manipulative Eurasian stepmother. Determined to survive, Adeline struggled for independence as she moved from Hong Kong to England and eventually to the United States to become a physician and writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A compelling, moving, and ultimately triumphant story of a girl's journey into adulthood, &lt;i&gt;Falling Leaves&lt;/i&gt; is a work of heartfelt intimacy that explores the harsh realities of growing up female in a family and society that kept girls in emotional chains.</description>

In short, I liked the prose and the way Mah wove modern Chinese history throughout the narrative of her childhood. It worked to provide context for the world around her.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A three-time winner of Goodreads Choice Awards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter moves between two worlds: the poor neighborhood where she lives and the fancy suburban prep school she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Khalil was unarmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some are calling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters are taking to the streets in Khalil’s name. Some cops and the local drug lord try to intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what really went down that night? And the only person alive who can answer that is Starr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Starr does—or does not—say could upend her community. It could also endanger her life.</description>

  <description>Khaim, The Blue City, is the last remaining city in a crumbled empire that overly relied upon magic until it became toxic. It is run by a tyrant known as The Jolly Mayor and his devious right hand, the last archmage in the world. Together they try to collect all the magic for themselves so they can control the citizens of the city. But when their decadence reaches new heights and begins to destroy the environment, the people stage an uprising to stop them.</description>

  <description>In the early years of the 20th century, a group of female factory workers in Newark, New Jersey slowly died of radiation poisoning. Around the same time, an Indian elephant was deliberately put to death by electricity in Coney Island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the facts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now these two tragedies are intertwined in a dark alternate history of rage, radioactivity, and injustice crying out to be righted. Prepare yourself for a wrenching journey that crosses eras, chronicling histories of cruelty both grand and petty in search of meaning and justice.</description>

      <![CDATA[The prose in this work is something out of a poem. In this brief novella, we follow four POVs, two human and two elephant. It's about radiation and closure and will sit down right on your feelings and not get up for a while.<br /><br />Bolander writes anger so well. I really loved the moment at t...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Susan Dennard, &lt;i&gt;Sightwitch&lt;/i&gt; is an illustrated novella set in the Witchlands and told through Ryber’s journal entries and sketches.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Safi and Iseult battled a Bloodwitch...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Merik returned from the dead…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryber Fortiza was a Sightwitch Sister at a secluded convent, waiting to be called by her goddess into the depths of the mountain. There she would receive the gift of foretelling. But when that call never comes, Ryber finds herself the only Sister without the Sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years pass and Ryber’s misfit pain becomes a dull ache, until one day, Sisters who already possess the Sight are summoned into the mountain, never to return. Soon enough, Ryber is the only Sister left. Now, it is up to her to save her Sisters, though she does not have the Sight—and though she does not know what might await her inside the mountain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On her journey underground, she encounters a young captain named Kullen Ikray, who has no memory of who he is or how he got there. Together, the two journey ever deeper in search of answers, their road filled with horrors, and what they find at the end of that road will alter the fate of the Witchlands forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set a year before &lt;i&gt;Truthwitch&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sightwitch&lt;/i&gt; is a companion novella that also serves as a set up to &lt;i&gt;Bloodwitch&lt;/i&gt;, as well as an expansion of the Witchlands world.</description>

  <description>Each year, eight beautiful girls are chosen as Paper Girls to serve the king. It's the highest honor they could hope for...and the most demeaning. This year, there's a ninth. And instead of paper, she's made of fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this richly developed fantasy, Lei is a member of the Paper caste, the lowest and most persecuted class of people in Ikhara. She lives in a remote village with her father, where the decade-old trauma of watching her mother snatched by royal guards for an unknown fate still haunts her. Now, the guards are back and this time it's Lei they're after -- the girl with the golden eyes whose rumored beauty has piqued the king's interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over weeks of training in the opulent but oppressive palace, Lei and eight other girls learns the skills and charm that befit a king's consort. There, she does the unthinkable -- she falls in love. Her forbidden romance becomes enmeshed with an explosive plot that threatens her world's entire way of life. Lei, still the wide-eyed country girl at heart, must decide how far she's willing to go for justice and revenge.</description>

  <description>Frey and Rafi are inseparable . . . but very few people have ever seen them together. This is because Frey is Rafi’s double, raised in the shadows of their rich father’s fortress. While Rafi has been taught to charm, Frey has been taught to kill. Frey only exists to protect her sister. There is no other part of her life. Frey has never been out in the world on her own – until her father sends her in Rafi’s place to act as collateral for a dangerous deal. Everyone thinks she’s her sister – but Col, the son of a rival leader, is starting to get close enough to tell the difference. As the stakes grow higher and higher, Frey must decide whether she can trust him – or anyone in her life.</description>

  <description>A ship sets sail with a killer on board . . .&lt;br /&gt;1859. A man joins a whaling ship bound for the Arctic Circle. Having left the British Army with his reputation in tatters, Patrick Sumner has little option but to accept the position of ship's surgeon on this ill-fated voyage. But when, deep into the journey, a cabin boy is discovered brutally killed, Sumner finds himself forced to act. Soon he will face an evil even greater than he had encountered at the siege of Delhi, in the shape of Henry Drax: harpooner, murderer, monster . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'A tour de force' Hilary Mantel&lt;br /&gt;'Riveting and darkly brilliant' Colm Tóibín</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A breakout suspense novel from the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Haunting of Maddy Clare&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vermont, 1950. &lt;/b&gt;There's a place for the girls whom no one wants--the troublemakers, the illegitimate, the too smart for their own good. It's called Idlewild Hall. And in the small town where it's located, there are rumors that the boarding school is haunted. Four roommates bond over their whispered fears, their budding friendship blossoming--until one of them mysteriously disappears. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vermont, 2014.&lt;/b&gt; As much as she's tried, journalist Fiona Sheridan cannot stop revisiting the events surrounding her older sister's death. Twenty years ago, her body was found lying in the overgrown fields near the ruins of Idlewild Hall. And though her sister's boyfriend was tried and convicted of murder, Fiona can't shake the suspicion that something was never right about the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Fiona discovers that Idlewild Hall is being restored by an anonymous benefactor, she decides to write a story about it. But a shocking discovery during the renovations will link the loss of her sister to secrets that were meant to stay hidden in the past--and a voice that won't be silenced. . . .</description>

  <description>Sancia Grado is a thief, and a damn good one. And her latest target, a heavily guarded warehouse on Tevanne’s docks, is nothing her unique abilities can’t handle. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But unbeknownst to her, Sancia’s been sent to steal an artifact of unimaginable power, an object that could revolutionize the magical technology known as scriving. The Merchant Houses who control this magic--the art of using coded commands to imbue everyday objects with sentience--have already used it to transform Tevanne into a vast, remorseless capitalist machine. But if they can unlock the artifact’s secrets, they will rewrite the world itself to suit their aims. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Now someone in those Houses wants Sancia dead, and the artifact for themselves. And in the city of Tevanne, there’s nobody with the power to stop them. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; To have a chance at surviving—and at stopping the deadly transformation that’s under way—Sancia will have to marshal unlikely allies, learn to harness the artifact’s power for herself, and undergo her own transformation, one that will turn her into something she could never have imagined.</description>

  <description>A boy orphaned by violence grows up in the shadow of his father's murder. His older brother offers him a home, but the life of a farmer is a poor fit for Christian Richardson. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in England in the 1400s, the Wars of the Roses litters the country with plenty of jobs for a young mercenary trained in how to wield a sword. Christian grows out of his youth and becomes a capable fighter, one who inherited his father's blade. As a member of the Brotherhood of the Black Rose, he puts coins in his pockets and food in his stomach, but every day he searches for the sigil of the men who took his father's life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after years skirting the edges of a group called the Luminaries, he'll make a discovery that will put him in reach of his goal. Vengeance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sword was not the only possession his father had given to him, though, and unbeknownst to Christian, the Luminaries have been hunting for Richard's son - the boy who escaped from them nearly a decade ago - just as he has been scouring for signs of them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An almost successful attempt on his life reveals hidden gifts, and even more secrets that his father had taken to the grave. As Christian reaches the threshold of claiming revenge, he faces the realization that retribution might come at a high price. Will he listen to the pleas of his loved ones, cautioning him away from danger? Or will his pursuit for justice take him down a path from where he can never return?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Why be the sheep, when you can be the wolf?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Ismae escapes from the brutality of an arranged marriage into the sanctuary of the convent of St. Mortain, where the sisters still serve the gods of old. Here she learns that the god of Death Himself has blessed her with dangerous gifts—and a violent destiny. If she chooses to stay at the convent, she will be trained as an assassin and serve as a handmaiden to Death. To claim her new life, she must destroy the lives of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ismae’s most important assignment takes her straight into the high court of Brittany—where she finds herself woefully under prepared—not only for the deadly games of intrigue and treason, but for the impossible choices she must make. For how can she deliver Death’s vengeance upon a target who, against her will, has stolen her heart?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Ulises asked, "How can I look at these maps, see this riddle, and do nothing? They are my brothers."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elias reached across the table and flicked aside two shells with a fingertip. The map curled into itself. "It's bound to be a goose chase. You know that?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Or a treasure hunt," Ulises countered, "and you've always been good at those."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nineteen-year-old Elias is a royal explorer, a skilled mapmaker, and the new king of del Mar's oldest friend. Soon he will embark on the adventure of a lifetime, an expedition past the Strait of Cain and into uncharted waters. Nothing stands in his way...until a long-ago tragedy creeps back into the light, threatening all he holds dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people of St. John del Mar have never recovered from the loss of their boy princes, kidnapped eighteen years ago, both presumed dead. But when two maps surface, each bearing the same hidden riddle, troubling questions arise. What really happened to the young heirs? And why do the maps appear to be drawn by Lord Antoni, Elias's father, who vanished on that same fateful day? With the king's beautiful cousin by his side—whether he wants her there or not—Elias will race to solve the riddle of the princes. He will have to use his wits and guard his back. Because some truths are better left buried...and an unknown enemy stalks his every turn.</description>

  <description>Alosa's mission is finally complete. Not only has she recovered all three pieces of the map to a legendary hidden treasure, but the pirates who originally took her captive are now prisoners on her ship. Still unfairly attractive and unexpectedly loyal, first mate Riden is a constant distraction, but now he's under her orders. And she takes great comfort in knowing that the villainous Vordan will soon be facing her father's justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Vordan exposes a secret her father has kept for years, Alosa and her crew find themselves in a deadly race with the feared Pirate King. Despite the danger, Alosa knows they will recover the treasure first . . . after all, she is the daughter of the Siren Queen.</description>

  <description>Under the influence of their charismatic classics professor, a group of clever, eccentric misfits at an elite New England college discover a way of thinking and living that is a world away from the humdrum existence of their contemporaries. But when they go beyond the boundaries of normal morality they slip gradually from obsession to corruption and betrayal, and at last - inexorably - into evil.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Arram. Varice. Ozorne. In the first book in the Numair Chronicles, three student mages are bound by fate . . . fated for trouble.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arram Draper is a boy on the path to becoming one of the realm’s most powerful mages. The youngest student in his class at the Imperial University of Carthak, he has a Gift with unlimited potential for greatness–and for attracting danger. At his side are his two best friends: Varice, a clever girl with an often-overlooked talent, and Ozorne, the “leftover prince” with secret ambitions. Together, these three friends forge a bond that will one day shape kingdoms. And as Ozorne gets closer to the throne and Varice gets closer to Arram’s heart, Arram begins to realize that one day soon he will have to decide where his loyalties truly lie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Numair Chronicles, readers will be rewarded with the never-before-told story of how Numair Salmalín came to Tortall. Newcomers will discover an unforgettable fantasy adventure where a kingdom’s future rests on the shoulders of a talented young man with a knack for making vicious enemies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Act fast! The first printing of the hardcover includes a collector’s edition poster!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The thrilling conclusion to the Mask of Shadows duology that weaves a tale of magic, shadows, and most importantly, revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one of the Queen’s elite assassins, Sal finally has the power, prestige, and permission to hunt down the lords who killed their family. But Sal still has to figure out who the culprits are. They must enlist the help of some old friends and enemies while ignoring a growing distaste for the queen and that the charming Elise is being held prisoner by her father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there’s something terribly wrong in the north. Talk of the return of shadows, missing children, and magic abounds. As Sal takes out the people responsible for their ruined homeland, Sal learns secrets and truths that can’t be forgotten.</description>

  <description>A unique anthology of all-new stories that challenges authors to throw down the gauntlet in an epic genre battle and demands an answer to the age-old question: Who is more awesome—robots or fairies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rampaging robots! Tricksy fairies! Facing off for the first time in an epic genre death match!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People love pitting two awesome things against each other. &lt;i&gt;Robots vs. Fairies&lt;/i&gt; is an anthology that pitches genre against genre, science fiction against fantasy, through an epic battle of two icons. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one side, robots continue to be the classic sci-fi phenomenon in literature and media, from Asimov to &lt;i&gt;WALL-E&lt;/i&gt;, from Philip K. Dick to &lt;i&gt;Terminator&lt;/i&gt;. On the other, fairies are the beloved icons and unquestionable rulers of fantastic fiction, from Tinkerbell to Tam Lin, from &lt;i&gt;True Blood&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;Once Upon a Time&lt;/i&gt;. Both have proven to be infinitely fun, flexible, and challenging. But when you pit them against each other, which side will triumph as the greatest genre symbol of all time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There can only be one…or can there?</description>

  <description>In The Bone Witch, Tea mastered resurrection―now she's after revenge...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one knows death like Tea. A bone witch who can resurrect the dead, she has the power to take life...and return it. And she is done with her self-imposed exile. Her heart is set on vengeance, and she now possesses all she needs to command the mighty daeva. With the help of these terrifying beasts, she can finally enact revenge against the royals who wronged her―and took the life of her one true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are those who plot against her, those who would use Tea's dark power for their own nefarious ends. Because you can't kill someone who can never die...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;War is brewing among the kingdoms, and when dark magic is at play, no one is safe.</description>

  <description>In her childhood, Rose Franklin accidentally discovered a giant metal hand buried beneath the ground outside Deadwood, South Dakota. As an adult, Dr. Rose Franklin led the team that uncovered the rest of the body parts which together form Themis: a powerful robot of mysterious alien origin. She, along with linguist Vincent, pilot Kara, and the unnamed Interviewer, protected the Earth from geopolitical conflict and alien invasion alike. Now, after nearly ten years on another world, Rose returns to find her old alliances forfeit and the planet in shambles. And she must pick up the pieces of the Earth Defense Corps as her own friends turn against each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The stunningly original, must-read fantasy of 2018 follows two fiercely independent young women, centuries apart, who hold the power to save their world...or doom it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When assassins ambush her best friend, Rielle Dardenne risks everything to save him, exposing herself as one of a pair of prophesied queens: a queen of light, and a queen of blood. To prove she is the Sun Queen, Rielle must endure seven elemental magic trials. If she fails, she will be executed...unless the trials kill her first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thousand years later, the legend of Queen Rielle is a fairy tale to Eliana Ferracora. A bounty hunter for the Undying Empire, Eliana believes herself untouchable--until her mother vanishes. To find her, Eliana joins a rebel captain and discovers that the evil at the empire's heart is more terrible than she ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Rielle and Eliana fight in a cosmic war that spans millennia, their stories intersect, and the shocking connections between them ultimately determine the fate of their world--and of each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Boyhood&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Sun Is Also a Star&lt;/i&gt; in this unconventional love story by award-winning author Meredith Russo!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two kids, Morgan and Eric, are bonded for life after being born on the same day at the same time. We meet them once a year on their shared birthday as they grow and change: as Eric figures out who he is and how he fits into the world, and as Morgan makes the difficult choice to live as her true self. Over the years, they will drift apart, come together, fight, make up, and break up—and ultimately, realize how inextricably they are a part of each other.</description>

  <description>Malin’s mission to avenge her mother's murder has uncovered dangerous secrets. As a Valkyrie-in-training, Malin must slay immortals who’ve had their time, to maintain balance between humans and immortals. But her quest could destroy earth’s stability – and unleash chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when she needs to focus, her friend Asher is in grave danger. He’s been dragged into the underworld, where vengeful immortals plot revolution. Malin believes her feelings mustn’t distract from her goal – but is desperate to rescue him. So she ventures into the darkest of realms, knowing she may not survive. With new allies at her side and new enemies ahead, Malin will face terrible choices. She’ll have to keep her head – or be ruled by her heart.</description>

  <description>Two feudal kingdoms, Midland and Chuder, battle for supremacy in what will become the final clash in a century-long struggle. Spearheading the Midland forces is the Band of the Hawk, a legendary cadre of elite mercenaries led by the charismatic Griffith and with the fearless Guts as its berserker champion. The Hawks’ ferocity, courage, and fearsome skills – not to mention Guts’ enormous broadsword – are just what Midland needs to turn the bloody tide, but during the fray, Guts and Griffith’s most trusted lieutenant, Casca, fall together from a cliff into a raging river. Miraculously, both barely survive, and Guts tends to Casca’s wounds as she tells of having her life saved by Griffith, her induction into the Band of the Hawk, and her deep feelings toward Griffith. She even seems to finally be warming up to the grim Guts. But this greeting-card moment won’t last long, for Chuder warriors are on the prowl, and the only greetings they carry are on the points of their spears!</description>

  <description>Port Lewis, a coastal town perched on the Washington cliffs, is surrounded by dense woods, and is home to quaint coffee shops, a movie theater, a few bars, two churches, the local college, and witches, of course. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ryder is a witch with two secrets—one about his blood and the other about his heart. Keeping the secrets hasn’t been a problem, until a tarot reading with his best friend, Liam Montgomery, who happens to be one of his secrets, starts a chain of events that can’t be undone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dark magic runs through Ryder’s veins. The cards have prophesized a magical catastrophe that could shake the foundation of Ryder’s life, and a vicious partnership with the one person he doesn’t want to risk. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Magic and secrets both come at a cost, and Ryder must figure out what he’s willing to pay to become who he truly is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Content Warnings: Scenes of bloodletting, consuming blood, erotic bloody scenes. Death (and resurrection) of a main character and animal/pet. Explicit sexual content. Depiction of anxiety.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Between the Blade and the Heart&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in a brilliant new young adult fantasy duology inspired by Norse mythology by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Amanda Hocking.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one of Odin's Valkyries, Malin's greatest responsibility is to slay immortals and return them to the underworld. The balance of the world rests on her ability to carry out orders. But when Malin discovers that her mother spared the life of an immortal who was destined to die, her world is thrown into chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Malin wrestles with the knowledge that her mother might not be who she thought, she’s also thrust into the path of a gorgeous blue-eyed guy named Asher who needs her help slaying the rogue immortal who destroyed his family. Malin, along with her best friend and her ex-girlfriend, must decide where her loyalties lie...and whether helping Asher enact his revenge is worth the risk—to the world and to her heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Getting to Eden brought Emmett and his crewmates one step closer to their promised fortune. But surviving Eden may be the biggest reward of all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emmett Atwater thought Babel’s game sounded easy. Get points. Get paid. Go home. But it didn’t take long for him to learn that Babel’s competition was full of broken promises, none darker or more damaging than the last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Emmett and the rest of the Genesis survivors must rally and forge their own path through a new world. Their mission from Babel is simple: extract nyxia, the most valuable material in the universe, and play nice with the indigenous Adamite population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Emmett and the others quickly realize they are caught between two powerful forces—Babel and the Adamites—with clashing desires. Will the Genesis team make it out alive before it’s too late?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Keep your eyes peeled for a small black iron door.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Down the road from a working-class British pub, along the brick wall of a narrow alley, if the conditions are exactly right, you’ll find the entrance to Slade House. A stranger will greet you by name and invite you inside. At first, you won’t want to leave. Later, you’ll find that you can’t. Every nine years, the house’s residents — an odd brother and sister — extend a unique invitation to someone who’s different or lonely: a precocious teenager, a recently divorced policeman, a shy college student. But what really goes on inside Slade House? For those who find out, it’s already too late...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Spanning five decades, from the last days of the 1970s to the present, leaping genres, and barreling toward an astonishing conclusion, this intricately woven novel will pull you into a reality-warping new vision of the haunted house story—as only David Mitchell could imagine it.</description>

  <description>When Rini lands with a literal splash in the pond behind Eleanor West's Home for Wayward Children, the last thing she expects to find is that her mother, Sumi, died years before Rini was even conceived. But Rini can’t let Reality get in the way of her quest – not when she has an entire world to save! (Much more common than one would suppose.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If she can't find a way to restore her mother, Rini will have more than a world to save: she will never have been born in the first place. And in a world without magic, she doesn’t have long before Reality notices her existence and washes her away. Good thing the student body is well-acquainted with quests...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tale of friendship, baking, and derring-do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: May contain nuts.</description>

  <description>Twin sisters Jack and Jill were seventeen when they found their way home and were packed off to Eleanor West’s Home for Wayward Children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of what happened first…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacqueline was her mother’s perfect daughter—polite and quiet, always dressed as a princess. If her mother was sometimes a little strict, it’s because crafting the perfect daughter takes discipline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jillian was her father’s perfect daughter—adventurous, thrill-seeking, and a bit of a tom-boy. He really would have preferred a son, but you work with what you've got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were five when they learned that grown-ups can’t be trusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were twelve when they walked down the impossible staircase and discovered that the pretense of love can never be enough to prepare you a life filled with magic in a land filled with mad scientists and death and &lt;i&gt;choices&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>To save his daughter, he'll go anywhere—and any-when…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kin Stewart is an everyday family man: working in I.T., trying to keep the spark in his marriage, and struggling to connect with his teenage daughter, Miranda. But his current life is a far cry from his previous career as a time-traveling secret agent from 2142.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stranded in suburban San Francisco since the 1990s after a botched mission, Kin has kept his past hidden from everyone around him, despite the increasing blackouts and memory loss affecting his time-traveler's brain. Until one afternoon, his “rescue” team arrives—eighteen years too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their mission: return Kin to 2142 where he's only been gone weeks, not years, and where another family is waiting for him. A family he can’t remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torn between two lives, Kin is desperate for a way to stay connected to both. But when his best efforts threaten to destroy the agency and even history itself, his daughter’s very existence is at risk. It'll take one final trip across time to save Miranda—even if it means breaking all the rules of time travel in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A uniquely emotional genre-bending debut, Here and Now and Then captures the perfect balance of heart, playfulness, and imagination, offering an intimate glimpse into the crevices of a father’s heart, and its capacity to stretch across both space and time to protect the people that mean the most.</description>

  <description>A congressman's daughter who has to be perfect. A star quarterback with a secret. A guy who's tired of being ignored. A clarinet player who's done trying to fit in. An orphaned rebel who wants to teach someone a lesson. A guy who wants people to see &lt;i&gt;him,&lt;/i&gt; not his religion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They couldn't be more different, but before the morning's over, they'll all be trapped in a school that's been rocked by a bombing. When they hear that someone inside is the bomber, they'll also be looking to one another for answers.</description>

  <description>"I need Owen to explain this. Because yes, I do know that Owen would never do that, but I also know Hannah would never lie about something like that."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mara and Owen are about as close as twins can get. So when Mara's friend Hannah accuses Owen of rape, Mara doesn't know what to think. Can the brother she loves really be guilty of such a violent crime? Torn between the family she loves and her own sense of right and wrong, Mara is feeling lost, and it doesn't help that things have been strained with her ex-girlfriend and best friend since childhood, Charlie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Mara, Hannah, and Charlie navigate this new terrain, Mara must face a trauma from her own past and decide where Charlie fits in her future. With sensitivity and openness, this timely novel confronts the difficult questions surrounding consent, victim blaming, and sexual assault.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Eelyn’s world is war. Raised to fight alongside her Aska clansmen in a generations-old blood feud against the Riki, her life is brutal but simple: fight and survive. Until the day she sees the impossible on the battlefield—her brother, fighting with the enemy—the brother she watched die five years ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faced with her brother's betrayal, she must survive the winter in the mountains with the Riki if she wants to make it back to the fjord after the thaw. But when she begins to see herself in the people she's been taught to hate, the world Eelyn once knew begins to crumble. And after the village is raided by a ruthless clan many believe to be a myth, Eelyn is given no choice but to trust Fiske, her brother’s friend who has tried more than once to kill her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they must end the blood feud between their clans or watch their people be slaughtered. A lush, Viking-age inspired fantasy about loyalty, forgiveness, and the definition of family.'</description>

  <description>What do you really do when you shop? The answers are fascinating and, for retailers, they're cash in the bank. In &lt;i&gt;Inside the Mind of the Shopper: The Science of Retailing&lt;/i&gt;, world-renowned retail consultant Dr. Herb Sorensen, Ph.D. uncovers the truth about the retail shopper and rips away the myths and mistakes that lead retailers to miss their greatest opportunities. Every year, says Sorensen, shoppers will spend a quadrillion seconds in supermarkets and they'll waste 80% of that time. Sorensen analyzes consumer behavior-how shoppers make buying decisions as they move through supermarkets and other retail stores-and presents powerful, tested strategies for designing more effective stores, improving merchandising, and driving double-digit sales increases. He identifies simple interventions that can have dramatic sales effects, and shows why many common strategies simply don't work. You'll learn how to appeal to the "quick trip" shopper; make the most of all three "moments of truth"; understand consumers' powerful in-store migration patterns; improve collaboration between manufacturers and retailers; learn the lessons of Stew Leonard's and other innovators; and much more. Then, in Part II, Sorensen presents revealing interviews with several leading in-store retail experts, including crucial insights on using technology and retailing to multicultural communities.</description>

  <description>Raw, captivating, and undeniably real, Nic Stone joins industry giants Jason Reynolds and Walter Dean Myers as she boldly tackles American race relations in this stunning debut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justyce McAllister is top of his class and set for the Ivy League—but none of that matters to the police officer who just put him in handcuffs. And despite leaving his rough neighborhood behind, he can't escape the scorn of his former peers or the ridicule of his new classmates. Justyce looks to the teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for answers. But do they hold up anymore? He starts a journal to Dr. King to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then comes the day Justyce goes driving with his best friend, Manny, windows rolled down, music turned up—way up, sparking the fury of a white off-duty cop beside them. Words fly. Shots are fired. Justyce and Manny are caught in the crosshairs. In the media fallout, it's Justyce who is under attack.</description>

  <description>On a floating junkyard beneath a radiation sky, a deadly secret lies buried in the scrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve isn’t looking for secrets—she’s too busy looking over her shoulder. The robot gladiator she’s just spent six months building has been reduced to a smoking wreck, and the only thing keeping her Grandpa from the grave was the fistful of credits she just lost to the bookies. To top it off, she’s discovered she can destroy electronics with the power of her mind, and the puritanical Brotherhood are building a coffin her size. If she’s ever had a worse day, Eve can’t remember it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Eve discovers the ruins of an android boy named Ezekiel in the scrap pile she calls home, her entire world comes crashing down. With her best friend Lemon Fresh and her robotic conscience, Cricket, in tow, she and Ezekiel will trek across deserts of irradiated glass, infiltrate towering megacities and scour the graveyard of humanity’s greatest folly to save the ones Eve loves, and learn the dark secrets of her past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if those secrets were better off staying buried.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A debut novel based on the true story of the iconic painter, Artemisia Gentileschi.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her mother died when she was twelve, and suddenly Artemisia Gentileschi had a stark choice: a life as a nun in a convent or a life grinding pigment for her father's paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She chose paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time she was seventeen, Artemisia did more than grind pigment. She was one of Rome's most talented painters, even if no one knew her name. But Rome in 1610 was a city where men took what they wanted from women, and in the aftermath of rape Artemisia faced another terrible choice: a life of silence or a life of truth, no matter the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He will not consume&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;my every thought.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I am a painter.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I will paint.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I will show you&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;what a woman can do.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In the kingdom of Sempera, time is currency—extracted from blood, bound to iron, and consumed to add time to one’s own lifespan. The rich aristocracy, like the Gerlings, tax the poor to the hilt, extending their own lives by centuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one resents the Gerlings more than Jules Ember. A decade ago, she and her father were servants at Everless, the Gerlings’ palatial estate, until a fateful accident forced them to flee in the dead of night. When Jules discovers that her father is dying, she knows that she must return to Everless to earn more time for him before she loses him forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But going back to Everless brings more danger—and temptation—than Jules could have ever imagined. Soon she’s caught in a tangle of violent secrets and finds her heart torn between two people she thought she’d never see again. Her decisions have the power to change her fate—and the fate of time itself.</description>

  <description>Area X has been cut off from the rest of the world for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; the second expedition ended in mass suicide, the third in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another. The members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within weeks, all had died of cancer. In &lt;i&gt;Annihilation&lt;/i&gt;, the first volume of Jeff VanderMeer's &lt;i&gt;Southern Reach Trilogy&lt;/i&gt;, we join the twelfth expedition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, record all observations of their surroundings and of one another, and, above all, avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers—but it’s the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything.</description>

  <description>Princess Lira is siren royalty and the most lethal of them all. With the hearts of seventeen princes in her collection, she is revered across the sea. Until a twist of fate forces her to kill one of her own. To punish her daughter, the Sea Queen transforms Lira into the one thing they loathe most—a human. Robbed of her song, Lira has until the winter solstice to deliver Prince Elian’s heart to the Sea Queen or remain a human forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ocean is the only place Prince Elian calls home, even though he is heir to the most powerful kingdom in the world. Hunting sirens is more than an unsavory hobby—it’s his calling. When he rescues a drowning woman in the ocean, she’s more than what she appears. She promises to help him find the key to destroying all of sirenkind for good—But can he trust her? And just how many deals will Elian have to barter to eliminate mankind’s greatest enemy?</description>

  <description>The city of Parole is burning. Like Venice slips into the sea, Parole crumbles into fire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire population inside has been quarantined, cut off from the rest of the world, and left to die - directly over the open flame. Eye in the Sky, a deadly and merciless police force ensures no one escapes. Ever. All that’s keeping Parole alive is faith in the midst of horrors and death, trust in the face of desperation… and their fantastic, terrifying, and beautiful superhuman abilities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regan, stealth and reconnaissance expert with a lizard's scales and snake's eyes, is haunted by ten years of anxiety, trauma and terror, and he’s finally reached his limit. His ability to disappear into thin air isn’t enough: he needs an escape, and he’ll do anything for a chance. Unluckily for him, Hans, a ghostly boy with a chilling smile, knows just the thing to get one. It starts with a little murder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But instead of ending a man’s life, Regan starts a new one of his own. He turns away from that twisted path, and runs into Evelyn, fearless force on stage and sonic-superheroic revolutionary on the streets. Now Regan has a choice - and a chance to not only escape from Parole, but unravel the mystery deep in its burning heart. And most of all, discover the truth about their own entwining pasts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They join forces with Evelyn’s family: the virtuosic but volatile Danae, who breathes life into machines, and her wife Rose, whose compassionate nature and power over healing vines and defensive thorns will both be vital to survive this nightmare. Then there’s Zilch, a cool and level-headed person made of other dead people, and Finn, one of Parole’s few remaining taxi drivers, who causes explosions whenever he feels anything but happy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Separately they’d never survive, much less uncover the secret of Parole’s eternally-burning fire. Together, they have a chance. Unfortunately, Hans isn’t above playing dirty, lying, cheating, manipulating… and holding Regan’s memories hostage until he gets his way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parole’s a rough place to live. But they’re not dead yet. If they can survive the imminent cataclysmic disaster, they might just stay that way…</description>

  <description>In the early 20th Century, the United States government concocted a plan to import hippopotamuses into the marshlands of Louisiana to be bred and slaughtered as an alternative meat source. This is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other true things about hippos: they are savage, they are fast, and their jaws can snap a man in two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a terrible plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contained within this volume is an 1890s America that might have been: a bayou overrun by feral hippos and mercenary hippo wranglers from around the globe. It is the story of Winslow Houndstooth and his crew. It is the story of their fortunes. It is the story of &lt;i&gt;his &lt;/i&gt;revenge.</description>

Here, graveyards, castles and secret passageways teem with restless phantoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Cass meets a girl who shares her "gift", she realizes how much she still has to learn about the Veil—and herself. And she'll have to learn fast. The city of ghosts is more dangerous than she ever imagined.</description>

The Republic of Rome is on a relentless march to create an empire―an empire built on the backs of the conquered, brought back to Rome as slaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attia was once destined to rule as the queen and swordmaiden of Thrace, the greatest warrior kingdom the world had seen since Sparta. Now she is a slave, given to Xanthus, the Champion of Rome, as a sign of his master’s favor. Enslaved as a child, Xanthus is the preeminent gladiator of his generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against all odds, Attia and Xanthus form a tentative bond. A bond that will spark a rebellion. A rebellion that threatens to bring the Roman Republic to its end―and gives rise to the legend of Spartacus...</description>

  <description>A skilled painter must stand up to the ancient power of the faerie courts—even as she falls in love with a faerie prince—in this gorgeous debut novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isobel is a prodigy portrait artist with a dangerous set of clients: the sinister fair folk, immortal creatures who cannot bake bread, weave cloth, or put a pen to paper without crumbling to dust. They crave human Craft with a terrible thirst, and Isobel’s paintings are highly prized. But when she receives her first royal patron—Rook, the autumn prince—she makes a terrible mistake. She paints mortal sorrow in his eyes—a weakness that could cost him his life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Furious and devastated, Rook spirits her away to the autumnlands to stand trial for her crime. Waylaid by the Wild Hunt’s ghostly hounds, the tainted influence of the Alder King, and hideous monsters risen from barrow mounds, Isobel and Rook depend on one another for survival. Their alliance blossoms into trust, then love—and that love violates the fair folks’ ruthless laws. Now both of their lives are forfeit, unless Isobel can use her skill as an artist to fight the fairy courts. Because secretly, her Craft represents a threat the fair folk have never faced in all the millennia of their unchanging lives: for the first time, her portraits have the power to make them feel.</description>

In a scant number of pages, there's great character development with little info dumping. Looking to seeing where the rest of the world takes these two.]]>

  <description>After the climate wars, a floating city is constructed in the Arctic Circle, a remarkable feat of mechanical and social engineering, complete with geothermal heating and sustainable energy. The city’s denizens have become accustomed to a roughshod new way of living, however, the city is starting to fray along the edges—crime and corruption have set in, the contradictions of incredible wealth alongside direst poverty are spawning unrest, and a new disease called “the breaks” is ravaging the population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a strange new visitor arrives—a woman riding an orca, with a polar bear at her side—the city is entranced. The “orcamancer,” as she’s known, very subtly brings together four people—each living on the periphery—to stage unprecedented acts of resistance. By banding together to save their city before it crumbles under the weight of its own decay, they will learn shocking truths about themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blackfish City&lt;/i&gt; is a remarkably urgent—and ultimately very hopeful—novel about political corruption, organized crime, technology run amok, the consequences of climate change, gender identity, and the unifying power of human connection.</description>

  <description>A searing #OwnVoices coming-of-age debut in which an Indian-American Muslim teen confronts Islamophobia and a reality she can neither explain nor escape—perfect for fans of Angie Thomas, Jacqueline Woodson, and Adam Silvera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American-born seventeen-year-old Maya Aziz is torn between worlds. There’s the proper one her parents expect for their good Indian daughter: attending a college close to their suburban Chicago home, and being paired off with an older Muslim boy her mom deems “suitable.” And then there is the world of her dreams: going to film school and living in New York City—and maybe (just maybe) pursuing a boy she’s known from afar since grade school, a boy who’s finally falling into her orbit at school.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s also the real world, beyond Maya’s control. In the aftermath of a horrific crime perpetrated hundreds of miles away, her life is turned upside down. The community she’s known since birth becomes unrecognizable; neighbors and classmates alike are consumed with fear, bigotry, and hatred. Ultimately, Maya must find the strength within to determine where she truly belongs.</description>

  <description>The company says Otherworld is amazing — like nothing you’ve ever seen before. They say it’s addictive — that you’ll want to stay forever. They promise Otherworld will make all your dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simon thought Otherworld was a game. Turns out he knew nothing. Otherworld is the next phase of reality. It’s everything you’ve ever wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it’s about to change humanity forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the Otherworld. No one could have seen it coming.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;All that glitters is not gold.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York City, 2118. Manhattan is home to a thousand-story supertower, a breathtaking marvel that touches the sky. But amid high-tech luxury and futuristic glamour, five teenagers are keeping dangerous secrets…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leda is haunted by memories of what happened on the worst night of her life. She’ll do anything to make sure the truth stays hidden—even if it means trusting her enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watt just wants to put everything behind him…until Leda forces him to start hacking again. Will he do what it takes to be free of her for good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rylin wins a scholarship to an upper-floor school, her life transforms overnight. But being there also means seeing the boy whose heart she broke, and who broke hers in return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avery is tormented by her love for the one person in the world she can never have. She’s desperate to be with him…no matter the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there’s Calliope, the mysterious, bohemian beauty who arrives in New York determined to cause a stir. And she knows exactly where to begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But unbeknownst to them all, someone is watching their every move, someone with revenge in mind. After all, in a world of such dazzling heights, just one wrong step can mean a devastating fall.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The magical adventure begun in &lt;i&gt;The Bear and the Nightingale&lt;/i&gt; continues as brave Vasya, now a young woman, is forced to choose between marriage or life in a convent and instead flees her home—but soon finds herself called upon to help defend the city of Moscow when it comes under siege.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orphaned and cast out as a witch by her village, Vasya’s options are few: resign herself to life in a convent, or allow her older sister to make her a match with a Moscovite prince. Both doom her to life in a tower, cut off from the vast world she longs to explore. So instead she chooses adventure, disguising herself as a boy and riding her horse into the woods. When a battle with some bandits who have been terrorizing the countryside earns her the admiration of the Grand Prince of Moscow, she must carefully guard the secret of her gender to remain in his good graces—even as she realizes his kingdom is under threat from mysterious forces only she will be able to stop.</description>

But Amanda's terrified that once she tells him the truth, he won't be able to see past it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the secret that Amanda's been keeping? It's that at her old school, she used to be Andrew. Will the truth cost Amanda her new life, and her new love? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meredith Russo's If I Was Your Girl is a universal story about feeling different and a love story that everyone will root for.</description>

  <description>Rumor Mora fears two things: hellhounds too strong for him to kill, and failure. Jude Welton has two dreams: for humans to stop killing monsters, and for his strange abilities to vanish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in no reality should a boy raised to love monsters fall for a boy raised to kill them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nyx Llorca keeps two secrets: the moon speaks to her, and she’s in love with Dahlia, her best friend. Braeden Tennant wants two things: to get out from his mother's shadow, and to unlearn Epsilon's darkest secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’ll both have to commit treason to find the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During one twenty-seven-hour night, if they can’t stop the war between the colonies and the monsters from becoming a war of extinction, the things they wish for will never come true, and the things they fear will be all that’s left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;27 Hours&lt;/em&gt; is a sweeping, thrilling story featuring a stellar cast of queer teenagers battling to save their homes and possibly every human on Sahara as the clock ticks down to zero.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this highly anticipated sequel to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling &lt;em&gt;The Gentleman’s Guide to Vice and Virtue&lt;/em&gt;, Felicity Montague must use all her womanly wits and wiles to achieve her dreams of becoming a doctor—even if she has to scheme her way across Europe to do it. A must-have for fans of Mackenzi Lee’s extraordinary and Stonewall Honor-winning novel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year after an accidentally whirlwind grand tour with her brother Monty, Felicity Montague has returned to England with two goals in mind—avoid the marriage proposal of a lovestruck suitor from Edinburgh and enroll in medical school. However, her intellect and passion will never be enough in the eyes of the administrators, who see men as the sole guardians of science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then a window of opportunity opens—a doctor she idolizes is marrying an old friend of hers in Germany. Felicity believes if she could meet this man he could change her future, but she has no money of her own to make the trip. Luckily, a mysterious young woman is willing to pay Felicity’s way, so long as she’s allowed to travel with Felicity disguised as her maid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of her suspicions, Felicity agrees, but once the girl’s true motives are revealed, Felicity becomes part of a perilous quest that leads them from the German countryside to the promenades of Zurich to secrets lurking beneath the Atlantic.</description>

  <description>In Velocity: From the Front Line to the Bottom Line, retail automotive expert Dale Pollak reveals how dealers in today's pre-owned automotive marketplace can shift out of low gear toward accelerated profits. Today's dealers are facing increased competition brought on by Internet shopping. Pollak delivers a gut check to dealers employing traditional used car disciplines while revealing new strategies that turn money-losing departments into profit-generating winners. "The used vehicle marketplace is less giving and less forgiving than it's ever been before. Astute, investment-minded management processes are essential for today's dealers to survive and thrive," says Pollak.</description>

  <description>Travelling on the Orient Express, Poirot is approached by a desperate American named Ratchett. Afraid that someone plans to kill him, Ratchett asks Poirot for help. Sadly the very next day Ratchett's worst fears become reality, when he is found dead in his cabin, a victim of multiple stab wounds. With nothing but a scrap of paper to go on, Poirot must piece together Ratchett’s identity before he can establish which of his fellow passengers murdered him.</description>

  <description>Magical jade—mined, traded, stolen, and killed for—is the lifeblood of the island of Kekon. For centuries, honorable Green Bone warriors like the Kaul family have used it to enhance their abilities and defend the island from foreign invasion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the war is over and a new generation of Kauls vies for control of Kekon's bustling capital city. They care about nothing but protecting their own, cornering the jade market, and defending the districts under their protection. Ancient tradition has little place in this rapidly changing nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a powerful new drug emerges that lets anyone—even foreigners—wield jade, the simmering tension between the Kauls and the rival Ayt family erupts into open violence. The outcome of this clan war will determine the fate of all Green Bones—from their grandest patriarch to the lowliest motorcycle runner on the streets—and of Kekon itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jade City&lt;/i&gt; begins an epic tale of family, honor, and those who live and die by the ancient laws of jade and blood.</description>

  &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37834800-siege-and-storm" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alternative Cover Edition #1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Darkness never dies.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunted across the True Sea, haunted by the lives she took on the Fold, Alina must try to make a life with Mal in an unfamiliar land, all while keeping her identity as the Sun Summoner a secret. But she can’t outrun her past or her destiny for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Darkling has emerged from the Shadow Fold with a terrifying new power and a dangerous plan that will test the very boundaries of the natural world. With the help of a notorious privateer, Alina returns to the country she abandoned, determined to fight the forces gathering against Ravka. But as her power grows, Alina slips deeper into the Darkling’s game of forbidden magic, and farther away from Mal. Somehow, she will have to choose between her country, her power, and the love she always thought would guide her—or risk losing everything to the oncoming storm.</description>

  <description>Nathaniel Brill spent most of his life surrounded by the safety of his parents farm. When the offer of a job aboard a luxury ocean liner came his way, he jumped at the chance. But as his year long contract with the orchestra draws to a close, he's finding that his job isn't the adventure he thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Majestic is approaching London and Nathaniel is looking forward to a few days on solid ground to figure out his next steps. He just has to make it through his last big performance and everything should work out fine. Right? Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mysterious stranger, drunken band mates, and a run-in with airship pirates bring him way more excitement than he could have ever imagined.</description>

  <description>Emmett Atwater isn’t just leaving Detroit; he’s leaving Earth. Why the Babel Corporation recruited &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; is a mystery, but the number of zeroes on their contract has him boarding their lightship and hoping to return to Earth with enough money to take care of his family.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forever.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before long, Emmett discovers that he is one of ten recruits, all of whom have troubled pasts and are a long way from home. Now each recruit must earn the right to travel down to the planet of Eden—a planet that Babel has kept hidden—where they will mine a substance called Nyxia that has quietly become the most valuable material in the universe.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Babel’s ship is full of secrets. And Emmett will face the ultimate choice: win the fortune at any cost, or find a way to fight that won’t forever compromise what it means to be human.</description>

  <description>Frozen meets The Bloody Chamber in this feminist fantasy reimagining of the Snow White fairytale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At sixteen, Mina's mother is dead, her magician father is vicious, and her silent heart has never beat with love for anyone has never beat at all, in fact, but shed always thought that fact normal. She never guessed that her father cut out her heart and replaced it with one of glass. When she moves to Whitespring Castle and sees its king for the first time, Mina forms a plan: win the kings heart with her beauty, become queen, and finally know love. The only catch is that shell have to become a stepmother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen-year-old Lynet looks just like her late mother, and one day she discovers why: a magician created her out of snow in the dead queens image, at her fathers order. But despite being the dead queen made flesh, Lynet would rather be like her fierce and regal stepmother, Mina. She gets her wish when her father makes Lynet queen of the southern territories, displacing Mina. Now Mina is starting to look at Lynet with something like hatred, and Lynet must decide what to do and who to be to win back the only mother shes ever known or else defeat her once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entwining the stories of both Lynet and Mina in the past and present, Girls Made of Snow and Glass traces the relationship of two young women doomed to be rivals from the start. Only one can win all, while the other must lose everything unless both can find a way to reshape themselves and their story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"In Girls Made of Snow and Glass, Melissa Bashardoust has given us exquisite displays of magic, complex mother-daughter relationships, and gloriously powerful women triumphing in a world that does not want them to be powerful. A gorgeous, feminist fairy tale." -Traci Chee, New York Times bestselling author of "The Reader"</description>

Under the orders of a ruthless king, maji were killed, leaving Zélie without a mother and her people without hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Zélie has one chance to bring back magic and strike against the monarchy. With the help of a rogue princess, Zélie must outwit and outrun the crown prince, who is hell-bent on eradicating magic for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danger lurks in Orïsha, where snow leoponaires prowl and vengeful spirits wait in the waters. Yet the greatest danger may be Zélie herself as she struggles to control her powers and her growing feelings for an enemy.</description>

  <description>An epic fantasy debut, The Empire’s Ghost weaves together the lives of the haves and the have-nots both desperately fighting to reassemble the remains of a fallen empire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The empire of Elesthene once spanned a continent, but its rise heralded the death of magic. It tore itself apart from within, leaving behind a patchwork of kingdoms struggling to rebuild. But when a new dictator, the ambitious and enigmatic Imperator Elgar, seizes power in the old capital and seeks to recreate the lost empire anew, the other kingdoms have little hope of stopping him. Prince Kelken of Reglay finds himself at odds with his father at his country’s darkest hour; the marquise of Esthrades is unmatched in politics and strategy, but she sits at a staggering military disadvantage. And Issamira, the most powerful of the free countries, has shut itself off from the conflict, thrown into confusion by the disappearance of its crown prince and the ensuing struggle for succession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything seems aligned in Elgar’s favor, but when he presses a band of insignificant but skilled alley-dwellers into his service for a mission of the greatest secrecy, they find an unexpected opportunity to alter the balance of power in the war. Through their actions and those of the remaining royals, they may uncover not just a way to defeat Elgar, but also a deeper truth about their world’s lost history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isabelle Steiger has crafted a powerful and masterful debut with The Empire's Ghost, the first book in a haunting new epic fantasy series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One man’s thrilling journey through an enchanted world to find his wife, who has disappeared after seemingly committing an unforgiveable act of violence, from the award-winning author of the &lt;i&gt;The Devil in Silver&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Big Machine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apollo Kagwa has had strange dreams that have haunted him since childhood. An antiquarian book dealer with a business called Improbabilia, he is just beginning to settle into his new life as a committed and involved father, unlike his own father who abandoned him, when his wife Emma begins acting strange. Disconnected and uninterested in their new baby boy, Emma at first seems to be exhibiting all the signs of post-partum depression, but it quickly becomes clear that her troubles go far beyond that. Before Apollo can do anything to help, Emma commits a horrific act—beyond any parent’s comprehension—and vanishes, seemingly into thin air. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus begins Apollo’s odyssey through a world he only thought he understood to find a wife and child who are nothing like he’d imagined. His quest begins when he meets a mysterious stranger who claims to have information about Emma’s whereabouts. Apollo then begins a journey that takes him to a forgotten island in the East River of New York City, a graveyard full of secrets, a forest in Queens where immigrant legends still live, and finally back to a place he thought he had lost forever. This dizzying tale is ultimately a story about family and the unfathomable secrets of the people we love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A young woman finding her way&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is Antonina Beaulieu's first Grand Season in the elegant city of Loisail. A chance to take her place in high society, to find a suitable husband, and to leave her checkered past behind. Because Antonina possesses telekinetic powers, powers she can't control, that have made her the subject of cruel gossip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A gentleman with a secret&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Famed telekinetic performer Hector Auvray is also new to the city. He arrives in Loisail with the intent of recapturing the heart of his former flame, the beautiful Valérie Beaulieu, and finds his way into her household by courting Antonina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astounded by Hector's abilities, which she wishes to master, and flattered by his attention, Antonina does not suspect the duplicitous drama which will unfold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A romance with a dash of the fantastic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in a sumptuous world inspired by the Belle Epoque, where scandal is a dreaded weapon, &lt;i&gt;The Beautiful Ones&lt;/i&gt; is a tale of desire and betrayal, and the struggle between conformity and passion.</description>

  <description>In the land of dolls, there is magic.&lt;br /&gt;In the land of humans, there is war.&lt;br /&gt;Everywhere there is pain.&lt;br /&gt;But &lt;i&gt;together&lt;/i&gt; there is hope.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Karolina is a living doll whose king and queen have been overthrown. But when a strange wind spirits her away from the Land of the Dolls, she finds herself in Krakow, Poland, in the company of the Dollmaker, a man with an unusual power and a marked past. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dollmaker has learned to keep to himself, but Karolina's courageous and compassionate manner lead him to smile and to even befriend a violin-playing father and his daughter--that is, once the Dollmaker gets over the shock of realizing a doll is speaking to him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But their newfound happiness is dashed when Nazi soldiers descend upon Poland. Karolina and the Dollmaker quickly realize that their Jewish friends are in grave danger, and they are determined to help save them, no matter what the risks.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Revenge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Eugenides, the Thief of Eddis, stole Hamiathes's Gift, the Queen of Attolia lost more than a mythical relic. She lost face. Everyone knew that Eugenides had outwitted and escaped her. To restore her reputation and reassert her power, the Queen of Attolia will go to any length and accept any help that is offered...she will risk her country to execute the perfect revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;...but&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eugenides can steal anything. And he taunts the Queen of Attolia, moving through her strongholds seemingly at will. So Attolia waits, secure in the knowledge that the Thief will slip, that he will haunt her palace one too many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; ...at what price?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Eugenides finds his small mountain country at war with Attolia, he must steal a man, he must steal a queen, he must steal peace. But his greatest triumph, and his greatest loss, comes in capturing something that the Queen of Attolia thought she had sacrificed long ago...</description>

  <description>Cvareh returns home to his sky world of Nova with the genius crafter Arianna as his temperamental guest. The mercurial inventor possesses all the Xin family needs to turn the tides of a centuries-old power struggle, but the secrets she harbors must be earned with trust -- hard to come by for Ari, especially when it comes to Dragons. On Nova, Ari finds herself closer to exacting vengeance against the traitor who killed everything -- and everyone – she once loved. But before Ari can complete her campaign of revenge, the Crimson Court exposes her shadowed past and reveals something even more dangerous sparking between her and Cvareh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Nova is embroiled in blood sport and political games, the rebels on Loom prepare for an all-out assault on their Dragon oppressors. Florence unexpectedly finds herself at the forefront of change, as her unique blend of skills -- and quick-shooting accuracy -- makes her a force to be reckoned with. For the future of her world, she vows vengeance against the Dragons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the rebellion can rise, though, the Guilds must fall.</description>

Leila keeps herself busy with her passion for environmental advocacy, monitoring the Urban Ecovists message board and joining a local environmental club with her best friend Sarika. And now that Leila has finally been adopted, she dares to hope her life will improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the voices in Leila’s head are growing louder by the day. Ignoring them isn’t working anymore. Something calls out to her from the grove at Fairmount Park.</description>

  <description>The year is 1927. The crew of the airship the Sweet Revenge live on the fringes of society, taking odd jobs and supplementing their incomes with activities of questionable legality. Captain Phineas Wilbert has a bounty on his head, which the British government has every intention of collecting. Staying away from the United Kingdom would be easy enough, but word has spread that someone from Phineas' past may not be as dead as he previously suspected.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A thrilling YA debut about teen spies disguised as "love interests"--whoever gets the girl lives; but the one she rejects, dies.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a secret organization that cultivates teenage spies. The agents are called Love Interests because getting close to people destined for great power means getting valuable secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caden is a Nice: The boy next door, sculpted to physical perfection. &lt;br /&gt;Dylan is a Bad: The brooding, dark-souled guy, and dangerously handsome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girl they are competing for is important to the organization, and each boy will pursue her. Will she choose a Nice or the Bad?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Caden and Dylan are living in the outside world for the first time. They are well-trained and at the top of their games. They have to be - whoever the girl doesn't choose will die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the boys don't expect are feelings that are outside of their training. Feelings that could kill them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From debut author Cale Dietrich comes a fast-paced adventure that is full of both action and romance and subverts common tropes.</description>

  <description>All hell breaks loose when Dean Smith, Earl of Carwick, is tricked into being discovered in the company of Rob, a handsome male prostitute. Now Dean needs to repair his broken engagement to a wealthy heiress…and Rob is the only one who can identify the man who set him up, proving to Dean's fiancée that things weren't as they appeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trip from Worcester to Bath turns into a journey of self-discovery, as Dean finds himself becoming increasingly attracted to Rob. His charming companion stirs feelings Dean has long kept repressed, but acting on them would make true the accusations that destroyed his engagement. Torn between duty and desire, Dean's destiny lies in the hands of a &lt;i&gt;Discreet Young Gentleman&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>When Henry Atherton helps Mr. Fogarty clean up around his house, he expects to find a mess and a cranky old man; what he doesn't expect to find is Pyrgus Malvae, crown prince of the Faerie realm, who has escaped the treacherous Faeries of the Night by traveling to the human world through a portal powered by trapped lightning. An egomaniacal demon prince, greedy glue factory owners Brimstone and Chalkhill, and the nefarious Lord Hairstreak, leader of the Faeries of the Night, all dream of ruling the Faerie realm and are out to kill Pyrgus. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enlisting the help of his sister, Holly Blue, and his new friend, Henry, Pyrgus must get back to the Faerie world alive before one of his many enemies gets to him instead. But how many portals are open, and can Pyrgus find the right one before it falls into the wrong hands? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conjuring scenes filled with vivid color, unforgettable detail, and fearless characters, author Herbie Brennan brings readers to the Faerie world, where nothing is ever what it seems and no one can be trusted.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;More Happy Than Not&lt;/i&gt; meets Glory O’Brien’s &lt;i&gt;History of the Future&lt;/i&gt; in this gritty, contemporary YA debut about a bullied gay teen boy with an eating disorder who believes he’s developed super powers via starvation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt hasn’t eaten in days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His stomach stabs and twists inside, pleading for a meal. But Matt won’t give in. The hunger clears his mind, keeps him sharp—and he needs to be as sharp as possible if he’s going to find out just how Tariq and his band of high school bullies drove his sister, Maya, away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt’s hardworking mom keeps the kitchen crammed with food, but Matt can resist the siren call of casseroles and cookies because he has discovered something: the less he eats the more he seems to have . . . powers. The ability to see things he shouldn’t be able to see. The knack of tuning in to thoughts right out of people’s heads. Maybe even the authority to bend time and space. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is lunch, really, compared to the secrets of the universe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt decides to infiltrate Tariq’s life, then use his powers to uncover what happened to Maya. All he needs to do is keep the hunger and longing at bay. No problem. But Matt doesn’t realize there are many kinds of hunger… and he isn’t in control of all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A darkly funny, moving story of body image, addiction, friendship, and love, Sam J. Miller’s debut novel will resonate with any reader who’s ever craved the power that comes with self-acceptance.</description>

  <description>The most important thing is that Jess Wong is Angie Redmond's best friend, even if Angie can't see how she truly feels. It's okay that Jess is the girl on the sidelines that nobody notices. That means she's free to watch everyone else and be at Angie's side. But when Angie starts falling for Margot, a girl from the nearby boarding school, Jess can already see what's going to happen. And suddenly her gift for observation is a curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Angie drags Jess further into Margot's circle, Jess finds more than her friend's growing crush. Secrets lie just beneath the carefree surface of this world, and when they come out, Jess knows Angie won't be able to handle the consequences. When the inevitable darkness finally descends, Angie will need her best friend.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There will be plenty of time for me to beat him soundly once I’ve gotten what I came for.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent on a mission to retrieve an ancient hidden map—the key to a legendary treasure trove—seventeen-year-old pirate captain Alosa deliberately allows herself to be captured by her enemies, giving her the perfect opportunity to search their ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than a match for the ruthless pirate crew, Alosa has only one thing standing between her and the map: her captor, the unexpectedly clever and unfairly attractive first mate, Riden. But not to worry, for Alosa has a few tricks up her sleeve, and no lone pirate can stop the Daughter of the Pirate King.</description>

  <description>There is a dark secret that is hiding at the heart of New York City and diminishing the city’s magicians’ power in this fantasy thriller by acclaimed author Kat Howard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In New York City, magic controls everything. But the power of magic is fading. No one knows what is happening, except for Sydney—a new, rare magician with incredible power that has been unmatched in decades, and she may be the only person who is able to stop the darkness that is weakening the magic. But Sydney doesn’t want to help the system, she wants to destroy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sydney comes from the House of Shadows, which controls the magic with the help of sacrifices from magicians.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I Needed to Win.&lt;br /&gt;They Needed to Die.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sallot Leon is a thief, and a good one at that. But gender fluid Sal wants nothing more than to escape the drudgery of life as a highway robber and get closer to the upper-class—and the nobles who destroyed their home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sal steals a flyer for an audition to become a member of The Left Hand—the Queen’s personal assassins, named after the rings she wears—Sal jumps at the chance to infiltrate the court and get revenge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the audition is a fight to the death filled with clever circus acrobats, lethal apothecaries, and vicious ex-soldiers. A childhood as a common criminal hardly prepared Sal for the trials. And as Sal succeeds in the competition, and wins the heart of Elise, an intriguing scribe at court, they start to dream of a new life and a different future, but one that Sal can have only if they survive.</description>

  <description>Nahri has never believed in magic. Certainly, she has power; on the streets of 18th century Cairo, she’s a con woman of unsurpassed talent. But she knows better than anyone that the trade she uses to get by—palm readings, zars, healings—are all tricks, sleights of hand, learned skills; a means to the delightful end of swindling Ottoman nobles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Nahri accidentally summons an equally sly, darkly mysterious djinn warrior to her side during one of her cons, she’s forced to accept that the magical world she thought only existed in childhood stories is real. For the warrior tells her a new tale: across hot, windswept sands teeming with creatures of fire, and rivers where the mythical marid sleep; past ruins of once-magnificent human metropolises, and mountains where the circling hawks are not what they seem, lies Daevabad, the legendary city of brass, a city to which Nahri is irrevocably bound. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that city, behind gilded brass walls laced with enchantments, behind the six gates of the six djinn tribes, old resentments are simmering. And when Nahri decides to enter this world, she learns that true power is fierce and brutal. That magic cannot shield her from the dangerous web of court politics. That even the cleverest of schemes can have deadly consequences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, there is a reason they say be careful what you wish for...</description>
