  <description>Susan Orlean first met John Laroche when visiting Florida to write for the &lt;i&gt;New Yorker &lt;/i&gt;about his arrest for stealing rare ghost orchids from a nature reserve. Fascinated both by Laroche and the world she uncovered of orchid collectors and growers, she stayed on, to write this magical exploration of obsession and the strange world both of the orchid obsessives and of Florida, that haunting and weird 'debatable land' of swamps and condos, retirement communities and real-estate scams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world of the orchid hunters, breeders and showmen, their rivalries, vendettas and crimes, smuggling, thefts and worse provide the backdrop to a fascinating exploration of one of the byways of human nature, the obsessive world of the collector, and the haunting beauty of the flowers themselves.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was surprisingly entertaining! I'm generally not a fan of orchids, I can take them or leave them in a floral scenario!! Susan Orlean's manner of writing is so witty however, that I found myself really involved in the story. <br /><br />I think the success of the book is her portrayal of the people...]]>

  <description>David Sedaris plays in the snow with his sisters. He goes on vacation with his family. He gets a job selling drinks. He attends his brother’s wedding. He mops his sister’s floor. He gives directions to a lost traveler. He eats a hamburger. He has his blood sugar tested. It all sounds so normal, doesn’t it? In his newest collection of essays, David Sedaris lifts the corner of ordinary life, revealing the absurdity teeming below its surface. His world is alive with obscure desires and hidden motives — a world where forgiveness is automatic and an argument can be the highest form of love. Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim is another unforgettable collection from one of the wittiest and most original writers at work today.&lt;br /&gt;--davidsedarisbooks.com</description>

      <![CDATA[David Sedaris is just naturally funny. <br /><br />He just has the knack for telling a tale humorously. <br /><br />The chapters here are unrelated, simple snippets of family life, sibling relationships, parents, partner's foibles. <br /><br />And they're all bloody funny! <br /><br />Well except maybe the drowning mouse, that was just tight o...]]>

  <description>The mesmerising new novel by Iceland's internationally renowned writer Sjón - 'the trickster that makes the world, and he is achingly brilliant' Junot Díaz, 'an extraordinary and original writer' A.S. Byatt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winner of the Icelandic Literary Prize&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 1918 and in Iceland the erupting volcano Katla can be seen colouring the sky night and day from the streets of Reykjavik. Yet life in the small capital carries on as usual, despite the natural disaster, a shortage of coal and, in the outside world, the Great War grinding on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There, sixteen-year-old Máni Steinn lives for the new fashion - the movies. Asleep he dreams altered versions of them, their tapestry of events threaded with strands from his own life. Awake he hovers on the fringes of society. But then the Spanish flu epidemic comes ashore, killing hundreds and driving thousands into their sick beds. The shadows of existence deepen and for Máni everything changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Capturing Iceland at a moment of profound transformation, this is the story of a misfit in a place where life and death, reality and imagination, secrets and revelations jostle for dominance. With not a word wasted, this mesmerising and original novel is the work of a major international writer.</description>

  <description>The last person Alice Shipley expected to see since arriving in Tangier with her new husband was Lucy Mason. After the accident at Bennington, the two friends—once inseparable roommates—haven’t spoken in over a year. But there Lucy was, trying to make things right and return to their old rhythms. Perhaps Alice should be happy. She has not adjusted to life in Morocco, too afraid to venture out into the bustling medinas and oppressive heat. Lucy—always fearless and independent—helps Alice emerge from her flat and explore the country. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But soon a familiar feeling starts to overtake Alice—she feels controlled and stifled by Lucy at every turn. Then Alice’s husband, John, goes missing, and Alice starts to question everything around her: her relationship with her enigmatic friend, her decision to ever come to Tangier, and her very own state of mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tangerine&lt;/i&gt; is a sharp dagger of a book—a debut so tightly wound, so replete with exotic imagery and charm, so full of precise details and extraordinary craftsmanship, it will leave you absolutely breathless.</description>

  <description>Meursault is different. He will not lie. He will not pretend. He is true to himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when his mother dies and he is unmoved, he refuses to do the proper thing and grieve. Returning to Algiers after the funeral, he carries on life as usual until he becomes involved in a violent murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In court, it is clear that Meursault's guilt or innocence will not be determined by what he did or did not do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is on trial for being different - an outsider.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thoughtful, revealing, chilling and always unputdownable, &lt;i&gt;Unnatural Causes&lt;/i&gt; is the true crime book of the year. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you liked &lt;i&gt;This is Going to Hurt, War Doctor&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;All That Remains&lt;/i&gt; you'll love this. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'One of the most fascinating books I have read in a long time. Engrossing, a haunting page-turner. A book I could not put down' &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Times\&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;DAILY MAIL &lt;/i&gt;100 BEST SUMMER BOOKS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_&lt;i&gt;_________&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet the forensic pathologist, Dr Richard Shepherd. A detective in his own right, he must solve the mystery of sudden and unexplained deaths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has performed over 23,000 autopsies, including some of the most high-profile cases of recent times; the Hungerford Massacre, the Princess Diana inquiry, and 9/11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has faced serial killers, natural disaster, 'perfect murders' and freak accidents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His evidence has put killers behind bars, freed the innocent, and turned open-and-shut cases on their heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet all this has come at a huge personal cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unnatural Causes &lt;/i&gt;tells the story of not only the cases and bodies that have haunted him the most, but also how to live a life steeped in death. &lt;br /&gt;__________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'A deeply mesmerising memoir of forensic pathology. Human and fascinating' &lt;/b&gt;- Nigella Lawson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Gripping, grimly fascinating, and I suspect I'll read it at least twice' &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Evening Standard&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Included in &lt;i&gt;The Times&lt;/i&gt; Books of the Year&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Puts the reader at his elbow as he wields the scalpel' &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Fascinating, gruesome yet engrossing'&lt;/b&gt; Richard and Judy, &lt;i&gt;Daily Express&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Heart-wrenchingly honest' &lt;/b&gt;Professor Sue Black, author of &lt;i&gt;All That Remains&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Fascinating, insightful, candid, compassionate' &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Observer&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;‘One of the most important books about gay culture in recent times’ &lt;i&gt;The Quietus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1984 the pulsing electronics and soft vocals of Smalltown Boy would become an anthem uniting gay men. A month later, an aggressive virus, HIV, would be identified and a climate of panic and fear would spread across the nation, marginalising an already ostracised community. Yet, out of this terror would come tenderness and 30 years later, the long road to gay equality would climax with the passing of same sex marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Flynn charts this astonishing pop cultural and societal U-turn via the cultural milestones that effected change—from Manchester’s self-selection as Britain’s gay capital to the real-time romance of Elton John and David Furnish’s eventual marriage. Including candid interviews from major protagonists, such as Kylie, Russell T Davies, Will Young, Holly Johnson and Lord Chris Smith, as well as the relative unknowns crucial to the gay community, we see how an unlikely group of bedfellows fought for equality both front of stage and in the wings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of Britain’s brothers, cousins and sons. Sometimes it is the story of their fathers and husbands. It is one of public outrage and personal loss, the (not always legal) highs and the desperate lows, and the final collective victory as gay men were final recognised, as Good As You.</description>

  <description>Birds have not been known for their high IQs, which is why a person of questionable intelligence is sometimes called a "birdbrain." Yet in the past two decades, the study of avian intelligence has witnessed dramatic advances. From a time when birds were seen as simple instinct machines responding only to stimuli in their external worlds, we now know that some birds have complex internal worlds as well. This beautifully illustrated book provides an engaging exploration of the avian mind, revealing how science is exploding one of the most widespread myths about our feathered friends--and changing the way we think about intelligence in other animals as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bird Brain&lt;/i&gt; looks at the structures and functions of the avian brain, and describes the extraordinary behaviors that different types of avian intelligence give rise to. It offers insights into crows, jays, magpies, and other corvids--the "masterminds" of the avian world--as well as parrots and some less-studied species from around the world. This lively and accessible book shows how birds have sophisticated brains with abilities previously thought to be uniquely human, such as mental time travel, self-recognition, empathy, problem solving, imagination, and insight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written by a leading expert and featuring a foreword by Frans de Waal, renowned for his work on animal intelligence, &lt;i&gt;Bird Brain&lt;/i&gt; shines critical new light on the mental lives of birds.</description>

  <description>Just two months before the September 11 terrorist attacks, Dr. Judy Melinek began her training as a New York City forensic pathologist. With her husband, T.J. and their toddler, Daniel, holding down the home front, Judy threw herself into the fascinating world of death investigation—performing autopsies, investigating death scenes, and counseling grieving relatives. &lt;i&gt;Working Stiff&lt;/i&gt; takes readers behind the police tape of some of the most harrowing deaths in the Big Apple, including a firsthand account of the events of September 11, the subsequent anthrax bioterrorism attack, and the disastrous crash of American Airlines Flight 587. Lively, action-packed, and loaded with mordant wit, &lt;i&gt;Working Stiff&lt;/i&gt; explores both the challenges and rewards of shuttling between the domains of the living and the dead.</description>

  <description>Baba Yaga is an old hag who lives in a house built on chicken legs and kidnaps small children. She is one of the most pervasive and powerful creatures in all mythology. She appears in many forms: as Pupa, a tricksy, cantankerous old woman who keeps her legs tucked into a huge furry boot; as a trio of mischievous elderly women who embark on the trip of a lifetime to a hotel spa; and as a villainous flock of ravens, black hens and magpies infected with the H5N1 virus. But what story does Baba Yaga have to tell us today?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a quizzical tale about one of the most pervasive and poerful creatures in all mythology, and an extraordinay yarn of identity, secrets, storytelling and love.</description>

  <description>Bod is an unusual boy who inhabits an unusual place-he's the only living resident of a graveyard. Raised from infancy by the ghosts, werewolves, and other cemetery denizens, Bod has learned the antiquated customs of his guardians' time as well as their timely ghostly teachings-like the ability to Fade. Can a boy raised by ghosts face the wonders and terrors of the worlds of both the living and the dead? And then there are things like ghouls that aren't really one thing or the other. &lt;br /&gt;This chilling tale is Neil Gaiman's first full-length novel for middle-grade readers since the internationally bestselling and universally acclaimed Coraline. Like Coraline, this book is sure to enchant and surprise young readers as well as Neil Gaiman's legion of adult fans.</description>

  <description>Georges Simenon's chilling portrayal of tragic love, persecution and betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;'One sensed in him neither flesh nor bone, nothing but soft, flaccid matter, so much so that his movements were hard to make out. Very red lips stood out from his orb-like face, as did the thin moustache that he curled with an iron and looked as if it had been drawn on with India ink; on his cheekbones were the symmetrical pink dots of a doll's cheeks.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People find Mr Hire strange, disconcerting. The tenants he shares his building with try to avoid him. He is a peeping Tom, a visitor of prostitutes, a dealer in unsavoury literature. He is also the prime suspect for a brutal murder that he did not commit. Yet Mr Hire's innocence will not stand in the way of those looking for a scapegoat as tragedy unfolds in this quietly devastating and deeply unnerving novel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'The&lt;i&gt; romans durs&lt;/i&gt; are extraordinary: tough, bleak, offhandedly violent, suffused with guilt and bitterness, redolent of place . . . utterly unsentimental, frightening in the pitilessness of their gaze, yet wonderfully entertaining' John Banville&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georges Simenon was born in Liège, Belgium, in 1903. Best known in Britain as the author of the Maigret books, his prolific output of over 400 novels and short stories have made him a household name in continental Europe. He died in 1989 in Lausanne, Switzerland, where he had lived for the latter part of his life.</description>

  <description>On the banks of the River Avon, five sisters are born. The seasons come and go, the girls take their lessons under the ash tree, and always there is the sound of water swirling through the weir. Then, unexpectedly, an air of decay descends upon the house: ivy grows unchecked over the windows, angry shouts split the summer air, the milk sours in the larder and their father takes out his gun. Tragedy strikes the family, and before long the furniture is being auctioned off and the sisters dispersed among relatives. In her daring first novel, originally published in 1947, Barbara Comyns' unique young heroine relates the vivid, funny and bittersweet story of a childhood.</description>

  <description>This is a startling memoir of a successful journalist's journey from the deserted and dusty mining towns of the American Southwest, to an antique filled apartment on Park Avenue. Jeanette Walls narrates her nomadic and adventurous childhood with her dreaming, 'brilliant' but alcoholic parents. At the age of seventeen she escapes on a Greyhound bus to New York with her older sister; her younger siblings follow later. After pursuing the education and civilisation her parents sought to escape, Jeanette eventually succeeds in her quest for the 'mundane, middle class existence' she had always craved. In her apartment, overlooked by 'a portrait of someone else's ancestor' she recounts poignant remembered images of star watching with her father, juxtaposed with recollections of irregular meals, accidents and police-car chases and reveals her complex feelings of shame, guilt, pity and pride toward her parents.</description>

  <description>The ponds of Hampstead Heath are small oases; fragments of wild nature nestled in the heart of north-west London. For the best part of his life Al Alvarez - poet, critic, novelist, rock-climber and poker player - has swum in them almost daily. An athlete in his youth, Alvarez, now in his eighties, chronicles what it is to grow old with humour and fierce honesty - from his relentlessly nagging ankle which makes daily life a struggle, to infuriating bureaucratic battles with the council to keep his disabled person's Blue Badge, the devastating effects of a stroke, and the salvation he finds in the three Ss - Swimming, Sex and Sleep.As Alvarez swims in the ponds he considers how it feels when you begin to miss that person you used to be - to miss yourself. Swimming is his own private form of protest against the onslaught of time; proof to others, and himself, that he's not yet beaten. By turns funny, poetic and indignant, "Pondlife" is a meditation on love, the importance of life's small pleasures and, above all, a lesson in not going gently in to that good night.</description>

  <description>Opposites attract, and Helmut Holk and Christine Arne, the appealing married couple at the center of this engrossing book by one of Germany’s greatest novelists, could not be less alike. Christine is a serious soul from a devout background. She is brooding and beautiful and devoted to her husband and their two children. Helmut is lighthearted and pleasure-loving and largely content to defer to his wife’s deeper feelings and better wisdom. They live in a beautiful large house overlooking the sea, which they built themselves, and have been happily married for twenty-three years—only of late a certain tension has crept into their dealings with each other. Little jokes, casual endearments, long-meditated plans: they all hit a raw nerve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How a couple can slowly drift apart, until one day they find themselves in a situation which is nothing they ever wished for but from which they cannot go back, is at the heart of this timeless story of everyday life. Theodor Fontane’s great gift is to tell the story effectively in his characters’ own words, listening to how they talk and fail to talk to each other, watching them turn away from their own true feelings as much as from each other. &lt;em&gt;Irretrievable&lt;/em&gt; is a nuanced, affectionate, enormously sophisticated, and profoundly humane reckoning with the blindness of love.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Outward Room&lt;/i&gt; is a book about a young woman’s journey from madness to self-discovery. It created a sensation when it was first published in 1937, and has lost none of its immediacy or its power to move the reader.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Having suffered a nervous breakdown after her brother’s death in a car accident, Harriet Demuth is committed to a mental hospital, but her doctor’s Freudian nostrums do little to make her well. Convinced that she and she alone can refashion her life, Harriet makes a daring escape from the hospital—hopping a train by night and riding the rails into the vastness of New York City in the light of the rising sun. It is the middle of the Great Depression, and at first Harriet is lost among the city’s anonymous multitudes. She pawns her jewelry and lives an increasingly hand-to-mouth existence until she meets John, a machine-shop worker. Slowly Harriet begins to recover her sense of self; slowly she and John begin to fall in love. The story of that emerging love, told with the lyricism of Virginia Woolf and the realism of Theodore Dreiser, is the heart of Millen Brand’s remarkable book.</description>

  <description>Growing up in Edwardian south London, Alice Rowlands longs for romance and excitement, for a release from a life that is dreary, restrictive and lonely. Her father, a vet, is harsh and domineering; his new girlfriend brash and lascivious. Alice seeks refuge in memories and fantasies, in her rapturous longing for Nicholas, a handsome young sailor, and in the blossoming of what she perceives as her occult powers. A series of strange events unfolds that leads her, dressed in bridal white, to a scene of ecstatic triumph and disaster among the crowds on Clapham Common. The Vet's Daughter is a uniquely vivid, witty and touching story of love and mystery.</description>

  <description>Rachel Waring is deliriously happy. Out of nowhere, a great-aunt leaves her a Georgian mansion in another city--and she sheds her old life without delay. Gone is her dull administrative job, her mousy wardrobe, her downer of a roommate. She will live as a woman of leisure, devoted to beauty, creativity, expression, and love. Once installed in her new quarters, Rachel plants a garden, takes up writing, and impresses everyone she meets with her extraordinary optimism. But as Rachel sings and jokes the days away, her new neighbors begin to wonder if she might be taking her transformation just a bit too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Wish Her Safe at Home&lt;/i&gt;, Stephen Benatar finds humor and horror in the shifting region between elation and mania. His heroine could be the next-door neighbor of the Beales of Grey Gardens or a sister to Jane Gardam's oddball protagonists, but she has an ebullient charm all her own.</description>

  <description>"The Pumpkin Eater "is a surreal black comedy about the wages of adulthood and the pitfalls of parenthood. A nameless woman speaks, at first from the precarious perch of a therapist's couch, and her smart, wry, confiding, immensely sympathetic voice immediately captures and holds our attention. She is the mother of a vast, swelling brood of children, also nameless, and the wife of a successful screenwriter, Jake Armitage. The Armitages live in the city, but they are building a great glass tower in the country in which to settle down and live happily ever after. But could that dream be nothing more than a sentimental delusion? At the edges of vision the spectral children come and go, while our heroine, alert to the countless gradations of depression and the innumerable forms of betrayal, tries to make sense of it all: doctors, husbands, movie stars, bodies, grocery lists, nursery rhymes, messes, aging parents, memories, dreams, and breakdowns. How to pull it all together? Perhaps you start by falling apart.</description>

  <description>Ralph Ellison's blistering and impassioned first novel tells the extraordinary story of a man invisible "simply because people refuse to see me". Published in 1952 when American society was on the cusp of immense change, the powerfully depicted adventures of Ellison's invisible man - from his expulsion from a Southern college to a terrifying Harlem race riot - go far beyond the story of one individual. As John Callahan says, "In an extraordinary imaginative leap, he hit upon a single word for the different yet shared condition of African Americans, Americans, and, for that matter, the human individual in the twentieth century, and beyond."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This edition includes Ralph Ellison's introduction to the thirtieth anniversary edition of Invisible Man, a fascinating account of the novel's seven-year gestation.</description>

His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the source of all discord and unhappiness: the printed book. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Montag never questions the destruction or his own bland life, until he is shown a past where people didn’t live in fear and a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Montag begins to question everything he has ever known and starts hiding books in his home, and when his pilfering is discovered, the fireman has to run for his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The classic novel of a post-literate future, Fahrenheit 451 stands alongside Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World as prophetic account of Western civilization's enslavement by the media, drugs and conformity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bradbury's powerful and poetic prose combines with uncanny insight into the potential of technology to create a classic of twentieth-century literature which over fifty years from first publication, still has the power to dazzle and shock.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A celebration of reading, of libraries, and of the mysterious human desire to give order to the universe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Inspired by the process of creating a library for his fifteenth-century home near the Loire, in France, Alberto Manguel, the acclaimed writer on books and reading, has taken up the subject of libraries. “Libraries,” he says, “have always seemed to me pleasantly mad places, and for as long as I can remember I’ve been seduced by their labyrinthine logic.” In this personal, deliberately unsystematic, and wide-ranging book, he offers a captivating meditation on the meaning of libraries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manguel, a guide of irrepressible enthusiasm, conducts a unique library tour that extends from his childhood bookshelves to the “complete” libraries of the Internet, from Ancient Egypt and Greece to the Arab world, from China and Rome to Google. He ponders the doomed library of Alexandria as well as the personal libraries of Charles Dickens, Jorge Luis Borges, and others. He recounts stories of people who have struggled against tyranny to preserve freedom of thought—the Polish librarian who smuggled books to safety as the Nazis began their destruction of Jewish libraries; the Afghani bookseller who kept his store open through decades of unrest. Oral “memory libraries” kept alive by prisoners, libraries of banned books, the imaginary library of Count Dracula, the library of books never written—Manguel illuminates the mysteries of libraries as no other writer could. With scores of wonderful images throughout, &lt;i&gt;The Library at Night &lt;/i&gt;is a fascinating voyage through Manguel’s mind, memory, and vast knowledge of books and civilizations.</description>

  <description>At the age of fourteen, Laura Freeman was diagnosed with anorexia. She had seized the one aspect of her life that she seemed able to control, and struck different foods from her diet one by one until she was starving. But even at her lowest point, the one appetite she never lost was her love of reading.&lt;br /&gt;As Laura battled her anorexia, she gradually re-discovered how to enjoy food - and life more broadly - through literature. Plum puddings and pottles of fruit in Dickens gave her courage to try new dishes; the wounded Robert Graves' appreciation of a pair of greengages changed the way she thought about plenty and choice; Virginia Woolf's painterly descriptions of bread, blackberries and biscuits were infinitely tempting. Book by book, meal by meal, Laura developed an appetite and discovered an entire library of reasons to live.&lt;br /&gt;The Reading Cure is a beautiful, inspiring account of hunger and happiness, about addiction, obsession and recovery, and about the way literature and food can restore appetite and renew hope.</description>

  <description>The midnight hour approaches in an almost empty all-night diner. Mari sips her coffee and glances up from a book as a young man, a musician, intrudes on her solitude. Both have missed the last train home. The musician has plans to rehearse with his jazz band all night, Mari is equally unconcerned and content to read, smoke and drink coffee until dawn. They realise they've been acquainted through Eri, Mari's beautiful sister. The musician soon leaves with a promise to return before dawn. Shortly afterwards Mari will be interrupted a second time by a girl from the Alphaville Hotel; a Chinese prostitute has been hurt by a client, the girl has heard Mari speaks fluent Chinese and requests her help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile Eri is at home and sleeps a deep, heavy sleep that is 'too perfect, too pure' to be normal; pulse and respiration at the lowest required level. She has been in this soporfic state for two months; Eri has become the classic myth - a sleeping beauty. But tonight as the digital clock displays 00:00 a faint electrical crackle is perceptible, a hint of life flickers across the TV screen, though the television's plug has been pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murakami, acclaimed master of the surreal, returns with a stunning new novel, where the familiar can become unfamiliar after midnight, even to those that thrive in small hours. With After Dark we journey beyond the twilight. Strange nocturnal happenings, or a trick of the night?</description>

  <description>This family story, starting with an idyllic - though definitely strange - childhood, almost ends in tragedy. At its heart, there is a mystery, to be understood only when the child Julian becomes a man.</description>

  <description>This is how a family keeps a secret…and how that secret ends up keeping them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how a family lives happily ever after…until happily ever after becomes complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how children change…and then change the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Claude. He’s five years old, the youngest of five brothers, and loves peanut butter sandwiches. He also loves wearing a dress, and dreams of being a princess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he grows up, Claude says, he wants to be a girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosie and Penn want Claude to be whoever Claude wants to be. They’re just not sure they’re ready to share that with the world. Soon the entire family is keeping Claude’s secret. Until one day it explodes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Is How It Always Is is a novel about revelations, transformations, fairy tales, and family. And it’s about the ways this is how it always is: Change is always hard and miraculous and hard again, parenting is always a leap into the unknown with crossed fingers and full hearts, children grow but not always according to plan. And families with secrets don’t get to keep them forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"This is a novel everyone should read. It’s brilliant. It’s bold. And it’s time.” &lt;br /&gt;―Elizabeth George, &lt;i&gt;#1 New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;A Banquet of Consequences&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>You are a mind reader, born with an extraordinary ability to understand what others think, feel, believe, want, and know. It’s a sixth sense you use every day, in every personal and professional relationship you have. At its best, this ability allows you to achieve the most important goal in almost any life: connecting, deeply and intimately and honestly, to other human beings. At its worst, it is a source of misunderstanding and unnecessary conflict, leading to damaged relationships and broken dreams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How good are you at knowing the minds of others? How well can you guess what others think of you, know who really likes you, or tell when someone is lying? How well do you really understand the minds of those closest to you, from your spouse to your kids to your best friends? Do you really know what your coworkers, employees, competitors, or clients want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this illuminating exploration of one of the great mysteries of the human mind, University of Chicago psychologist Nicholas Epley introduces us to what scientists have learned about our ability to understand the most complicated puzzle on the planet—other people—and the surprising mistakes we so routinely make. Why are we sometimes blind to the minds of others, treating them like objects or animals? Why do we sometimes talk to our cars, or the stars, as if there is a mind that can hear us? Why do we so routinely believe that others think, feel, and want what we do when, in fact, they do not? And why do we believe we understand our spouses, family, and friends so much better than we actually do? &lt;i&gt;Mindwise&lt;/i&gt; will not turn other people into open books, but it will give you the wisdom to revolutionize how you think about them—and yourself. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Young Dr. Bromgard has come to a small country town to assume a new practice. No sooner has he arrived than he receives word that a colleague, Dr. Polyakov, has fallen gravely ill. Before Bromgard can go to his friend's aid, Polyakov is brought to his practice in the middle of the night with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and, barely conscious, gives Bromgard his journal before dying. What Bromgard uncovers in the entries is Polyakov's uncontrollable and merciless descent into morphine addiction -- his first injection to ease his back pain, the thrill of the drug as it overtakes him, the looming signs of addiction, and the feverish final entries before his death.</description>

  <description>As one of the largest predators left in Britain, the fox is captivating: a comfortably familiar figure in our country landscapes; an intriguing flash of bright-eyed wildness in our towns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet no other animal attracts such controversy, has provoked more column inches or been so ambiguously woven into our culture over centuries, perceived variously as a beautiful animal, a cunning rogue, a vicious pest and a worthy foe. As well as being the most ubiquitous of wild animals, it is also the least understood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Foxes Unearthed&lt;/i&gt; Lucy Jones investigates the truth about foxes in a media landscape that often carries complex agendas. Delving into fact, fiction, folklore and her own family history, Lucy travels the length of Britain to find out first-hand why these animals incite such passionate emotions, revealing our rich and complex relationship with one of our most loved – and most vilified – wild animals. This compelling narrative adds much-needed depth to the debate on foxes, asking what our attitudes towards the red fox say about us – and, ultimately, about our relationship with the natural world.</description>

  <description>Last Words: The Final Journals of William S. Burroughs is the most intimate book ever written by William S. Burroughs, author of Naked Lunch and one of the most celebrated literary outlaws of our time. Laid out as diary entries of the last nine months of Burroughs's life, Last Words spans the realms of cultural criticism, personal memoir, and fiction. Classic Burroughs concerns -- literature, U.S. drug policy, the state of humanity, his love for his cats -- permeate the book. Most significantly, Last Words contains some of the most personal work Burroughs has ever written, a final reckoning with his life and regrets, and his reflections on the deaths of his friends Allen Ginsberg and Timothy Leary. It is a poignant portrait of the man, his life, and his creative process -- one that never quit, not even in the shadow of death</description>

  <description>What exactly are the Weird and the Eerie? In this new book, Mark Fisher argues that some of the most haunting and anomalous fiction of the 20th century belongs to these two modes. The Weird and the Eerie are closely related but distinct modes, each possessing its own distinct properties. Both have often been associated with Horror, yet this emphasis overlooks the aching fascination that such texts can exercise. The Weird and the Eerie both fundamentally concern the outside and the unknown, which are not intrinsically horrifying, even if they are always unsettling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps a proper understanding of the human condition requires examination of liminal concepts such as the weird and the eerie. These two modes will be analysed with reference to the work of authors such as H.P. Lovecraft, H.G. Wells, M.R. James, Christopher Priest, Joan Lindsay, Nigel Kneale, Daphne Du Maurier, Alan Garner and Margaret Atwood, and films by Stanley Kubrick, Jonathan Glazer and Christoper Nolan.</description>

  <description>"One comes away from Reiss’s book agreeing that ‘dolphins are among the smartest creatures on the planet’ and that they merit not just our attention but our care and protection."—&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;For centuries, humans and dolphins have enjoyed a special relationship, evident not just in mythology and folklore but in many documented encounters. Diana Reiss is one of the world’s leading experts on dolphin intelligence, and her decades of research and interactions with dolphins have made her a strong advocate for their global protection. In &lt;i&gt;The Dolphin in the Mirror&lt;/i&gt;, Reiss combines her science and activism to show just how smart dolphins really are and why we must protect them.Dolphins are creative and self-aware, with distinct personalities and the ability to communicate with humans. They craft their own toys, use underwater keyboards, and live in complex societies in the seas. And yet some nations continue to slaughter them indiscriminately. This story of Reiss’s encounters and research with dolphins is both a scientific revelation and an emotional eye-opener, revealing one of the greatest intelligences on the planet and exposing our terrible mistreatment of the smartest creatures in the sea."Reiss has managed no small feat—synthesizing personal experience, descriptive material, and scientific fact . . . No one reading this book could possibly remain untouched by the beauty and intelligence of these powerful mammals of the sea."—Irene Pepperberg, author of &lt;i&gt;Alex &amp;amp; Me&lt;/i&gt;"Reiss fills the book with such intriguing tales and with the science behind them… Reiss is passionate about her science, but she is passionate about her subjects as well."—&lt;i&gt;The Tampa Bay Times&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The stifling, reclusive life of nineteen-year-old Irma Voth, recently married, and more recently deserted is turned on its head when a film crew moves in to make a movie about the strict religious community, in which she lives. When she clashes with her domineering father over her work as a translator for the crew, Irma is set on a path towards something that feels like freedom. Along with her younger sister Aggie, wise beyond her teenage years, she hits the road and flees to the city. Upheld only by their love for each other and their smart wit, the sisters finally gain the distance to understand the tragedy that has their family in its grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Irma Voth&lt;/i&gt; delves into the complicated factors that set us on the road to self-discovery and how we can sometimes find the strength to endure the really hard things that happen. It also asks that most &lt;br /&gt;difficult of questions: How do we forgive? And most importantly, how do we forgive ourselves?</description>

  <description>It started with fireballs raining down from the sky and crashing into the oceans' deeps. Then ships began sinking mysteriously and later 'sea tanks' emerged from the deeps to claim people . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For journalists Mike and Phyllis Watson, what at first appears to be a curiosity becomes a global calamity. Helpless, they watch as humanity struggles to survive now that water - one of the compounds upon which life depends - is turned against them. Finally, sea levels begin their inexorable rise . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Kraken Wakes&lt;/i&gt; is a brilliant novel of how humankind responds to the threat of its own extinction and, ultimately, asks what we are prepared to do in order to survive.</description>

  <description>In the sleepy English village of Midwich, a mysterious silver object appears and all the inhabitants fall unconscious. A day later the object is gone and everyone awakens unharmed - except that all the women in the village are discovered to be pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resultant children of Midwich do not belong to their parents: all are blond, all are golden-eyed. They grow up too fast and their minds exhibit frightening abilities that give them control over others. This brings them into conflict with the villagers just as a chilling realization dawns on the world outside...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE MIDWICH CUCKOOS is the classic tale of aliens in our midst, exploring how we respond when confronted by those who are innately superior to us in every conceivable way.</description>

  <description>Una visión descarnada y amena de la relación entre humanos y gatos por parte de uno de nuestros escritores más transgresores. No cabe duda de que los felinos tocan la fibra sensible de Charles Bukowski. Admira a esas criaturas inescrutables y majestuosas, cuya mirada le llega al alma. Para Bukowski, los gatos son auténticas fuerzas de la naturaleza, emisarios esquivos de la belleza y el amor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; En Gatos, Bukowski cavila sobre la resistencia y la capacidad de recuperación de los gatos. Son luchadores natos, cazadores y supervivientes que le inspiran admiración y respeto: “Los gatos no tienen nada en cuenta, son un claro ejemplo de que cuando los elementos de la naturaleza entran en juego no hay nada que hacer”. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Gatos es un compendio de poemas y prosa mordaz y conmovedor. Los gatos que describe Bukowski son fieros e inmisericordes; los observa mientras acechan a su presa, se arrastran por sus manuscritos o le despiertan a zarpazos, pero también son cariñosos y una inagotable fuente de inspiración.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Gatos es una colección emotiva, nunca almibarada, en la que Bukowski ofrece su particular visión sobre los animales que considera sus verdaderos maestros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Charles Bukowski es uno de los escritores más conocidos y celebrados de las letras estadounidenses contemporáneas y, según muchos, unos de los poetas más influyentes e imitados de los últimos tiempos. Nació en 1920 en Andernach, en Alemania, hijo de un soldado norteamericano y de una costurera alemana, y llegó a los Estados Unidos a los tres años. Creció en Los Ángeles, donde vivió durante más de cinco décadas. Publicó su primer relato en 1944 y sus primeros poemas en 1946. Falleció en San Pedro, California, el 9 de marzo de 1994 a los setenta y tres años, poco después de haber finalizado su última novela, Pulp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Abel Debritto es el editor de la edición norteamericana de Gatos.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition for ISBN 9780099448921&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugely original and erudite travelogue-come-memoir from one of Europe’s most lauded writers.&lt;br /&gt;The Rings of Saturn begins as the record of a journey on foot through coastal East Anglia. From Lowestoft to Bungay, Sebald's own story becomes the conductor of evocations of people and cultures past and present: of Chateaubriand, Thomas Browne, Swinburne and Conrad, of fishing fleets, skulls and silkworms. The result is an intricately patterned and haunting book on the transience of all things human.</description>

  <description>On a remote Greek Island, Nicholas Urfe finds himself embroiled in the deceptions of a master trickster. As reality and illusion intertwine, Urfe is caught up in the darkest of psychological games. John Fowles expertly unfolds a tale that is lush with over-powering imagery in a spellbinding exploration of human complexities. By turns disturbing, thrilling and seductive, &lt;i&gt;The Magus&lt;/i&gt; is a feast for the mind and the senses.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Change the way you think about gender and feminism forever. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the revolutionary zeal, laugh-out-loud humour and intelligence of Laura Bates, Caitlin Moran and Bell Hooks, Emer O'Toole explores what it really means to 'act like a girl'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a woman is, largely, about performance - how we dress and modify our bodies, what we say, the roles we play, and how we conform to expectations. Gender stereotypes are still deeply embedded in our society, but Emer O'Toole is on a mission to re-write the old script and bend the rules of gender - and she shows how and why we should all be joining in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With game-changing ideas and laugh-out-loud humour, this book will open your mind and revolutionise the way that you think about gender.</description>

  <description>David Storm's father doesn't approve of Angus Morton's unusually large horses, calling them blasphemies against nature. Little does he realise that his own son, and his son's cousin Rosalind and their friends, have their own secret aberration which would label them as mutants. But as David and Rosalind grow older it becomes more difficult to conceal their differences from the village elders. Soon they face a choice: wait for eventual discovery, or flee to the terrifying and mutable Badlands....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Chrysalids&lt;/i&gt; is a post-nuclear apocalypse story of genetic mutation in a devastated world and explores the lengths the intolerant will go to to keep themselves pure.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/i&gt; is a classic. With over a million copies sold in the UK alone, it is hailed as one of the all-time 'greats' of literature, inspiring generations of readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in the deep American South between the wars, it is the tale of Celie, a young black girl born into poverty and segregation. Raped repeatedly by the man she calls 'father', she has two children taken away from her, is separated from her beloved sister Nettie and is trapped into an ugly marriage. But then she meets the glamorous Shug Avery, singer and magic-maker - a woman who has taken charge of her own destiny. Gradually, Celie discovers the power and joy of her own spirit, freeing her from her past and reuniting her with those she loves.</description>

  <description>"I came away from this book a better human being. Michael Harris' take on existence is calm, unique, and makes one's soul feel good." &lt;b&gt;DOUGLAS COUPLAND&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solitude is a rapidly vanishing experience. Our society now embraces sharing like never before: time alone is being forced out of our lives by the constant pings of smartphones and prods of social media. But what if solitude still has something to offer us - something we have forgotten, but that we still desperately need? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Solitude&lt;/i&gt;, award-winning author Michael Harris examines why being alone matters now more than ever before. He reflects on the paradoxical feeling of isolation that emerges from being constantly connected - and on how learning the beauty of solitude can help us escape it. After all, it is when we are alone that we realise the greatest truths about ourselves. Being alone - really alone - could be the only antidote to the frenzy of our digital age. Rich with stories about the transformative power of solitude, and drawing on the research of the world's leading neuroscientists and behavioural psychologists, Solitude offers a timely and profound exploration of how to be alone - and why it matters for us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A timely, eloquent provocation to daydream and wander." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nathan Filer, author of &lt;i&gt;The Shock of the Fall&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Most people want to avoid thinking about death, but Caitlin Doughty—a twenty-something with a degree in medieval history and a flair for the macabre—took a job at a crematory, turning morbid curiosity into her life’s work. Thrown into a profession of gallows humor and vivid characters (both living and very dead), Caitlin learned to navigate the secretive culture of those who care for the deceased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&lt;/em&gt; tells an unusual coming-of-age story full of bizarre encounters and unforgettable scenes. Caring for dead bodies of every color, shape, and affliction, Caitlin soon becomes an intrepid explorer in the world of the dead. She describes how she swept ashes from the machines (and sometimes onto her clothes) and reveals the strange history of cremation and undertaking, marveling at bizarre and wonderful funeral practices from different cultures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her eye-opening, candid, and often hilarious story is like going on a journey with your bravest friend to the cemetery at midnight. She demystifies death, leading us behind the black curtain of her unique profession. And she answers questions you didn’t know you had: Can you catch a disease from a corpse? How many dead bodies can you fit in a Dodge van? What exactly does a flaming skull look like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honest and heartfelt, self-deprecating and ironic, Caitlin's engaging style makes this otherwise taboo topic both approachable and engrossing. Now a licensed mortician with an alternative funeral practice, Caitlin argues that our fear of dying warps our culture and society, and she calls for better ways of dealing with death (and our dead).</description>

  <description>Fernando Pessoa was many writers in one. He attributed his prolific writings to a wide range of alternate selves, each of which had a distinct biography, ideology. and horoscope. When he died in 1935, Pessoa left behind a trunk filled with unfinished and unpublished writings, among which were the remarkable pages that make up his posthumous masterpiece, &lt;i&gt;The Book of Disquiet&lt;/i&gt;, an astonishing work that, in George Steiner's words, "gives to Lisbon the haunting spell of Joyce's Dublin or Kafka's Prague."Published for the first time some fifty years after his death, this unique collection of short, aphoristic paragraphs comprises the "autobiography" of Bernardo Soares, one of Pessoa's alternate selves. Part intimate diary, part prose poetry, part descriptive narrative, &lt;i&gt;The Book of Disquiet&lt;/i&gt; is one of the greatest works of the twentieth century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fernando Pessoa&lt;/b&gt;, one of the founders of modernism, was born in Lisbon in 1888. Most of Pessoa's writing was not published during his lifetime: &lt;i&gt;The Book of Disquiet&lt;/i&gt; was first published in Portugal in 1982.</description>

  <description>While his literary reputation rests mainly on such celebrated novels as &lt;i&gt;Crime and Punishment&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Brothers Karamazov&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Idiot&lt;/i&gt;, Dostoyevsky also wrote much superb short fiction. &lt;i&gt;The Double&lt;/i&gt; is one of the finest of his shorter works. It appeared in 1846 (his second published work) and is by far the most significant of his early stories, not least for its successful, straight-faced treatment of a hallucinatory theme.&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Double&lt;/i&gt;, the protagonist, Golyadkin senior, is persecuted by his double, Golyadkin junior, who resembles him closely in almost every detail. The latter abuses the former with mounting scorn and brutality as the tale proceeds toward its frightening denouement. Characteristic Dostoyevskyan themes of helplessness, victimization, and scandal are beautifully handled here with an artistry that qualifies the story as a small masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;Students of literature, admirers of Dostoyevsky, and general readers will all be delighted to have this classic work available in this inexpensive but high-quality edition. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;One Breath&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping and powerful exploration of the strange and fascinating sport of freediving, and of the tragic, untimely death of America's greatest freediver &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Competitive freediving-a sport built on diving as deep as possible on a single breath-tests the limits of human ability in the most hostile environment on earth. The unique and eclectic breed of individuals who freedive at the highest level regularly dive hundreds of feet below the ocean's surface, reaching such depths that their organs compress, light disappears, and one mistake could kill them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even among freedivers, few have ever gone as deep as Nicholas Mevoli. A handsome young American with an unmatched talent for the sport, Nick was among freediving's brightest stars. He was also an extraordinary individual, one who rebelled against the vapid and commoditized society around him by relentlessly questing for something more meaningful and authentic, whatever the risks. So when Nick Mevoli arrived at Vertical Blue in 2013, the world's premier freediving competition, he was widely expected to challenge records and continue his meteoric rise to stardom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, before the end of that fateful competition Nick Mevoli had died, a victim of the sport that had made him a star, and the very future of free diving was called into question. With unparalleled access and masterfully crafted prose, &lt;i&gt;One Breath &lt;/i&gt;tells his unforgettable story, and of the sport which shaped and ultimately destroyed him.</description>

  <description>How many of us sometimes feel that we are scratching at the walls of this life, seeking to find our way into a wider space beyond? That our mild, polite existence sometimes seems to crush the breath out of us? Feral is the lyrical and gripping story of George Monbiot's efforts to re-engage with nature and discover a new way of living. He shows how, by restoring and rewilding our damaged ecosystems on land and at sea, we can bring wonder back into our lives. Making use of some remarkable scientific discoveries, Feral lays out a new, positive environmentalism, in which nature is allowed to find its own way.</description>

  <description>Seashells, stretching from the deep past into the present day, are touchstones leading into fascinating realms of the natural world and cutting-edge science. Members of the phylum Mollusca are among the most ancient animals on the planet. Their shells provide homes for other animals, and across the ages, people have used shells not only as trinkets but also as a form of money, and as powerful symbols of sex and death, prestige and war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The science and natural history of shells are woven into a compelling narrative, revealing their cultural importance and the ways they have been used by humans over the millennia. (Seashells have even been tapped as a source of mind-bending drugs.) Marine biologist Helen Scales shows how seashells have been sculpted by the fundamental rules of mathematics and evolution; how they gave us color, gems, food, and new medicines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After surviving multiple mass extinctions millions of years ago, molluscs and their shells still face an onslaught of anthropogenic challenges, including climate change and corrosive oceans. But rather than dwelling on all that is lost, Scales emphasizes that seashells offer an accessible way to reconnect people with nature, helping to bridge the gap between ourselves and the living world. &lt;i&gt;Spirals in Time: The&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; Secret Life and Curious Afterlife of Seashells &lt;/i&gt;shows why nature matters, and reveals the hidden wonders that you can hold in the palm of your hand.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"On the day after humans disappear, nature takes over and immediately begins cleaning house - or houses, that is. Cleans them right off the face of the earth. They all go."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if mankind disappeared right now, forever ... what would happen to the Earth in a week, a year, a millennium? Could the planet's climate ever recover from human activity? How would nature destroy our huge cities and our myriad plastics? And what would our final legacy be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking to experts in fields as diverse as oil production and ecology, and visiting the places that have escaped recent human activity to discover how they have adapted to life without us, Alan Weisman paints an intriguing picture of the future of Earth. Exploring key concerns of our time, this absorbing thought experiment reveals a powerful - and surprising - picture of our planet's future.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Landskipping&lt;/i&gt;, Anna Pavord explores some of Britain's most iconic landscapes in the past, in the present, and in literature. With her passionate, personal, and lyrical style, Pavord considers how different artists and agriculturists have responded to these environments. Like the author's previous book &lt;i&gt;The Tulip&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Landskipping&lt;/i&gt; is as sublime and picturesque as its subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Landskipping features an eclectic mix of locations, both ecologically and culturally significant, such as the Highlands of Scotland, the famous landscapes of the Lake District, and the Celtic hill forts of the West Country. These are some of the most recognizable landscapes in all of Britain. Along the way, Pavord annotates her fascinating journey with evocative descriptions of the country's natural beauty and brings to life travelers of earlier times who left fascinating accounts of their journeys by horseback and on foot through the most remote corners of the British Isles.</description>

  <description>The story follows Prince Prospero's attempts to avoid a dangerous plague known as the Red Death by hiding in his abbey. He, along with many other wealthy nobles, has a masquerade ball within seven rooms of his abbey, each decorated with a different color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the midst of their revelry, a mysterious figure disguised as a Red Death victim enters and makes his way through each of the rooms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The story follows many traditions of Gothic fiction and is often analyzed as an allegory about the inevitability of death, though some critics advise against an allegorical reading. Many different interpretations have been presented, as well as attempts to identify the true nature of the titular disease.</description>

  <description>The compelling story of two outsiders striving to find their place in an unforgiving world. Drifters in search of work, George and his simple-minded friend Lennie have nothing in the world except each other and a dream--a dream that one day they will have some land of their own. Eventually they find work on a ranch in California’s Salinas Valley, but their hopes are doomed as Lennie, struggling against extreme cruelty, misunderstanding and feelings of jealousy, becomes a victim of his own strength. Tackling universal themes such as the friendship of a shared vision, and giving voice to America’s lonely and dispossessed, &lt;i&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/i&gt; has proved one of Steinbeck’s most popular works, achieving success as a novel, a Broadway play and three acclaimed films.</description>

  <description>To some it's the classic "gateway drug", to others it is a harmless way to relax, or provide relief from crippling pain. Some fear it is a dangerous drug with addictive properties; to others still it is a legal anomaly and should be decriminalized. Whatever the viewpoint, and by whatever name it is known, cannabis--or marijuana, hashish, dope, pot, weed, grass, ganja--incites debate at every level, and the effect it has on the cultures and economics of every corner of the globe is undeniable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this definitive study, Martin Booth crafts a tale of medical advance, religious enlightenment, political subterfuge and human rights; of law enforcement and custom officers, cunning smugglers, street pushers, gang warfare, writers, artists, musicians, and happy-go-lucky hippies and potheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Booth chronicles the fascinating and often mystifying process through which cannabis, a relatively harmless substance, became outlawed throughout the Western world, and the devastating effect such legislation has on the global economy. Above all, he demonstrates how the case for decriminalization remains one of the twenty-first century's hottest topics.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Keiko Furukura had always been considered a strange child, and her parents always worried how she would get on in the real world, so when she takes on a job in a convenience store while at university, they are delighted for her. For her part, in the convenience store she finds a predictable world mandated by the store manual, which dictates how the workers should act and what they should say, and she copies her coworkers' style of dress and speech patterns so she can play the part of a normal person. However, eighteen years later, at age 36, she is still in the same job, has never had a boyfriend, and has only few friends. She feels comfortable in her life but is aware that she is not living up to society's expectations and causing her family to worry about her. When a similarly alienated but cynical and bitter young man comes to work in the store, he will upset Keiko's contented stasis—but will it be for the better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sayaka Murata brilliantly captures the atmosphere of the familiar convenience store that is so much part of life in Japan. With some laugh-out-loud moments prompted by the disconnect between Keiko's thoughts and those of the people around her, she provides a sharp look at Japanese society and the pressure to conform, as well as penetrating insights into the female mind. &lt;i&gt;Convenience Store Woman&lt;/i&gt; is a fresh, charming portrait of an unforgettable heroine that recalls Banana Yoshimoto, Han Kang, and &lt;i&gt;Amelie&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>#1 "New York Times" bestselling author and finalist for the National Book Award -- one of the most admired and controversial public intellectuals of our time -- shares his personal life story. &lt;br /&gt;Most who have observed Christopher Hitchens over the years would agree that he possesses a ferocious intellect and is unafraid to tackle the most contentious subjects. Now 60, English-born and American by adoption; all atheist and partly Jewish; bohemian (even listing "drinking" along with "disputation" as "hobbies" in "Who's Who"), he has held to a consistent thread of principle whether opposing war in Vietnam or supporting intervention in Iraq. As a foreign correspondent in some of the world's nastiest places, a lecturer and teacher and an esteemed literary critic, Hitchens manifests a style that is at once ironic, witty, and tough-minded. A legendary bon vivant with an unquenchable thirst for literature, he has sometimes ridiculed those who claim that the personal is political, though he has often seemed to illustrate that very idea. Readers will find that his own many opposites attract, as do his many sketches of friendship and ex-friendship, from Martin Amis to Noam Chomsky. Condemned to be able to see both sides of any argument, Christopher Hitchens has contradictions that contain their own multitudes. "From the Hardcover edition."</description>

  <description>An entrancing, otherworldly collection of short stories from one of Europe's most accomplished 20th century writers, new to Penguin Modern Classics&lt;br /&gt;A counter-prophet attempts the impossible to prove his power; a girl sees the hideous fate of her sisters and father in a mirror bought from a gypsy; the death of a prostitute causes an unanticipated uprising; and the lives of every ordinary person since 1789 are recreated in the almighty Encyclopedia of the Dead. These stories about love and death, truth and lies, myth and reality range across many epochs and settings. Brilliantly combining fact and fiction, epic and miniature, horror and comedy, this was Danilo Kiš final work, published in Serbo-Croatian in 1983.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiš is one of the great European writers of the post-war period - Guardian&lt;br /&gt;Compulsively readable - Daily Telegraph &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantasy chases reality and reality chases fantasy. Pirandello and Borges are not far away. But these names are intended as approximate references. Kiš is a new, original writer - Times Literary Supplement &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intense and exotic, his mysteries hint at unspeakable secrets that remain forever beyond the story-teller's grasp - Boyd Tonkin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danilo Kiš was born in the then Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1935. After an unsettled childhood during the Second World War, in which several of his family members were killed, Kiš studied literature at the University of Belgrade where he lived for most of his adult life. He wrote novels, short stories and poetry and went on to receive the prestigious NIN Award for his novel Pešcanik. He died in Paris in 1989.</description>

  <description>LATTICING one cherry pie after another, an Ohio housewife tries to bridge the gaps between reality and the torrent of meaningless info that is the United States of America. She worries about her children, her dead parents, African elephants, the bedroom rituals of “happy couples”, Weapons of Mass Destruction, and how to hatch an abandoned wood pigeon egg. Is there some trick to surviving survivalists? School shootings? Medical debts? Franks ’n’ beans?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A scorching indictment of America’s barbarity, past and present, and a lament for the way we are sleepwalking into environmental disaster, Ducks, Newburyport is a heresy, a wonder—and a revolution in the novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s also very, very funny.</description>

  <description>The heatwave of 1976. Following the accidental drowning of her sister, sixteen-year-old Nif and her family move to a small village on the Welsh borders to escape their grief. But rural seclusion doesn't bring any relief. As her family unravels, Nif begins to put together her own form of witchcraft - collecting talismans from the sun-starved land. That is, until she meets Mally, a teen boy who takes a keen interest in her, and has his own secret rites to divulge. Reminiscent of the suspense of Shirley Jackson and soaked in the folk horror of the British landscape, &lt;em&gt;Water Shall Refuse Them&lt;/em&gt; is an atmospheric coming-of-age novel and a thrilling debut.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Please Read This Leaflet Carefully&lt;/em&gt;, the debut novel from Norwegian writer and translator Karen Havelin, is the story of a woman whose body has become her enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The novel tracks backward, from 2016 until 1995, etching details of daily life into a gripping and darkly humorous bildungsroman, about the intricacies of love and life in a fragile body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We meet Laura Fjellstad first as she works and cares for her young daughter, while struggling with debilitating pain and endometriosis, an invisible chronic illness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the reader moves in reverse to meet Laura’s younger and somewhat healthier selves (a hopeful bride in New York, a baby queer in Paris, a figure skater in Norway) we uncover her tireless work to gain control of her identity, her illness and the conflicting demands made by doctors, friends, lovers and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man Booker Prize-winning author Paul Beatty says most books about disease try to describe the pain; told in poetic whisper, Karen Havelin's debut novel lets pain speak for itself. It's a book that dares you be nosy, to eavesdrop and listen in to a stoic young woman whom no one noticed until she began to disappear, her body disintegrating from the inside out until there's nothing left but searing agony and almost impossibly―a burning triumph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jarringly funny and perceptive; an intimate reckoning with the inner demons and precarity of everyday life, unpacked through the very specific lens of a woman with chronic pain.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"It's no exaggeration to say that &lt;i&gt;Behave &lt;/i&gt;is one of the best nonfiction books I've ever read." --David P. Barash, &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It has my vote for science book of the year." &lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;Parul Sehgal, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Hands-down one of the best books I've read in years. I loved it." --&lt;b&gt;Dina Temple-Raston, &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Named a Best Book of the Year by &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the celebrated neurobiologist and primatologist, a landmark, genre-defining examination of human behavior, both good and bad, and an answer to the question: &lt;b&gt;Why do we do the things we do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sapolsky's storytelling concept is delightful but it also has a powerful intrinsic logic: he starts by looking at the factors that bear on a person's reaction in the precise moment a behavior occurs, and then hops back in time from there, in stages, ultimately ending up at the deep history of our species and its evolutionary legacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so the first category of explanation is the neurobiological one. A behavior occurs--whether an example of humans at our best, worst, or somewhere in between. What went on in a person's brain a second before the behavior happened? Then Sapolsky pulls out to a slightly larger field of vision, a little earlier in time: What sight, sound, or smell caused the nervous system to produce that behavior? And then, what hormones acted hours to days earlier to change how responsive that individual is to the stimuli that triggered the nervous system? By now he has increased our field of vision so that we are thinking about neurobiology and the sensory world of our environment and endocrinology in trying to explain what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sapolsky keeps going: How was that behavior influenced by structural changes in the nervous system over the preceding months, by that person's adolescence, childhood, fetal life, and then back to his or her genetic makeup? Finally, he expands the view to encompass factors larger than one individual. How did culture shape that individual's group, what ecological factors millennia old formed that culture? And on and on, back to evolutionary factors millions of years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is one of the most dazzling tours d'horizon of the science of human behavior ever attempted, a majestic synthesis that harvests cutting-edge research across a range of disciplines to provide a subtle and nuanced perspective on why we ultimately do the things we do...for good and for ill. Sapolsky builds on this understanding to wrestle with some of our deepest and thorniest questions relating to tribalism and xenophobia, hierarchy and competition, morality and free will, and war and peace. Wise, humane, often very funny, &lt;i&gt;Behave&lt;/i&gt; is a towering achievement, powerfully humanizing, and downright heroic in its own right.</description>

  <description>"This book will shake your preconceptions about the deaf, about language and about thought--. Sacks [is] one of the finest and most thoughtful writers of our time."--&lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like &lt;b&gt;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&lt;/b&gt;, this is a fascinating voyage into a strange and wonderful land, a provocative meditation on communication, biology, adaptation, and culture.  In &lt;b&gt;Seeing Voices&lt;/b&gt;, Oliver Sacks turns his attention to the subject of deafness, and the result is a deeply felt portrait of a minority struggling for recognition and respect--a minority with its own rich, sometimes astonishing, culture and unique visual language, an extraordinary mode of communication that tells us much about the basis of language in hearing people as well. &lt;b&gt;Seeing Voices&lt;/b&gt; is, as Studs Terkel has written, "an exquisite, as well as revelatory, work."</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;'I am dreaming of the edge-land again'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After moving from London to a new home in Yorkshire, Rob Cowen finds himself on unfamiliar territory, disoriented, hemmed in by winter and yearning for the nearest open space. So one night, he sets out to find it – a pylon-slung edge-land, a tangle of wood, meadow, field and river on the outskirts of town. Despite being in the shadow of thousands of houses, it feels unclaimed, forgotten, caught between worlds, and all the more magical for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obsessively revisiting this contested ground, Cowen ventures deeper into its many layers and lives, documenting its changes through time and season and unearthing histories that profoundly resonate and intertwine with transformative events happening in his own life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blurring the boundaries of memoir, natural history and novel, &lt;i&gt;Common Ground&lt;/i&gt; offers nothing less than an enthralling new way of writing about nature and our experiences within it. We encounter the edge-land's inhabitants in immersive, kaleidoscopic detail as their voices and visions rise from the fields and woods: beasts, birds, insects, plants and people – the beggars, sages and lovers across the ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Startlingly personal and poetic,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;this is a unique portrait of a forgotten realm and a remarkable evocation of how, over the course of a year, a man came to know himself once more by unlocking it. But, above all, this is a book that reasserts a vital truth: nature isn’t just found in some remote mountain or protected park. It is all around us. It is in us. It&lt;i&gt; is &lt;/i&gt;us.</description>

  <description>When the stray dog dying on the streets of Moscow is taken in by a wealthy professor, he is subjected to medical experiments in which he receives various transplants of human organs. As he begins to transform into a rowdy, unkempt human by the name of Poligraf Poligrafovich Sharikov, his actions distress the professor and those surrounding him, although he finds himself accepted into the ranks of the Soviet state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A parodic reworking of the Frankenstein myth and a vicious satire of the Communist revolution and the concept of the New Soviet man, A Dog’s Heart was banned by the censors in 1925 and circulated only in samizdat form. Nowadays this hugely entertaining tale has become very popular in Russia, and has inspired many adaptations across the world.&lt;br /&gt;________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Bulgakov was not merely a brilliant observer of what was going on around him, but had an uncanny ability to pick out the particular manifestations of folly and discord which would set the tone of the era to follow.'

  <description>In the fields and forests of western New York State in the late 1960s, several dozen idealists set out to live off the land, founding what becomes a famous commune centered on the grounds of a decaying mansion called Arcadia House. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Arcadia&lt;/i&gt; follows this lyrical, rollicking, tragic, and exquisite utopian dream from its hopeful start through its heyday and after. The story is told from the point of view of Bit, a fascinating character and the first child born in &lt;i&gt;Arcadia&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A fascinating and poignant memoir of the body and its care, told through the experiences of a young nurse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a teenager, Molly Case underwent an operation that saved her life. Nearly a decade later, she finds herself in the operating room again—this time as a trainee nurse. She learns to care for her patients, sharing not only their pain, but also life- affirming moments of hope. In doing so, she offers a compelling account of the processes that keep them alive, from respiratory examinations to surgical prep. But when Molly’s father is admitted to the cardiac unit where she works, the professional and the personal suddenly collide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In rich, lyrical prose, Case illustrates the intricacies of the human condition through the hand of a stranger, offered in solace, and in a person’s last breaths. Weaving together medical history, art, memoir, and science, &lt;em&gt;How to Treat People&lt;/em&gt; explores the oscillating rhythms of life and death in a tender reminder that we can all find meaning in the lives of others.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;London, 1888: Jack the Ripper stalks the streets of Whitechapel; national strikes and social unrest threaten the status quo; a grave economic crisis is spreading across the Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; . . . &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yet Her Majesty's government is preoccupied with "a mere book" - or rather, a series of books: new translations of the Rougon-Macquart saga by French literary giant Émile Zola.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;In his time, Zola made his British&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;contemporaries look positively pastoral; much of his work is considered shocking and transgressive even now. But it was his English publisher who bore the brunt of the Victorians' moral outrage at Zola's "realistic" depictions of striking miners, society courtesans and priapic, feuding farmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventy years before &lt;i&gt;Lady Chatterley's Lover &lt;/i&gt;broke the back of British censorship, Henry Vizetelly's commitment to publishing Zola, and to the nascent principle of free speech, not only landed him in the dock and thereafter in prison, but brought to ruin to the publishing house he had founded. Meanwhile, Zola was going from strength to strength, establishing his reputation as a literary legend and falling in love with a woman half his age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lively, humorous and ultimately tragic tale is an exploration of the consequences of translation and censorship which remains relevant today for readers, publishers and authors everywhere.</description>

  <description>'Since Bob has appeared, I've made huge strides in my life. For more than a decade I was a homeless drug addict. I was lost to the world and had forgotten what was important in life. Now I've got myself back on my two feet, but as I put the past behind me, I'm still stepping unsteadily into the future. I still need help in the right direction. Bob is always there to offer guidance and friendship.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James and his street cat Bob have been on a remarkable journey together. In the years since their story ended in the bestselling &lt;i&gt;A Street Cat Named Bob&lt;/i&gt; James, with Bob's help, has begun to find his way back to the real world. Almost every day, Bob provides moments of intelligence, bravery and humour, at the same time opening his human friend's eyes to important truths about friendship, loyalty, trust - and the meaning of happiness. In the continuing tale of their life together James shows the many ways in which Bob has been his protector and guardian angel through times of illness, hardship, even life-threatening danger. As they high five together for their crowds of admirers, James knows that the tricks he's taught Bob are nothing compared to the lessons he's learnt from his street-wise cat.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt; In what is widely hailed as the best of his many novels, Charles Bukowski details the long, lonely years of his own hardscrabble youth in the raw voice of alter ego Henry Chinaski. From a harrowingly cheerless childhood in Germany through acne-riddled high school years and his adolescent discoveries of alcohol, women, and the Los Angeles Public Library's collection of D. H. Lawrence, &lt;i&gt;Ham on Rye&lt;/i&gt; offers a crude, brutal, and savagely funny portrait of an outcast's coming-of-age during the desperate days of the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A bestselling first collection of humorous and insightful essays by a luminary of the women's liberation movement&lt;br /&gt;These essays from Gloria Steinem's first three decades of work offer a portrait of a woman who was not only one of the savviest leaders of the women's liberation movement, but also a profoundly humane thinker with a wide-ranging intellect and irresistible wit. In "If Men Could Menstruate," Steinem engages readers in a flight of imagination as incisive as it is hilarious. She offers first-person journalism in her underground expos"e" "I Was a Playboy Bunny," provides heartbreaking memoir in the story of her mother's struggles in "Ruth's Song," and stakes important positions in feminist theory in "Erotica vs. Pornography." This is Steinem at her most provocative--and most compassionate.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Asylums&lt;/i&gt; is an analysis of life in "total institutions"--closed worlds like prisons, army camps, boarding schools, nursing homes and mental hospitals. It focuses on the relationship between the inmate and the institution, how the setting affects the person and how the person can deal with life on the inside.</description>

  <description>Originally published in 1988, Anthony Storr's enlightening meditation on the creative individual's need for solitude has become a classic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Solitude&lt;/i&gt; was seminal in challenging the established belief that "interpersonal relationships of an intimate kind are the chief, if not the only, source of human happiness." Indeed, most self-help literature still places relationships at the center of human existence. Lucid and lyrical, Storr's book cites numerous examples of brilliant scholars and artists -- from Beethoven and Kant to Anne Sexton and Beatrix Potter -- to demonstrate that solitude ranks alongside relationships in its impact on an individual's well-being and productivity, as well as on society's progress and health. But solitary activity is essential not only for geniuses, says Storr; the average person, too, is enriched by spending time alone. &lt;br /&gt; For fifteen years, readers have found inspiration and renewal in Storr's erudite, compassionate vision of human experience.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Цитата&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Книга «Поток» представляет собой очень нетривиальный подход к проблемам эмоциональной жизни человека и регуляции поведения. Радость потока — это высшая награда, которой может одарить нас природа за стремление к решению все более и более сложных задач. В отличие от уровня жизни качество переживаний можно повысить, заплатив только одной валютой — вложением внимания и организованных усилий; другая валюта в царстве потока не котируется. Чиксентмихайи напоминает: счастье — это не то, что просто случается с нами, это и искусство, и наука, это то, что требует усилий и своеобразной квалификации. «Ключ к счастью лежит в умении контролировать себя, свои чувства и впечатления, находя таким образом радость в окружающей нас повседневности».&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Дмитрий Леонтьев,&lt;br /&gt;доктор психологических наук&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;О чем книга «Поток: Психология оптимального переживания»&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Исследуя творческих личностей, автор обнаружил в своих исследованиях, что они счастливы благодаря тому, что в процессе озарения испытывают состояние потока. Но поток не является исключительным достоянием каких-то особых людей. Автор выстраивает детальную, стройную и экспериментально подтвержденную теорию, в центре которой находится идея потока. Это состояние полного слияния со своим делом, поглощения им, когда не ощущаешь времени, самого себя, когда вместо усталости возникает постоянный прилив энергии.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Почему книга «Поток» достойна прочтения&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cостояние потока — одна из самых прекрасных вещей в нашей жизни. И книга приведет читателя к этому состоянию.&lt;br /&gt; Оказывается, счастье не снисходит на нас как благодать, а порождается нашими осмысленными усилиями, оно в наших руках.&lt;br /&gt; Редкий пример служения высокой науки обычному человеку.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Для кого эта книга&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Для всех, кто стремится по-настоящему счастливо прожить эту жизнь. Для тех, кто интересуется психологией как дисциплиной, кого в принципе привлекает феномен счастья, ну и для всех тех, кому этого самого счастья так сильно не хватает в собственной жизни. Ведь в состоянии потока удовольствие сливается с усилиями и смыслом, порождая питающее энергией безграничное состояние радости.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Кто автор&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Михай Чиксентмихайи – психолог, заслуженный профессор и директор центра исследований качества жизни Клермонтского университета (США), член Американской академии образования, Американской академии наук и искусств и Национальной академии исследований досуга, автор около 20 книг, наиболее известная из которых – «Поток» - переведена на 30 языков. Живет и работает в США.</description>

  <description>Filippo Brunelleschi's design for the dome of the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence remains one of the most towering achievements of Renaissance architecture. Completed in 1436, the dome remains a remarkable feat of design and engineering. Its span of more than 140 feet exceeds St Paul's in London and St Peter's in Rome, and even outdoes the Capitol in Washington, D.C., making it the largest dome ever constructed using bricks and mortar. The story of its creation and its brilliant but "hot-tempered" creator is told in Ross King's delightful &lt;i&gt;Brunelleschi's Dome&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt; Both dome and architect offer King plenty of rich material. The story of the dome goes back to 1296, when work began on the cathedral, but it was only in 1420, when Brunelleschi won a competition over his bitter rival Lorenzo Ghiberti to design the daunting cupola, that work began in earnest. King weaves an engrossing tale from the political intrigue, personal jealousies, dramatic setbacks, and sheer inventive brilliance that led to the paranoid Filippo, "who was so proud of his inventions and so fearful of plagiarism," finally seeing his dome completed only months before his death. King argues that it was Brunelleschi's improvised brilliance in solving the problem of suspending the enormous cupola in bricks and mortar (painstakingly detailed with precise illustrations) that led him to "succeed in performing an engineering feat whose structural daring was without parallel." He tells a compelling, informed story, ranging from discussions of the construction of the bricks, mortar, and marble that made up the dome, to its subsequent use as a scientific instrument by the Florentine astronomer Paolo Toscanelli. &lt;i&gt;--Jerry Brotton, Amazon.co.uk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Sometimes, the legacy of depression includes a wisdom beyond one's years, a depth of passion unexperienced by those who haven't traveled to hell and back. Off the charts in its enlightening, comprehensive analysis of this pervasive yet misunderstood condition, &lt;i&gt;The Noonday Demon&lt;/i&gt; forges a long, brambly path through the subject of depression--exposing all the discordant views and "answers" offered by science, philosophy, law, psychology, literature, art, and history. The result is a sprawling and thoroughly engrossing study, brilliantly synthesized by author Andrew Solomon. &lt;p&gt; Deceptively simple chapter titles (including "Breakdowns," "Treatments," "Addiction," "Suicide") each sit modestly atop a virtual avalanche of Solomon's intellect. This is not a book to be skimmed. But Solomon commands the language--and his topic--with such grace and empathy that the constant flow of references, poems, and quotations in his paragraphs arrive like welcome dinner guests. A longtime sufferer of severe depression himself, Solomon willingly shares his life story with readers. He discusses updated information on various drugs and treatment approaches while detailing his own trials with them. He describes a pharmaceutical company's surreal stage production (involving Pink Floyd, kick dancers, and an opener à la &lt;i&gt;Cats&lt;/i&gt;) promoting a new antidepressant to their sales team. He chronicles his research visits to assorted mental institutions, which left him feeling he would "&lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; rather engage with every manner of private despair than spend a protracted time" there. Under Solomon's care, however, such tales offer much more than shock value. They show that depression knows no social boundaries, manifests itself quite differently in each person, and has become political. And, while it may worsen or improve, depression will never be eradicated. Hope lies in finding ways--as Solomon clearly has--to harness its powerful lessons. &lt;i&gt;--Liane Thomas&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>For thirty-two years Ken Steele lived with the devastating symptoms of schizophrenia, tortured by inner voices commanding him to kill himself, ravaged by the delusions of paranoia, barely surviving on the ragged edges of society. In this inspiring story, Steele tells the story of his hard-won recovery from schizophrenia and how activism and advocacy helped him regain his sanity and go on to give hope and support to so many others like him.</description>

  <description>In an age when much American writing was either glacially noncommittal or heremetically personal, William Styron persisted in addressing great moral issues with incendiary passion. Seriousness and ardor characterize all the essays in &lt;i&gt;This Quiet Dust&lt;/i&gt;, the first book of nonfiction by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Lie Down in Darkness&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Sophie's Choice&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this edition, which has been updated with the inclusion of six previously uncollected essays, Styron covers a wide range of concerns; yet whether he is recounting his search for the historic Nat Turner, peering into the abyss of Auschwitz, navigating the battlefields of Vietnam and Chicago in 1968, or offering fresh assessments of Thomas Wolfe, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, James Jones, and Robert Penn Warren, Styron is always a consummate literary stylist. One who is as engaging as he is engaged.</description>

  <description>In this first volume of her autobiography, New Zealand novelist Janet Frame tells of her childhood as the daughter of an impoverished railway worker and a mother who aspired to publish poetry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite material privations and family conflicts, the world of the imagination was accorded a supreme place in the Frame household, and it was at this time that Janet Frame acquired her lifelong love for Romantic poetry and her tactile sense of the power of words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amongst evocations of New Zealand landscape and the recall of childhood perceptions, we learn of the tragic death by drowning of her sister Myrtle, her brother's epilepsy - and begin to feel the dark undercurrents that were to suck Janet Frame under in the years before she found herself as a writer.</description>

  <description>Olympic swimmer Jesse Austin is seduced and consequently edged out for a gold medal by her Australian rival. From there, Anshaw intricately traces three possible paths for Jesse, spinning exhilarating variations on the themes of lost love and parallel lives unlived. Dorothy Allison, author of &lt;i&gt;Bastard Out of Carolina&lt;/i&gt;, writes, "I found myself wishing I could buy a dozen copies and start a discussion group, just so I'd be able to debate all the questions this astonishing novel provokes." A Reader's Guide is available.</description>

  <description>'One of the most impressive accounts of madness to be found in literature ... A masterpiece' Anita Brookner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Published as part of a beautifully designed series to mark the 40th anniversary of the Virago Modern Classics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'I was now an established citizen with little hope of returning across the frontier; I was in the crazy world, separated now by more than locked doors and barred windows from the people who called themselves sane.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Janet Frame's doctor suggested that she write about her traumatic experiences in mental institutions in order to free herself from them, the result was Faces in the Water, a powerful and poignant novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Istina Mavet descends through increasingly desolate wards, with the threat of leucotomy ever present. As she observes her fellow patients, long dismissed by hospital staff, with humour and compassion, she reveals her original and questing mind. This riveting novel became an international classic, translated into nine languages, and has also been used as a medical school text.</description>

  <description>Long believed to be disappearing and possibly even extinct, the Southwestern bighorn sheep of Utah’s canyonlands have made a surprising comeback. Naturalist Ellen Meloy tracks a band of these majestic creatures through backcountry hikes, downriver floats, and travels across the Southwest. Alone in the wilderness, Meloy chronicles her communion with the bighorns and laments the growing severance of man from nature, a severance that she feels has left us spiritually hungry. Wry, quirky and perceptive, &lt;i&gt;Eating Stone&lt;/i&gt; is a brillant and wholly original tribute to the natural world.</description>

  <description>In this invigorating mix of natural history and adventure, artist-naturalist Ellen Meloy uses turquoise—the color and the gem—to probe deeper into our profound human attachment to landscape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Sierra Nevada, the Mojave Desert, the Yucatan Peninsula, and the Bahamas to her home ground on the high plateaus and deep canyons of the Southwest, we journey with Meloy through vistas of both great beauty and great desecration. Her keen vision makes us look anew at ancestral mountains, turquoise seas, and even motel swimming pools. She introduces us to Navajo “velvet grandmothers” whose attire and aesthetics absorb the vivid palette of their homeland, as well as to Persians who consider turquoise the life-saving equivalent of a bullet-proof vest. Throughout, Meloy invites us to appreciate along with her the endless surprises in all of life and celebrates the seduction to be found in our visual surroundings.</description>

  <description>A futuristic story of tragic love and of the gradual extermination of the human race by plague, &lt;i&gt;The Last Man&lt;/i&gt; is Mary Shelley's most important novel after Frankenstein. With intriguing portraits of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron, the novel offers a vision of the future that expresses a reaction against Romanticism, and demonstrates the failure of the imagination and of art to redeem the doomed characters.</description>

  <description>Since the time of Aristotle, there had been a clear divide between the three kingdoms of animal, vegetable, and mineral. But by the eighteenth century, biological experiments, and the wide range of new creatures coming to Europe from across the world, challenged these neat divisions. Abraham Trembley found that freshwater polyps grew into complete individuals when cut. This shocking discovery raised deep questions: was it a plant or an animal? And this was not the only conundrum. What of coral? Was it a rock or a living form? Did plants have sexes, like animals? The boundaries appeared to blur. And what did all this say about the nature of life itself? Were animals and plants soul-less, mechanical forms, as Descartes suggested? The debates raging across science played into some of the biggest and most controversial issues of Enlightenment Europe. In this book, Susannah Gibson explains how a study of pond slime could cause people to question the existence of the soul; observation of eggs could make a man doubt that God had created the world; how the discovery of the Venus fly-trap was linked to the French Revolution; and how interpretations of fossils could change our understanding of the Earth's history. Using rigorous historical research, and a lively and readable style, this book vividly captures the big concerns of eighteenth-century science. And the debates concerning the divisions of life did not end there; they continue to have resonances in modern biology.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A work of great personal courage and a literary tour de force, this bestseller is Styron's true account of his descent into a crippling and almost suicidal depression. Styron is perhaps the first writer to convey the full terror of depression's psychic landscape, as well as the illuminating path to recovery.</description>

"Staggering . . . the most extraordinary, precise, deep, and beautiful account of blindness I have ever read".--Oliver Sacks, author of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.</description>

  <description>Alternate cover for ISBN 9780345350688&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through a life of passion and struggle, Malcolm X became one of the most influential figures of the 20th Century. In this riveting account, he tells of his journey from a prison cell to Mecca, describing his transition from hoodlum to Muslim minister. Here, the man who called himself "the angriest Black man in America" relates how his conversion to true Islam helped him confront his rage and recognize the brotherhood of all mankind. &lt;br /&gt;An established classic of modern America, "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" was hailed by the New York Times as "Extraordinary. A brilliant, painful, important book." Still extraordinary, still important, this electrifying story has transformed Malcom X's life into his legacy. The strength of his words, the power of his ideas continue to resonate more than a generation after they first appeared.</description>

      <![CDATA[I very much enjoyed the first half of this book which detailed Malcolm X's upbringing, schooling, family life, teenage hood and his days on the mean streets as a hustler! The writing was joyful, funny, audacious and interesting; you get a sense of a character with real edge but cheek and charisma...]]>

  <description>From autumn to spring, J.A. Baker set out to track the daily comings and goings of a pair of peregrine falcons across the flat fen lands of eastern England. He followed the birds obsessively, observing them in the air and on the ground, in pursuit of their prey, making a kill, eating, and at rest, activities he describes with an extraordinary fusion of precision and poetry. And as he continued his mysterious private quest, his sense of human self slowly dissolved, to be replaced with the alien and implacable consciousness of a hawk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is this extraordinary metamorphosis, magical and terrifying, that these beautifully written pages record.</description>

  <description>One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit. Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. But we tend to take the situation for granted. Most people are rather confident of their ability to recognize bullshit and to avoid being taken in by it. So the phenomenon has not aroused much deliberate concern. We have no clear understanding of what bullshit is, why there is so much of it, or what functions it serves. And we lack a conscientiously developed appreciation of what it means to us. In other words, as Harry Frankfurt writes, "we have no theory."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankfurt, one of the world's most influential moral philosophers, attempts to build such a theory here. With his characteristic combination of philosophical acuity, psychological insight, and wry humor, Frankfurt proceeds by exploring how bullshit and the related concept of humbug are distinct from lying. He argues that bullshitters misrepresent themselves to their audience not as liars do, that is, by deliberately making false claims about what is true. In fact, bullshit need not be untrue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather, bullshitters seek to convey a certain impression of themselves without being concerned about whether anything at all is true. They quietly change the rules governing their end of the conversation so that claims about truth and falsity are irrelevant. Frankfurt concludes that although bullshit can take many innocent forms, excessive indulgence in it can eventually undermine the practitioner's capacity to tell the truth in a way that lying does not. Liars at least acknowledge that it matters what is true. By virtue of this, Frankfurt writes, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Žižek analyzes the end of the world at the hands of the “four riders of the apocalypse.”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There should no longer be any doubt: global capitalism is fast approaching its terminal crisis. Slavoj Žižek has identified the four horsemen of this coming apocalypse: the worldwide ecological crisis; imbalances within the economic system; the biogenetic revolution; and exploding social divisions and ruptures. But, he asks, if the end of capitalism seems to many like the end of the world, how is it possible for Western society to face up to the end times? In a major new analysis of our global situation, Slavok Žižek argues that our collective responses to economic Armageddon correspond to the stages of grief: ideological denial, explosions of anger and attempts at bargaining, followed by depression and withdrawal.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After passing through this zero-point, we can begin to perceive the crisis as a chance for a new beginning. Or, as Mao Zedong put it, “There is great disorder under heaven, the situation is excellent.” Slavoj Žižek shows the cultural and political forms of these stages of ideological avoidance and political protest, from New Age obscurantism to violent religious fundamentalism. Concluding with a compelling argument for the return of a Marxian critique of political economy, Žižek also divines the wellsprings of a potentially communist culture—from literary utopias like Kafka’s community of mice to the collective of freak outcasts in the TV series &lt;em&gt;Heroes&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A searching, captivating look at the persistence of myth in our modern world&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"By nature volatile and discordant, the human animal looks to silence for relief from being itself while other creatures enjoy silence as their birthright."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;In a book by turns chilling and beautiful, John Gray continues the thinking that made his &lt;i&gt;Straw Dogs&lt;/i&gt; such a cult classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gray draws on an extraordinary array of memoirs, poems, fiction, and philosophy to re-imagine our place in the world. Writers as varied as Ballard, Borges, Conrad, and Freud have been mesmerized by forms of human extremity—experiences that are on the outer edge of the possible or that tip into fantasy and myth. What happens to us when we starve, when we fight, when we are imprisoned? And how do our imaginations leap into worlds way beyond our real experiences?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Silence of Animals&lt;/i&gt; is consistently fascinating, filled with unforgettable images and a delight in the conundrum of human existence—an existence that we decorate with countless myths and ideas, where we twist and turn to avoid acknowledging that we too are animals, separated from the others perhaps only by our self-conceit. In the Babel we have created for ourselves, it is the silence of animals that both reproaches and bewitches us.</description>

  <description>For over 2000 years, philosophy has been our best guide to the experience of being human, and the true nature of reality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Aristotle, Plato, Epicurus, Confucius, Cicero and Heraclitus in ancient times to 17th century rationalists Descartes, Leibniz and Spinoza, from 20th-century greats Jean-Paul Sartre, Jean Baudrillard and Simone de Beauvoir to contemporary thinkers Michael Sandel, Peter Singer and Slavoj Zizek, &lt;i&gt;50 Philosophy Classics&lt;/i&gt; explores key writings that have shaped the discipline and had an impact on the real world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philosophy can no longer be confined to academia, and &lt;i&gt;50 Philosophy Classics&lt;/i&gt; shows how powerful it can be as a tool for opening our minds and helping us think. Whether you are fascinated or daunted by the big questions of how to think, how to be, how to act and how to see, this is the perfect introduction to some of humanity's greatest minds and their landmark books.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a good little "guide to philosophy" if you will, something to dip in and out of depending on your mood and preferences. Butler-Bowden pretty much gives an A-Z of philosophers, and summarizes their main school of thought, their background and the pivotal points of their "teachings". The se...]]>

  <description>A passionate manifesto decrying misogyny in the Arab world, by an Egyptian American journalist and activist When the Egyptian journalist Mona Eltahawy published an article in Foreign Policy magazine in 2012 titled Why Do They Hate Us it provoked a firestorm of controversy. The response it generated, with more than four thousand posts on the website, broke all records for the magazine, prompted dozens of follow-up interviews on radio and television, and made it clear that misogyny in the Arab world is an explosive issue, one that engages and often enrages the public. In Headscarves and Hymens, Eltahawy takes her argument further. Drawing on her years as a campaigner and commentator on womens issues in the Middle East, she explains that since the Arab Spring began, women in the Arab world have had two revolutions to undertake one fought with men against oppressive regimes, and another fought against an entire political and economic system that treats women in countries from Yemen and Saudi Arabia to Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya as second-class citizens. Eltahawy has traveled across the Middle East and North Africa, meeting with women and listening to their stories. Her book is a plea for outrage and action on their behalf, confronting the toxic mix of culture and religion that few seem willing or able to disentangle lest they blaspheme or offend. A manifesto motivated by hope and fury in equal measure, Headscarves and Hymens is as illuminating as it is incendiary.</description>

  <description>Chris works as a librarian in a small-town library in the south of England. This is the story of the library, its staff, and the fascinating group of people who use the library on a regular basis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet characters like the street-sleepers Brewer, Wolf and Spencer, who are always the first through the doors. The Mad Hatter, an elderly man who scurries around manically, searching for books. Sons of Anarchy Alan, a young Down's Syndrome man addicted to the American TV drama series. Startled Stewart, a gay man with a spray-on tan who pops in most days for a nice chat, sharking for good-looking foreign language students. And Trish, who is relentlessly cheerful and always dressed in pink - she has never married, but the marital status of everybody she meets is of huge interest to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the characters' stories are tragic, some are amusing, some are genuinely surreal, but together they will paint a bigger picture of the world we live in today, and of a library's hugely important place within it. Yes, of course, people come in to borrow books, but the library is also the equivalent of the village pump. It's one of the few places left where anyone, regardless of age or income or background, can wander in and find somebody to listen to their concerns, to share the time of day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading Allowed will provide us with a fascinating portrait of a place that we all value and cherish, but which few of us truly know very much about ...</description>

  <description>With &lt;i&gt;The Blazing World&lt;/i&gt;, internationally best­selling author Siri Hustvedt returns to the New York art world in her most masterful and urgent novel since &lt;i&gt;What I Loved&lt;/i&gt;. Hustvedt tells the provocative story of the artist Harriet Burden. After years of watching her work ignored or dismissed by critics, Burden conducts an experiment she calls Maskings: she presents her own art behind three male masks, concealing her female identity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three solo shows are successful, but when Burden finally steps forward triumphantly to reveal herself as the artist behind the exhibitions, there are critics who doubt her. The public scandal turns on the final exhibition, initially shown as the work of acclaimed artist Rune, who denies Burden’s role in its creation. What no one doubts, however, is that the two artists were intensely involved with each other. As Burden’s journals reveal, she and Rune found themselves locked in a charged and dangerous game that ended with the man’s bizarre death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingeniously presented as a collection of texts compiled after Burden’s death, &lt;i&gt;The Blazing World&lt;/i&gt; unfolds from multiple perspectives. The exuberant Burden speaks—in all her joy and fury—through extracts from her own notebooks, while critics, fans, family members, and others offer their own conflicting opinions of who she was, and where the truth lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From one of the most ambitious and interna­tionally renowned writers of her generation, &lt;i&gt;The Blazing World&lt;/i&gt; is a polyphonic tour de force. An intricately conceived, diabolical puzzle, it explores the deceptive powers of prejudice, money, fame, and desire.</description>

  <description>An eloquent and sometimes even erotic book, the Philosophical Enquiry was long dismissed as a piece of mere juvenilia. However, Burke's analysis of the relationship between emotion, beauty, and art form is now recognized as not only an important and influential work of aesthetic theory, but also one of the first major works in European literature on the Sublime, a subject that has fascinated thinkers from Kant and Coleridge to the philosophers and critics of today.</description>

  <description>Imagine you have survived an apocalypse. Civilization as you knew it is no more. What will life be like and how will you cope?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2006, Dylan Evans set out to answer these questions. He left his job in a high-tech robotics lab, moved to the Scottish Highlands and founded a community called &lt;i&gt;The Utopia Experiment&lt;/i&gt;. There, together with an eclectic assortment of volunteers, he tried to live out a scenario of global collapse, free from modern technology and comforts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a year, Evans found himself detained in a psychiatric hospital, shattered and depressed, trying to figure out what had gone wrong. In &lt;i&gt;The Utopia Experiment&lt;/i&gt; he tells his own extraordinary story: his frenzied early enthusiasm for this unusual project, the many challenges of post-apocalyptic living, his descent into madness and his gradual recovery. In the process, he learns some hard lessons about himself and about life, and comes to see the modern world he abandoned in a new light.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;'I emerged from this book feeling better about almost everything... a mosaic of faces building into this extraordinary portrait of our species.' &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;'The Ten Types of Human&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; is a fantastic piece of non-fiction, mixing astonishing real-life cases with the latest scientific research to provide a guide to who we really are. It’s inspiring and essential.'&lt;/b&gt; Charles Duhigg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Uplifting and indispensable.'&lt;/b&gt; Howard Cunnell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book will introduce you to ten people. In a way, you already know them. Only you don’t – not really. In a sense, they are you. Only they’re not entirely. They inform and shape the most important decisions in your life. But you’re almost certainly unaware of their intervention. They are the Ten Types of Human. Who are they? What are they for? How did they get into your head? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We want to believe that there are some things we would never do. We want to believe that there are others we always would. But how can we be sure? What are our limits? Do we have limits?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer lies with the Ten Types of Human: the people we become when we are faced with life's most difficult decisions. But who or what are these Types? Where do they come from? How did they get into our heads?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Ten Types of Human&lt;/i&gt; is a pioneering examination of human nature. It looks at the best and worst that human beings are capable of, and asks why. It explores the frontiers of the human experience, excavating the forces that shape our thoughts and actions in extreme situations. It begins in a courtroom and journeys across four continents and through the lives of some exceptional people, in search of answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixing cutting-edge neuroscience, social psychology and human rights research, &lt;i&gt;The Ten Types of Human&lt;/i&gt; is at once a provocation and a map to our hidden selves. It provides a new understanding of who we are – and who we can be.</description>

  <description>In 2014, award-winning journalist Reni Eddo-Lodge wrote about her frustration with the way that discussions of race and racism in Britain were being led by those who weren't affected by it. She posted a piece on her blog, entitled: 'Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race' that led to this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exploring issues from eradicated black history to the political purpose of white dominance, whitewashed feminism to the inextricable link between class and race, Reni Eddo-Lodge offers a timely and essential new framework for how to see, acknowledge and counter racism. It is a searing, illuminating, absolutely necessary exploration of what it is to be a person of colour in Britain today.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In&lt;i&gt; Sapiens, &lt;/i&gt;he explored our past. In &lt;i&gt;Homo Deus, &lt;/i&gt;he looked to our future&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;Now, one of the most innovative thinkers on the planet turns to the present to make sense of today's most pressing issues.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do computers and robots change the meaning of being human? How do we deal with the epidemic of fake news? Are nations and religions still relevant? What should we teach our children?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuval Noah Harari's &lt;i&gt;21 Lessons for the 21st Century&lt;/i&gt; is a probing and visionary investigation into today's most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future. As technology advances faster than our understanding of it, hacking becomes a tactic of war, and the world feels more polarized than ever, Harari addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting change and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In twenty-one accessible chapters that are both provocative and profound, Harari builds on the ideas explored in his previous books, untangling political, technological, social, and existential issues and offering advice on how to prepare for a very different future from the world we now live in: How can we retain freedom of choice when Big Data is watching us? What will the future workforce look like, and how should we ready ourselves for it? How should we deal with the threat of terrorism? Why is liberal democracy in crisis?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harari's unique ability to make sense of where we have come from and where we are going has captured the imaginations of millions of readers. Here he invites us to consider values, meaning, and personal engagement in a world full of noise and uncertainty. When we are deluged with irrelevant information, clarity is power. Presenting complex contemporary challenges clearly and accessibly, &lt;i&gt;21 Lessons for the 21st Century&lt;/i&gt; is essential reading.</description>

  <description>In postwar rural England, Hilary Mantel grew up convinced that the most improbable of accomplishments, including "chivalry, horsemanship, and swordplay," were within her grasp. Once married, however, she acquired a persistent pain that led to destructive drugs and patronizing psychiatry, ending in an ineffective but irrevocable surgery. There would be no children; in herself she found instead one novel, and then another.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Nowhere is Patricia Highsmith more edgy than in these mordantly hilarious sketches that make up &lt;i&gt;Little Tales of Misogyny&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here you'll meet seemingly familiar women with the power to destroy both themselves and the men around them. In these stories Highsmith is at her most scathing as she draws out the mystery and menace of her once ordinary subject.</description>

  <description>It is 1900, give or take a few years. The Vajkays—call them Mother and Father—live in Sárszeg, a dead-end burg in the provincial heart of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Father retired some years ago to devote his days to genealogical research and quaint questions of heraldry. Mother keeps house. Both are utterly enthralled with their daughter, Skylark. Unintelligent, unimaginative, unattractive, and unmarried, Skylark cooks and sews for her parents and anchors the unremitting tedium of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Skylark is going away, for one week only, it’s true, but a week that yawns endlessly for her parents. What will they do? Before they know it, they are eating at restaurants, reconnecting with old friends, and attending the theater. But this is just a prelude to Father’s night out at the Panther Club, about which the less said the better. Drunk, in the light of dawn Father surprises himself and Mother with his true, buried, unspeakable feelings about Skylark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, Skylark is back. Is there a world beyond the daily grind and life's creeping disappointments? Kosztolányi’s crystalline prose, perfect comic timing, and profound human sympathy conjure up a tantalizing beauty that lies on the far side of the irredeemably ordinary. To that extent, &lt;i&gt;Skylark&lt;/i&gt; is nothing less than a magical novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From storytelling phenomenon The Moth, 45 unforgettable true stories about risk, courage, and facing the unknown, drawn from the best ever told on their stages&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Carefully selected by the creative minds at The Moth, and adapted to the page to preserve the raw energy of live storytelling, &lt;i&gt;All These Wonders&lt;/i&gt; features voices both familiar and new. Alongside Louis C.K., Tig Notaro, John Turturro, and Meg Wolitzer, readers will encounter: an astronomer gazing at the surface of Pluto for the first time, an Afghan refugee learning how much her father sacrificed to save their family, a hip-hop star coming to terms with being a one-hit wonder, a young female spy risking everything as part of Churchill's secret army during World War II, and more. &lt;br /&gt; High-school student and neuroscientist alike, the storytellers share their ventures into uncharted territory and how their lives were changed indelibly by what they discovered there. With passion, and humor, they encourage us all to be more open, vulnerable, and alive."</description>

  <description>For the first time in print, celebrated storytelling phenomenon The Moth presents fifty spellbinding, soul-bearing stories selected from their extensive archive (fifteen-plus years and 10,000-plus stories strong). Inspired by friends telling stories on a porch, The Moth was born in small-town Georgia, garnered a cult following in New York City, and then rose to national acclaim with the wildly popular podcast and Peabody Award-winning weekly public radio show &lt;i&gt;The Moth Radio Hour&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stories include: writer Malcolm Gladwell's wedding toast gone horribly awry; legendary rapper Darryl "DMC" McDaniels' obsession with a Sarah McLachlan song; poker champion Annie Duke's two-million-dollar hand; and A. E. Hotchner's death-defying stint in a bullring . . . with his friend Ernest Hemingway. Read about the panic of former Clinton Press Secretary Joe Lockhart when he misses Air Force One after a hard night of drinking in Moscow, and Dr. George Lombardi's fight to save Mother Teresa's life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a beloved read for existing Moth enthusiasts, fans of the featured storytellers, and all who savor well-told, hilarious, and heartbreaking stories.</description>

  <description>Henry Marsh has spent a lifetime operating on the surgical front line. There have been exhilarating highs and devastating lows, but his love for the practice of neurosurgery has never wavered. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the publication of his celebrated New York Times bestseller &lt;i&gt;Do No Harm&lt;/i&gt;, Marsh retired from his full-time job in England to work pro bono in Ukraine and Nepal. In &lt;i&gt;Admissions&lt;/i&gt;, he describes the difficulties of working in these troubled, impoverished countries and the further insights it has given him into the practice of medicine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marsh also faces up to the burden of responsibility that can come with trying to reduce human suffering. Unearthing memories of his early days as a medical student and the experiences that shaped him as a young surgeon, he explores the difficulties of a profession that deals in probabilities rather than certainties and where the overwhelming urge to prolong life can come at a tragic cost for patients and those who love them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reflecting on what forty years of handling the human brain has taught him, Marsh finds a different purpose in life as he approaches the end of his professional career and a fresh understanding of what matters to us all in the end.</description>

  <description>Chava is a golem, a creature made of clay, brought to life by a disgraced rabbi who dabbles in dark Kabbalistic magic, created to be the wife of a man who dies at sea on the voyage from Poland. Chava is unmoored and adrift as the ship arrives in New York harbor in 1899. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahmad is a jinni, a being of fire born in the ancient Syrian desert, trapped in an old copper flask, and released in New York City, though still not entirely free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahmad and Chava become unlikely friends and soul mates with a mystical connection. Marvelous and compulsively readable, Helene Wecker's debut novel The Golem and the Jinni weaves strands of Yiddish and Middle Eastern literature, historical fiction and magical fable, into a wondrously inventive and unforgettable tale.</description>

  <description>Ever since Chaucer's day, when the host of the Tabard Inn in Southwark rose to welcome the Canterbury Pilgrims with a joke, the After Dinner Speech, designed, if possible, to reduce the assembled company to helpless merriment, has presented the ultimate challenge. The best speakers are natural story-tellers—Gerard Hoffnung, reading a selection of letters from continental hoteliers: 'There is a French widow in every bedroom affording delightful prospects'; John Mortimer telling the woeful tale of a man's numerous unsuccessful attempts to murder his wife: 'At no time did Mrs Scott feel that the magic had gone out of their marriage'—and in this collection of post-prandial treasures you will find the very best of them, from Groucho Marx on how to resist a femme fatale, to Ralph Steadman surreally addressing the Lewis Carroll Centenary Dinner. 'Goodness', said a friend on greeting Mae West, 'where did you get those beautiful pearls?' 'Goodness', replied Mae, 'had nothing to do with it.' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaggy dog stories, practical jokes, sporting anecdotes, rousing toasts, travellers' tales and risqué reminiscences rub shoulders in this essential collection with real-life revelations and moments of history. Among the guests are Peter Ustinov, Jilly Cooper, Brian Johnstone, Charles Dickens, Dorothy Parker, Robertson Davies, Henry Grady and A.P. Herbert. There is food and drink in abundance. There is gentle reflection and endearing charm as well as defiant frivolity. Above all there are stories for every occasion—witty, absurd, momentous, philosophical, fascinating, poignant, and forever entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No-ISBN.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is ugliness only skin-deep, or can something that is beautifully engineered--a B52 bomber or a Colt .45--also be ugly, if its function is to kill or to maim? What was "Degenerate Art" and why was it deemed such? Why are mountains seen as sublime expression of nature, when only two hundred years ago they were regarded as loathsome things to be avoided at all costs? Just what is the relation, if any, between tattoos and crime? And lastly, if there were no ugliness in the world, would there be any beauty? Stephen Bayley, in his singular and at times tongue-in-cheek style, questions and explains the aesthetics of everything.</description>

  <description>Snowflakes may be an everyday, common subject, but you ve never seen them like this! A collection of amazing photography of snow crystals using a unique system designed to take super-detailed micro images of these miniature ice masterpieces, &lt;i&gt;The Snowflake&lt;/i&gt; is an extraordinary look at a seemingly ordinary object.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general public is interested in popular science subjects, weather, and amazing photography. &lt;i&gt;The Snowflake&lt;/i&gt; has elements of all these, and with its appealing combination of informative text and fascinating photography, there is no other book like it on the market. Author Kenneth Libbrecht, an executive officer of physics at CalTech and the pre-eminent snow-crystal researcher, discusses the physics and mythology of snow and how snow crystals are made. Photographer Patricia Rasmussen presents remarkable color micro-photography of snowflakes, and also discusses the history of snow-crystal micro-photography as invented by farmer Wilson Bentley.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>100,000 years ago, at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Sapiens&lt;/i&gt;, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power ... and our future.</description>

  <description>Dept. of Speculation is a portrait of a marriage. It is also a beguiling rumination on the mysteries of intimacy, trust, faith, knowledge, and the condition of universal shipwreck that unites us all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenny Offill's heroine, referred to in these pages as simply "the wife," once exchanged love letters with her husband postmarked Dept. of Speculation, their code name for all the uncertainty that inheres in life and in the strangely fluid confines of a long relationship. As they confront an array of common catastrophes - a colicky baby, a faltering marriage, stalled ambitions - the wife analyzes her predicament, invoking everything from Keats and Kafka to the thought experiments of the Stoics to the lessons of doomed Russian cosmonauts. She muses on the consuming, capacious experience of maternal love, and the near total destruction of the self that ensues from it as she confronts the friction between domestic life and the seductions and demands of art. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With cool precision, in language that shimmers with rage and wit and fierce longing, Jenny Offill has crafted an exquisitely suspenseful love story that has the velocity of a train hurtling through the night at top speed. Exceptionally lean and compact, Dept. of Speculation is a novel to be devoured in a single sitting, though its bracing emotional insights and piercing meditations on despair and love will linger long after the last page.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;THE &lt;em&gt;SUNDAY TIMES&lt;/em&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Bella’s brilliant love letter to running turns into an extraordinarily brave and frank account of her battle with anxiety. A compassionate and important book’ Joe Lycett&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Perfect for resetting a glum January mindset’ Alexandra Heminsley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘My kind of role model’ Ben Fogle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divorced and struggling with deep-rooted mental health problems, Bella Mackie ended her twenties in tears. She could barely find the strength to get off the sofa, let alone piece her life back together. Until one day she did something she had never done of her own free will – she pulled on a pair of trainers and went for a run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That first attempt didn’t last very long. But to her surprise, she was back out there the next day. And the day after that. She began to set herself achievable goals – to run 5k in under 30 minutes, to walk to work every day for a week, to attempt 10 push-ups in a row. Before she knew it, her mood was lifting for the first time in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Jog On&lt;/em&gt;, Bella explains with hilarious and unfiltered honesty how she used running to battle crippling anxiety and depression, without having to sacrifice her main loves: booze, cigarettes and ice cream. With the help of a supporting cast of doctors, psychologists, sportspeople and friends, she shares a wealth of inspirational stories, research and tips that show how exercise often can be the best medicine. This funny, moving and motivational book will encourage you to say ‘jog on’ to your problems and get your life back on track – no matter how small those first steps may be.</description>

  <description>Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....</description>

      <![CDATA[A superbly written thriller. <br /><br />Plenty of suspense, twists and turns and strong, fleshy characters. <br /><br />I have to admit I was kept guessing until the end and the final twist was very clever. <br /><br />I really enjoyed this read. ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A tale of a single night. The story of a lifetime.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you had to pick five people to sum up your life, who would they be? If you were to raise a glass to each of them, what would you say? And what would you learn about yourself, when all is said and done?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of Maurice Hannigan, who, over the course of a Saturday night in June, orders five different drinks at the Rainford House Hotel. With each he toasts a person vital to him: his doomed older brother, his troubled sister-in-law, his daughter of fifteen minutes, his son far off in America, and his late, lamented wife. And through these people, the ones who left him behind, he tells the story of his own life, with all its regrets and feuds, loves and triumphs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully written, powerfully felt, &lt;i&gt;When All Is Said&lt;/i&gt; promises to be the next great Irish novel.</description>

  <description>Rice Moore is just beginning to think his troubles are behind him. He’s found a job protecting a remote forest preserve in Virginian Appalachia where his main responsibilities include tracking wildlife and refurbishing cabins. It’s hard work, and totally solitary—perfect to hide away from the Mexican drug cartels he betrayed back in Arizona. But when Rice finds the carcass of a bear killed on the grounds, the quiet solitude he’s so desperately sought is suddenly at risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More bears are killed on the preserve and Rice’s obsession with catching the poachers escalates, leading to hostile altercations with the locals and attention from both the law and Rice’s employers. Partnering with his predecessor, a scientist who hopes to continue her research on the preserve, Rice puts into motion a plan that could expose the poachers but risks revealing his own whereabouts to the dangerous people he was running from in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James McLaughlin expertly brings the beauty and danger of Appalachia to life. The result is an elemental, slow burn of a novel—one that will haunt you long after you turn the final page.</description>

  <description>An Orchestra of Minorities is about the life of a troubled young poultry farmer who sacrifices everything to win the woman he loves. Set between Nigeria and Cyprus, according to Little, Brown it is "a modern epic of Igbo civilisation", dealing with myth, spirituality, life, death, obsession and ownership. It can also be read as a parable about a civilisation lurching towards modernity, sometimes at the cost of abandoning the wisdom of elders.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For centuries, the mysterious dark-robed figure has roamed the globe, searching for those whose complicity and cowardice have fed into the rapids of history’s darkest waters—and now, in Sarah Perry’s breathtaking follow-up to &lt;i&gt;The Essex Serpent&lt;/i&gt;, it is heading in our direction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been years since Helen Franklin left England. In Prague, working as a translator, she has found a home of sorts—or, at least, refuge. That changes when her friend Karel discovers a mysterious letter in the library, a strange confession and a curious warning that speaks of Melmoth the Witness, a dark legend found in obscure fairy tales and antique village lore. As such superstition has it, Melmoth travels through the ages, dooming those she persuades to join her to a damnation of timeless, itinerant solitude. To Helen it all seems the stuff of unenlightened fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, unaware, as she wanders the cobblestone streets Helen is being watched. And then Karel disappears. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;If you go back and look at your life there are certain scenes, acts, or maybe just incidents on which everything that follows seems to depend. If only you could narrate them, then you might be understood. I mean the part of yourself that you don't know how to explain.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the early Seventies a glamorous and androgynous couple known collectively as Evie/Stevie appear out of nowhere on the isolated concrete campus of a new university. To a group of teenagers experimenting with radical ideas they seem blown back from the future, unsettling everything and uncovering covert desires. But the varnished patina of youth and flamboyant self-expression hides deep anxieties and hidden histories. For Adele, with the most to conceal, Evie/Stevie become a lifelong obsession, as she examines what happened on the night of her own twentieth birthday and her friends' complicity in their fate. A set of school exercise books might reveal everything, but they have been missing for nearly forty years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From summers in Cornwall to London in the twenty-first century, long after they have disappeared, Evie/Stevie go on challenging everyone's ideas of what their lives should turn out to be.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book blew me away. At its beating heart is the premise that we all essentially create a persona when we're young, in order to get through life and survive the experience of growing up.

  <description>An exquisitely talented young British author makes her American debut with this rapturously acclaimed historical novel, set in late nineteenth-century England, about an intellectually minded young widow, a pious vicar, and a rumored mythical serpent that explores questions about science and religion, skepticism, and faith, independence and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Cora Seaborne’s brilliant, domineering husband dies, she steps into her new life as a widow with as much relief as sadness: her marriage was not a happy one. Wed at nineteen, this woman of exceptional intelligence and curiosity was ill-suited for the role of society wife. Seeking refuge in fresh air and open space in the wake of the funeral, Cora leaves London for a visit to coastal Essex, accompanied by her inquisitive and obsessive eleven-year old son, Francis, and the boy’s nanny, Martha, her fiercely protective friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While admiring the sites, Cora learns of an intriguing rumor that has arisen further up the estuary, of a fearsome creature said to roam the marshes claiming human lives. After nearly 300 years, the mythical Essex Serpent is said to have returned, taking the life of a young man on New Year’s Eve. A keen amateur naturalist with no patience for religion or superstition, Cora is immediately enthralled, and certain that what the local people think is a magical sea beast may be a previously undiscovered species. Eager to investigate, she is introduced to local vicar William Ransome. Will, too, is suspicious of the rumors. But unlike Cora, this man of faith is convinced the rumors are caused by moral panic, a flight from true belief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These seeming opposites who agree on nothing soon find themselves inexorably drawn together and torn apart—an intense relationship that will change both of their lives in ways entirely unexpected.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;People make a mess.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marc Maron was a parent-scarred, angst-filled, drug-dabbling, love-starved comedian who dreamed of a simple life: a wife, a home, a sitcom to call his own. But instead he woke up one day to find himself fired from his radio job, surrounded by feral cats, and emotionally and financially annihilated by a divorce from a woman he thought he loved. He tried to heal his broken heart through whatever means he could find—minor-league hoarding, Viagra addiction, accidental racial profiling, cat fancying, flying airplanes with his mind—but nothing seemed to work. It was only when he was stripped down to nothing that he found his way back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Attempting Normal&lt;/i&gt; is Marc Maron’s journey through the wilderness of his own mind, a collection of explosively, painfully, addictively funny stories that add up to a moving tale of hope and hopelessness, of failing, flailing, and finding a way. From standup to television to his outrageously popular podcast, &lt;i&gt;WTF with Marc Maron,&lt;/i&gt; Marc has always been a genuine original, a disarmingly honest, intensely smart, brutally open comic who finds wisdom in the strangest places. This is his story of the winding, potholed road from madness and obsession and failure to something like normal, the thrillingly comic journey of a sympathetic f***up who’s trying really hard to do better without making a bigger mess. Most of us will relate.</description>

  <description>We plan, as the old proverb says, and God laughs. But most of us don't find it all that funny when things go wrong. Most of us want love, a nice home, good work, and happy children. Many of us grew up with parents who made these things look relatively easy and assumed we would get them, too. So what do you do if you don't? What do you do when you feel you've messed it all up and your friends seem to be doing just fine? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Christina Patterson, it was her job as a journalist that kept her going through the ups and downs of life. And then she lost that, too. Dreaming of revenge and irritated by self-help books, she decided to do the kind of interviews she had never done before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resulting conversations are surprising, touching and often funny. There's Ken, the first person to be publicly fired from a FTSE-100 board. There's Winston, who fell through a ceiling onto a purple coffin. There's Louise, whose baby was seriously ill, but who still worried about being fat. And through it all, there's Christina, eating far too many crisps as she tries to pick up the pieces of her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'The Art of Not Falling Apart' is a joyous, moving and sometimes shockingly honest celebration of life as an adventure, one where you ditch your expectations, raise a glass and prepare for a rocky ride.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the New York Times bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs&lt;/i&gt;, a startling challenge to our thinking about depression and anxiety.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Award-winning journalist Johann Hari suffered from depression since he was a child and started taking antidepressants when he was a teenager. He was told—like his entire generation—that his problem was caused by a chemical imbalance in his brain. As an adult, trained in the social sciences, he began to investigate this question—and he learned that almost everything we have been told about depression and anxiety is wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across the world, Hari discovered social scientists who were uncovering the real causes—and they are mostly not in our brains, but in the way we live today. Hari’s journey took him from the people living in the tunnels beneath Las Vegas, to an Amish community in Indiana, to an uprising in Berlin—all showing in vivid and dramatic detail these new insights. They lead to solutions radically different from the ones we have been offered up until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as &lt;i&gt;Chasing the Scream&lt;/i&gt; transformed the global debate about addiction, with over twenty million views for his TED talk and the animation based on it, &lt;i&gt;Lost Connections&lt;/i&gt; will lead us to a very different debate about depression and anxiety—one that shows how, together, we can end this epidemic.</description>

  <description>Pulitzer Prize-winning author Carl Sagan traces our exploration of space and suggests that our very survival may depend on the wise use of other worlds. This stirring book reveals how scientific discovery has altered our perception of who we are and where we stand, and challenges us to weigh what we will do with that knowledge. Photos, many in color.</description>

  <description>The bestselling feminist novel that awakened both women and men, &lt;i&gt;The Women's Room&lt;/i&gt; follows the transformation of Mira Ward and her circle as the women's movement begins to have an impact on their lives. A biting social commentary on an emotional world gone silently haywire, &lt;i&gt;The Women's Room&lt;/i&gt; is a modern classic that offers piercing insight into the social norms accepted so blindly and revered so completely. Marilyn French questions those accepted norms and poignantly portrays the hopeful believers looking for new truths.</description>

  <description>A dark midwinter’s night in an ancient inn on the Thames. The regulars are entertaining themselves by telling stories when the door bursts open on an injured stranger. In his arms is the drowned corpse of a little child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hours later the dead girl stirs, takes a breath and returns to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a miracle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it magic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or can it be explained by science?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replete with folklore, suspense and romance, as well as with the urgent scientific curiosity of the Darwinian age, &lt;em&gt;Once Upon a River&lt;/em&gt; is as richly atmospheric as Setterfield’s bestseller &lt;em&gt;The Thirteenth Tale&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>Howard Belsey, a Rembrandt scholar who doesn't like Rembrandt, is an Englishman abroad and a long-suffering professor at Wellington, a liberal New England arts college. He has been married for thirty years to Kiki, an American woman who no longer resembles the sexy activist she once was. Their three children passionately pursue their own paths: Levi quests after authentic blackness, Zora believes that intellectuals can redeem everybody, and Jerome struggles to be a believer in a family of strict atheists. Faced with the oppressive enthusiasms of his children, Howard feels that the first two acts of his life are over and he has no clear plans for the finale. Or the encore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Jerome, Howard's older son, falls for Victoria, the stunning daughter of the right-wing icon Monty Kipps, and the two families find themselves thrown together in a beautiful corner of America, enacting a cultural and personal war against the background of real wars that they barely register. An infidelity, a death, and a legacy set in motion a chain of events that sees all parties forced to examine the unarticulated assumptions which underpin their lives. How do you choose the work on which to spend your life? Why do you love the people you love? Do you really believe what you claim to? And what is the beautiful thing, and how far will you go to get it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set on both sides of the Atlantic, Zadie Smith's third novel is a brilliant analysis of family life, the institution of marriage, intersections of the personal and political, and an honest look at people's deceptions. It is also, as you might expect, very funny indeed.</description>

  <description>Combining the insights of a gifted research scientist with vivid tales that are usually the realm of the novelist, Dr. Ronald Siegel lets his readers experience the suspicion, terror, and rage that possess the mind of the paranoid. This is the first book to investigate the actual experience of paranoia and to demonstrate that under the right conditions - drugs or deprivation, for example - anyone can be driven into that state. And indeed, eight million Americans already have been. The paranoid inhabits a different realm of being, one that tilts the world ever so slightly. The senses detect these differences and sound mental alarms. Delusions and hallucinations feed on each other, flourishing with amazing speed. The paranoid becomes locked in a new mode of thinking - viewing life as from a cell. In a dozen case studies, Dr. Siegel follows his patients into the shadow lands where paranoia flourishes - drug addiction, prison, organized crime, and terrorism. He introduces us to mild cases where there is only a vague sense that something is out there stalking, to those with apocalyptic visions so intense that they shake the foundations of an entire community. We meet the old woman who hears her teeth whispering, the beautiful ballet dancer who falls in love with a shadow, and the cocaine addict for whom the invasion of imaginary bugs was strong enough to kill. This intrepid journey through the mind's dark corridors ends with a reflective coda exploring the suicide of Ernest Hemingway, and there is no better guide than Dr. Ronald Siegel.</description>

Whilst Fire in the Brain comes across as a mildly clinical book with excellent anecdotal references, Whispers just seems a bit overly sensationalist to me. Siegel portrays himself...]]>

  <description>In 2008, Marion Coutts' husband, the art critic Tom Lubbock, was diagnosed with a brain tumour, and told that he had not more than two years to live. The tumour was located in the area of the brain that controls speech and language, and would eventually rob him of the ability to speak. Tom was 53 when he died, leaving Marion and their son Eugene, just two years old, alone. In short bursts of beautiful, textured prose, Coutts describes the eighteen months leading up to Tom's death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Iceberg is an unflinching, honest exploration of staring death in the face, finding solace in strange places, finding beauty and even joy in the experience of dying. Written with extraordinary narrative force and power, it is almost shocking in its rawness. Nothing is kept from the reader: the fury, the occasional spells of selfishness, the indignity of being trapped in a hopeless situation. It is a story of pain and sadness, but also an uplifting and life-affirming tale of great fortitude, courage, determination – and above all, love.</description>

  <description>Why would a talented young woman enter into a torrid affair with hunger, drugs, sex, and death? Through five lengthy hospital stays, endless therapy, and the loss of family, friends, jobs, and all sense of what it means to be "normal," Marya Hornbacher lovingly embraced her anorexia and bulimia -- until a particularly horrifying bout with the disease in college put the romance of wasting away to rest forever. A vivid, honest, and emotionally wrenching memoir, &lt;em&gt;Wasted&lt;/em&gt; is the story of one woman's travels to reality's darker side -- and her decision to find her way back on her own terms.</description>

  <description>"&lt;i&gt;Unbearable Weight&lt;/i&gt; is brilliant. From an immensely knowledgeable feminist perspective, in engaging, jargonless (!) prose, Bordo analyzes a whole range of issues connected to the body—weight and weight loss, exercise, media images, movies, advertising, anorexia and bulimia, and much more—in a way that makes sense of our current social landscape—finally! This is a great book for anyone who wonders why women's magazines are always describing delicious food as 'sinful' and why there is a cake called Death by Chocolate. Loved it!"—Katha Pollitt, Nation columnist and author of &lt;i&gt;Subject to Debate: Sense and Dissents on Women, Politics, and Culture&lt;/i&gt; (2001)</description>

The subject matter, whilst fascinating and of huge interest to me, felt overblown and inflated by Bordo's (only in my opinion) unnecessary use of grandiose and florid language to accentuate her points.

  <description>A groundbreaking work of science fiction, &lt;i&gt;The Left Hand of Darkness&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of a lone human emissary to Winter, an alien world whose inhabitants can choose—and change—their gender. His goal is to facilitate Winter's inclusion in a growing intergalactic civilization. But to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own views and those of the completely dissimilar culture that he encounters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Embracing the aspects of psychology, society, and human emotion on an alien world, &lt;i&gt;The Left Hand of Darkness&lt;/i&gt; stands as a landmark achievement in the annals of intellectual science fiction.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;11,002 Things to Be Miserable About&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;is a list of all the reasons NOT to wake up in the morning. Ironically enough, when you put all of them under one cover, it’s actually very funny. This decidedly absurd inventory of misery is perfect for sardonic and disaffected youth, for people seeking gifts for Traumatic Event Birthdays (like 21, 25, 30, 40, and, well, anything after 40), and for anyone else with an offbeat sense of humor. Enjoy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some of the entries are pretty basic, like imitation crabmeat, student loans, and David Hasselhoff, but other entries actually include educational things, like: Dust mites, which make up one-third of the weight of a six-year-old pillow. See, you can laugh and learn.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Stiff&lt;/em&gt; is an oddly compelling, often hilarious exploration of the strange lives of our bodies postmortem. For two thousand years, cadavers—some willingly, some unwittingly—have been involved in science's boldest strides and weirdest undertakings. In this fascinating account, Mary Roach visits the good deeds of cadavers over the centuries and tells the engrossing story of our bodies when we are no longer with them.</description>

  <description>In late 1950s London, something uncanny besets a group of elderly friends: an insinuating voice on the telephone informs each, "&lt;em&gt;Remember you must die.&lt;/em&gt;" Their geriatric feathers are soon thoroughly ruffled by these seemingly supernatural phone calls, and in the resulting flurry many old secrets are dusted off. Beneath the once decorous surface of their lives, unsavories like blackmail and adultery are now to be glimpsed. As spooky as it is witty, poignant and wickedly hilarious, &lt;em&gt;Memento Mori&lt;/em&gt; may ostensibly concern death, but it is a book which leaves one relishing life all the more.</description>

  <description>Originally published in 1854, Walden; or, Life in the Woods, is a vivid account of the time that Henry D. Thoreau lived alone in a secluded cabin at Walden Pond. It is one of the most influential and compelling books in American literature. This new paperback edition-introduced by noted American writer John Updike-celebrates the 150th anniversary of this classic work. Much of Walden's material is derived from Thoreau's journals and contains such engaging pieces as "Reading" and "The Pond in the Winter" Other famous sections involve Thoreau's visits with a Canadian woodcutter and with an Irish family, a trip to Concord, and a description of his bean field. This is the complete and authoritative text of Walden-as close to Thoreau's original intention as all available evidence allows. For the student and for the general reader, this is the ideal presentation of Thoreau's great document of social criticism and dissent.</description>

  <description>The Slow Food movement was established in Italy as a response to the dominance of fast food chains, supermarkets, and large-scale agribusiness. Defending "the universal right to pleasure," it promotes food production and consumption based on "good, clean, and fair" local products. In twenty years Slow Food has grown into an international organisation with more than 80,000 members in over 100 countries. With roots in the 1960s and 1970s counter-culture, Slow Food's distinctive politics link gastronomic pleasure and environmental responsibility. The movement crosses the left-right divide to embrace both the conservative desire to preserve traditional rural communities and an alternative "virtuous" idea of globalisation. In the first in-depth study of the fascinating politics of Slow Food, Geoff Andrews shows that the alternative future it offers can be extended to all aspects of modern life. The Slow Food Story is an extensive critique of the fast-moving, work-obsessed contemporary capitalist culture.</description>

  <description>While the main focus of this autobiographical memoir is a tender father-son relationship, Peter Reich also provides an uncommon glimpse of enigmatic, controversial &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/118694.Wilhelm_Reich" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wilhelm Reich&lt;/a&gt; at his 200 acre hilltop home in Maine as he strokes the skies with his Cloudbusters and suffers the indignation of seeing his Orgone Energy Accumulators destroyed. Reich’s books -- &lt;i&gt;The Function of the Orgasm, The Sexual Revolution&lt;/i&gt;, and others -- were burned by the U.S. Government in 1956.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having trained in Vienna with Sigmund Freud, Wilhelm Reich, MD (1897-1957), arrived in the U.S. in 1939, where his books and ideas about human sexuality gained a substantial audience. While summering on the pristine lakes of Rangeley, Maine he discovered what he called Cosmic Orgone Energy. Accumulated in small telephone both-size boxes, this Orgone Energy, he reported, was successful in healing wounds and restoring life energy. Yet another device, the Cloudbuster, appeared to control the weather...and flying saucers? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Food and Drug Administration, Reich’s work was an easy target, and soon after his accumulators and books were burned, he was sentenced to two years in prison where he died in 1957, at age 60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a pre-adolescent boy protected by his imaginary cavalry those 1950’s were, in retrospect, a grade B sci-fi movie with a sad ending. The book moves in a series of images, like a movie, between past and present, dream and reality. As the images interweave, after layers of defenses, fears, and uncertainties are stripped away, Peter is finally able to see both himself and his father with clear eyes and an open heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“i enjoyed reich’s dreams very much” [sic] - John Lennon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“My God, your book is beautiful!” - Ken Kesey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This autobiographical sketch of a boy’s early years, the genius loci of a remarkable setting, Orgonon, is a fascinating document. Nature offered a wonderland of sensory stimuli, parents allowed freedom and gave devoted care, and other visiting adults supported his physical playfulness with amused appreciation. But as his father’s ally, he became enmeshed in a star wars fantasy too ‘far out’ to be reconciled with reality. Love, loyalty, and the loss of father and his guiding purposes demanded resolution. … But the much-loved land and tensely experienced sensory memories have endured and are described with such authentic simplicity. If more of us could remember childhood with such clarity of recall, adulthood could be both enriched and clarified.” - Joan and Erik Erikson</description>

  <description>In the updated second edition of &lt;i&gt;Whipping Girl&lt;/i&gt;, Julia Serano, a transsexual woman whose supremely intelligent writing reflects her diverse background as a lesbian transgender activist and professional biologist, shares her powerful experiences and observation-both pre- and post-transition-to reveal the ways in which fear, suspicion and dismissiveness toward femininity shape our societal attitudes toward trans women, as well as gender and sexuality as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;Serano's well-honed arguments stem from her ability to bridge the gap between the often-disparate biological and social perspectives on gender. In this provocative manifesto, she exposes how deep-rooted the cultural belief is that femininity is frivolous, weak, and passive, and how this "feminine" weakness exists only to attract and appease male desire.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to debunking popular misconceptions about transsexuality, Serano makes the case that today's feminists and transgender activists must work to embrace and empower femininity-in all of its wondrous forms.</description>

  <description>A deliciously funny novella that celebrates the pleasure of reading. When the Queen in pursuit of her wandering corgis stumbles upon a mobile library she feels duty bound to borrow a book. Aided by Norman, a young man from the palace kitchen who frequents the library, the Queen is transformed as she discovers the liberating pleasures of the written word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author of the Tony Award winner The History Boys, Alan Bennett is one of Britain’s best-loved literary voices. With The Uncommon Reader, he brings us a playful homage to the written word, imagining a world in which literature becomes a subversive bridge between powerbrokers and commoners. By turns cheeky and charming, the novella features the Queen herself as its protagonist. When her yapping corgis lead her to a mobile library, Her Majesty develops a new obsession with reading. She finds herself devouring works by a tantalizing range of authors, from the Brontë sisters to Jean Genet. With a young member of the palace kitchen staff guiding her choices, it’s not long before the Queen begins to develop a new perspective on the world - one that alarms her closest advisers and tempts her to make bold new decisions. Brimming with the mischievous wit that has garnered acclaim for Bennett on both sides of the Atlantic, The Uncommon Reader is a delightful celebration of books and writers, and the readers who sustain them.</description>

  <description>Yeong-hye and her husband are ordinary people. He is an office worker with moderate ambitions and mild manners; she is an uninspired but dutiful wife. The acceptable flatline of their marriage is interrupted when Yeong-hye, seeking a more 'plant-like' existence, decides to become a vegetarian, prompted by grotesque recurring nightmares. In South Korea, where vegetarianism is almost unheard-of and societal mores are strictly obeyed, Yeong-hye's decision is a shocking act of subversion. Her passive rebellion manifests in ever more bizarre and frightening forms, leading her bland husband to self-justified acts of sexual sadism. His cruelties drive her towards attempted suicide and hospitalisation. She unknowingly captivates her sister's husband, a video artist. She becomes the focus of his increasingly erotic and unhinged artworks, while spiralling further and further into her fantasies of abandoning her fleshly prison and becoming - impossibly, ecstatically - a tree. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fraught, disturbing and beautiful, &lt;i&gt;The Vegetarian&lt;/i&gt; is a novel about modern day South Korea, but also a novel about shame, desire and our faltering attempts to understand others, from one imprisoned body to another.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;'A memoir to stand alongside classics by the likes of Jeanette Winterson and Lorna Sage … a compelling and ultimately joyous account of self-determination’ &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tara Westover grew up preparing for the End of Days, watching for the sun to darken, for the moon to drip as if with blood. She spent her summers bottling peaches and her winters rotating emergency supplies, hoping that when the World of Men failed, her family would continue on, unaffected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She hadn’t been registered for a birth certificate. She had no school records because she’d never set foot in a classroom, and no medical records because her father didn’t believe in doctors or hospitals. According to the state and federal government, she didn’t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she grew older, her father became more radical, and her brother, more violent. At sixteen Tara decided to educate herself. Her struggle for knowledge would take her far from her Idaho mountains, over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she’d travelled too far. If there was still a way home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDUCATED is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty, and of the grief that comes with the severing of the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, from her singular experience Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes, and the will to change it.</description>

  <description>The serene and maternal Mrs. Ramsay, the tragic yet absurd Mr. Ramsay, and their children and assorted guests are on holiday on the Isle of Skye. From the seemingly trivial postponement of a visit to a nearby lighthouse, Woolf constructs a remarkable, moving examination of the complex tensions and allegiances of family life and the conflict between men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As time winds its way through their lives, the Ramsays face, alone and simultaneously, the greatest of human challenges and its greatest triumph—the human capacity for change.</description>

  <description>Mikhail Bulgakov's devastating satire of Soviet life was written during the darkest period of Stalin's regime. Combining two distinct yet interwoven parts—one set in ancient Jerusalem, one in contemporary Moscow—the novel veers from moods of wild theatricality with violent storms, vampire attacks, and a Satanic ball; to such somber scenes as the meeting of Pilate and Yeshua, and the murder of Judas in the moonlit garden of Gethsemane; to the substanceless, circus-like reality of Moscow. Its central characters, Woland (Satan) and his retinue—including the vodka-drinking black cat, Behemoth; the poet, Ivan Homeless; Pontius Pilate; and a writer known only as The Master, and his passionate companion, Margarita—exist in a world that blends fantasy and chilling realism, an artful collage of grotesqueries, dark comedy, and timeless ethical questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though completed in 1940, "The Master and Margarita" wasn't published in Moscow until 1966, when the first part appeared in the magazine "Moskva." It was an immediate and enduring success: audiences responded with great enthusiasm to its expression of artistic and spiritual freedom.</description>

  <description>For millennia, the human heart was the deepest of mysteries, as untouchable as the human soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we have always been curious and frail, and by the twentieth surgeons were exploring the secret recesses of the human body, searching out the heart’s imperfections, holes and tears, and with the advent of World War, bullets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The implications of these life-changing endeavours stretch far beyond the merely surgical and into a dizzying moral maze. What should we make of the grotesque and macabre experiments of the Russian surgeons who created bizarre and unnatural animal hybrids, the advances of vivisection, or the moral dilemma of transplants that led to the redefinition of death across the globe and the coining of the phrase ‘brain dead’?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Matter of the Heart&lt;/i&gt; is a story of human ingenuity, perseverance and ambition, an astonishing compendium of technological invention, alongside some catastrophic failures, bringing us right up to the medical miracles of the present day.</description>

  <description>Sita Dulip has missed her flight. But instead of listening to garbled announcements in the airport, she has found a method of bypassing the crowds at the desks, the long lines at the toilets, the nasty lunch, the whimpering children and punitive parents, the bookless bookstores, and the blue plastic chairs bolted to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This method - changing planes - enables Sita to visit fifteen societies not found on Earth. She will encounter cultures where the babble of children fades over time into the silence of adults; where whole towns exist solely for holiday shopping; where personalities are ruled by rage; where genetic experiments produce less than desirable results. And many other exotic landscapes whose denizens are fundamentally human...</description>

  <description>We have a lifetime's association with our bodies, but for many of us they remain uncharted territory. In &lt;i&gt;Adventures in Human Being&lt;/i&gt;, Gavin Francis leads the reader on a journey through health and illness, offering insights on everything from the ribbed surface of the brain to the secret workings of the heart and the womb; from the pulse of life at the wrist to the unique engineering of the foot. Drawing on his own experiences as a doctor and GP, he blends first-hand case studies with reflections on the way the body has been imagined and portrayed over the millennia. If the body is a foreign country, then to practice medicine is to explore new territory. Francis leads the reader on an adventure through what it means to be human. Both a user's guide to the body and a celebration of its elegance, this book will transform the way you think about being alive, whether in sickness or in health.</description>

  <description>At first, only a few things are known about the celestial object that astronomers dub Rama. It is huge, weighing more than ten trillion tons. And it is hurtling through the solar system at an inconceivable speed. Then a space probe confirms the unthinkable: Rama is no natural object. It is, incredibly, an interstellar spacecraft. Space explorers and planet-bound scientists alike prepare for mankind's first encounter with alien intelligence. It will kindle their wildest dreams... and fan their darkest fears. For no one knows who the Ramans are or why they have come. And now the moment of rendezvous awaits — just behind a Raman airlock door.</description>

      <![CDATA[I can see where the writing of this author went into 2001: A Space Oddity. This book is so clever. Not much happens but the suspense and descriptive element make it a highly regarded piece of literature. I was conjuring up images of glass seas, mini biots, indoor cyclones, smooth grey tombs.

I find his writing sophisticated, innovatory and for his time (writing in the 20's/30's) highly revolutionary! <br /><br />I love his thoughts on socialism, despite the fact that they're so idealistic.

  <description>With the same trademark compassion and erudition he brought to The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, Oliver Sacks explores the place music occupies in the brain and how it affects the human condition. In Musicophilia, he shows us a variety of what he calls “musical misalignments.” Among them: a man struck by lightning who suddenly desires to become a pianist at the age of forty-two; an entire group of children with Williams syndrome, who are hypermusical from birth; people with “amusia,” to whom a symphony sounds like the clattering of pots and pans; and a man whose memory spans only seven seconds-for everything but music. Illuminating, inspiring, and utterly unforgettable, Musicophilia is Oliver Sacks’ latest masterpiece.</description>

  <description>Covering such topics as adultery, lust, pornography and impotence, Alain de Botton argues that 21st century sex will always be a balancing act of trust versus risk, and of primal desire versus studied civility. By examining sex from a subjective perspective, he uncovers new ideas on how we can achieve that balance.</description>

  <description>Anyone who’s ever lost sleep over an unreturned phone call or the neighbor’s Lexus had better read Alain de Botton’s irresistibly clear-headed new book, immediately. For in its pages, a master explicator of our civilization and its discontents turns his attention to the insatiable quest for status, a quest that has less to do with material comfort than with love. To demonstrate his thesis, de Botton ranges through Western history and thought from St. Augustine to Andrew Carnegie and Machiavelli to Anthony Robbins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether it’s assessing the class-consciousness of Christianity or the convulsions of consumer capitalism, dueling or home-furnishing, &lt;b&gt;Status Anxiety&lt;/b&gt; is infallibly entertaining. And when it examines the virtues of informed misanthropy, art appreciation, or walking a lobster on a leash, it is not only wise but helpful.</description>

  <description>Alain de Botton's &lt;i&gt;The Consolations of Philosophy&lt;/i&gt; takes the discipline of logic and the mind back to its roots. Drawing inspiration from six of the finest minds in history - Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Montaigne, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche - he addresses lack of money, the pain of love, inadequacy, anxiety and conformity. De Botton's book led one critic to call philosophy 'the new rock and roll'.</description>

  <description>A beautiful pianist hears her music drowned out by the voice of God. A young woman calmly watches the gang rape of her girlfriend and herself. A shy schoolboy turns to his invisible best friend to wreak bloody vengeance. In Fire in the Brain, Ronald K. Siegel shows how even the sober brain can create the sights and sounds of artificial heavens and hells. Here we find gods and demons, living playmates and dead friends, even UFOs--all astonishingly vivid yet entirely illusory. With the wit and compassion of Oliver Sacks and with psychological detective work worthy of Sherlock Holmes, Siegel reveals the topography of the hallucinatory world through seventeen riveting case histories. Readers will meet a young girl who insists that a dragon named Chopsticks is her frequent companion; a pool shark desperate to discover the trigger for his horrifying LSD flashbacks; and an elderly woman whose doppelganger rescues her from a violent intruder at the eleventh hour. Their stories, and over a dozen more, reveal the commonalities of the hallucinating brain, whether our hallucinations are induced by drugs, dreams, severe trauma, or the delirium of illness. Omni magazine said that the author "probably knows more about how drugs work than anyone else alive." In this masterfully orchestrated blend of scientific fact and bizarre yet compelling anecdotes, Siegel demonstrates that his brilliance goes beyond psychopharmacology into the fascinating natural workings--as well as the dark side--of the human mind.</description>

  <description>Joan has a unique role in Western imagination--she is one of the few true female heroes. Marina Warner uses her superb historical and literary skills to move beyond conventional biography and to capture the essence of Joan of Arc, both as she lived in her own time and as she has "grown" in the human imagination over the five centuries since her death. She has examined the court documents from Joan of Arc's 1431 Inquisition trial for heresy and woven the facts together with an analysis of the histories, biographies, plays, and paintings and sculptures that have appeared over time to honor this heroine and symbol of France's nationhood. Warner shows how the few facts that are known about the woman Joan have been shaped to suit the aims of those who have chosen her as their hero. The book places Joan in the context of the mythology of the female hero and takes note of her historical antecedents, both pagan and Christian and the role she has played up to the present as the embodiment of an ideal, whether as Amazon, saint, child of nature, or personification of virtue.</description>

  <description>When Mae Holland is hired to work for the Circle, the world's most powerful internet company, she feels she's been given the opportunity of a lifetime. The Circle, run out of a sprawling California campus, links users' personal emails, social media, banking, and purchasing with their universal operating system, resulting in one online identity and a new age of civility and transparency. As Mae tours the open-plan office spaces, the towering glass dining facilities, the cozy dorms for those who spend nights at work, she is thrilled with the company's modernity and activity. There are parties that last through the night, there are famous musicians playing on the lawn, there are athletic activities and clubs and brunches, and even an aquarium of rare fish retrieved from the Marianas Trench by the CEO. Mae can't believe her luck, her great fortune to work for the most influential company in the world--even as life beyond the campus grows distant, even as a strange encounter with a colleague leaves her shaken, even as her role at the Circle becomes increasingly public. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What begins as the captivating story of one woman's ambition and idealism soon becomes a heart-racing novel of suspense, raising questions about memory, history, privacy, democracy, and the limits of human knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;(front flap)</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; culture reporter Dave Itzkoff, the definitive biography of Robin Williams – a compelling portrait of one of America’s most beloved and misunderstood entertainers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;From his rapid-fire stand-up comedy riffs to his breakout role in &lt;i&gt;Mork &amp;amp; Mindy&lt;/i&gt; and his Academy Award-winning performance in &lt;i&gt;Good Will Hunting&lt;/i&gt;, Robin Williams was a singularly innovative and beloved entertainer. He often came across as a man possessed, holding forth on culture and politics while mixing in personal revelations – all with mercurial, tongue-twisting intensity as he inhabited and shed one character after another with lightning speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Dave Itzkoff shows in this revelatory biography, Williams’s comic brilliance masked a deep well of conflicting emotions and self-doubt, which he drew upon in his comedy and in celebrated films like &lt;i&gt;Dead Poets Society&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;Good Morning, Vietnam&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;The Fisher King&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;Aladdin&lt;/i&gt;; and &lt;i&gt;Mrs. Doubtfire&lt;/i&gt;, where he showcased his limitless gift for improvisation to bring to life a wide range of characters. And in &lt;i&gt;Good Will Hunting &lt;/i&gt;he gave an intense and controlled performance that revealed the true range of his talent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Itzkoff also shows how Williams struggled mightily with addiction and depression – topics he discussed openly while performing and during interviews – and with a debilitating condition at the end of his life that affected him in ways his fans never knew. Drawing on more than a hundred original interviews with family, friends, and colleagues, as well as extensive archival research, &lt;i&gt;Robin&lt;/i&gt; is a fresh and original look at a man whose work touched so many lives.</description>

  <description>A shocking, hilarious and strangely tender novel about a young woman’s experiment in narcotic hibernation, aided and abetted by one of the worst psychiatrists in the annals of literature. Our narrator has many of the advantages of life, on the surface. Young, thin, pretty, a recent Columbia graduate, she lives in an apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan paid for, like everything else, by her inheritance. But there is a vacuum at the heart of things, and it isn’t just the loss of her parents in college, or the way her Wall Street boyfriend treats her, or her sadomasochistic relationship with her alleged best friend. It’s the year 2000 in a city aglitter with wealth and possibility; what could be so terribly wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story of a year spent under the influence of a truly mad combination of drugs, designed to heal us from our alienation from this world, shows us how reasonable, even necessary, that alienation sometimes is. Blackly funny, both merciless and compassionate – dangling its legs over the ledge of 9/11 – this novel is a showcase for the gifts of one of America’s major young writers working at the height of her powers.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;So here we are. My name was Eileen Dunlop. Now you know me. I was twenty-four years old then, and had a job that paid fifty-seven dollars a week as a kind of secretary at a private juvenile correctional facility for teenage boys. I think of it now as what it really was for all intents and purposes—a prison for boys. I will call it Moorehead. Delvin Moorehead was a terrible landlord I had years later, and so to use his name for such a place feels appropriate. In a week, I would run away from home and never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of how I disappeared.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Christmas season offers little cheer for Eileen Dunlop, an unassuming yet disturbed young woman trapped between her role as her alcoholic father’s caretaker in a home whose squalor is the talk of the neighborhood and a day job as a secretary at the boys’ prison, filled with its own quotidian horrors. Consumed by resentment and self-loathing, Eileen tempers her dreary days with perverse fantasies and dreams of escaping to the big city. In the meantime, she fills her nights and weekends with shoplifting, stalking a buff prison guard named Randy, and cleaning up her increasingly deranged father’s messes. When the bright, beautiful, and cheery Rebecca Saint John arrives on the scene as the new counselor at Moorehead, Eileen is enchanted and proves unable to resist what appears at first to be a miraculously budding friendship. In a Hitchcockian twist, her affection for Rebecca ultimately pulls her into complicity in a crime that surpasses her wildest imaginings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Played out against the snowy landscape of coastal New England in the days leading up to Christmas, young Eileen’s story is told from the gimlet-eyed perspective of the now much older narrator. Creepy, mesmerizing, and sublimely funny, in the tradition of Shirley Jackson and early Vladimir Nabokov, this powerful debut novel enthralls and shocks, and introduces one of the most original new voices in contemporary literature.</description>

  <description>At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Quiet&lt;/i&gt;, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, &lt;i&gt;Quiet&lt;/i&gt; has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.</description>

  <description>Magic takes many forms. Supernatural magic is what our ancestors used in order to explain the world before they developed the scientific method. The ancient Egyptians explained the night by suggesting the goddess Nut swallowed the sun. The Vikings believed a rainbow was the gods’ bridge to earth. The Japanese used to explain earthquakes by conjuring a gigantic catfish that carried the world on its back—earthquakes occurred each time it flipped its tail. These are magical, extraordinary tales. But there is another kind of magic, and it lies in the exhilaration of discovering the real answers to these questions. It is the magic of reality—science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packed with clever thought experiments, dazzling illustrations and jaw-dropping facts, The Magic of Reality explains a stunningly wide range of natural phenomena. What is stuff made of? How old is the universe? Why do the continents look like disconnected pieces of a puzzle? What causes tsunamis? Why are there so many kinds of plants and animals? Who was the first man, or woman? This is a page-turning, graphic detective story that not only mines all the sciences for its clues but primes the reader to think like a scientist as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Dawkins, the world’s most famous evolutionary biologist and one of science education’s most passionate advocates, has spent his career elucidating the wonders of science for adult readers. But now, in a dramatic departure, he has teamed up with acclaimed artist Dave McKean and used his unrivaled explanatory powers to share the magic of science with readers of all ages. This is a treasure trove for anyone who has ever wondered how the world works. Dawkins and McKean have created an illustrated guide to the secrets of our world—and the universe beyond—that will entertain and inform for years to come.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;An intensely personal expose of what happens when family and politics collide during the collapse of the Hungarian Communist regime--for fans of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lives of Others&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blending fact and fiction, &lt;i&gt;No Live Files Remain&lt;/i&gt; is the story of how, almost thirty years after the fall of communism in Hungary, Andras Forgach found out that his mother, whom he loved deeply, had been an informant for the Kadar regime and had informed not only on acquaintances, but also on family, friends, and even her children. In a work of heartbreaking intensity and nuance, Forgach must confront the truth about the woman who was simultaneously an informant as well as a tender and loveable mother, a victim and a perpetrator, someone to be both pitied and scorned. It pulls back the shroud of secrecy on her complex relationship with her husband, her continuous homesickness and desire to return to her homeland, Palestine, and her devotion to communism and the anti-Zionist feelings that it provoked in her. Forgach dares to give a voice to his deceased mother, hold her responsible for her deeds--and, as her son, defend cherished memories of her as his mother.&lt;br /&gt;A work of secrets and lies, &lt;i&gt;No Live Files Remain&lt;/i&gt; sheds light on socialist Hungary in the seventies and eighties; it is simultaneously a vivid description of a claustrophobic era, an evisceration of bureaucratic stupidity, and a heartbreakingly sharp-yet-loving portrait of the author's relationship with his parents.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Over 80 per cent of our waking time is spent on autopilot.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know the feeling of driving a long distance and arriving at our destination with little memory of the journey. That's because when we are doing routine activities our subconscious takes over to save energy: we are on autopilot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn't just happen when we drive. It happens every day when we are at work, with our loved ones, or simply living our lives. Wake Up! is a series of experiments designed to help you break free from this trap. From climbing a tree to writing a letter, here are a year's worth of balanced, playful experiences that will engage your imagination and stimulate your senses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By escaping autopilot more often you'll feel tuned in, tap in to who you really are, and make every day count.</description>

  <description>The greatest literary sensation of recent times - and now the inspiration for a major BBC series, starring Mark Rylance and Damian Lewis and directed by Peter Kosminsky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winner of the Man Booker Prize 2009. England, the 1520s. Henry VIII has been king for almost twenty years, but has no heir. Cardinal Wolsey is unable to deliver the divorce he craves. For a man with the right talents this crisis could be an opportunity... In WOLF HALL, one of our very best writers brings the opulent, brutal world of the Tudors to bloody, glittering life. It is the backdrop to the rise and rise of Thomas Cromwell: lowborn boy, charmer, bully, master of deadly intrigue, and, finally, most powerful of Henry VIII's courtiers.</description>

  <description>Kate Fox, the social anthropologist who put the quirks and hidden conditions of the English under a microscope, is back with more biting insights about the nature of Englishness. This updated and revised edition of &lt;i&gt;Watching the English&lt;/i&gt; features a new foreword and fresh chapters on the unwritten rules and foibles of "squaddies," bikers, horse-riders, and more. Fox revisits a strange and fascinating culture, governed by complex sets of unspoken rules and bizarre codes of behavior. She demystifies the peculiar cultural rules that baffle us: the rules of weather-speak, the ironic-gnome rule, the reflex apology rule, the paranoid-pantomime rule, class anxiety tests, the money-talk taboo, and many more. An international bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Watching the English&lt;/i&gt; is both an incisive and hilarious look at the English and their society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kate Fox&lt;/b&gt; is co-director of the Social Issues Research Centre in Oxford. Her work involves monitoring and assessing global sociocultural trends, and has included research, publications, and broadcasts on many aspects of human behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Waris Dirie, whose name means desert flower, was born in Somalia of nomadic parents. She underwent extreme female circumcision at the age of five, and when she was 13 her father sold her into marriage with a 60-year-old for five camels, at which time she ran away. She was discovered by a fashion photographer in the United States whilst working as a janitor at McDonald's, and became a model who has been used to promote Revlon skin-care products. She also speaks on women's rights in Africa and travels the world to give lectures on behalf of the UN. This is her autobiography.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt; From his childhood fascination with the gigantic Natural History Museum model of a blue whale to his adult encounters with the living animals in the Atlantic Ocean, the acclaimed writer Philip Hoare has been obsessed with whales. Journeying through human and natural history, &lt;i&gt;The Whale&lt;/i&gt; is the result of his voyage of discovery into the heart of this obsession and the book that inspired it: Herman Melville's &lt;i&gt;Moby-Dick&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Taking us deep into their domain, Hoare shows us these mysterious creatures as they have never been seen before. Following in Ishmael's footsteps, he explores the troubled history of man and whale; visits the historic whaling locales of New Bedford, Nantucket, and the Azores; and traces the whale's cultural history from Jonah to &lt;i&gt;Free Willy&lt;/i&gt;. Winner of the prestigious BBC Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction, &lt;i&gt;The Whale&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable and often moving attempt to explain why these strange and beautiful animals still exert such a powerful hold on our imagination. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Translated and with a preface by Mark Harman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left unfinished by Kafka in 1922 and not published until 1926, two years after his death, &lt;i&gt;The Castle &lt;/i&gt;is the haunting tale of K.’s relentless, unavailing struggle with an inscrutable authority in order to gain access to the Castle. Scrupulously following the fluidity and breathlessness of the sparsely punctuated original manuscript, Mark Harman’s new translation reveals levels of comedy, energy, and visual power, previously unknown to English language readers.</description>

  <description>A deeply panoramic tour of the night, from its brightest spots to the darkest skies we have left. &lt;br /&gt; A starry night is one of nature's most magical wonders. Yet in our artificially lit world, three-quarters of Americans' eyes never switch to night vision and most of us no longer experience true darkness. In THE END OF NIGHT, Paul Bogard restores our awareness of the spectacularly primal, wildly dark night sky and how it has influenced the human experience across everything from science to art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Las Vegas' Luxor Beam--the brightest single spot on this planet--to nights so starlit the sky looks like snow, Bogard blends personal narrative, natural history, science, and history to shed light on the importance of darkness--what we've lost, what we still have, and what we might regain--and the simple ways we can reduce the brightness of our nights tonight.</description>

  <description>Although most of the action of &lt;b&gt;The Mezzanine&lt;/b&gt; occurs on the escalator of an office building, where its narrator is returning to work after buying shoelaces, this startlingly inventive and witty novel takes us farther than most fiction written today. It lends to milk cartons the associative richness of Marcel Proust's &lt;u&gt;madeleines&lt;/u&gt;. It names the eight most significant advances in a human life -- beginning with shoe-tying. It asks whether the hot air blowers in bathrooms really &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; more sanitary than towels. And it casts a dazzling light on our relations with the objects and people we usually take for granted.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A gorgeously unique, fully illustrated exploration into the phenomenology of reading-how we visualize images from reading works of literature, from one of our very best book jacket designers, himself a passionate reader. A VINTAGE ORIGINAL.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do we see when we read? Did Tolstoy really describe Anna Karenina? Did Melville ever really tell us what, exactly, Ishmael looked like? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The collection of fragmented images on a page - a graceful ear there, a stray curl, a hat positioned just so - and other clues and signifiers helps us to create an image of a character. But in fact our sense that we know a character intimately has little to do with our ability to concretely picture our beloved - or reviled - literary figures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this remarkable work of nonfiction, Knopf's Associate Art Director Peter Mendelsund combines his profession, as an award-winning designer; his first career, as a classically trained pianist; and his first love, literature - he thinks of himself first, and foremost, as a reader - into what is sure to be one of the most provocative and unusual investigations into how we understand the act of reading.</description>

  <description>An ancient title of respect for women, the word cunt long ago veered off this noble path. Inga Muscio traces the road from honor to expletive, giving women the motivation and tools to claim cunt as a positive and powerful force in their lives. In this fully revised edition, she explores, with candidness and humor, such traditional feminist issues as birth control, sexuality, jealousy between women, and prostitution with a fresh attitude for a new generation of women. Sending out a call for every woman to be the Cunt lovin Ruler of Her Sexual Universe, Muscio stands convention on its head by embracing all things cunt-related. This edition is fully revised with updated resources, a new foreword from sexual pioneer Betty Dodson, and a new afterword by the author.</description>

  <description>It's the beginning of the summer in a small town in Ireland. Emma O'Donovan is eighteen years old, beautiful, happy, confident. One night, there's a party. Everyone is there. All eyes are on Emma. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, she wakes on the front porch of her house. She can't remember what happened, she doesn't know how she got there. She doesn't know why she's in pain. But everyone else does. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photographs taken at the party show, in explicit detail, what happened to Emma that night. But sometimes people don't want to believe what is right in front of them, especially when the truth concerns the town's heroes...</description>

  <description>The four Dollanganger children had such perfect lives -- a beautiful mother, a doting father, a lovely home. Then Daddy was killed in a car accident, and Momma could no longer support the family. So she began writing letters to her parents, her millionaire parents, whom the children had never heard of before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Momma tells the children all about their rich grandparents, and how Chris and Cathy and the twins will live like princes and princesses in their grandparents' fancy mansion. The children are only too delighted by the prospect. But there are a few things that Momma hasn't told them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She hasn't told them that their grandmother considers them "devil's spawn" who should never have been born. She hasn't told them that she has to hide them from their grandfather if she wants to inherit his fortune. She hasn't told them that they are to be locked away in an abandoned wing of the house with only the dark, airless attic to play in. But, Momma promises, it's only for a few days....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the days stretch into months, and the months into years. Desperately isolated, terrified of their grandmother, and increasingly convinced that their mother no longer cares about them, Chris and Cathy become all things to the twins and to each other. They cling to their love as their only hope, their only strength -- a love that is almost stronger than death.</description>

  <description>William Stoner is born at the end of the nineteenth century into a dirt-poor Missouri farming family. Sent to the state university to study agronomy, he instead falls in love with English literature and embraces a scholar’s life, so different from the hardscrabble existence he has known. And yet as the years pass, Stoner encounters a succession of disappointments: marriage into a “proper” family estranges him from his parents; his career is stymied; his wife and daughter turn coldly away from him; a transforming experience of new love ends under threat of scandal. Driven ever deeper within himself, Stoner rediscovers the stoic silence of his forebears and confronts an essential solitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Williams’s luminous and deeply moving novel is a work of quiet perfection. William Stoner emerges from it not only as an archetypal American, but as an unlikely existential hero, standing, like a figure in a painting by Edward Hopper, in stark relief against an unforgiving world.</description>
