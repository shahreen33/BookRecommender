  <description>&lt;b&gt;Faber Stories, a landmark series of individual volumes, presents masters of the short story form at work in a range of genres and styles. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The evening is fine. In the sky a few early stars are shining of their own accord. She watches the dog licking the bowl clean. This dog will break her daughter's heart, she's sure of it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claire Keegan's mesmeric story takes us into the heart of the Wicklow countryside, and of the farming family of Victor Deegan, with his 'three teenagers, the milking and the mortgage'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Deegan finds a gun dog and gives it as a present to his only daughter, his wife is filled with foreboding at this seeming act of kindness. As the seasons pass, long-buried family secrets threaten to emerge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bringing together past, present and future in our ninetieth year, Faber Stories is a celebratory compendium of collectable work.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The original Japanese edition of &lt;i&gt;The Art of Discarding&lt;/i&gt;, titled &lt;i&gt;Suteru! Gijutsu&lt;/i&gt;, was published in 2000 and became an overnight sensation - selling a million copies in six months and inspiring a young Marie Kondo. The book has since become a multimillion-copy international bestseller, but it has never been translated into English, until now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this guide to living a calmer, more ordered life, renowned author Nagisa Tatsumi teaches us how letting go of unwanted things will transform our day-to-day happiness. The book offers practical advice and techniques to help readers learn to let go of stuff that is holding them back, as well as tips for acquiring less in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's time to live with less.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The award-winning, bestselling French novel by Philippe Besson about an affair between two teenage boys in 1984 France, translated with subtle beauty and haunting lyricism by the iconic and internationally acclaimed actress/writer Molly Ringwald. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;We drive at high speed along back roads, through woods, vineyards, and oat fields. The bike smells like gasoline and makes a lot of noise, and sometimes I’m frightened when the wheels slip on the gravel on the dirt road, but the only thing that matters is that I’m holding on to him, that I’m holding on to him &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;outside&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just outside a hotel in Bordeaux, Philippe chances upon a young man who bears a striking resemblance to his first love. What follows is a look back at the relationship he’s never forgotten, a hidden affair with a gorgeous boy named Thomas during their last year of high school. Without ever acknowledging they know each other in the halls, they steal time to meet in secret, carrying on a passionate, world-altering affair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dazzlingly rendered in English by Ringwald in her first-ever translation, Besson’s powerfully moving coming-of-age story captures the eroticism and tenderness of first love—and the heartbreaking passage of time.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The history-making, ground-breaking speeches of Greta Thunberg, the young activist who has become the voice of a generation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Everything needs to change. And it has to start today'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In August 2018 a fifteen-year-old Swedish girl, Greta Thunberg, decided not to go to school one day. Her actions ended up sparking a global movement for action against the climate crisis, inspiring millions of pupils to go on strike for our planet, forcing governments to listen, and earning her a Nobel Peace Prize nomination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book brings you Greta in her own words, for the first time. Collecting her speeches that have made history across Europe, from the UN to mass street protests, No One Is Too Small to Make A Difference is a rallying cry for why we must all wake up and fight to protect the living planet, no matter how powerless we feel. Our future depends upon it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Faber Stories, a landmark series of individual volumes, presents masters of the short story form at work in a range of genres and styles. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unnamed protagonist is on holiday with her new, much-married lover, in the company of the monstrously rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'How long would she last? It would be uppermost in all their minds.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each day, while the others are out at sea, she is taught to swim. Eventually, she will be expected to perform. The pressure mounts; it is only a matter of time before she snaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edna O'Brien crafts a quietly horrifying scene of eroticism and insecurity, and makes one woman's near-fatal discomfort stand for society's larger trap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bringing together past, present and future in our ninetieth year, Faber Stories is a celebratory compendium of collectable work.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He met Liston's gaze but found it almost impossible to sustain eye contact. Soon it became an exercise in the control of fear. Sonny Liston gave Kid Dynamite the slightest hint of a smile and winked.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the build-up to a fight, Kid Dynamite's head swirls - with thoughts of his estranged father, his difficult relationship with his stepfather, the time he met his hero, and the sense that his own life is reaching a moment of change. A masterclass in tone, atmosphere and control, 'Sonny Liston Was a Friend of Mine' pays testimony to Thom Jones's unique talent for the short-story form.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;No one’s ever told Eleanor that life should be better than fine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Eleanor Oliphant: she struggles with appropriate social skills and tends to say exactly what she’s thinking. Nothing is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding unnecessary human contact, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and deeply unhygienic IT guy from her office. When she and Raymond together save Sammy, an elderly gentleman who has fallen, the three rescue one another from the lives of isolation that they had been living. Ultimately, it is Raymond’s big heart that will help Eleanor find the way to repair her own profoundly damaged one. If she does, she'll learn that she, too, is capable of finding friendship—and even love—after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart, warm, uplifting, &lt;i&gt;Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine&lt;/i&gt; is the story of an out-of-the-ordinary heroine whose deadpan weirdness and unconscious wit make for an irresistible journey as she realizes. . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;the only way to survive is to open your heart.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Kafka meets &lt;i&gt;The Thick Of It&lt;/i&gt; in a bitingly funny new political satire from Ian McEwan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;That morning, Jim Sams, clever but by no means profound, woke from uneasy dreams to find himself transformed into a gigantic creature.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Sams has undergone a metamorphosis. In his previous life he was ignored or loathed, but in his new incarnation he is the most powerful man in Britain – and it is his mission to carry out the will of the people. Nothing must get in his way: not the opposition, nor the dissenters within his own party. Not even the rules of parliamentary democracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With trademark intelligence, insight and scabrous humour, Ian McEwan pays tribute to Franz Kafka’s most famous work to engage with a world turned on its head.</description>

  <description>In 1994 fledgling journalist Louis Theroux was given a one-off gig on Michael Moore's TV Nation, presenting a segment on apocalyptic religious sects. Gawky, socially awkward and totally unqualified, his first reaction to this exciting opportunity was panic. But he'd always been drawn to off-beat characters, so maybe his enthusiasm would carry the day. Or, you know, maybe it wouldn't...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Gotta Get Theroux This, Louis takes the reader on a joyous journey through his life and unexpectedly successful career. Nervously accepting the BBC's offer of his own series, he went on to create an award-winning documentary style that has seen him immersed in worlds as diverse as racist US militias and secretive pro-wrestlers, the violent gangs of Johannesburg and extreme drinkers in London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arguably his biggest challenge was corralling celebrities in his When Louis Met series, with Jimmy Savile proving most elusive. Blindsided when the revelations about Savile came to light, Louis was to reflect again on the nature of evil he had spent decades uncovering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with wry observation, larger-than-life characters, and self-deprecating humour, this is Louis at his insightful and honest best.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Well, thought Belacqua, it's a quick death, God help us all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is not.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Dante and the Lobster' is the first of the linked short stories in Samuel Beckett's first book, &lt;i&gt;More Pricks Than Kicks&lt;/i&gt;. Published in 1934, its style was recognisably indebted to that of his mentor, James Joyce, and crammed with linguistic texture and allusion that Beckett later shed. The book baffled many critics and sold so few copies that several batches were pulped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decades later, this story was hailed as the Nobel Prize-winner's earliest important work.</description>

  <description>"There has been one constant throughout my four decade career: Story. The crafting of it, the guarding of it--and the illumination of it through the technology of the epoch I was in. Whether transforming newspapers from broadsheets to tabloids, from tabloids to Berliners, from black and white to color, from print to online--my role has been as steward of the story, always insuring the it was told. Today we live in a mobile culture; thus, the new art of storytelling requires that, yet again, we who tell stories must adapt to a new medium in order to continue engaging our reader. With the phone as a constant companion, the story has never been closer to us, making the guarding of its purity paramount to protecting the authenticity of its essence. How to illuminate the story in the mobile age is what this book is all about."--Mario Garcia</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Faber Stories, a landmark series of individual volumes, presents masters of the short story form at work in a range of genres and styles. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;As he stood up, he suddenly felt aroused by Mrs Shaw's large breasts, boy's haircut, and little-girl sneakers. Even her nostrils suggested a frank sexuality. Gopal wanted to put his hands on her waist and pull her toward him. And then he realized that he had.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gopal Maurya's wife has left him, preferring to seek enlightenment in an ashram in India. But when his neighbour comes to borrow his lawnmower, Gopal thinks he might find something similar right here in New Jersey. Armed with &lt;i&gt;Cosmopolitan&lt;/i&gt; magazine as his bible, he embarks on a quest for suburban romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bringing together past, present and future in our ninetieth year, Faber Stories is a celebratory compendium of collectable work.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Courage to Be Disliked&lt;/i&gt;, already an enormous bestseller in Asia with more than 3.5 million copies sold, demonstrates how to unlock the power within yourself to be the person you truly want to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is happiness something you choose for yourself? &lt;i&gt;The Courage to Be Disliked&lt;/i&gt; presents a simple and straightforward answer. Using the theories of Alfred Adler, one of the three giants of nineteenth-century psychology alongside Freud and Jung, this book follows an illuminating dialogue between a philosopher and a young man. Over the course of five conversations, the philosopher helps his student to understand how each of us is able to determine the direction of our own life, free from the shackles of past traumas and the expectations of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich in wisdom, &lt;i&gt;The Courage to Be Disliked&lt;/i&gt; will guide you through the concepts of self-forgiveness, self-care, and mind decluttering. It is a deeply liberating way of thinking, allowing you to develop the courage to change and ignore the limitations that you might be placing on yourself. This plainspoken and profoundly moving book unlocks the power within you to find lasting happiness and be the person you truly want to be. Millions have already benefited from its teachings, now you can too.</description>

  <description>The American pianist Jonathan Biss is known to audiences throughout the world for his artistry, musical intelligence and deeply felt interpretations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is less known until now is that Jonathan Biss writes about music in a most compelling and engaging way. For anyone who has ever enjoyed a Beethoven concert or a Beethoven recording or one of the many films about Beethoven, this Kindle Single is an inspiring reading experience. For those of you who have heard Beethoven in concert or listened to a Beethoven recording, Jonathan Biss takes you behind the scenes of those performances. If your musical interests are much broader than Beethoven or if your interests focus on the creative process , this Single will fully engage you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“On April 24th, 2007, Beethoven’s Sonata Opus 109 made me lose my mind.”</description>

Sent to live in England, he grows up to become a renowned detective and, 20 years later, returns to Shanghai, where the Sino-Japanese War is raging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The maze of human memory--the ways in which we accommodate and alter it, deceive and deliver ourselves with it--is territory that Kazuo Ishiguro has made his own. In his previous novels, he has explored this inner world and its manifestations in the lives of his characters with rare inventiveness and subtlety, shrewd humor and insight. In When We Were Orphans, his first novel in five years, he returns to this terrain in a brilliantly realized story that illuminates the power of one's past to determine the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christopher Banks, an English boy born in early-twentieth-century Shanghai, is orphaned at age nine when his mother and father both vanish under suspicious circumstances. Sent to live in England, he grows up to become a renowned detective and, more than twenty years later, returns to Shanghai, where the Sino-Japanese War is raging, to solve the mystery of the disappearances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is straightforward. Its telling is remarkable. Christopher's voice is controlled, detailed, and detached, its precision unsurprising in someone who has devoted his life to the examination of details and the rigors of objective thought. But within the layers of his narrative is slowly revealed what he can't, or won't, see: that his memory, despite what he wants to believe, is not unaffected by his childhood tragedies; that his powers of perception, the heralded clarity of his vision, can be blinding as well as enlightening; and that the simplest desires--a child's for his parents, a man's for understanding--may give rise to the most complicated truths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A masterful combination of narrative control and soaring imagination, When We Were Orphans is Kazuo Ishiguro at his best.</description>

  <description>In the face of the misery in his homeland, the artist Masuji Ono was unwilling to devote his art solely to the celebration of physical beauty. Instead, he put his work in the service of the imperialist movement that led Japan into World War II. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as the mature Ono struggles through the aftermath of that war, his memories of his youth and of the “floating world”—the nocturnal world of pleasure, entertainment, and drink—offer him both escape and redemption, even as they punish him for betraying his early promise. Indicted by society for its defeat and reviled for his past aesthetics, he relives the passage through his personal history that makes him both a hero and a coward but, above all, a human being.</description>

  <description>Being wrong is an inescapable part of being alive. And yet we go through life tacitly assuming (or loudly insisting) that we are right about nearly everything – from our political beliefs to our private memories, from our grasp of scientific fact to the merits of our favourite team. Being Wrong looks at why this conviction has such a powerful grip on us, what happens when this conviction is shaken, and how we interpret the moral, political and psychological significance of being wrong. Drawing on philosophies old and new and cutting-edge neuroscience, Schulz offers an exploration of the allure of certainty and the necessity of fallibility in four main areas: in religion (when the end of the world fails to be nigh); in politics (where were those WMD?); in memory (where are my keys?); and in love (when Mr or Ms Right becomes Mr or Ms Wrong).</description>

  <description>How do you get rid of unwanted guests? What do you do if there's a racket in the quiet carriage? How should you eat peas, and behave in queues? How to behave, like how to punctuate, is an aspect of life that many are no longer taught - and getting it wrong is the stuff of comedy at best and humiliation at worst. Thankfully, Sandi Toksvig has come to the rescue with her entertaining guide to modern manners, with tips on what to do whether you're talking to a bore, or forgot their name in the first place. (Just call them 'darling'.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The award-winning Radio 4 broadcaster and writer offers guidance on the social pitfalls of every phase of life, from christenings to condolence letters. With characteristic wit and perceptiveness, and revealing the trickiest of her encounters along the way, she highlights decency rather than convention and provides an essential guide to twenty-first century behaviour.</description>

  <description>With more than a million victims every year--more than any other disease, including malaria--and antibiotic resistance now found in every country worldwide, tuberculosis is once again proving itself to be one of the smartest killers that humanity has ever faced. But it’s hardly surprising considering how long it’s had to hone its skills. Forty-thousand years ago, our ancestors set off from the cradle of civilization on their journey towards populating the planet. Tuberculosis hitched a lift and came with us, and it’s been there ever since; waiting, watching, and learning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organism responsible, &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, has had plenty of time to adapt to its chosen habitat--human lungs--and has learned through natural selection to be an almost perfect pathogen. Using our own immune cells as a Trojan Horse to aid its spread, it’s come up with clever ways to avoid being killed by antibiotics. But patience has been its biggest lesson--it can enter into a latent state when times are tough, only to come back to life when a host’s immune system is compromised. Today, more than one million people die of the disease every year and around one-third of the world’s population are believed to be infected. That’s more than two billion people. Throw in the compounding problems of drug resistance, the HIV epidemic, and poverty, and it’s clear that tuberculosis remains one of the most serious problems in world medicine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Catching Breath&lt;/i&gt; follows the history of TB through the ages, from its time as an infection of hunter-gatherers to the first human villages, which set it up with everything it needed to become the monstrous disease it is today, through to the perils of industrialization and urbanization. It goes on to look at the latest research in fighting the disease, with stories of modern scientific research, interviews with doctors on the TB frontline, and the personal experiences of those affected by the disease.</description>

  <description>For writer Jade Yeo, the Roaring Twenties are coming in with more of a purr — until she pillories London's best-known author in a scathing review. Sebastian Hardie is tall, dark and handsome, and more intrigued than annoyed. But if Jade succumbs to temptation, she risks losing her hard-won freedom — and her best chance for love.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tulip Fever, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;a deliciously funny, poignant and wry novel, full of surprising twists and turns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James is getting on a bit and needs full-time help. So Phoebe and Robert, his middle-aged offspring, employ Mandy, who seems willing to take him off their hands. But as James regales his family with tales of Mandy's virtues, their shopping trips, and the shared pleasure of their journeys to garden centres, Phoebe and Robert sense something is amiss. Is this really their father, the distant figure who never once turned up for a sports day, now happily chortling over cuckoo clocks and television soaps? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then something happens that throws everything into new relief, and Phoebe and Robert discover that life most definitely does not stop for the elderly. It just moves onto a very different plane - changing all the stories they thought they knew so well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A newer edition of this book can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48675438-why-we-get-the-wrong-politicians" rel="nofollow"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Politicians are consistently voted the least trusted professional group by the UK public. They've recently become embroiled in scandals concerning sexual harassment and expenses. Every year, they introduce new legislation that doesn't do what it sets out to achieve - often with terrible financial and human costs. But, with some notable exceptions, they are decent, hard-working people, doing a hugely difficult and demanding job. &lt;p&gt;In this searching examination of our political class, award-winning journalist Isabel Hardman tries to square this circle. She lifts the lid on the strange world of Westminster and asks why we end up with representatives with whom we are so unhappy. Filled with forensic analysis and revealing reportage, this landmark and accessible book is a must read for anyone who wants to see a future with better government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <![CDATA[This is one of those books where, thanks to the author's many newspaper columns on the same subject, I knew what I was getting into before reading it. O'Toole presents some interesting and well argued perspectives on the drivers behind Brexit. There's plenty of wit alongside the analysis.<br /><b...]]>

  <description>For women in tech, Silicon Valley is not a fantasyland where millions of dollars grow on trees. It's a "Brotopia," where men hold all the cards and make all the rules. Vastly outnumbered, women face toxic workplaces rife with discrimination and sexual harassment, where investors take meetings in hot tubs and network at sex parties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this powerful exposé, Bloomberg TV journalist Emily Chang reveals how Silicon Valley got so sexist despite its utopian ideals, why bro culture endures despite decades of companies claiming the moral high ground (Don't Be Evil! Connect the World!)--and how women are finally starting to speak out and fight back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on her deep network of Silicon Valley insiders, Chang opens the boardroom doors of male-dominated venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, the subject of Ellen Pao's high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit, and Sequoia, where a partner once famously said they "won't lower their standards" just to hire women. Interviews with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, and former Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer--who got their start at Google, where just one in five engineers is a woman--reveal just how hard it is to crack the Silicon Ceiling. And Chang shows how women such as former Uber engineer Susan Fowler, entrepreneur Niniane Wang, and game developer Brianna Wu, have risked their careers and sometimes their lives to pave a way for other women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silicon Valley's aggressive, misogynistic, work-at-all costs culture has shut women out of the greatest wealth creation in the history of the world. It's time to break up the boys' club. Emily Chang shows us how to fix this toxic culture--to bring down Brotopia, once and for all.</description>

  <description>The government has cleaned up Harare for the Queen of England's visit. 'The townships are too full of people, they said, gather them up and put them in the places the Queen will not see.' Four waves of people have settled on Easterly Farm since then, living on the margins in homes that will soon be destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among them is Martha Mupengo. She has lost her wits, and gained a pregnancy. Who could be the baby's father, and what fate awaits mothers and children in this temporary, poverty-stricken town?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Faber Stories, a landmark series of individual volumes, presents masters of the short story form at work in a range of genres and styles. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walking ahead of him on the heath, his wife turns to look at him over her shoulder, 'Topaz eyes glinting. Scorched face. Vixen.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In language harvested from nature, Sarah Hall tells a story of metamorphosis, of wildness and fecundity, and of a man reaching for reason, who cannot let go of the creature he loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bringing together past, present and future in our ninetieth year, Faber Stories is a celebratory compendium of collectable work.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>One life-changing summer&lt;br /&gt;Charlie meets Fran...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1997, Charlie Lewis is the kind of boy you don't remember in the school photograph. His exams have not gone well. At home he is looking after his father, when surely it should be the other way round, and if he thinks about the future at all, it is with a kind of dread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Fran Fisher bursts into his life and despite himself, Charlie begins to hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if Charlie wants to be with Fran, he must take on a challenge that could lose him the respect of his friends and require him to become a different person. He must join the Company. And if the Company sounds like a cult, the truth is even more appalling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of hope, it seems, is Shakespeare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poignant, funny, enchanting, devastating, Sweet Sorrow is a tragicomedy about the rocky path to adulthood and the confusion of family life, a celebration of the reviving power of friendship and that brief, searing explosion of first love that can only be looked at directly after it has burned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Such a beautiful book. Captures perfectly a moment in time we've all experienced.' Graham Norton&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'He's such a genius. His novels are relatable and recognizable, but also surprising, breath-taking and life-enhancing' Nina Stibbe</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Faber Stories, a landmark series of individual volumes, presents masters of the short story form at work in a range of genres and styles. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'I have quite changed my mind. I am going to run away and become a boy.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In these three stories, written by Djuna Barnes under the pseudonym Lydia Steptoe, three characters find themselves on the brink of a sexual awakening - accompanied by guns, whips, and worldly innuendo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fourteen-year-old girl plans to become 'a virago', until her mother intercepts her first tryst by dressing up as her male lover. A boy of the same age is lured into the forest by his father's mistress. A woman of forty falls in love and longs to kill herself, so unbearable is the return of the youth she thought she wanted. 'Alice', she tells herself, 'be a man.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barnes makes gender and desire seem slippery and joyful - and makes the fictional Lydia Steptoe seem like a writer for our time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bringing together past, present and future in our ninetieth year, Faber Stories is a celebratory compendium of collectable work.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;My love for him felt so total and so annihilating that it was often impossible for me to see him clearly at all.&lt;/i&gt; Years ago, Sukie moved in with Nathan because her mother was dead and her father was difficult, and she had nowhere else to go. Now they are on the brink of the inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Rooney is one of the most acclaimed young talents of recent years. With her minute attention to the power dynamics in everyday speech, she builds up sexual tension and throws a deceptively low-key glance at love and death.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Faber Stories, a landmark series of individual volumes, presents masters of the short story form at work in a range of genres and styles. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the whole, it was easier than I had expected. Only once did I feel myself at risk. That was when the Inspector suddenly intervened. He said in a harsh voice: "He married your wife, didn't he? Took her away from you some people might say. Nice piece of goods, too, by the look of her. Didn't you feel any grievance?"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I had been expecting this question. I knew exactly what I would say.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The late, great P. D. James takes us inside the mind of a murderer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bringing together past, present and future in our ninetieth year, Faber Stories is a celebratory compendium of collectable work.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>"I had always imagined that my life story...would have a great first line: something like Nabokov's 'Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins;' or if I could not do lyric, then something sweeping like Tolstoy's 'All happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.'... When it comes to openers, though, the best in my view has to be the first line of Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier: 'This is the saddest story I have ever heard.'"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins the remarkable tale of Firmin the rat. Born in a bookstore in a blighted 1960's Boston neighborhood, Firmin miraculously learns how to read by digesting his nest of books. Alienated from his family and unable to communicate with the humans he loves, Firmin quickly realizes that a literate rat is a lonely rat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following a harrowing misunderstanding with his hero, the bookseller, Firmin begins to risk the dangers of Scollay Square, finding solace in the Lovelies of the burlesque cinema. Finally adopted by a down-on-his-luck science fiction writer, the tide begins to turn, but soon they both face homelessness when the wrecking ball of urban renewal arrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a series of misadventures, Firmin is ultimately led deep into his own imaginative soul-a place where Ginger Rogers can hold him tight and tattered books, storied neighborhoods, and down-and-out rats can find people who adore them.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780062457738&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. &lt;em&gt;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k&lt;/em&gt; is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, &lt;em&gt;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k&lt;/em&gt; is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Faber Stories, a landmark series of individual volumes, presents masters of the short story form at work in a range of genres and styles. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his masterful story 'A River in Egypt', David Means paints a portrait of a moment. Cavanaugh and his young son are suspended; trapped in what a nurse calls 'the sweat chamber', where the boy will be tested for cystic fibrosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cavanaugh has brought distractions - spasmodic action figures, malformed toy trucks - but they do little to alter the frustration of the sick child screaming, or to alleviate the anxiety of the time spent waiting for 'some exactitude in the form of a diagnosis'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bringing together past, present and future in our ninetieth year, Faber Stories is a celebratory compendium of collectable work.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The life-changing principles of Stoicism taught through the story of its most famous proponent.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius was the final famous Stoic philosopher of the ancient world. &lt;i&gt;The Meditations&lt;/i&gt;, his personal journal, survives to this day as one of the most loved self-help and spiritual classics of all time. In &lt;i&gt;How to Think Like a Roman Emperor&lt;/i&gt;, cognitive psychotherapist Donald Robertson weaves the life and philosophy of Marcus Aurelius together seamlessly to provide a compelling modern-day guide to the Stoic wisdom followed by countless individuals throughout the centuries as a path to achieving greater fulfillment and emotional resilience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Think Like a Roman Emperor&lt;/i&gt; takes readers on a transformative journey along with Marcus, following his progress from a young noble at the court of Hadrian—taken under the wing of some of the finest philosophers of his day—through to his reign as emperor of Rome at the height of its power. Robertson shows how Marcus used philosophical doctrines and therapeutic practices to build emotional resilience and endure tremendous adversity, and guides readers through applying the same methods to their own lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combining remarkable stories from Marcus’s life with insights from modern psychology and the enduring wisdom of his philosophy, &lt;i&gt;How to Think Like a Roman Emperor&lt;/i&gt; puts a human face on Stoicism and offers a timeless and essential guide to handling the ethical and psychological challenges we face today.</description>

  <description>From an award-winning writer whose work bristles with “hard-won strength, insight, agility, and love” (Maggie Nelson), an exquisite and troubling narrative of masculinity, violence, and society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this groundbreaking new book, the author, a trans man, trains to fight in a charity match at Madison Square Garden while struggling to untangle the vexed relationship between masculinity and violence. Through his experience boxing—learning to get hit, and to hit back; wrestling with the camaraderie of the gym; confronting the betrayals and strength of his own body—McBee examines the weight of male violence, the pervasiveness of gender stereotypes, and the limitations of conventional masculinity. A wide-ranging exploration of gender in our society, &lt;i&gt;Amateur &lt;/i&gt;is ultimately a story of hope, as McBee traces a new way forward, a new kind of masculinity, inside the ring and outside of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this graceful, stunning, and uncompromising exploration of living, fighting, and healing, we gain insight into the stereotypes and shifting realities of masculinity today through the eyes of a new man.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I was standing on one leg shucking oysters when the problems began…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don and Rosie are back in Melbourne after a decade in New York, and they’re about to face their most important project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their son, Hudson, is having trouble at school: his teachers say he isn’t fitting in with the other kids. Meanwhile, Rosie is battling Judas at work, and Don is in hot water after the Genetics Lecture Outrage. The life-contentment graph, recently at its highest point, is curving downwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Don Tillman, geneticist and World’s Best Problem-Solver, learning to be a good parent as well as a good partner will require the help of friends old and new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will mean letting Hudson make his way in the world, and grappling with awkward truths about his own identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And opening a cocktail bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hilarious and thought-provoking, with a brilliant cast of characters and an ending that will have readers cheering for joy, &lt;i&gt;The Rosie Result &lt;/i&gt;is the triumphant final instalment of the internationally bestselling series that began with &lt;i&gt;The Rosie Project&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

      <![CDATA[This packs far more food for thought into 40 pages than most writers pack into 400. <br /><br />A young-ish girl starts out on an ominous train journey, her ticket having been purchased by her parents.

  <description>A family sets out on a road trip in the American South. The grandmother suggests they change course in order to avoid "The Misfit", an escaped convict who's reportedly heading towards Florida. But when their car turns over in a ditch, who should they flag down for help but the very man whose picture they recognise from the paper . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flannery O'Connor's famous fifties story evokes heat and dust, family and feuding, God and grace - and is utterly uncompromising in its brutality.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a classic work of literature, and so you shouldn't let the fact that I found its 34 pages a little pedestrian and unmoving put you off reading it.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;From 'one of the most gifted writers working today' (New York Times) comes an audacious new novel about the bodies we live in and the bodies we desire&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Brexit Britain, a young transgender doctor called Ry is falling in love – against their better judgement – with Victor Stein, a celebrated professor leading the public debate around AI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Ron Lord, just divorced and living with Mum again, is set to make his fortune launching a new generation of sex dolls for lonely men everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across the Atlantic, in Phoenix, Arizona, a cryogenics facility houses dozens of bodies of men and women who are medically and legally dead… but waiting to return to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the scene is set in 1816, when nineteen-year-old Mary Shelley writes a story about creating a non-biological life-form. &lt;i&gt;‘Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will happen when homo sapiens is no longer the smartest being on the planet? Jeanette Winterson shows us how much closer we are to that future than we realise. Funny and furious, bold and clear-sighted, &lt;i&gt;Frankissstein&lt;/i&gt; is a love story about life itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Faber Stories, a landmark series of individual volumes, presents masters of the short story form at work in a range of genres and styles. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Her story was this: she had been an orphan, her mother probably a whore. Brought up by nuns, she had lost her faith, found another, fought for it and been imprisoned. This was inexact but serviceable.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the twelfth day of her hunger strike, Maggy is unable to tell the difference between what is real and what is imagined. That's true of what brought her here too: was she IRA, or did she just take risks for the sake of a friend?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julia O'Faolain paints a portrait of young Irish girls and their unseverable connection, showing solidarity in places politics cannot reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bringing together past, present and future in our ninetieth year, Faber Stories is a celebratory compendium of collectable work.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Music broadcaster and composer Stephen Johnson explores how Shostakovich's music took shape under Stalin's reign of terror, and how it gave form to the hopes of an oppressed people. Johnson writes of the healing effect of music on sufferers of mental illness and tells of how Shostakovich's music lent him unexpected strength in his struggle with bipolar disorder.</description>

  <description>It is worse, much worse, than you think. If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible. In California, wildfires now rage year-round, destroying thousands of homes. Across the US, "500-year" storms pummel communities month after month, and floods displace tens of millions annually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is only a preview of the changes to come. And they are coming fast. Without a revolution in how billions of humans conduct their lives, parts of the Earth could become close to uninhabitable, and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his travelogue of our near future, David Wallace-Wells brings into stark relief the climate troubles that await--food shortages, refugee emergencies, and other crises that will reshape the globe. But the world will be remade by warming in more profound ways as well, transforming our politics, our culture, our relationship to technology, and our sense of history. It will be all-encompassing, shaping and distorting nearly every aspect of human life as it is lived today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like &lt;i&gt;An Inconvenient Truth&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Silent Spring&lt;/i&gt; before it, &lt;i&gt;The Uninhabitable Earth&lt;/i&gt; is both a meditation on the devastation we have brought upon ourselves and an impassioned call to action. For just as the world was brought to the brink of catastrophe within the span of a lifetime, the responsibility to avoid it now belongs to a single generation.</description>

  <description>A literary sensation and bestseller both in England and America, The Swimming-Pool Library is an enthralling, darkly erotic novel of homosexuality before the scourge of AIDS; an elegy, possessed of chilling clarity, for ways of life that can no longer be lived with impunity. "Impeccably composed and meticulously particular in its observation of everything" (Harpers &amp;amp; Queen), it focuses on the friendship of two men: William Beckwith, a young gay aristocrat who leads a life of privilege and promiscuity, and the elderly Lord Nantwich, an old Africa hand, searching for someone to write his biography and inherit his traditions.</description>

  <description>Everyone accepts the importance of physical health; isn't it just as important to aim for the mental equivalent? Philippa Perry has come to the rescue with How to Stay Sane -- a maintenance manual for the mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years of working as a psychotherapist showed Philippa Perry what approaches produced positive change in her clients and how best to maintain good mental health. In How to Stay Sane, she has taken these principles and applied them to self-help. Using ideas from neuroscience and sound psychological theory, she shows us how to better understand ourselves. Her idea is that if we know how our minds form and develop, we are less at the mercy of unknown unconscious processes. In this way, we can learn to be the master of our feelings and not their slave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a smart, pithy, readable book that everyone with even a passing interest in their psychological health will find useful.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this spellbinding exploration of the varieties of love, the author of the worldwide bestseller &lt;i&gt;Call Me by Your Name&lt;/i&gt; revisits its complex and beguiling characters decades after their first meeting.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No novel in recent memory has spoken more movingly to contemporary readers about the nature of love than André Aciman’s haunting &lt;i&gt;Call Me by Your Name&lt;/i&gt;. First published in 2007, it was hailed as “a love letter, an invocation . . . an exceptionally beautiful book” (Stacey D’Erasmo, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;). Nearly three quarters of a million copies have been sold, and the book became a much-loved, Academy Award–winning film starring Timothée Chalamet as the young Elio and Armie Hammer as Oliver, the graduate student with whom he falls in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Find Me&lt;/i&gt;, Aciman shows us Elio’s father, Samuel, on a trip from Florence to Rome to visit Elio, who has become a gifted classical pianist. A chance encounter on the train with a beautiful young woman upends Sami’s plans and changes his life forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elio soon moves to Paris, where he, too, has a consequential affair, while Oliver, now a New England college professor with a family, suddenly finds himself contemplating a return trip across the Atlantic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aciman is a master of sensibility, of the intimate details and the emotional nuances that are the substance of passion. &lt;i&gt;Find Me&lt;/i&gt; brings us back inside the magic circle of one of our greatest contemporary romances to ask if, in fact, true love ever dies.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Faber Stories, a landmark series of individual volumes, presents masters of the short story form at work in a range of genres and styles. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adrienne is living in a puritanical age, when the best compliment a childless woman can get is: 'You'd make a terrific mother'. That's when she goes to her friends' Labor Day picnic and accidentally kills their baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shock of this scene is expertly packed into two brief paragraphs. What follows is Adrienne's retreat from life and her attempt to return to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her sharp scepticism about the people around her is achingly funny. Yet beyond derision there is forgiveness and something along the lines of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bringing together past, present and future in our ninetieth year, Faber Stories is a celebratory compendium of collectable work.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>When Alexander Litvinenko set out for London's Millennium Hotel one November day in 2006, he already knew he was embroiled in a political conflict. The dissident Russian agent had, after all, fled Moscow to escape the wrath of Vladimir Putin and the country's feared security service. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What he didn't realise was that the men he would drink with that afternoon were about to throw him into another battle: a brutal fight with a little-known but devastatingly toxic poison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than six years after a fatal poisoning that made headlines around the world, award-winning novelist and investigative journalist Will Storr navigates the web of betrayal and biology that left Litvinenko dead. Edited by Pulitzer prize-winning science writer Deborah Blum, the sixth story from MATTER delves into the history of Russia's poisoning programme — and the extraordinary properties of what may be it most deadly product.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;‘One of my absolute favourite writers’ Decca Aitkenhead&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Who would we be without stories?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories mould who we are, from our character to our cultural identity. They drive us to act out our dreams and ambitions, and shape our politics and beliefs. We use them to construct our relationships, to keep order in our law courts, to interpret events in our newspapers and social media. Storytelling is an essential part of what makes us human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been many attempts to understand what makes a good story – from Joseph Campbell’s well-worn theories about myth and archetype to recent attempts to crack the ‘Bestseller Code’. But few have used a scientific approach. This is curious, for if we are to truly understand storytelling in its grandest sense, we must first come to understand the ultimate storyteller – the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this scalpel-sharp, thought-provoking book, Will Storr demonstrates how master storytellers manipulate and compel us, leading us on a journey from the Hebrew scriptures to Mr Men, from Booker Prize-winning literature to box set TV. Applying dazzling psychological research and cutting-edge neuroscience to the foundations of our myths and archetypes, he shows how we can use these tools to tell better stories – and make sense of our chaotic modern world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The things that are said on camera are only part of the story.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind every interview there is a backstory. How it came about. How it ended. The compromises that were made. The regrets, the rows, the deeply inappropriate comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making news is an essential but imperfect art, and it rarely goes according to plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never expected to find myself wandering around the Maharani of Jaipur's bedroom with Bill Clinton or invited to the Miss USA beauty pageant by its owner, Donald Trump. I never expected to be thrown into a provincial Cuban jail, or to be drinking red wine at Steve Bannon's kitchen table or spend three hours in a lift with Alan Partridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly didn't expect the Dalai Lama to tell me the story of his most memorable poo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beauty of television is its ability to simplify, but that's also its weakness: it can distil everything down to one snapshot, one soundbite. Then the news cycle moves on.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Britain has lost the Falklands war, Margaret Thatcher battles Tony Benn for power and Alan Turing achieves a breakthrough in artificial intelligence. In a world not quite like this one, two lovers will be tested beyond their understanding.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Machines Like Me&lt;/i&gt; occurs in an alternative 1980s London. Charlie, drifting through life and dodging full-time employment, is in love with Miranda, a bright student who lives with a terrible secret. When Charlie comes into money, he buys Adam, one of the first batch of synthetic humans. With Miranda’s assistance, he co-designs Adam’s personality. This near-perfect human is beautiful, strong and clever – a love triangle soon forms. These three beings will confront a profound moral dilemma. Ian McEwan’s subversive and entertaining new novel poses fundamental questions: what makes us human? Our outward deeds or our inner lives? Could a machine understand the human heart? This provocative and thrilling tale warns of the power to invent things beyond our control.</description>

      <![CDATA[It's Ian McEwan, so of course the writing is great, but this didn't really work as a novel. There were too many ideas stuffed into it - resurrecting Alan Turing, counter-factual social history of the 1980s, and (of course) lifelike robots. There were lots of interesting ideas hinted at, but none...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Cleanliness is next to enlightenment. In this Japanese bestseller a Buddhist monk explains the traditional meditative techniques that will help cleanse not only your house - but your soul.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Live clean. Feel calm. Be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;We remove dust to sweep away our worldly cares. We live simply and take time to contemplate the self, mindfully living each moment. It's not just monks that need to live this way. Everyone in today's busy world needs it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Japan, cleanliness is next to enlightenment. This bestselling guide by a Zen Buddhist monk draws on ancient traditions to show you how a few simple changes to your daily habits - from your early morning routine to preparing food, from respecting the objects around you to working together as a team -will not only make your home calmer and cleaner, but will leave you feeling refreshed, happier and more fulfilled.</description>

  <description>At long last, Mary Beard addresses in one brave book the misogynists and trolls who mercilessly attack and demean women the world over, including, very often, Mary herself. In &lt;em&gt;Women &amp;amp; Power&lt;/em&gt;, she traces the origins of this misogyny to its ancient roots, examining the pitfalls of gender and the ways that history has mistreated strong women since time immemorial. As far back as Homer’s &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, Beard shows, women have been prohibited from leadership roles in civic life, public speech being defined as inherently male. From Medusa to Philomela (whose tongue was cut out), from Hillary Clinton to Elizabeth Warren (who was told to sit down), Beard draws illuminating parallels between our cultural assumptions about women’s relationship to power—and how powerful women provide a necessary example for all women who must resist being vacuumed into a male template. With personal reflections on her own online experiences with sexism, Beard asks: If women aren’t perceived to be within the structure of power, isn’t it power itself we need to redefine? And how many more centuries should we be expected to wait?</description>

  <description>A guy walks into a bar car and...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From here the story could take many turns. When this guy is David Sedaris, the possibilities are endless, but the result is always the same: he will both delight you with twists of humor and intelligence and leave you deeply moved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sedaris remembers his father's dinnertime attire (shirtsleeves and underpants), his first colonoscopy (remarkably pleasant), and the time he considered buying the skeleton of a murdered Pygmy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls&lt;/i&gt;, David Sedaris shows once again why his work has been called "hilarious, elegant, and surprisingly moving" (&lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;).</description>

  <description>Ruth Patchett never thought of herself as particularly devilish. Rather the opposite in fact -- simply a tall, not terribly attractive woman living a quiet life as a wife and mother in a respectable suburb. But when she discovers that her husband is having a passionate affair with the lovely romantic novelist Mary Fisher, she is so seized by envy that she becomes truly diabolic. Within weeks she has burnt down the family home, collected the insurance, made love to the local drunk and embarked on a course of destruction and revenge. A blackly comic satire of the war of the sexes, LIFE AND LOVES OF A SHE DEVIL is the fantasy of the wronged woman made real.</description>

  <description>Minimalism is the art of knowing how much is just enough. Digital minimalism applies this idea to our personal technology. It's the key to living a focused life in an increasingly noisy world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this timely and enlightening book, the bestselling author of Deep Work introduces a philosophy for technology use that has already improved countless lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Digital minimalists are all around us. They're the calm, happy people who can hold long conversations without furtive glances at their phones. They can get lost in a good book, a woodworking project, or a leisurely morning run. They can have fun with friends and family without the obsessive urge to document the experience. They stay informed about the news of the day, but don't feel overwhelmed by it. They don't experience "fear of missing out" because they already know which activities provide them meaning and satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Newport gives us a name for this quiet movement, and makes a persuasive case for its urgency in our tech-saturated world. Common sense tips, like turning off notifications, or occasional rituals like observing a digital sabbath, don't go far enough in helping us take back control of our technological lives, and attempts to unplug completely are complicated by the demands of family, friends and work. What we need instead is a thoughtful method to decide what tools to use, for what purposes, and under what conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on a diverse array of real-life examples, from Amish farmers to harried parents to Silicon Valley programmers, Newport identifies the common practices of digital minimalists and the ideas that underpin them. He shows how digital minimalists are rethinking their relationship to social media, rediscovering the pleasures of the offline world, and reconnecting with their inner selves through regular periods of solitude. He then shares strategies for integrating these practices into your life, starting with a thirty-day "digital declutter" process that has already helped thousands feel less overwhelmed and more in control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technology is intrinsically neither good nor bad. The key is using it to support your goals and values, rather than letting it use you. This book shows the way.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The bestselling authors of the classic &lt;i&gt;Difficult Conversations &lt;/i&gt;teach us how to turn evaluations, advice, criticisms, and coaching into productive listening and learning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We swim in an ocean of feedback. Bosses, colleagues, customers—but also family, friends, and in-laws—they all have “suggestions” for our performance, parenting, or appearance. We know that feedback is essential for healthy relationships and professional development—but we dread it and often dismiss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s because receiving feedback sits at the junction of two conflicting human desires. We do want to learn and grow. And we also want to be accepted just as we are right now. &lt;i&gt;Thanks for the Feedback &lt;/i&gt;is the first book to address this tension head on. It explains why getting feedback is so crucial yet so challenging, and offers a powerful framework to help us take on life’s blizzard of off-hand comments, annual evaluations, and unsolicited advice with curiosity and grace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The business world spends billions of dollars and millions of hours each year teaching people how to give feedback more effectively. Stone and Heen argue that we’ve got it backwards and show us why the smart money is on educating &lt;i&gt;r&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;ceivers—&lt;/i&gt; in the workplace and in personal relationships as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coauthors of the international bestseller &lt;i&gt;Difficult Conversations&lt;/i&gt;, Stone and Heen have spent the last ten years working with businesses, nonprofits, governments, and families to determine what helps us learn and what gets in our way. With humor and clarity, they blend the latest insights from neuroscience and psychology with practical, hard-headed advice. The book is destined to become a classic in the world of leadership, organizational behavior, and education.</description>

  <description>Is it possible to write a sidesplitting novel about the breakup of the perfect marriage? If the writer is Nora Ephron, the answer is a resounding yes. For in this inspired confection of adultery, revenge, group therapy, and pot roast, the creator of &lt;i&gt;Sleepless in Seattle&lt;/i&gt; reminds us that comedy depends on anguish as surely as a proper gravy depends on flour and butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven months into her pregnancy, Rachel Samstat discovers that her husband, Mark, is in love with another woman. The fact that the other woman has "a neck as long as an arm and a nose as long as a thumb and you should see her legs" is no consolation. Food sometimes is, though, since Rachel writes cookbooks for a living. And in between trying to win Mark back and loudly wishing him dead, Ephron's irrepressible heroine offers some of her favorite recipes. &lt;i&gt;Heartburn &lt;/i&gt;is a sinfully delicious novel, as soul-satisfying as mashed potatoes and as airy as a perfect soufflé.</description>

  <description>A modern masterpiece from one of Italy's most acclaimed authors, My Brilliant Friend is a rich, intense and generous hearted story about two friends, Elena and Lila. Ferrante's inimitable style lends itself perfectly to a meticulous portrait of these two women that is also the story of a nation and a touching meditation on the nature of friendship. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighbourhood, a city and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between her two protagonists.</description>

  <description>In this little treasure, Thich Nhat Hanh, the renowned Zen monk, offers timeless insight into the nature of real love. With simplicity, warmth, and directness, he explores the four key aspects of love as described in the Buddhist tradition: lovingkindness, compassion, joy, and freedom—explaining how to experience them in our day-to-day lives. He also emphasizes that in order to love in a real way, we must first learn how to be fully present in our lives, and he offers simple techniques from the Buddhist tradition that anyone can use to establish the conditions of love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk, is an internationally known author, poet, scholar, and peace activist who was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by Martin Luther King Jr.</description>

  <description>Bernadette Fox has vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her daughter Bee claims a family trip to Antarctica as a reward for perfect grades, Bernadette, a fiercely intelligent shut-in, throws herself into preparations for the trip. But worn down by years of trying to live the Seattle life she never wanted, Ms. Fox is on the brink of a meltdown. And after a school fundraiser goes disastrously awry at her hands, she disappears, leaving her family to pick up the pieces--which is exactly what Bee does, weaving together an elaborate web of emails, invoices, and school memos that reveals a secret past Bernadette has been hiding for decades. &lt;i&gt;Where'd You Go Bernadette&lt;/i&gt; is an ingenious and unabashedly entertaining novel about a family coming to terms with who they are and the power of a daughter's love for her mother.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Grayson Perry’s book will overturn everything you thought you knew about “art”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now Grayson Perry is a fully paid-up member of the art establishment, he wants to show that any of us can appreciate art (after all, there is a reason he’s called this book &lt;i&gt;Playing to the Gallery &lt;/i&gt;and not &lt;i&gt;Sucking Up to the Academic Elite&lt;/i&gt;). This funny, personal journey through the art world answers the basic questions that might occur to us in an art gallery but that we’re too embarrassed to ask. Questions such as: What is “good” or “bad” art—and does it even matter? Is art still capable of shocking us or have we seen it all before? And what happens if you place apiece of art in a rubbish dump?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Remember the words of Ivan Rogers the next time you hear some plausible posh boy in a suit telling you ‘no deal’ wouldn’t hurt at all and might even be a jolly good thing.” J.K. Rowling&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two and a half years after Britain voted to leave the European Union, the political debate over Brexit seems as intense and as complicated as ever. Who and what can we trust? And how on earth do we make sense of it all?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivan Rogers, the UK’s former ambassador to the EU, is uniquely placed to tell some home truths about the failure of the British political class and the flaws, dishonesty and confusion inherent in the UK’s approach to Brexit so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this short, elegant essay, Rogers draws up nine lessons that we, as a soon-to-be ‘third country’, need to learn from the last few years, if the next few years – indeed the next decade – are not to be even more painful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Schoolteacher Barbara Covett has led a solitary life until Sheba Hart, the new art teacher at St. George's, befriends her. But even as their relationship develops, so too does another: Sheba has begun an illicit affair with an underage male student. When the scandal turns into a media circus, Barbara decides to write an account in her friend's defense—and ends up revealing not only Sheba's secrets, but also her own.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bestselling author and marketing strategist Ryan Holiday reveals to creatives of all stripes&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;authors, entrepreneurs, musicians, filmmakers, fine artists--how a classic work is made and marketed.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In Hollywood, a movie is given a single weekend to succeed before being written off. In Silicon Valley, a startup is a failure if it doesn't go viral or rake in venture capital from the start. In publishing, a book that took years to write is given less than three months to sink or swim. These brutally shortsighted attitudes have choked the world with instructions for engineering a flash-in-the-pan and littered the media landscape with fads and flops. &lt;br /&gt; Meanwhile, the greats, the stalwarts, the household names, are those who focus on a singularly different, possibly heretical, idea: that their work can and should last. For instance, Zildjian has been one of the premier makers of cymbals since its founding in 1623--and shows no signs of quitting. Iron Maiden has filled stadiums for forty years, moving some 85 million albums without the help of radio or television. Robert Greene's first book, &lt;i&gt;The 48 Laws of Power&lt;/i&gt;, didn't hit the bestseller lists until over a decade after it was first released, and since then has sold more than 1 million copies worldwide. &lt;br /&gt; These works Ryan Holiday calls Perennial Sellers. They exist in every creative industry--timeless, dependable resources and unsung moneymakers, paying like blue chip annuities. Like gold or land, they increase in value over time, outlasting and outreaching any competition. And they're not flukes or lucky breaks--they were built to last from the outset. &lt;br /&gt;Holiday shows readers how to make and market their own classic work. Featuring interviews with some of the world's greatest creatives, and grounded in a deep study of the classics in every genre, this exciting new book empowers readers with a foundational set of innovative principles. Whether you have a book or a business, a song or the next great screenplay, this book reveals the recipe for perennial success.</description>

  <description>One of the most important philosophy titles published in the twentieth century, Josef Pieper's &lt;i&gt;Leisure: the Basis of Culture&lt;/i&gt; is more significant, even more crucial, today than it was when it first appeared fifty years ago. Pieper shows that the Greeks understood and valued leisure, as did the medieval Europeans. He points out that religion can be born only in leisure - a leisure that allows time for the contemplation of the nature of God. Leisure has been, and always will be, the first foundation of any culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He maintains that our bourgeois world of total labor has vanquished leisure, and issues a startling warning: Unless we regain the art of silence and insight, the ability for nonactivity, unless we substitute true leisure for our hectic amusements, we will destroy our culture - and ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These astonishing essays contradict all our pragmatic and puritanical conceptions about labor and leisure; Josef Pieper demolishes the twentieth-century cult of "work" as he predicts its destructive consequences.</description>

  <description>In his highly acclaimed debut, A Pale View of Hills, Kazuo Ishiguro tells the story of Etsuko, a Japanese woman now living alone in England, dwelling on the recent suicide of her daughter. Retreating into the past, she finds herself reliving one particular hot summer in Nagasaki, when she and her friends struggled to rebuild their lives after the war. But then as she recalls her strange friendship with Sachiko - a wealthy woman reduced to vagrancy - the memories take on a disturbing cast.</description>

  <description>A grumpy yet loveable man finds his solitary world turned on its head when a boisterous young family moves in next door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Ove. He's a curmudgeon, the kind of man who points at people he dislikes as if they were burglars caught outside his bedroom window. He has staunch principles, strict routines, and a short fuse. People call him &lt;i&gt;the bitter neighbor from hell&lt;/i&gt;, but must Ove be bitter just because he doesn't walk around with a smile plastered to his face all the time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind the cranky exterior there is a story and a sadness. So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in next door and accidentally flatten Ove's mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul. All of which will change one cranky old man and a local residents' association to their very foundations.</description>

  <description>In the north of England, far from the intrusions of cities but not far from civilization, Silvie and her family are living as if they are ancient Britons, surviving by the tools and knowledge of the Iron Age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two weeks, the length of her father's vacation, they join an anthropology course set to reenact life in simpler times. They are surrounded by forests of birch and rowan; they make stew from foraged roots and hunted rabbit. The students are fulfilling their coursework; Silvie's father is fulfilling his lifelong obsession. He has raised her on stories of early man, taken her to witness rare artifacts, recounted time and again their rituals and beliefs—particularly their sacrifices to the bog. Mixing with the students, Silvie begins to see, hear, and imagine another kind of life, one that might include going to university, traveling beyond England, choosing her own clothes and food, speaking her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ancient Britons built ghost walls to ward off enemy invaders, rude barricades of stakes topped with ancestral skulls. When the group builds one of their own, they find a spiritual connection to the past. What comes next but human sacrifice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A story at once mythic and strikingly timely, Sarah Moss's &lt;i&gt;Ghost Wall &lt;/i&gt;urges us to wonder how far we have come from the "primitive minds" of our ancestors.</description>

  <description>An unprecedented history of a personality test devised in the 1940s by a mother and daughter, both homemakers, that has achieved cult-like status and is used in today's most distinguished boardrooms, classrooms, and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is the most popular personality test in the world. It has been harnessed by Fortune 100 companies, universities, hospitals, churches, and the military. Its language - of extraversion vs. introversion, thinking vs. feeling - has inspired online dating platforms and &lt;i&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/i&gt; quizzes alike. And yet despite the test's widespread adoption, experts in the field of psychometric testing, a $500 million industry, struggle to account for its success - no less to validate its results. How did the Myers-Briggs test insinuate itself into our jobs, our relationships, our Internet, our lives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First conceived in the 1920s by the mother-daughter team of Katherine Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers, a pair of aspiring novelists and devoted homemakers, the Myers-Briggs was designed to bring the gospel of Carl Jung to the masses. But it would take on a life of its own, reaching from the smoke-filled boardrooms of mid-century New York to Berkeley, California, where it was honed against some of the twentieth century's greatest creative minds. It would travel across the world to London, Zurich, Cape Town, Melbourne, and Tokyo; to elementary schools, nunneries, wellness retreats, and the closed-door corporate training sessions of today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing from original reporting and never-before-published documents, &lt;i&gt;The Personality Brokers&lt;/i&gt; examines nothing less than the definition of the self - our attempts to grasp, categorize, and quantify our personalities. Surprising and absorbing, the book, like the test at its heart, considers the timeless question: What makes you &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;'A blisteringly good, urgent, essential read' ZADIE SMITH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jaron Lanier, the world-famous Silicon Valley scientist-pioneer and 'high-tech genius' (&lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt;) who first alerted us to the dangers of social media, explains why its toxic effects are at the heart of its design, and explains in ten simple arguments why liberating yourself from its hold will transform your life and the world for the better.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Social media is making us sadder, angrier, less empathetic, more fearful, more isolated and more tribal. In recent months it has become horribly clear that social media is not bringing us together – it is tearing us apart. In &lt;i&gt;Ten Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now &lt;/i&gt;Jaron Lanier draws on his insider's expertise to explain precisely how social media works – by deploying constant surveillance and subconscious manipulation of its users – and why its cruel and dangerous effects are at the heart of its current business model and design. As well as offering ten simple arguments for liberating yourself from its addictive hold, his witty and urgent manifesto outlines a vision for an alternative that provides all the benefits of social media without the harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want a happier life, a more just and peaceful world, or merely the chance to think for yourself without being monitored and influenced by the richest corporations in history, then the best thing you can do, for now, is delete your social media accounts – right now. You will almost certainly become a calmer and possibly a nicer person in the process.</description>

  <description>This is the story of Mary, a young girl born in a beautiful city full of rose gardens and fluttering kites. When she is still very small, Mary meets Lanmo, a shining golden snake, who becomes her very best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The snake visits Mary many times, he sees her city change, become sadder as bombs drop and war creeps in. He sees Mary and her family leave their home, he sees her grow up and he sees her fall in love. But Lanmo knows that the day will come when he can no longer visit Mary, when his destiny will break them apart, and he wonders whether having a friend can possibly be worth the pain of knowing you will lose them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From one of Britain's most gifted and celebrated writers, The Little Snake is a magical and deeply moving fable about the journey we all take through life, about love and family, about war and resilience, about how we live in this world, and how we leave it.</description>

  <description>At school Connell and Marianne pretend not to know each other. He’s popular and well-adjusted, star of the school soccer team while she is lonely, proud, and intensely private. But when Connell comes to pick his mother up from her housekeeping job at Marianne’s house, a strange and indelible connection grows between the two teenagers—one they are determined to conceal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, they’re both studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Marianne has found her feet in a new social world while Connell hangs at the sidelines, shy and uncertain. Throughout their years in college, Marianne and Connell circle one another, straying toward other people and possibilities but always magnetically, irresistibly drawn back together. Then, as she veers into self-destruction and he begins to search for meaning elsewhere, each must confront how far they are willing to go to save the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Rooney brings her brilliant psychological acuity and perfectly spare prose to a story that explores the subtleties of class, the electricity of first love, and the complex entanglements of family and friendship.</description>

  <description>The Wisdom of Pooh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there such thing as a Western Taoist? Benjamin Hoff says there is, and this Taoist's favorite food is honey. Through brilliant and witty dialogue with the beloved Pooh-bear and his companions, the author of this smash bestseller explains with ease and aplomb that rather than being a distant and mysterious concept, Taoism is as near and practical to us as our morning breakfast bowl. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romp through the enchanting world of Winnie-the-Pooh while soaking up invaluable lessons on simplicity and natural living.</description>

I'm not a particular fan of the stories from the Hundred Acre Wood, and neither am I at all well-read on Taoism, so there was never going to be too much in here to rile me!<br /><br />My overall feeling was that this...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A charming, practical, and unsentimental approach to putting a home in order while reflecting on the tiny joys that make up a long life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Sweden there is a kind of decluttering called &lt;i&gt;döstädning&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;dö&lt;/i&gt; meaning “death” and &lt;i&gt;städning&lt;/i&gt; meaning “cleaning.” This surprising and invigorating process of clearing out unnecessary belongings can be undertaken at any age or life stage but should be done sooner than later, before others have to do it for you. In &lt;i&gt;The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning&lt;/i&gt;, artist Margareta Magnusson, with Scandinavian humor and wisdom, instructs readers to embrace minimalism. Her radical and joyous method for putting things in order helps families broach sensitive conversations, and makes the process uplifting rather than overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margareta suggests which possessions you can easily get rid of (unworn clothes, unwanted presents, more plates than you’d ever use) and which you might want to keep (photographs, love letters, a few of your children’s art projects). Digging into her late husband’s tool shed, and her own secret drawer of vices, Margareta introduces an element of fun to a potentially daunting task. Along the way readers get a glimpse into her life in Sweden, and also become more comfortable with the idea of letting go.</description>

  <description>A poetic and nuanced exploration of the human experience of flight that reminds us of the full imaginative weight of our most ordinary journeys—and reawakens our capacity to be amazed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The twenty-first century has relegated airplane flight—a once remarkable feat of human ingenuity—to the realm of the mundane. Mark Vanhoenacker, a 747 pilot who left academia and a career in the business world to pursue his childhood dream of flight, asks us to reimagine what we—both as pilots and as passengers—are actually doing when we enter the world between departure and discovery. In a seamless fusion of history, politics, geography, meteorology, ecology, family, and physics, Vanhoenacker vaults across geographical and cultural boundaries; above mountains, oceans, and deserts; through snow, wind, and rain, renewing a simultaneously humbling and almost superhuman activity that affords us unparalleled perspectives on the planet we inhabit and the communities we form.</description>

  <description>I loved this book. It made my heart sing. Written by a woman in the law with compassion, wit and legal know-how, these true life courtroom stories tell it like it is. - Helena Kennedy QC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Langford is a barrister. Her job is to stand in court representing the mad and the bad, the vulnerable, the heartbroken and the hopeful. She must become their voice: weave their story around the black and white of the law and tell it to the courtroom. These stories may not make headlines but they will change the lives of ordinary people in extraordinary ways. They are stories which, but for a twist of luck, might have been yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With remarkable candour, Sarah describes eleven cases which reveal what goes on in our criminal and family courts: these are tales of domestic fall out, everyday burglary, sexual indiscretion, and children caught up in the law. They are sometimes shocking and they are often heart-stopping. She examines how she feels as she defends the person standing in the dock. She also shows us how our attitudes and actions can shape not only the outcome of a case, but the legal system itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Would you rather love the more, and suffer the more; or love the less, and suffer the less? That is, I think, finally, the only real question.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First love has lifelong consequences, but Paul doesn’t know anything about that at nineteen. At nineteen, he’s proud of the fact his relationship flies in the face of social convention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he grows older, the demands placed on Paul by love become far greater than he could possibly have foreseen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tender and profound, &lt;i&gt;The Only Story&lt;/i&gt; is an achingly beautiful novel by one of fiction’s greatest mappers of the human heart.</description>

  <description>In this fascinating book, Alan Watts explores man's quest for psychological security, examining our efforts to find spiritual and intellectual certainty in the realms of religion and philosophy. The Wisdom of Insecurity underlines the importance of our search for stability in an age where human life seems particularly vulnerable and uncertain. Watts argues our insecurity is the consequence of trying to be secure and that, ironically, salvation and sanity lie in the recognition that we have no way of saving ourselves.</description>

  <description>As it was in Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary, and Othello, so it is in life. Most forms of private vice and public evil are kindled and sustained by lies. Acts of adultery and other personal betrayals, financial fraud, government corruption—even murder and genocide—generally require an additional moral defect: a willingness to lie.</description>

  <description>A look inside the algorithms that are shaping our lives and the dilemmas they bring with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were accused of a crime, who would you rather decide your sentence—a mathematically consistent algorithm incapable of empathy or a compassionate human judge prone to bias and error? What if you want to buy a driverless car and must choose between one programmed to save as many lives as possible and another that prioritizes the lives of its own passengers? And would you agree to share your family’s full medical history if you were told that it would help researchers find a cure for cancer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are just some of the dilemmas that we are beginning to face as we approach the age of the algorithm, when it feels as if the machines reign supreme. Already, these lines of code are telling us what to watch, where to go, whom to date, and even whom to send to jail. But as we rely on algorithms to automate big, important decisions—in crime, justice, healthcare, transportation, and money—they raise questions about what we want our world to look like. What matters most: Helping doctors with diagnosis or preserving privacy? Protecting victims of crime or preventing innocent people being falsely accused?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello World&lt;/em&gt; takes us on a tour through the good, the bad, and the downright ugly of the algorithms that surround us on a daily basis. Mathematician Hannah Fry reveals their inner workings, showing us how algorithms are written and implemented, and demonstrates the ways in which human bias can literally be written into the code. By weaving in relatable, real world stories with accessible explanations of the underlying mathematics that power algorithms, &lt;em&gt;Hello World&lt;/em&gt; helps us to determine their power, expose their limitations, and examine whether they really are improvement on the human systems they replace.</description>

  <description>The story of a wealthy, fiftyish American widow, recently a famous stage beauty, but now "drifting." The novel opens soon after her husband's death and her retirement from the theatre, as Mrs. Stone tries to adjust to her aimless new life in Rome. She is adjusting, too, to aging ("The knowledge that her beauty was lost had come upon her recently and it was still occasionally forgotten.") With poignant wit and his own particular brand of relish, Williams charts her drift into an affair with a cruel young gigolo: "As compelling, as fascinating, and as technically skilled as his plays."

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Call Me by Your Name&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a sudden and powerful romance that blossoms between an adolescent boy and a summer guest at his parents' cliff-side mansion on the Italian Riviera. Unprepared for the consequences of their attraction, at first each feigns indifference. But during the restless summer weeks that follow, unrelenting buried currents of obsession and fear, fascination and desire, intensify their passion as they test the charged ground between them. What grows from the depths of their spirits is a romance of scarcely six weeks' duration and an experience that marks them for a lifetime. For what the two discover on the Riviera and during a sultry evening in Rome is the one thing both already fear they may never truly find again: total intimacy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The psychological maneuvers that accompany attraction have seldom been more shrewdly captured than in André Aciman's frank, unsentimental, heartrending elegy to human passion. &lt;em&gt;Call Me by Your Name&lt;/em&gt; is clear-eyed, bare-knuckled, and ultimately unforgettable.</description>

      <![CDATA[A book about adolescent passion: an intense summer crush, perhaps love, between a teenager and a slightly older lodger. I found this moving, both for the sheer force of emotion in the early part of the story, and for the more reflective, contemplative later parts. <br /><br />Most of this was absorbing and t...]]>

  <description>A passionate portrait of love’s contradictory power, in five illuminating stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andre Aciman, who has been called “the most exciting new fiction writer of the twenty-first century” (&lt;i&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/i&gt;), has written a novel in &lt;i&gt;Enigma Variations&lt;/i&gt; that charts the life of Paul whose loves remain as consuming and covetous throughout adulthood as they were in adolescence. Whether in southern Italy, where as a boy he has a crush on his parents’ cabinet maker, or on a snowbound campus in New England, where his enduring passion for a girl he’ll meet again and again over the years is punctuated by anonymous encounters with men; on a tennis court in Central Park, or a sidewalk in early spring New York, his attachments are ungraspable, transient and forever underwritten by raw desire—not for just one person’s body but, inevitably, for someone else’s as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In mapping the most inscrutable corners of desire, Aciman proves to be an unsparing reader of the human psyche and a master stylist of contemporary literature. With language at once lyrical, bare-knuckled, and unabashedly candid, he casts a sensuous, shimmering light over each facet of desire to probe how we ache, want, and waver, and ultimately how we sometimes falter and let go of those who may want only to offer what we crave from them. Behind every step the hero takes, his hopes, denials, fears, and regrets are always ready to lay their traps. Yet the dream of love always casts its luminous halo. We may not always know what we want. We may remain enigmas to ourselves and others. But sooner or later we discover who we’ve always known we were.</description>

  <description>Just after midnight, a snowdrift stops the Orient Express in its tracks. The luxurious train is surprisingly full for the time of the year, but by the morning it is one passenger fewer. An American tycoon lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isolated and with a killer in their midst, detective Hercule Poirot must identify the murderer – in case he or she decides to strike again.</description>

  <description>For twenty years, Daniel Hardesty has borne the emotional scars of a childhood trauma which he is powerless to undo, which leaves him no peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One August morning in 1995, the young Daniel and his estranged father Francis – a character of ‘two weathers’, of irresistible charm and roiling self-pity – set out on a road trip to the North that seems to represent a chance to salvage their relationship. But with every passing mile, the layers of Fran’s mendacity and desperation are exposed, pushing him to acts of violence that will define the rest of his son’s life.</description>

The book is narrated by a man in his 30s telling the story of a now notorious visit to Leeds with his father when he was 12. Horrific things happen, all reported through the eyes of the 12 year old. The book is atmospheric and suspensef...]]>

  <description>8 hours, 20 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who says you can't run away from your problems?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are a failed novelist about to turn fifty. A wedding invitation arrives in the mail: your boyfriend of the past nine years is engaged to someone else. You can't say yes--it would be too awkward--and you can't say no--it would look like defeat. On your desk are a series of invitations to half-baked literary events around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;QUESTION&lt;/b&gt;: How do you arrange to skip town?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ANSWER&lt;/b&gt;: You accept them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What would possibly go wrong?&lt;/i&gt; Arthur Less will almost fall in love in Paris, almost fall to his death in Berlin, barely escape to a Moroccan ski chalet from a Saharan sandstorm, accidentally book himself as the (only) writer-in-residence at a Christian Retreat Center in Southern India, and encounter, on a desert island in the Arabian Sea, the last person on Earth he wants to face. Somewhere in there: he will turn fifty. Through it all, there is his first love. And there is his last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because, despite all these mishaps, missteps, misunderstandings and mistakes, LESS is, above all, a love story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A scintillating satire of the American abroad, a rumination on time and the human heart, a bittersweet romance of chances lost, by an author The New York Times has hailed as "inspired, lyrical," "elegiac," "ingenious," as well as "too sappy by half," LESS shows a writer at the peak of his talents raising the curtain on our shared human comedy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;High-octane action, celebrity glamour, and endless possibilities for danger meet in this fast-paced debut for fans of John Sandford and Lee Child.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still reeling from a devastating personal tragedy, air marshal turned investigator Seth Walker embarks on his first case. All he has to do is accompany female pop star Max Magic to Los Angeles and deliver her to the FBI. But when their routine flight ends in a hail of gunfire at LAX, Walker has no choice but to take the frightened diva on the run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a second attack leaves him battered and bloody, Walker realizes he cannot trust the FBI. To keep his client alive, he must use a patchwork of trusted aviation contacts to get her home to Austin, where the key suspects await.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as they race to stay one step ahead of their deadly pursuers, the biggest danger of all may be what they’re heading toward—the dark secrets that Max herself has been keeping…</description>

  <description>In these pages, the authors of the widely-acclaimed The Wellness Syndrome throw themselves headlong into the world of self-optimization, a burgeoning movement that seeks to transcend the limits placed on us by being merely human, whether the feebleness of our bodies or our mental incapacities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cederström and Spicer, though willing guinea pigs in an extraordinary (and sometimes downright dangerous) range of techniques and technologies, had hitherto undertaken little by way of self-improvement. They had rarely seen the inside of a gym, let alone utilized apps that deliver electric shocks in pursuit of improved concentration. But, in the course of a year spent researching this book, they wore head-bands designed to optimize meditation, attempted to boost their memory through learning associative techniques (and failed to be admitted to MENSA), trained for weightlifting competitions, wrote what they (still) hope might become a bestselling Scandinavian detective story, enrolled in motivational seminars and tantra sex workshops, attended new-age retreats and man-camps, underwent plastic surgery, and experimented with vibrators and productivity drugs. André even addressed a London subway car whilst (nearly) naked in an attempt to boost attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat surprisingly, the two young professors survived this year of rigorous research. Further, they have drawn deeply on it to produce a hilarious and eye-opening book. Written in the form of two parallel diaries, Desperately Seeking Self-Improvement provides a biting analysis of the narcissism and individual competitiveness that increasingly pervades a culture in which social solutions are receding and individual self-improvement is the only option left.</description>

  <description>Pietro is a lonely boy living in Milan. With his parents becoming more distant each day, the only thing the family shares is their love for the Dolomites, the mountains that hug the northeastern border of Italy. While on vacation at the foot of the mountains, Pietro meets Bruno, an adventurous, spirited local boy. Together they spend many summers exploring the mountain's meadows and peaks and discover the similarities and differences in their lives, their backgrounds, and their futures. The two boys come to find the true meaning of friendship and camaraderie, even as their divergent paths in life-- Bruno's in the mountains, Pietro's in cosmopolitan cities across the world--test the strength and meaning of their connection.</description>

  <description>Jeremy Underwood is a long-suffering subeditor on The Daily Beast, Britain's mightiest tabloid. Returning from holiday, he notices two burqa-clad figures lurking outside the paper's offices in Kensington. Fear is in the air since two male suspects escaped from a mosque. Jeremy's observation sets off a chain of events that rapidly escalates, as the great Beast comes under siege.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexander Starritt's novel is a vivid anatomy of that most uncontrollable and irresponsible of large creatures, the British tabloid newspaper. He writes with pinpoint precision about the ways in which scapegoats are selected by an institution that sees itself as the voice of Middle England. The fearsome professionalism and manic rivalries of a newsroom have rarely been so well described. This is a compelling novel in which comedy teeters on the edge of horror.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a satire set in the offices of a caricature of a self-important British tabloid newspaper, The Daily Mail in all but name. I struggled with it, I'm afraid. It is full of stock characters and cliché, and doesn't really have anything new to say. The plot is largely predictable and plays out...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For readers of Atul Gawande and Paul Kalanithi, a palliative care doctor's breathtaking stories from 30 years spent caring for the dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Modern medical technology is allowing us to live longer and fuller lives than ever before. And for the most part, that is good news. But with changes in the way we understand medicine come changes in the way we understand death. Once a familiar, peaceful, and gentle -- if sorrowful -- transition, death has come to be something from which we shield our eyes, as we prefer to fight desperately against it rather than accept its inevitability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Kathryn Mannix has studied and practiced palliative care for thirty years. In &lt;i&gt;With the End in Mind&lt;/i&gt;, she shares beautifully crafted stories from a lifetime of caring for the dying, and makes a compelling case for the therapeutic power of approaching death not with trepidation, but with openness, clarity, and understanding. Weaving the details of her own experiences as a caregiver through stories of her patients, their families, and their distinctive lives, Dr. Mannix reacquaints us with the universal, but deeply personal, process of dying. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With insightful meditations on life, death, and the space between them, &lt;i&gt;With the End in Mind&lt;/i&gt; describes the possibility of meeting death gently, with forethought and preparation, and shows the unexpected beauty, dignity, and profound humanity of life coming to an end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Few heirs to the throne have suffered as much humiliation as Prince Charles. Despite his hard work and genuine concern for the disadvantaged, he has struggled to overcome his unpopularity. After Diana’s death, his approval rating crashed to 4% and has been only rescued by his marriage to Camilla. Nevertheless, just one third of Britons now support him to be the next king.&lt;p&gt;Many still fear that his accession to the throne will cause a constitutional crisis. That mistrust climaxed in the aftermath of the trial of Paul Burrell, Diana’s butler, acquitted after the Queen’s sensational ‘recollection’. In unearthing many secrets surrounding that and many other dramas, Bower’s book, relying on the testimony from over 120 people employed or welcomed into the inner sanctum of Clarence House, reveals a royal household rife with intrigue and misconduct. The result is a book which uniquely will probe into the character and court of the Charles that no one, until now, has seen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Wendy Mitchell had a busy job with the British National Health Service, raised her two daughters alone, and spent her weekends running and climbing mountains. Then, slowly, a mist settled deep inside the mind she once knew so well, blurring the world around her. She didn't know it then, but dementia was starting to take hold. In 2014, at age fifty-eight, she was diagnosed with young-onset Alzheimer's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitchell shares the heartrending story of her cognitive decline and how she has fought to stave it off. What lay ahead of her after the diagnosis was scary and unknowable, but Mitchell was determined and resourceful, and she vowed to outwit the disease for as long as she could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Mitchell learned to embrace her new life, she began to see her condition as a gift, a chance to experience the world with fresh eyes and to find her own way to make a difference. Even now, her sunny outlook persists: She devotes her time to educating doctors, caregivers, and other people living with dementia, helping to reduce the stigma surrounding this insidious disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still living independently, Mitchell now uses Post-it notes and technology to remind her of her routines and has created a "memory room" where she displays photos--with labels--of her daughters, friends, and special places. It is a room where she feels calm and happy, especially on days when the mist descends.</description>

  <description>Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her "head-for-the-hills bag". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Educated&lt;/em&gt; is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From a prize-winning and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author comes a chilling novel of deception under the sun…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jan needs this. She’s flying to Crete to reunite with friends she met there five years ago and relive an idyllic vacation. Basking in the warmth of the sun, the azure sea, and the aura of antiquity, she can once again pretend—for a little while—that she belongs. Her ex-boyfriend Marcus will be among them, but even he doesn’t know the secrets she keeps hidden behind a veil of lies. None of them really know her, and that’s only part of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, how well does she know &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jan awakens in utter darkness, chained to a wall, a manacle around her wrist, her echoing screams only give her a sense of how small her cell is. As she desperately tries to reconstruct what happened and determine who is holding her prisoner, dread covers despair like a hand clamped over her mouth. Because, like the Minotaur in the labyrinth in Greek myth, her captor will be coming back for her, and all the lies will catch up to her…</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a perfectly serviceable beach-read thriller about a group of twenty-somethings who go on holiday to Crete (where "things" happen) and then return as a group 1,000 days later to find that the "things" come back to haunt them. The central character, who is a compulsive liar, tries to piece...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;'I felt something alive moving on my left leg ... when bending my Eyes downwards as much as I could. I perceived it to be a human Creature not six inches high'&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipwrecked and cast adrift, Lemuel Gulliver wakes to find himself on Lilliput, an island inhabited by little people, whose height makes their quarrels over fashion and fame seem ridiculous. His subsequent encounters - with the crude giants of Brobdingnag, the philosophical Houyhnhnms and the brutish Yahoos - give Gulliver new, bitter insights into human behaviour. Swift's savage satire view mankind in a distorted hall of mirrors as a diminished, magnified and finally bestial species, presenting us with an uncompromising reflection of ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This text, based on the first edition of 1726, reproduces all its original illustrations and includes an introduction by Robert Demaria, Jr, which discusses the ways &lt;i&gt;Gulliver's Travels&lt;/i&gt; has been interpreted since its first publication.</description>

  <description>Husband, father, drag queen, sex worker, wife. Sarah Krasnostein's &lt;i&gt;The Trauma Cleaner&lt;/i&gt; is a love letter to an extraordinary ordinary life. In Sandra Pankhurst she discovered a woman capable of taking a lifetime of hostility and transphobic abuse and using it to care for some of society's most in-need people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandra Pankhurst founded her trauma cleaning business to help people whose emotional scars are written on their houses. From the forgotten flat of a drug addict to the infested home of a hoarder, Sandra enters properties and lives at the same time. But few of the people she looks after know anything of the complexity of Sandra's own life. Raised in an uncaring home, Sandra's miraculous gift for warmth and humour in the face of unspeakable personal tragedy mark her out as a one-off.</description>

  <description>Eddie Mair is, by his own account, one of Britain's most beloved broadcasters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born in Dundee, Scotland, he has worked in radio all his adult life. From the foothills of commercial radio in his hometown, through the sunlit uplands of the BBC in Scotland, he has reached the peaks of his profession, with BBC network radio in London. And he's never afraid to work a metaphor beyond endurance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition he's appeared on most of the BBC's TV channels, including ones that are no longer on TV. He witnessed the handover of Hong Kong and once asked Arnold Schwarzenegger a question - though he takes no responsibility for either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nearly twenty years he has been at the helm of Radio 4's PM: a nightly news round up that means Eddie works for just one hour a day, giving him plenty time to knock together these diaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether he's interviewing politicians, getting people to share their personal experiences, or just imparting his favorite zesty chicken recipes, Eddie is never happier than when he is at the microphone. Except when he is at the microphone with a large martini.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In truth, his neediness is an irritation to everyone who knows him and if you buy this book he might get out of their hair.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Keep calm – but do not carry on. &lt;/b&gt;There is nothing remotely inevitable about Brexit – except that it will be deeply damaging if it happens. Extricating Britain from Europe will be the greatest challenge this country has faced since the Second World War. And as negotiations with the EU expose the promises of the Brexit campaign to have been hollow, even some Brexit-voters now wish to exercise their democratic right to change their mind, seeing that the most pragmatic option is to … stop. It would certainly be the best thing for Britain. But &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; can it be done? Haven’t the people spoken?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No. In this indispensable handbook, Nick Clegg categorically debunks the various myths that have been used to force Brexit on Britain, not by ‘the people’ but by a small, extremely rich, self-serving elite, and explains precisely how this historic mistake can be reversed – and what you can do to make sure that it is.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Universal basic income. A 15-hour workweek. Open borders. Does it sound too good to be true? One of Europe's leading young thinkers shows how we can build an ideal world today.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After working all day at jobs we often dislike, we buy things we don't need. Rutger Bregman, a Dutch historian, reminds us it needn't be this way-and in some places it isn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rutger Bregman's TED Talk about universal basic income seemed impossibly radical when he delivered it in 2014. His April 2017 talk continues to make the provocative case, detailing the idea's 500-year history and even its brief success in a forgotten trial in Manitoba in the 1970s. Nearly a million views later, guaranteed basic income is being seriously considered by leading economists and government leaders the world over. It's just one of the many utopian ideas that Bregman proves is possible today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Utopia for Realists &lt;/i&gt;is one of those rare books that takes you by surprise and challenges what you think can happen. From a Canadian city that once completely eradicated poverty, to Richard Nixon's near implementation of a basic income for millions of Americans, Bregman takes us on a journey through history, and beyond the traditional left-right divides, as he champions ideas whose time have come. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every progressive milestone of civilization-from the end of slavery to the beginning of democracy-was once considered a utopian fantasy. Bregman's book, both challenging and bracing, demonstrates that new utopian ideas, like the elimination of poverty and the creation of the fifteen-hour workweek, can become a reality in our lifetime. Being unrealistic and unreasonable can in fact make the impossible inevitable, and it is the only way to build the ideal world.&lt;b&gt;

      <![CDATA[Rutger Bregman (translated by Elizabeth Manton) argues that our societal development has stalled because nobody in politics is promoting "visionary" ideas any more, but rather simply different versions of the same basic model of society.

  <description>Sue Black confronts death every day. As Professor of Anatomy and Forensic Anthropology, she focuses on mortal remains in her lab, at burial sites, at scenes of violence, murder and criminal dismemberment, and when investigating mass fatalities due to war, accident or natural disaster. In All that Remains she reveals the many faces of death she has come to know, using key cases to explore how forensic science has developed, and what her work has taught her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do we expect a book about death to be sad? Macabre? Sue’s book is neither. There is tragedy, but there is also humour in stories as gripping as the best crime novel. Our own death will remain a great unknown. But as an expert witness from the final frontier, Sue Black is the wisest, most reassuring, most compelling of guides.</description>

  <description>Twenty-Five Hundred years ago, Sun Tzu wrote this classic book of military strategy based on Chinese warfare and military thought. Since that time, all levels of military have used the teaching on Sun Tzu to warfare and civilization have adapted these teachings for use in politics, business and everyday life. The Art of War is a book which should be used to gain advantage of opponents in the boardroom and battlefield alike.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;“I’m a barrister, a job which requires the skills of a social worker, relationship counsellor, arm-twister, hostage negotiator, named driver, bus fare-provider, accountant, suicide watchman, coffee-supplier, surrogate parent and, on one memorable occasion, whatever the official term is for someone tasked with breaking the news to a prisoner that his girlfriend has been diagnosed with gonorrhoea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the world of the Secret Barrister. These are the stories of life inside the courtroom. They are sometimes funny, often moving and ultimately life-changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you defend a child-abuser you suspect to be guilty? What do you say to someone sentenced to ten years who you believe to be innocent? What is the law and why do we need it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And why &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; they wear those stupid wigs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the criminals to the lawyers, the victims, witnesses and officers of the law, here is the best and worst of humanity, all struggling within a broken system which would never be off the front pages if the public knew what it was really like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both a searing first-hand account of the human cost of the criminal justice system, and a guide to how we got into this mess, The Secret Barrister wants to show you what it’s really like and why it really matters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>What first prompted prehistoric man, sheltering in the shadows of deep caves, to call upon the realm of the spirits? And why has belief thrived since, shaping thousands of generations of shamans, pharaohs, Aztec priests and Mayan rulers, Jews, Buddhists, Christians, Nazis, and Scientologists?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As our dreams and nightmares have changed over the millennia, so have our beliefs. The gods we created have evolved and mutated with us through a narrative fraught with human sacrifice, political upheaval and bloody wars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Belief was man's most epic labor of invention. It has been our closest companion, and has followed mankind across the continents and through history.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>You've seen it all before. A malicious online rumor costs a company millions. A political sideshow derails the national news cycle and destroys a candidate. Some product or celebrity zooms from total obscurity to viral sensation. What you don't know is that someone is responsible for all this. Usually, someone like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm a media manipulator. In a world where blogs control and distort the news, my job is to control blogs--as much as any one person can. In today's culture...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1) Blogs like "Gawker," "Buzzfeed" and the "Huffington Post" drive the media agenda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2) Bloggers are slaves to money, technology, and deadlines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 3) Manipulators wield these levers to shape everything you read, see and watch--online and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why am I giving away these secrets? Because I'm tired of a world where blogs take indirect bribes, marketers help write the news, reckless journalists spread lies, and no one is accountable for any of it. I'm pulling back the curtain because I don't want anyone else to get blindsided. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to explain exactly how the media "really" works. What you choose to do with this information is up to you.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;The inside, lesser-known story of NASA's boldest and riskiest mission: Apollo 8, mankind's first journey to the Moon on Christmas in 1968. A riveting account of three heroic astronauts who took one of the most dangerous space flights ever, from the &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Shadow Divers.&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In early 1968, the Apollo program was on shaky footing. President Kennedy's end-of-decade deadline to put a man on the Moon was in jeopardy, and the Soviets were threatening to pull ahead in the space race. By August 1968, with its back against the wall, NASA decided to scrap its usual methodical approach and shoot for the heavens. With just four months to prepare--a fraction of the normal time--the agency would send the first men in history to the Moon. In a year of historic violence and discord--the Tet offensive, the assassinations of MLK and RFK, the Chicago DNC riots--the Apollo 8 mission was the boldest test of what America could do. With a focus on astronauts Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders, and their wives and children, this is a vivid, gripping, you-are-there narrative that shows anew the epic danger involved, and the singular bravery it took, for man to leave Earth for the first time--and to arrive at a new world.</description>

  <description>Olive Kitteridge meets Do No Harm in this revealing and intimate interlinked collection of stories set in a hospital, written by a doctor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We wear our secrets openly, like diseases&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The messy truth of a hospital is laid bare in this interlinked collection of stories; not just the bleeps, the blood, the battles, but the hearts beating behind them. A junior doctor makes a moral judgment; a porter waxes lyrical on his invisibility; a patient swims in and out of consciousness. Over the course of one week, each character pulses round the others - a body fighting its own sickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In prose that's tender and refined, doctor and poet Sam Guglani dissects the ordinary moments that make the difference; taking up that tug of war between medicine and faith, love and fear, life and death.</description>

  <description>Married twenty years to Thomas and living in Nashville with their two children, Maggie is drawn ineluctably into a passionate affair while still fiercely committed to her husband and family. What begins as a platonic intellectual and spiritual exchange between writer Maggie and poet James, gradually transforms into an emotional and erotically charged bond that challenges Maggie's sense of loyalty and morality, drawing her deeper into the darkness of desire.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Factfulness:&lt;/i&gt; The stress-reducing habit of only carrying opinions for which you have strong supporting facts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When asked simple questions about global trends—&lt;i&gt;what percentage of the world’s population live in poverty; why the world’s population is increasing; how many girls finish school&lt;/i&gt;—we systematically get the answers wrong. In &lt;i&gt;Factfulness&lt;/i&gt;, Professor of International Health and global TED phenomenon Hans Rosling, together with his two long-time collaborators, Anna and Ola, offers &lt;b&gt;a radical new explanation of why this happens&lt;/b&gt;. They reveal &lt;b&gt;the ten instincts that distort our perspective&lt;/b&gt;—from our tendency to divide the world into two camps (usually some version of &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;) to the way we consume media (where fear rules) to how we perceive progress (believing that most things are getting worse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our problem is that we don’t know what we don’t know, and even our guesses are informed by unconscious and predictable biases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;It turns out that the world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think.&lt;/b&gt; That doesn’t mean there aren’t real concerns. But when we worry about everything all the time instead of embracing a worldview based on facts, we can lose our ability to focus on the things that threaten us most.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;'A highly readable, fascinating book that jerks the debate on religion versus atheism right out of its crusted rut into the light of serious intellectual scrutiny' &lt;i&gt;Observer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A meditation on the importance of atheism in the modern world - and its inadequacies and contradictions - by one of Britain's leading philosophers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'When you explore older atheisms, you will find some of your firmest convictions - secular or religious - are highly questionable. If this prospect disturbs you, what you are looking for may be freedom &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt; thought.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a generation now, public debate has been corroded by a narrow derision of religion in the name of an often very vaguely understood 'science'. John Gray's stimulating and extremely enjoyable new book describes the rich, complex world of the atheist tradition, a tradition which he sees as in many ways as rich as that of religion itself, as well as being deeply intertwined with what is so often crudely viewed as its 'opposite'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is a book that sheds an extraordinary and varied light on what it is to be human and on the thinkers who have, at different times and places, battled to understand this issue.</description>

  <description>Seneca, Lucius Annaeus, born at Corduba (Cordova) ca. 4 BCE, of a prominent and wealthy family, spent an ailing childhood and youth at Rome in an aunt's care. He became famous in rhetoric, philosophy, money-making, and imperial service. After some disgrace during Claudius' reign he became tutor and then, in 54 CE, advising minister to Nero, some of whose worst misdeeds he did not prevent. Involved (innocently?) in a conspiracy, he killed himself by order in 65. Wealthy, he preached indifference to wealth; evader of pain and death, he preached scorn of both; and there were other contrasts between practice and principle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have Seneca's philosophical or moral essays (ten of them traditionally called Dialogues)--on providence, steadfastness, the happy life, anger, leisure, tranquility, the brevity of life, gift-giving, forgiveness-- and treatises on natural phenomena. Also extant are 124 epistles, in which he writes in a relaxed style about moral and ethical questions, relating them to personal experiences; a skit on the official deification of Claudius, "Apocolocyntosis" (in Loeb number 15); and nine rhetorical tragedies on ancient Greek themes. Many epistles and all his speeches are lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His moral essays are collected in Volumes I-III of the Loeb Classical Library's ten-volume edition of Seneca.</description>

  <description>From bestselling, award-winning author Daniel Handler (aka Lemony Snicket), an eagerly anticipated, gutsy, exciting novel that looks honestly at the erotic lives and impulses of an all-too-typical young man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cole is a boy in high school. He runs cross country, he sketches in a sketchbook, he jokes around with friends. But none of this quite matters, next to the allure of sex. &lt;i&gt;Let me put it this way,&lt;/i&gt; he says, &lt;i&gt;Draw a number line, with zero is, you never think about sex, and ten is, it's all you think about, and while you are drawing the line, I am thinking about sex.&lt;/i&gt; Cole fantasizes about whomever he's looking at. He consumes and shares pornography. And he sleeps with a lot of girls--girls who seem to enjoy it at the time and seem to feel bad about it afterwards. Cole is getting a reputation around school--a not quite savory one--which leaves him adrift and hanging out with his best friend. Which is when something startling begins to happen between them--another kind of adventure, unexpected and hot, that might be what he's been after all this time. And then he meets Grisaille. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A companion piece to Handler's &lt;i&gt;Why We Broke Up&lt;/i&gt;, the bestselling Michael J. Printz Honor novel, &lt;i&gt;All The Dirty Parts&lt;/i&gt; is an unblinking take on the varied and ribald world of teenage desire in a culture of unrelenting explicitness and shunted communication, where sex feels like love, but no one knows what love feels like. Structured in short chapters recalling Jenny Offill's &lt;i&gt;Dept. of Speculation&lt;/i&gt; or Mary Robison's &lt;i&gt;Why Did I Ever&lt;/i&gt;, the novel gives us a tender, brutal, funny, and always intoxicating portrait of an age in which the whole world is tilted through the lens of sex. "There are love stories galore," Cole tells us, "and we all know them. This isn't that. The story I'm typing is all the dirty parts."</description>

  <description>In 2007, a short blogpost on Valleywag, the Silicon Valley-vertical of Gawker Media, outed PayPal founder and billionaire investor Peter Thiel as gay. Thiel's sexuality had been known to close friends and family, but he didn't consider himself a public figure, and believed the information was private.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This post would be the casus belli for a meticulously plotted conspiracy that would end nearly a decade later with a $140 million dollar judgment against Gawker, its bankruptcy and with Nick Denton, Gawker's CEO and founder, out of a job. Only later would the world learn that Gawker's demise was not incidental--it had been masterminded by Thiel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, Thiel had searched endlessly for a solution to what he'd come to call the "Gawker Problem." When an unmarked envelope delivered an illegally recorded sex tape of Hogan with his best friend's wife, Gawker had seen the chance for millions of pageviews and to say the things that others were afraid to say. Thiel saw their publication of the tape as the opportunity he was looking for. He would come to pit Hogan against Gawker in a multi-year proxy war through the Florida legal system, while Gawker remained confidently convinced they would prevail as they had over so many other lawsuit--until it was too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict would stun the world and so would Peter's ultimate unmasking as the man who had set it all in motion. Why had he done this? How had no one discovered it? What would this mean--for the First Amendment? For privacy? For culture?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Holiday's masterful telling of this nearly unbelievable conspiracy, informed by interviews with all the key players, this case transcends the narrative of how one billionaire took down a media empire or the current state of the free press. It's a study in power, strategy, and one of the most wildly ambitious--and successful--secret plots in recent memory.</description>

  <description>George Horace Lorimer (1869-1937) was born in Louisville, Kentucky. He attended Moseley High School in Chicago, Colby College, and Yale University. In 1899 he became editor-in-chief of The Saturday Evening Post, and remained in charge until his death. He served also as vice president, president, and chairman of Curtis Publishing Company, which published the Post. The remains of Lorimer's estate in Wyncote, Pennsylvania are now the campus of Ancillae Assumpta Academy. Most of Lorimer Park, a 213-acre public park located in Abington Township, Pennsylvania, was a bequest from the Lorimer family to the citizens of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. His works include: Letters from a Self-Made Merchant to His Son (1902), Old Gorgon Graham: More Letters from a Self-Made Merchant to His Son (1903), The False Gods (1906) and Jack Spurlock, Prodigal (1908).</description>

  <description>In 2008, Marion Coutts' husband, the art critic Tom Lubbock, was diagnosed with a brain tumour, and told that he had not more than two years to live. The tumour was located in the area of the brain that controls speech and language, and would eventually rob him of the ability to speak. Tom was 53 when he died, leaving Marion and their son Eugene, just two years old, alone. In short bursts of beautiful, textured prose, Coutts describes the eighteen months leading up to Tom's death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Iceberg is an unflinching, honest exploration of staring death in the face, finding solace in strange places, finding beauty and even joy in the experience of dying. Written with extraordinary narrative force and power, it is almost shocking in its rawness. Nothing is kept from the reader: the fury, the occasional spells of selfishness, the indignity of being trapped in a hopeless situation. It is a story of pain and sadness, but also an uplifting and life-affirming tale of great fortitude, courage, determination – and above all, love.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"You have the luck of Croesus on stilts (as my Auntie Vi would have said) if you’ve had the sort of career, ups and downs, warts and all that I have in that wondrous little corner of show business called musical theatre."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most successful and distinguished artists of our time, Andrew Lloyd Webber has reigned over the musical theatre world for nearly five decades. The winner of numerous awards, including multiple Tonys and an Oscar, Lloyd Webber has enchanted millions worldwide with his music and numerous hit shows, including &lt;em&gt;Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita, Cats, The Phantom of the Opera&lt;/em&gt;—Broadway’s longest running show—and most recently, &lt;em&gt;School of Rock&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Unmasked&lt;/em&gt;, written in his own inimitable, quirky voice, the revered, award-winning composer takes stock of his achievements, the twists of fate and circumstance which brought him both success and disappointment, and the passions that inspire and sustain him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The son of a music professor and a piano teacher, Lloyd Webber reveals his artistic influences, from his idols Rodgers and Hammerstein and the perfection of &lt;em&gt;South Pacific&lt;/em&gt;’s “Some Enchanted Evening,” to the pop and rock music of the 1960s and Puccini’s &lt;em&gt;Tosca&lt;/em&gt;, to P. G. Wodehouse and T. S. Eliot. Lloyd Webber recalls his bohemian London youth, reminiscing about the happiest place of his childhood, his homemade Harrington Pavilion—a make-believe world of musical theatre in which he created his earliest entertainments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A record of several exciting and turbulent decades of British and American musical theatre and the transformation of popular music itself, &lt;em&gt;Unmasked&lt;/em&gt; is ultimately a chronicle of artistic creation. Lloyd Webber looks back at the development of some of his most famous works and illuminates his collaborations with luminaries such as Tim Rice, Robert Stigwood, Harold Prince, Cameron Mackintosh, and Trevor Nunn. Taking us behind the scenes of his productions, Lloyd Webber reveals fascinating details about each show, including the rich cast of characters involved with making them, and the creative and logistical challenges and artistic political battles that ensued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lloyd Webber shares his recollections of the works that have become cultural touchstones for generations of fans: writings songs for a school production that would become his first hit, &lt;em&gt;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&lt;/em&gt;; finding the coterie of performers for his classic rock opera &lt;em&gt;Jesus Christ Superstar&lt;/em&gt;; developing his first megahit, &lt;em&gt;Evita&lt;/em&gt;, which would win seven Tonys Awards, including Best Musical; staking his reputation and fortune on the groundbreaking &lt;em&gt;Cats;&lt;/em&gt; and making history with the dazzling &lt;em&gt;The Phantom of the Opera. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reflecting a life that included many passions (from architecture to Turkish Swimming Cats), full of witty and revealing anecdotes, and featuring cameo appearances by numerous celebrities—Elaine Paige, Sarah Brightman, David Frost, Julie Covington, Judi Dench, Richard Branson, A.R. Rahman, Mandy Patinkin, Patti LuPone, Richard Rodgers, Norman Jewison, Milos Forman, Plácido Domingo, Barbra Streisand, Michael Crawford, Gillian Lynne, Betty Buckley, and more—&lt;em&gt;Unmasked&lt;/em&gt; at last reveals the true face of the extraordinary man beneath the storied legend.</description>

  <description>Don Tillman and Rosie Jarman are back. The Wife Project is complete, and Don and Rosie are happily married and living in New York. But they're about to face a new challenge because - surprise - Rosie is pregnant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don sets about learning the protocols of becoming a father, but his unusual research style gets him into trouble with the law. Fortunately his best friend Gene is on hand to offer advice: he's left Claudia and moved in with Don and Rosie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Don tries to schedule time for pregnancy research, getting Gene and Claudia to reconcile, servicing the industrial refrigeration unit that occupies half his apartment, helping Dave the Baseball Fan save his business, and staying on the right side of Lydia the social worker, he almost misses the biggest problem of all: he might lose Rosie when she needs him the most.</description>

  <description>This is the unmissable inside story of the most dramatic general election campaign in modern history and Theresa May’s battle for a Brexit deal – the greatest challenge for a prime minister since the Second World War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Out&lt;/em&gt; tells of how a leader famed for her caution battled her bitterly divided cabinet at home while facing duplicitous Brussels bureaucrats abroad. Of how she then took the biggest gamble of her career to strengthen her position – and promptly blew it. It is also a tale of treachery where – in the hour of her greatest weakness – one by one, May’s colleagues began to plot against her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside this book you will find all the strategy, comedy, tragedy and farce of modern politics – where principle, passion and vaulting ambition collide in the corridors of power. It chronicles a civil war at the heart of the Conservative Party and a Labour Party back from the dead, led by Jeremy Corbyn, who defied the experts and the critics on his own side to mount an unlikely tilt at the top job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With access to all the key players, Tim Shipman has written a political history that reads like a thriller, exploring how and why the EU referendum result pitched Britain into a year of political mayhem.</description>

  <description>With extraordinary access to the West Wing, Michael Wolff reveals what happened behind-the-scenes in the first nine months of the most controversial presidency of our time in &lt;i&gt;Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, the country―and the world―has witnessed a stormy, outrageous, and absolutely mesmerizing presidential term that reflects the volatility and fierceness of the man elected Commander-in-Chief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This riveting and explosive account of Trump’s administration provides a wealth of new details about the chaos in the Oval Office, including:&lt;br /&gt;-- What President Trump’s staff really thinks of him&lt;br /&gt;-- What inspired Trump to claim he was wire-tapped by President Obama&lt;br /&gt;-- Why FBI director James Comey was really fired&lt;br /&gt;-- Why chief strategist Steve Bannon and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner couldn’t be in the same room&lt;br /&gt;-- Who is really directing the Trump administration’s strategy in the wake of Bannon’s firing&lt;br /&gt;-- What the secret to communicating with Trump is&lt;br /&gt;-- What the Trump administration has in common with the movie The Producers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never before in history has a presidency so divided the American people. Brilliantly reported and astoundingly fresh, &lt;i&gt;Fire and Fury&lt;/i&gt; shows us how and why Donald Trump has become the king of discord and disunion.</description>

  <description>Romanen åpner med en svimlende beskrivelse av døden. Derfra fortelles det om forfatteren Karl Ove Knausgårds kamp for å mestre livet og seg selv og sine egne ambisjoner på skrivingens vegne, i møte med de menneskene han har rundt seg. Min kamp. Første bok utforsker det å vokse opp og være overgitt en verden som ser ut til å være komplett, avsluttet, lukket. Romanen beskriver det unge blikkets varhet og usikkerhet, der det registrerer andre menneskers tilstedeværelse og vurderinger med en åpenhet som er voldsom og nesten selvutslettende i sin konsekvens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I en borende prosa som oppsøker det sårbare, det pinlige og det eksistensielt betydningsbærende, blir dette en dypt personlig roman, selvutprøvende og kontroversiell. Et eksistensielt omdreiningspunkt er farens død, et annet er kanskje hovedpersonens debut som forfatter.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A lively history seen through the fifty inventions that shaped it most profoundly, by the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Undercover Economist&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Messy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Who thought up paper money? What was the secret element that made the Gutenberg printing press possible? And what is the connection between &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt; and the collapse of Lehman Brothers? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fifty Inventions That Shaped the Modern Economy&lt;/i&gt; paints an epic picture of change in an intimate way by telling the stories of the tools, people, and ideas that had far-reaching consequences for all of us. From the plough to artificial intelligence, from Gillette’s disposable razor to IKEA’s Billy bookcase, bestselling author and &lt;i&gt;Financial Times&lt;/i&gt; columnist Tim Harford recounts each invention’s own curious, surprising, and memorable story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invention by invention, Harford reflects on how we got here and where we might go next. He lays bare often unexpected connections: how the bar code undermined family corner stores, and why the gramophone widened inequality. In the process, he introduces characters who developed some of these inventions, profited from them, and were ruined by them, as he traces the principles that helped explain their transformative effects. The result is a wise and witty book of history, economics, and biography.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the #1 international best seller &lt;i&gt;The Girl in the Spider's Web:&lt;/i&gt; the new book in the Millennium series, which began with Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisbeth Salander - the girl with the dragon tattoo, the brilliant hacker, the obstinate outsider, the volatile seeker of justice for herself and others - has never been able to uncover the most telling facts of her traumatic childhood, the secrets that might finally, fully explain her to herself. Now, when she sees a chance to uncover them once and for all, she enlists the help of Mikael Blomkvist, the editor of the muckraking, investigative journal &lt;i&gt;Millennium&lt;/i&gt;. And nothing will stop her - not the anti-Muslim gang she enrages by rescuing a young woman from their brutality; not the deadly reach from inside the Russian mafia of her long-lost twin sister, Camilla; and not the people who will do anything to keep buried knowledge of a sinister pseudo-scientific experiment known only as The Registry. Once again, Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist, together, are the fierce heart of a thrilling full-tilt novel that takes on some of the most insidious problems facing the world at this very moment.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Mary Shelley&lt;/b&gt; began writing &lt;i&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/i&gt; when she was only eighteen. At once a Gothic thriller, a passionate romance, and a cautionary tale about the dangers of science, &lt;i&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of committed science student Victor Frankenstein. Obsessed with discovering the cause of generation and life and bestowing animation upon lifeless matter, Frankenstein assembles a human being from stolen body parts but; upon bringing it to life, he recoils in horror at the creature's hideousness. Tormented by isolation and loneliness, the once-innocent creature turns to evil and unleashes a campaign of murderous revenge against his creator, Frankenstein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/i&gt;, an instant bestseller and an important ancestor of both the horror and science fiction genres, not only tells a terrifying story, but also raises profound, disturbing questions about the very nature of life and the place of humankind within the cosmos: What does it mean to be human? What responsibilities do we have to each other? How far can we go in tampering with Nature? In our age, filled with news of organ donation genetic engineering, and bio-terrorism, these questions are more relevant than ever.</description>

  <description>Auteur de nombreuses biographies (Fouché, Balzac, Marie­-Antoinette, Magellan,... ), Stefan Zweig dresse avec psychologie le portrait d'un homme libre et tolérant. Alors qu'il fuit la guerre dans le lointain Brésil, Stefan Zweig cherche dans l'œuvre de Montaigne à soulager son désespoir, mais aussi dans l'expérience vécue d'un homme qui se trouva dans une situation proche de la sienne. &lt;br /&gt;"Montaigne a fait la tentative la plus difficile qui soit sur Terre : vivre par soi­-même, être libre et le devenir toujours plus..."</description>

  <description>From the Booker Prize-winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Remains of the Day&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;When We Were Orphans&lt;/i&gt;, comes an unforgettable edge-of-your-seat mystery that is at once heartbreakingly tender and morally courageous about what it means to be human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hailsham seems like a pleasant English boarding school, far from the influences of the city. Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it’s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Never Let Me Go&lt;/i&gt; breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date.</description>

  <description>A deliciously funny novella that celebrates the pleasure of reading. When the Queen in pursuit of her wandering corgis stumbles upon a mobile library she feels duty bound to borrow a book. Aided by Norman, a young man from the palace kitchen who frequents the library, the Queen is transformed as she discovers the liberating pleasures of the written word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author of the Tony Award winner The History Boys, Alan Bennett is one of Britain’s best-loved literary voices. With The Uncommon Reader, he brings us a playful homage to the written word, imagining a world in which literature becomes a subversive bridge between powerbrokers and commoners. By turns cheeky and charming, the novella features the Queen herself as its protagonist. When her yapping corgis lead her to a mobile library, Her Majesty develops a new obsession with reading. She finds herself devouring works by a tantalizing range of authors, from the Brontë sisters to Jean Genet. With a young member of the palace kitchen staff guiding her choices, it’s not long before the Queen begins to develop a new perspective on the world - one that alarms her closest advisers and tempts her to make bold new decisions. Brimming with the mischievous wit that has garnered acclaim for Bennett on both sides of the Atlantic, The Uncommon Reader is a delightful celebration of books and writers, and the readers who sustain them.</description>

  <description>With H.G. Wells’ other novels, &lt;i&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/i&gt; was one of the first and greatest works of science fiction ever to be written. Even long before man had learned to fly, H.G. Wells wrote this story of the Martian attack on England. These unearthly creatures arrive in huge cylinders, from which they escape as soon as the metal is cool. The first falls near Woking and is regarded as a curiosity rather than a danger until the Martians climb out of it and kill many of the gaping crowd with a Heat-Ray. These unearthly creatures have heads four feet in diameter and colossal round bodies, and by manipulating two terrifying machines – the Handling Machine and the Fighting Machine – they are as versatile as humans and at the same time insuperable. They cause boundless destruction. The inhabitants of the Earth are powerless against them, and it looks as if the end of the World has come. But there is one factor which the Martians, in spite of their superior intelligence, have not reckoned on. It is this which brings about a miraculous conclusion to this famous work of the imagination.</description>

However, I used to listen to Jeff Wayne's musical version quite a lot, and when 'Forever Autumn' turned up on a playlist last week, I thought it was perhaps time to give the original a try. I don't think I've seen...]]>

  <description>Nobel laureate Richard H. Thaler has spent his career studying the radical notion that the central agents in the economy are humans—predictable, error-prone individuals. &lt;em&gt;Misbehaving&lt;/em&gt; is his arresting, frequently hilarious account of the struggle to bring an academic discipline back down to earth—and change the way we think about economics, ourselves, and our world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traditional economics assumes rational actors. Early in his research, Thaler realized these Spock-like automatons were nothing like real people. Whether buying a clock radio, selling basketball tickets, or applying for a mortgage, we all succumb to biases and make decisions that deviate from the standards of rationality assumed by economists. In other words, we misbehave. More importantly, our misbehavior has serious consequences. Dismissed at first by economists as an amusing sideshow, the study of human miscalculations and their effects on markets now drives efforts to make better decisions in our lives, our businesses, and our governments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coupling recent discoveries in human psychology with a practical understanding of incentives and market behavior, Thaler enlightens readers about how to make smarter decisions in an increasingly mystifying world. He reveals how behavioral economic analysis opens up new ways to look at everything from household finance to assigning faculty offices in a new building, to TV game shows, the NFL draft, and businesses like Uber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laced with antic stories of Thaler’s spirited battles with the bastions of traditional economic thinking, &lt;em&gt;Misbehaving&lt;/em&gt; is a singular look into profound human foibles. When economics meets psychology, the implications for individuals, managers, and policy makers are both profound and entertaining.</description>

  <description>Once considered tedious, the field of statistics is rapidly evolving into a discipline Hal Varian, chief economist at Google, has actually called “sexy.” From batting averages and political polls to game shows and medical research, the real-world application of statistics continues to grow by leaps and bounds. How can we catch schools that cheat on standardized tests? How does Netflix know which movies you’ll like? What is causing the rising incidence of autism? As best-selling author Charles Wheelan shows us in &lt;em&gt;Naked Statistics&lt;/em&gt;, the right data and a few well-chosen statistical tools can help us answer these questions and more.&lt;br /&gt;For those who slept through Stats 101, this book is a lifesaver. Wheelan strips away the arcane and technical details and focuses on the underlying intuition that drives statistical analysis. He clarifies key concepts such as inference, correlation, and regression analysis, reveals how biased or careless parties can manipulate or misrepresent data, and shows us how brilliant and creative researchers are exploiting the valuable data from natural experiments to tackle thorny questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in Wheelan’s trademark style, there’s not a dull page in sight. You’ll encounter clever Schlitz Beer marketers leveraging basic probability, an International Sausage Festival illuminating the tenets of the central limit theorem, and a head-scratching choice from the famous game show &lt;em&gt;Let’s Make a Deal&lt;/em&gt;—and you’ll come away with insights each time. With the wit, accessibility, and sheer fun that turned &lt;em&gt;Naked Economics&lt;/em&gt; into a bestseller, Wheelan defies the odds yet again by bringing another essential, formerly unglamorous discipline to life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The dazzling second novel in Ali Smith's essential Seasonal Quartet — from the Baileys Prize-winning, Man Booker-shortlisted author of &lt;i&gt;Autumn&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;How to be both&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter? Bleak. Frosty wind, earth as iron, water as stone, so the old song goes. The shortest days, the longest nights. The trees are bare and shivering. The summer's leaves? Dead litter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world shrinks; the sap sinks. &lt;br /&gt;But winter makes things visible. And if there's ice, there'll be fire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Ali Smith's &lt;i&gt;Winter&lt;/i&gt;, lifeforce matches up to the toughest of the seasons. In this second novel in her acclaimed Seasonal cycle, the follow-up to her sensational &lt;i&gt;Autumn&lt;/i&gt;, Smith's shape-shifting quartet of novels casts a merry eye over a bleak post-truth era with a story rooted in history, memory and warmth, its taproot deep in the evergreens: art, love, laughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the season that teaches us survival. &lt;br /&gt;Here comes &lt;i&gt;Winter&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>MURDER IN THE YOGA STORE is the true story of the brutal killing of a beautiful young woman at a chic Lululemon yoga-wear shop. The grisly murder was committed on a pleasant Friday night in upscale Bethesda, Maryland, a leafy suburb of Washington, D.C. In this riveting narrative by veteran journalist Peter Ross Range, the author for the first time brings together the tale of what really happened in the yoga store murder. He portrays the personalities of both victim and murderer, along with the strange and convoluted circumstances of the crime and its cover-up. Range meticulously exposes layer upon layer of deceit and confusion. His account builds the tension of the police investigation until the real story, so odd and creepy, takes your breath away. The drama of the murder trial is a moving emotional roller coaster built around the prosecutors, the detectives and the family of the victim.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first sleep book by a leading scientific expert—Professor Matthew Walker, Director of UC Berkeley’s Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab—reveals his groundbreaking exploration of sleep, explaining how we can harness its transformative power to change our lives for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleep is one of the most important but least understood aspects of our life, wellness, and longevity. Until very recently, science had no answer to the question of why we sleep, or what good it served, or why we suffer such devastating health consequences when we don't sleep. Compared to the other basic drives in life—eating, drinking, and reproducing—the purpose of sleep remained elusive.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; An explosion of scientific discoveries in the last twenty years has shed new light on this fundamental aspect of our lives. Now, preeminent neuroscientist and sleep expert Matthew Walker gives us a new understanding of the vital importance of sleep and dreaming. Within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize, and make logical decisions. It recalibrates our emotions, restocks our immune system, fine-tunes our metabolism, and regulates our appetite. Dreaming mollifies painful memories and creates a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge to inspire creativity.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Walker answers important questions about sleep: how do caffeine and alcohol affect sleep? What really happens during REM sleep? Why do our sleep patterns change across a lifetime? How do common sleep aids affect us and can they do long-term damage? Charting cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, and synthesizing decades of research and clinical practice, Walker explains how we can harness sleep to improve learning, mood, and energy levels; regulate hormones; prevent cancer, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes; slow the effects of aging; increase longevity; enhance the education and lifespan of our children, and boost the efficiency, success, and productivity of our businesses. Clear-eyed, fascinating, and accessible, &lt;i&gt;Why We Sleep&lt;/i&gt; is a crucial and illuminating book.</description>

  <description>Set in the bleak Fen Country of East Anglia, and spanning some 240 years in the lives of its haunted narrator and his ancestors, &lt;b&gt;Waterland&lt;/b&gt; is a book that takes in eels and incest, ale-making and madness, the heartless sweep of history and a family romance as tormented as any in Greek tragedy.</description>

  <description>Stephen Lewis, a successful writer of children's books, is confronted with the unthinkable: his only child, three-year-old Kate, is snatched from him in a supermarket. In one horrifying moment that replays itself over the years that follow, Stephen realizes his daughter is gone. With extraordinary tenderness and insight, Booker Prize–winning author Ian McEwan takes us into the dark territory of a marriage devastated by the loss of a child. Kate's absence sets Stephen and his wife, Julie, on diverging paths as they each struggle with a grief that only seems to intensify with the passage of time. Eloquent and passionate, the novel concludes in a triumphant scene of love and hope that gives full rein to the author's remarkable gifts. The winner of the Whitbread Prize, &lt;b&gt;The Child in Time&lt;/b&gt; is an astonishing novel by one of the finest writers of his generation.</description>

  <description>In 1995, at the age of 42, Robert McCrum suffered a dramatic and near-fatal stroke, the subject of his acclaimed memoir My Year Off. Ever since that life-changing event, McCrum has lived in the shadow of death, unavoidably aware of his own mortality. And now, 21 years on, he is noticing a change: his friends are joining him there. Death has become his contemporaries' every third thought. The question is no longer "Who am I?" but "How long have I got?" and "What happens next?" This book takes us on a journey through a year and towards death itself. As he acknowledges his own and his friends' aging, McCrum confronts an existential question: in a world where we have learnt to live well at all costs, can we make peace with what Freud calls "the necessity of dying?" Searching for answers leads him to others for advice and wisdom, and this book is populated by the voices of brain surgeons, psychologists, cancer patients, hospice workers, writers and poets. Witty, lucid and provocative, this book is an enthralling exploration of what it means to approach the "end game," and begin to recognize, perhaps reluctantly, that we are not immortal.</description>

  <description>It’s time to move “doing nothing” to the top of your to-do list.&lt;br /&gt;In 2015, Manoush Zomorodi, host of WNYC’s popular podcast and radio show 'Note To Self' led tens of thousands of listeners through an experiment to help them unplug from their devices, get bored, jumpstart their creativity, and change their lives. Bored and Brilliant builds on that experiment to show us how to rethink our gadget use to live better and smarter in this new digital ecosystem. Manoush explains the connection between boredom and original thinking, exploring how we can harness boredom’s hidden benefits to become our most productive and creative selves without totally abandoning our gadgets in the process.&lt;br /&gt;Grounding the book in the neuroscience and cognitive psychology of “mind wandering”—what our brains do when we’re doing nothing at all—Manoush includes practical steps you can take to ease the nonstop busyness and enhance your ability to dream, wonder, and gain clarity in your work and life. The outcome is mind-blowing. Unplug and read on.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I’ve often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net. Now I’m letting my guard down.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; —Hillary Rodham Clinton, from the introduction of &lt;i&gt;What Happened&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, Hillary Rodham Clinton reveals what she was thinking and feeling during one of the most controversial and unpredictable presidential elections in history. Now free from the constraints of running, Hillary takes you inside the intense personal experience of becoming the first woman nominated for president by a major party in an election marked by rage, sexism, exhilarating highs and infuriating lows, stranger-than-fiction twists, Russian interference, and an opponent who broke all the rules. This is her most personal memoir yet.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In these pages, she describes what it was like to run against Donald Trump, the mistakes she made, how she has coped with a shocking and devastating loss, and how she found the strength to pick herself back up afterward. With humor and candor, she tells readers what it took to get back on her feet—the rituals, relationships, and reading that got her through, and what the experience has taught her about life. She speaks about the challenges of being a strong woman in the public eye, the criticism over her voice, age, and appearance, and the double standard confronting women in politics.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She lays out how the 2016 election was marked by an unprecedented assault on our democracy by a foreign adversary. By analyzing the evidence and connecting the dots, Hillary shows just how dangerous the forces are that shaped the outcome, and why Americans need to understand them to protect our values and our democracy in the future.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The election of 2016 was unprecedented and historic. &lt;i&gt;What Happened &lt;/i&gt;is the story of that campaign and its aftermath—both a deeply intimate account and a cautionary tale for the nation.</description>

  <description>When you see your nation’s flag fluttering in the breeze, what do you feel?&lt;br /&gt;For thousands of years flags have represented our hopes and dreams. We wave them. Burn them. March under their colours. And still, in the 21st century, we die for them. Flags fly at the UN, on the Arab street, from front porches in Texas. They represent the politics of high power as well as the politics of the mob.&lt;br /&gt;From the renewed sense of nationalism in China, to troubled identities in Europe and the USA, to the terrifying rise of Islamic State, the world is a confusing place right now and we need to understand the symbols, old and new, that people are rallying round.&lt;br /&gt;In nine chapters (covering the USA, UK, Europe, Middle East, Asia, Africa, Latin America, international flags and flags of terror), Tim Marshall draws on more than twenty-five years of global reporting experience to reveal the histories, the power and the politics of the symbols that unite us – and divide us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Full of sharp analysis and a very entertaining read”&lt;/i&gt; — &lt;b&gt;Andrew Neil&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“A fascinating tour of the world’s ensigns, their histories and meanings … a sobering lesson in just how silly we human beings can be” – &lt;b&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Insightful and entertaining ... a truly fascinating book that feels all the more considered and urgent in today's world of Brexit, Trump, China and ISIS"&lt;/i&gt; -- &lt;b&gt;Dan Lewis, &lt;i&gt;Wanderlust&lt;/i&gt; magazine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Marshall points out that we often forget the aggressive symbolism of established flags ... [they] are a quick, visual way of communicating loyalties, power and ideas"&lt;/i&gt; -- &lt;b&gt;Robbie Millen, &lt;i&gt;The Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"An engagingly written, veritable page-turner. Whether the topic is ethnic identity, Japanese imperialism, Panamanian shipping law or the defeat of Nazism, flags speak volumes about our human condition"&lt;/i&gt; -- &lt;b&gt;Lawrence Joffe, &lt;i&gt;Jewish Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"In today's globalised and media savvy environment, the role of state and non-state symbols has become more important and in many cases more dangerous and evocative. This witty book brings to our attention this power, alongside the reality that we must not underestimate or misunderstand how the flags of our world came to be. A must read for anyone wishing to grasp the meanings behind today's international affairs." &lt;/i&gt;-- &lt;b&gt;Human Security Centre&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>In the bestselling tradition of &lt;i&gt;Why Nations Fail&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Revenge of Geography&lt;/i&gt;, an award-winning journalist uses ten maps of crucial regions to explain the geo-political strategies of the world powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All leaders of nations are constrained by geography. Their choices are limited by mountains, rivers, seas, and concrete. To understand world events, news organizations and other authorities often focus on people, ideas, and political movements, but without geography, we never have the full picture. Now, in the relevant and timely &lt;i&gt;Prisoners of Geography&lt;/i&gt;, seasoned journalist Tim Marshall examines Russia, China, the USA, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Japan and Korea, and Greenland and the Arctic—their weather, seas, mountains, rivers, deserts, and borders—to provide a context often missing from our political reportage: how the physical characteristics of these countries affect their strengths and vulnerabilities and the decisions made by their leaders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In ten, up-to-date maps of each region, Marshall explains in clear and engaging prose the complex geo-political strategies of these key parts of the globe. What does it mean that Russia must have a navy, but also has frozen ports six months a year? How does this affect Putin’s treatment of Ukraine? How is China’s future constrained by its geography? Why will Europe never be united? Why will America never be invaded? Shining a light on the unavoidable physical realities that shape all of our aspirations and endeavors, &lt;i&gt;Prisoners of Geography&lt;/i&gt; is the critical guide to one of the major (and most often overlooked) determining factors in world history.</description>

  <description>Eric Erickson was the most important American spy of World War II. He also had a secret to keep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1942, the Brooklyn-born Erickson was a millionaire oil mogul who volunteered for a dangerous mission inside the Third Reich: locating the top-secret synthetic oil plants that kept the German war machine running. To fool the Nazis, Erickson played the role of a collaborator. He hung a portrait of Hitler in his apartment and “disowned” his Jewish best friend, then flew to Berlin, where he charmed Himmler and signed lucrative oil deals with the architects of the Final Solution. All the while, he was visiting the oil refineries and passing their coordinates to Allied Bomber Command, who destroyed the plants in a series of B-17 raids, helping to end the war early. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the war, Erickson's was revealed as a secret agent and received the Medal of Freedom for his bravery. William Holden even played him in a hit Hollywood movie. For a brief moment in the early '60s, Erickson was the most famous spy in the world. His secret? He hadn't played a Nazi collaborator. He'd actually been one - a war profiteer who'd made millions of trading with Hitler before having a change of heart. Black-listed by the Allies and disowned by his family, Erickson had volunteered for the spy mission in order to redeem himself, and ended up saving thousands of Allied lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on newly-discovered archives in Sweden, The Secret Agent is a riveting piece of narrative nonfiction that tells the true story of Erickson's remarkable life for the first time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Stephan Talty is the author of five acclaimed non-fiction books, including Agent Garbo: The Brilliant, Eccentric Spy Who Tricked Hitler and Saved D-Day. He's written for the New York Times Magazine, GQ, Men's Journal and many other publications.</description>

  <description>Rules for being a man:&lt;br /&gt;Don't Cry; Love Sport; Play Rough; Drink Beer; Don't Talk About Feelings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Robert Webb has been wondering for some time now: are those rules actually any use? To anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking back over his life, from schoolboy crushes (on girls and boys) to discovering the power of making people laugh (in the Cambridge Footlights with David Mitchell), and from losing his beloved mother to becoming a husband and father, Robert Webb considers the absurd expectations boys and men have thrust upon them at every stage of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hilarious and heartbreaking, How Not To Be a Boy explores the relationships that made Robert who he is as a man, the lessons we learn as sons and daughters, and the understanding that sometimes you aren't the Luke Skywalker of your life - you're actually Darth Vader.</description>

  <description>Around the world, populist movements are gaining traction among the white working class. Meanwhile, the professional elite—journalists, managers, and establishment politicians—is on the outside looking in, and left to argue over the reasons why. In &lt;i&gt;White Working Class&lt;/i&gt;, Joan C. Williams, described as “something approaching rock star status” in her field by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, explains why so much of the elite’s analysis of the white working class is misguided, rooted in assumptions by what she has controversially coined “class cluelessness.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Williams explains how most analysts, and the corresponding media coverage, have conflated “working class” with “poor.” All too often, white working class motivations have been dismissed as simply racism or xenophobia. Williams explains how the term “working class” has been misapplied—it is, in fact, the elusive, purportedly disappearing middle class. This demographic often resents both the poor and the professionals. They don’t, however, tend to resent the truly rich, nor are they particularly bothered by income inequality. Their dream is not to join the upper middle class, with its different culture, but to stay true to their own values in their own communities—just with more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;White Working Class&lt;/i&gt; is a blunt, bracing narrative that sketches a nuanced portrait of millions of people throughout the world who have proven to be a potent political force. For anyone stunned by the rise in populist, nationalist movements, wondering why so many would seemingly vote against their own economic interests or simply feeling like a stranger in their own country, &lt;i&gt;White Working Class&lt;/i&gt; will be a convincing primer on how to connect with a crucial set of workers—and voters.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>“Most of what I know about myself, I have learned from playing Schumann.”&lt;br /&gt;—Jonathan Biss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World famous pianist Jonathan Biss has had a special relationship with composer Robert Schumann since he was a child. Avoiding traditional biography and dense musical criticism, Biss writes a moving tribute to one of the most vulnerable composers in classical music history in his second Kindle Single: A Pianist Under the Influence. Biss's first Kindle Single, Beethoven's Shadow, has been a bestseller on Amazon since its release in December 2011.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Pianist Under the Influence reflects on Biss's life-long, intense, multi-layered relationship with the composer's music and historical treatment. As Biss writes from the unique position of performer, scholar and fan, his Single is both a personal and professional love-letter to the 19th century composer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An engaging read for anyone interested in the creative process, the Single also includes an annotated audio guide for readers who wish to delve further into the material. A Pianist Under the Influence is an important aspect of Biss's 2012-2013 focus on Schumann, during which Biss and several hand-picked collaborators will perform Schumann's work, music by his notable influences such as Beethoven, Schubert, and Purcell, and selections from his long list of successors ranging from Berg and Janáček to 26-year-old composer Timothy Andres. At the core of the project is four sets of concerts, curated by Biss, including series at Wigmore Hall, the Concertgebouw, Carnegie Hall and San Francisco Performances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan Biss has appeared with the foremost orchestras of North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Widely regarded known not only for his artistry and poetic interpretations but also for his deep musical curiosity, Biss performs a diverse repertoire ranging from Mozart and Beethoven, through the Romantics to Janáček and Schoenberg as well as works by contemporary composers such as Gyorgy Kurtág and including commissions from Leon Kirchner, Lewis Spratian and Bernard Rands. Biss has a noted recording career. His recordings include an album of Schubert sonatas and two short Kurtág pieces that was named by NPR Music as one of the best albums of the year. In January 2012, Onyx Classics released the first CD in a nine-year, nine-disc recording cycle of Beethoven's complete sonatas. The second album of Beethoven sonatas will release in January 2013. Biss studied at Indiana University and at The Curtis Institute of Music, where he was appointed to the piano faculty in 2010.</description>

  <description>Grayson Perry has been thinking about masculinity - what it is, how it operates, why little boys are thought to be made of slugs and snails - since he was a boy. Now, in this funny and necessary book, he turns round to look at men with a clear eye and ask, what sort of men would make the world a better place, for everyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would happen if we rethought the old, macho, outdated version of manhood, and embraced a different idea of what makes a man? Apart from giving up the coronary-inducing stress of always being 'right' and the vast new wardrobe options, the real benefit might be that a newly fitted masculinity will allow men to have better relationships - and that's happiness, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grayson Perry admits he's not immune from the stereotypes himself - as the psychoanalysts say, 'if you spot it, you've got it' - and his thoughts on everything from power to physical appearance, from emotions to a brand new Manifesto for Men, are shot through with honesty, tenderness and the belief that, for everyone to benefit, upgrading masculinity has to be something men decide to do themselves. They have nothing to lose but their hang-ups.</description>

  <description>Essential, required reading for doctors and patients alike: A Pulitzer Prize-winning author and one of the world’s premiere cancer researchers reveals an urgent philosophy on the little-known principles that govern medicine—and how understanding these principles can empower us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a decade ago, when Siddhartha Mukherjee was a young, exhausted, and isolated medical resident, he discovered a book that would forever change the way he understood the medical profession. The book, &lt;i&gt;The Youngest Science&lt;/i&gt;, forced Dr. Mukherjee to ask himself an urgent, fundamental question: Is medicine a “science”? Sciences must have laws—statements of truth based on repeated experiments that describe some universal attribute of nature. But does medicine have laws like other sciences?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Mukherjee has spent his career pondering this question—a question that would ultimately produce some of most serious thinking he would do around the tenets of his discipline—culminating in &lt;i&gt;The Laws of Medicine. &lt;/i&gt;In this important treatise, he investigates the most perplexing and illuminating cases of his career that ultimately led him to identify the three key principles that govern medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brimming with fascinating historical details and modern medical wonders, this important book is a fascinating glimpse into the struggles and Eureka! moments that people outside of the medical profession rarely see. Written with Dr. Mukherjee’s signature eloquence and passionate prose, &lt;i&gt;The Laws of Medicine&lt;/i&gt; is a critical read, not just for those in the medical profession, but for everyone who is moved to better understand how their health and well-being is being treated. Ultimately, this book lays the groundwork for a new way of understanding medicine, now and into the future.</description>

  <description>In a pulls-no-punches essay intended to provoke rational discussion, Stephen King sets down his thoughts about gun violence in America. Anger and grief in the wake of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School are palpable in this urgent piece of writing, but no less remarkable are King’s keen thoughtfulness and composure as he explores the contours of the gun-control issue and constructs his argument for what can and should be done.</description>

      <![CDATA[A short essay on US gun violence by Stephen King. From a UK perspective, it's really difficult to wrap my mind around the logic of King's position - which I'd inadequately summarise as 'ban the worst guns, protect everyone's right to have less-bad guns'. The essay is strong on the former, but wea...]]>

  <description>Videogames are among the defining art forms of our age. They are variously adored and reviled, but their influence is felt everywhere. Every game is its own little universe – and hundreds of millions of us now spend part of our time living in those universes. &lt;br /&gt;But what does it mean to play them? What does it feel like to be a member of the generation that grew up with them? Where do they take us, and what needs do they serve? In this short memoir, Sam Leith tells the story of his life through his relationship with games. &lt;br /&gt;It’s a story of games-playing. But it’s also the story of an anxious child trying to find a way of being in the world, a twenty-something negotiating the unfamiliar terrain of heartbreak, and an adult emerging from a turbulent time into marriage and fatherhood. It’s a story of love, fear, substance abuse and – well – mechanical emus.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Sunday Times &lt;/i&gt;Number One Bestseller and Humour Book of the Year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of the Books Are My Bag Book of the Year&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of iBooks' Book of the Year&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the life of a junior doctor: 97-hour weeks, life and death decisions, a constant tsunami of bodily fluids, and the hospital parking meter earns more than you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scribbled in secret after endless days, sleepless nights and missed weekends, Adam Kay's &lt;i&gt;This is Going to Hurt&lt;/i&gt; provides a no-holds-barred account of his time on the NHS front line. Hilarious, horrifying and heartbreaking, this diary is everything you wanted to know – and more than a few things you didn't – about life on and off the hospital ward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;As seen on ITV's Zoe Ball Book Club &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;This edition includes extra diary entries and a new afterword by the author.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>What do you do with a generation who’ve had everything, but still can’t grow up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this is you. Perhaps you still owe your student loan, and make jokes about how you’ll never pay it back, so it’s easy to ignore. We know. Perhaps you spend more than you earn. Perhaps you still live with your parents. We know. Perhaps those ignored bills and reminders have become threats and court summonses. We know, and we can help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to The Transition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While taking part in The Transition you and your partner will spend six months living under the supervision of your mentors, two successful adults of a slightly older generation. Freed from your financial responsibilities, you will be coached through the key areas of the scheme Employment, Nutrition, Responsibility, Relationship, Finances and Self-Respect until you are ready to be reintegrated into adult society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of your six months who knows what discoveries you’ll have made about yourself? The friends’ you no longer need. The talents you’ll have found time to nurture. The business you might have kick-started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knows where you’ll be?</description>

  <description>Psychological thriller set in Berlin during the Cold War, based on an actual (but little known) incident which tells of the secret tunnel under the Soviet sector which the British and Americans built in 1954 to gain access to the Russians' communication system. The protagonist, Leonard Marnham, is a 25-year-old, naive, unsophisticated English post office technician who is astonished and alarmed to find himself involved in a top-secret operation. At the same time that he loses his political innocence, Leonard experiences his sexual initiation in a clandestine affair with a German divorcee five years his senior. As his two secret worlds come together, events develop into a gruesome nightmare, building to a searing, unforgettable scene of surrealist intensity in which Leonard and his lover try to conceal evidence of a murder. Acting to save himself from a prison sentence, Leonard desperately performs an act of espionage whose ironic consequences resonate down the years to a twister of an ending. Though its plot rivals any thriller in narrative tension, this novel is also a character study--of a young man coming of age in bizarre circumstances, and of differences in national character: the gentlemanly Brits, all decorum and civility; the brash, impatient Americans; the cynical Germans. McEwan's neat, tensile prose raises this book to the highest level of the genre.</description>

      <![CDATA[Unusually for an Ian McEwan book, I didn't quite know what to make of this. It seemed to be a combination of spy thriller, coming-of-age novel, absurdity-of-war satire, and a reflection on cultural politics. The prose is sublime, almost poetic, as McEwan's writing always is - but it didn't quite...]]>

  <description>By an acclaimed writer at the height of his powers, The Sense of an Ending extends a streak of extraordinary books that began with the best-selling Arthur &amp;amp; George and continued with Nothing to Be Frightened Of and, most recently, Pulse. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This intense novel follows a middle-aged man as he contends with a past he has never much thought about - until his closest childhood friends return with a vengeance, one of them from the grave, another maddeningly present. Tony Webster thought he'd left all this behind as he built a life for himself, and by now his marriage and family and career have fallen into an amicable divorce and retirement. But he is then presented with a mysterious legacy that obliges him to reconsider a variety of things he thought he'd understood all along, and to revise his estimation of his own nature and place in the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A novel so compelling that it begs to be read in a single sitting, with stunning psychological and emotional depth and sophistication, The Sense of an Ending is a brilliant new chapter in Julian Barnes's oeuvre.</description>

      <![CDATA[A beautifully written book which explores ageing and the flaws in memory. So many passages of this book are quotable that it reads almost like poetry.

  <description>What is it like to be a brain surgeon? How does it feel to hold someone's life in your hands, to cut into the stuff that creates thought, feeling, and reason? How do you live with the consequences of performing a potentially lifesaving operation when it all goes wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In neurosurgery, more than in any other branch of medicine, the doctor's oath to "do no harm" holds a bitter irony. Operations on the brain carry grave risks. Every day, leading neurosurgeon Henry Marsh must make agonizing decisions, often in the face of great urgency and uncertainty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you believe that brain surgery is a precise and exquisite craft, practiced by calm and detached doctors, this gripping, brutally honest account will make you think again. With astonishing compassion and candor, Marsh reveals the fierce joy of operating, the profoundly moving triumphs, the harrowing disasters, the haunting regrets, and the moments of black humor that characterize a brain surgeon's life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do No Harm provides unforgettable insight into the countless human dramas that take place in a busy modern hospital. Above all, it is a lesson in the need for hope when faced with life's most difficult decisions.</description>

  <description>Human life is a staggeringly strange thing. On the surface of a ball of rock falling around a nuclear fireball in the blackness of a vacuum the laws of nature conspired to create a naked ape that can look up at the stars and wonder where it came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is a human being? Objectively, nothing of consequence. Particles of dust in an infinite arena, present for an instant in eternity. Clumps of atoms in a universe with more galaxies than people. And yet a human being is necessary for the question itself to exist, and the presence of a question in the universe – any question – is the most wonderful thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions require minds, and minds bring meaning. What is meaning? I don’t know, except that the universe and every pointless speck inside it means something to me. I am astonished by the existence of a single atom, and find my civilisation to be an outrageous imprint on reality. I don’t understand it. Nobody does, but it makes me smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book asks questions about our origins, our destiny, and our place in the universe. We have no right to expect answers; we have no right to even ask. But ask and wonder we do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Human Universe&lt;/i&gt; is first and foremost a love letter to humanity; a celebration of our outrageous fortune in existing at all. I have chosen to write my letter in the language of science, because there is no better demonstration of our magnificent ascent from dust to paragon of animals than the exponentiation of knowledge generated by science. Two million years ago we were apemen. Now we are spacemen. That has happened, as far as we know, nowhere else. That is worth celebrating.</description>

  <description>From the author of &lt;em&gt;The Blind Side&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of four outsiders in the world of high-finance who predict the credit and housing bubble collapse before anyone else. The film adaptation by Adam McKay (&lt;em&gt;Anchorman I&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;II&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Other Guys&lt;/em&gt;) features Academy Award® winners Christian Bale, Brad Pitt, Melissa Leo and Marisa Tomei; Academy Award® nominees Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the crash of the U.S. stock market became public knowledge in the fall of 2008, it was already old news. The real crash, the silent crash, had taken place over the previous year, in bizarre feeder markets where the sun doesn’t shine and the SEC doesn’t dare, or bother, to tread. Who understood the risk inherent in the assumption of ever-rising real estate prices, a risk compounded daily by the creation of those arcane, artificial securities loosely based on piles of doubtful mortgages? In this fitting sequel to &lt;em&gt;Liar’s Poker&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Lewis answers that question in a narrative brimming with indignation and dark humor.</description>

  <description>We live in the age of speed. We strain to be more efficient, to cram more into each minute, each hour, each day. Since the Industrial Revolution shifted the world into high gear, the cult of speed has pushed us to a breaking point. Consider these facts: Americans on average spend seventy-two minutes of every day behind the wheel of a car, a typical business executive now loses sixty-eight hours a year to being put on hold, and American adults currently devote on average a mere half hour per week to making love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living on the edge of exhaustion, we are constantly reminded by our bodies and minds that the pace of life is spinning out of control. &lt;em&gt;In Praise of Slowness&lt;/em&gt; traces the history of our increasingly breathless relationship with time and tackles the consequences of living in this accelerated culture of our own creation. Why are we always in such a rush? What is the cure for time sickness? Is it possible, or even desirable, to slow down? Realizing the price we pay for unrelenting speed, people all over the world are reclaiming their time and slowing down the pace -- and living happier, healthier, and more productive lives as a result. A Slow revolution is taking place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here you will find no Luddite calls to overthrow technology and seek a preindustrial utopia. This is a modern revolution, championed by cell-phone using, e-mailing lovers of sanity. The Slow philosophy can be summed up in a single word -- balance. People are discovering energy and efficiency where they may have been least expected -- in slowing down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this engaging and entertaining exploration, award-winning journalist and rehabilitated speedaholic Carl Honoré details our perennial love affair with efficiency and speed in a perfect blend of anecdotal reportage, history, and intellectual inquiry. &lt;em&gt;In Praise of Slowness&lt;/em&gt; is the first comprehensive look at the worldwide Slow movements making their way into the mainstream -- in offices, factories, neighborhoods, kitchens, hospitals, concert halls, bedrooms, gyms, and schools. Defining a movement that is here to stay, this spirited manifesto will make you completely rethink your relationship with time.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Yuval Noah Harari, author of the critically-acclaimed &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller and international phenomenon &lt;em&gt;Sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, returns with an equally original, compelling, and provocative book, turning his focus toward humanity’s future, and our quest to upgrade humans into gods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war. This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style—thorough, yet riveting—famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake?&lt;em&gt; Homo Deus&lt;/em&gt; explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century—from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the same insight and clarity that made &lt;em&gt;Sapiens&lt;/em&gt; an international hit and a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller, Harari maps out our future. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>What begins as the story of a lost boy turns into a story of a brave man yearning to understand what happened that night, in the years since, and to his very person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While on vacation with their parents, Matthew Homes and his older brother snuck out in the middle of the night. Only Matthew came home safely. Ten years later, Matthew tells us, he has found a way to bring his brother back... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What begins as the story of a lost boy turns into a story of a brave man yearning to understand what happened that night, in the years since, and to his very person. Unafraid to look at the shadows of our hearts, Nathan Filer's rare and brilliant debut shows us the strength that is rooted in resilience and love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Editor's Note Feb 10, 2014: St Martin's Press have just announced that Where The Moon Isn't will be republished under the UK title, The Shock and The Fall this week in digital format and later this fall in paperback. They said that the title change was necessary "because otherwise there's a lot of confusion" - The Shock and The Fall recently won the Costa Book of the Year award, which is UK based but has international renown.</description>

  <description>Echoing Socrates' time-honoured statement that the unexamined life is not worth living, psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz draws short, vivid stories from his 25-five-year practice in order to track the collaborative journey of therapist and patient as they uncover the hidden feelings behind ordinary behaviour.&lt;br /&gt; These beautifully rendered tales illuminate the fundamental pathways of life from birth to death. A woman finds herself daydreaming as she returns home from a business trip; a young man loses his wallet. We learn, too, from more extreme examples: the patient who points an unloaded gun at a police officer, the compulsive liar who convinces his wife he's dying of cancer. The stories invite compassionate understanding, suggesting answers to the questions that compel and disturb us most about love and loss, parents and children, work and change. The resulting journey will spark new ideas about who we are and why we do what we do.</description>

  <description>From Man Booker Prize-shortlisted author Sarah Hall comes a collection of unique and disturbing short fiction hailed as a sensation by UK reviewers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serenity of a Finnish lake turns sinister when a woman's lover does not come back from his swim . . . A bored London housewife discovers a secret erotic club . . . A shy, bookish girl develops an unlikely friendship with the schoolyard bully and her wild, horsey family . . . After fighting with her boyfriend, a woman goes for a night walk on a remote tropical beach with dark, unexpected consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Hall has been hailed as "one of the most significant and exciting of Britain's young novelists" (The Guardian). Now, in this collection of seven pieces of short fiction, published in England to phenomenal praise, she is at her best: seven pieces of uniquely talented prose telling stories as wholly absorbing as they are ambitious and accessible.</description>

  <description>What real reader does not yearn, somewhere in the recesses of his or her heart, for a really literate, first-class thriller--one that chills the body, but warms the soul with plot, perception, and language at once astute and vivid? In other words, a ghost story written by Jane Austen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, we cannot give you Austen, but Susan Hill's remarkable &lt;i&gt;Woman In Black&lt;/i&gt; comes as close as our era can provide. Set on the obligatory English moor, on an isolated causeway, the story has as its hero Arthur Kipps, an up-and-coming young solicitor who has come north from London to attend the funeral and settle the affairs of Mrs. Alice Drablow of Eel Marsh House. The routine formalities he anticipates give way to a tumble of events and secrets more sinister and terrifying than any nightmare: the rocking chair in the deserted nursery, the eerie sound of a pony and trap, a child's scream in the fog, and most dreadfully--and for Kipps most tragically--&lt;i&gt;The Woman In Black&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Woman In Black&lt;/i&gt; is both a brilliant exercise in atmosphere and controlled horror and a delicious spine-tingler--proof positive that this neglected genre, the ghost story, isn't dead after all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;'Tim Shipman's dispatches from the political front line are a must read’ NICK ROBINSON&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Politics was turned upside down during 2016. This book by &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; political editor Tim Shipman is the first to tell the full story of how and why Britain voted to leave the European Union and how the vote shattered the political status quo.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on unrivalled access to all the key politicians and their advisors – including Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, George Osborne, Nigel Farage and Dominic Cummings, the mastermind of Vote Leave – Shipman has written a political history that reads like a thriller, and offers a gripping, day-by-day account of what really happened behind-the-scenes in Downing Street, both Leave campaigns, the Labour Party, Ukip and Britain Stronger in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipman gives his readers a ringside seat on how decisions were made, mistakes justified and betrayals perpetrated. Filled with stories, anecdotes and juicy leaks the book does not seek to address the rights and wrongs of Brexit but to explore how and why David Cameron chose to take the biggest political gamble of his life and explain why he lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a story of calculation, attempted coups, individuals torn between principles and loyalty. All the events are here – from David Cameron’s pledge to hold a referendum, through to the campaign itself, his resignation as prime minister, the betrayals and rivalries that occurred during the race to find his successor to the arrival of Theresa May in Downing Street as Britain’s second female prime minister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All Out War&lt;/i&gt; is a book about leaders and their closest aides, the decisions they make and how and why they make them, as well as how they feel when they turn out to be wrong. It is about men who make decisions that are intellectually consistent and – by their own measure – morally sound that are simultaneously disastrous for themselves and those closest to them. It is about how doing what you know has worked before doesn’t always work again. Most of all it is about asking the question: how far are you prepared to go to win?</description>

  <description>I stole every nickel and blew it on fine threads, luxurious lodgings, fantastic foxes and other sensual goodies. I partied in every capital in Europe and basked on all the world's most famous beaches'. Frank W Abagnale, alias Frank Williams, Robert Conrad, Frank Adams and Ringo Monjo, was one of the most daring con men, forgers, imposters and escape artists in history. In his brief but notorious career, Abagnale donned a pilot's uniform and co-piloted a Pan Am jet, masqueraded as a member of hospital management, practised law without a licence, passed himself off as a college sociology professor, and cashed over $2.5 million in forged checks all before he was twenty-one. Known by the police of twenty-six foreign countries and all fifty states as 'The Skywayman', Abagnale lived a sumptuous life on the run - until the law caught up with him. Now recognised as the nation's leading authority on financial foul play, Abagnale is a charming rogue whose hilarious, stranger-than-fiction international escapades and ingenious escapes - including one from an aeroplane - make CATCH ME IF YOU CAN an irresistable tale of deceit.</description>

  <description>In his #1 bestselling books &lt;i&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Blink&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Outliers&lt;/i&gt;, Malcolm Gladwell has explored the ways we understand and change our world. Now he looks at the complex and surprising ways the weak can defeat the strong, the small can match up against the giant, and how our goals (often culturally determined) can make a huge difference in our ultimate sense of success. Drawing upon examples from the world of business, sports, culture, cutting-edge psychology, and an array of unforgettable characters around the world, &lt;i&gt;David and Goliath&lt;/i&gt; is in many ways the most practical and provocative book Malcolm Gladwell has ever written.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;TM&lt;/em&gt; offers graphic designers and those interested in the history of design and branding a uniquely detailed look at a select group of the very best visual identities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book takes 29 internationally recognized logos and explains their development, design, usage, and purpose. Based upon interviews with the designers responsible for these totems, and encompassing the marks from a range of corporate, artistic, and cultural institutions from across the globe, &lt;em&gt;TM&lt;/em&gt; reveals the stories behind such icons as the Coca-Cola logotype, the Penguin Books' colophon, and the Michelin Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based upon comprehensive research, authoritatively written and including a wealth of archival images, &lt;em&gt;TM&lt;/em&gt; is an opportunity to discover how designers are able to squeeze entire identities into 29 simple logos.</description>

  <description>A compact masterpiece dedicated to the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich: Julian Barnes’s first novel since his best-selling, Man Booker Prize–winning &lt;i&gt;The Sense of an Ending.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1936, Shostakovitch, just thirty, fears for his livelihood and his life. Stalin, hitherto a distant figure, has taken a sudden interest in his work and denounced his latest opera. Now, certain he will be exiled to Siberia (or, more likely, executed on the spot), Shostakovitch reflects on his predicament, his personal history, his parents, various women and wives, his children—and all who are still alive themselves hang in the balance of his fate. And though a stroke of luck prevents him from becoming yet another casualty of the Great Terror, for decades to come he will be held fast under the thumb of despotism: made to represent Soviet values at a cultural conference in New York City, forced into joining the Party and compelled, constantly, to weigh appeasing those in power against the integrity of his music. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barnes elegantly guides us through the trajectory of Shostakovitch's career, at the same time illuminating the tumultuous evolution of the Soviet Union. The result is both a stunning portrait of a relentlessly fascinating man and a brilliant exploration of the meaning of art and its place in society.</description>

  <description>Lucy Barton is recovering slowly from what should have been a simple operation. Her mother, to whom she hasn't spoken for many years, comes to see her. Her unexpected visit forces Lucy to confront the tension and longing that have informed every aspect of her life: her impoverished childhood in Amgash, Illinois, her escape to New York and her desire to become a writer, her faltering marriage, her love for her two daughters. &lt;p&gt;Knitting this powerful narrative together is the brilliant storytelling voice of Lucy herself: keenly observant, deeply human, and truly unforgettable. In &lt;i&gt;My Name Is Lucy Barton, &lt;/i&gt;one of America's finest writers shows how a simple hospital visit illuminates the most tender relationship of all-the one between mother and daughter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A biting satire about a young man's isolated upbringing and the race trial that sends him to the Supreme Court, Paul Beatty's The Sellout showcases a comic genius at the top of his game. It challenges the sacred tenets of the United States Constitution, urban life, the civil rights movement, the father-son relationship, and the holy grail of racial equality―the black Chinese restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born in the "agrarian ghetto" of Dickens―on the southern outskirts of Los Angeles―the narrator of The Sellout resigns himself to the fate of lower-middle-class Californians: "I'd die in the same bedroom I'd grown up in, looking up at the cracks in the stucco ceiling that've been there since '68 quake." Raised by a single father, a controversial sociologist, he spent his childhood as the subject in racially charged psychological studies. He is led to believe that his father's pioneering work will result in a memoir that will solve his family's financial woes. But when his father is killed in a police shoot-out, he realizes there never was a memoir. All that's left is the bill for a drive-thru funeral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fueled by this deceit and the general disrepair of his hometown, the narrator sets out to right another wrong: Dickens has literally been removed from the map to save California from further embarrassment. Enlisting the help of the town's most famous resident―the last surviving Little Rascal, Hominy Jenkins―he initiates the most outrageous action conceivable: reinstating slavery and segregating the local high school, which lands him in the Supreme Court.</description>
