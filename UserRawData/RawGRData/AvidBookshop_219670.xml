  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A chillingly personal and exquisitely wrought memoir of a daughter reckoning with the brutal murder of her mother at the hands of her former stepfather, and the moving, intimate story of a poet coming into her own in the wake of a tragedy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At age nineteen, Natasha Trethewey had her world turned upside down when her former stepfather shot and killed her mother. Grieving and still new to adulthood, she confronted the twin pulls of life and death in the aftermath of unimaginable trauma and now explores the way this experience lastingly shaped the artist she became.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With penetrating insight and a searing voice that moves from the wrenching to the elegiac, Pulitzer Prize–winning poet Natasha Trethewey explores this profound experience of pain, loss, and grief as an entry point into understanding the tragic course of her mother’s life and the way her own life has been shaped by a legacy of fierce love and resilience. Moving through her mother’s history in the deeply segregated South and through her own girlhood as a “child of miscegenation” in Mississippi, Trethewey plumbs her sense of dislocation and displacement in the lead-up to the harrowing crime that took place on Memorial Drive in Atlanta in 1985.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Memorial Drive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;is a compelling and searching look at a shared human experience of sudden loss and absence but also a piercing glimpse at the enduring ripple effects of white racism and domestic abuse. Animated by unforgettable prose and inflected by a poet’s attention to language, this is a luminous, urgent, and visceral memoir from one of our most important contemporary writers and thinkers.</description>

  <description>A brilliant and incisive look at how patriarchy, intolerance, and misogyny have conquered not just politics but American culture itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do Adam Sandler, Donald Trump, and &lt;i&gt;South Park&lt;/i&gt; have in common? Why are myths like "reverse sexism" and "political correctness" so seductive? And why do movie classics of yore, from &lt;i&gt;Sixteen Candles&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;Revenge of the Nerds&lt;/i&gt;, make rape look like so much silly fun? With Lindy West's signature wit and in her uniquely incendiary voice, &lt;i&gt;The Witches are Coming&lt;/i&gt; lays out a grand theory of America that explains why Trump's election was, in many ways, a foregone conclusion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As West reveals through fascinating journeys across the landscapes of pop culture, the lies that fostered the catastrophic resentment that boiled over in the 2016 presidential race did not spring from a vacuum. They have in fact been woven into America's DNA, cultivated by generations of mediocre white men and fed to the masses with such fury that we have become unable to recognize them as lies at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether it be the notion overheard since the earliest moments of the #MeToo movement that feminism has gone too far or the insistence that holding someone accountable for his actions amounts to a "witch hunt," &lt;i&gt;The Witches are Coming&lt;/i&gt; exposes the lies that many have chosen to believe and the often unexpected figures who have furthered them. Along the way, it unravels the tightening link between culture and politics, identifying in the memes, music, and movies we've loved the seeds of the neoreactionary movement now surging through the nation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sprawling, funny, scorching, and illuminating, &lt;i&gt;The Witches are Coming&lt;/i&gt; shows West at the top of her intellectual and comic powers. As much a celebration of America's potential as a condemnation of our failures, some will call it a witch hunt—to which West would reply, "So be it. I'm a witch and I'm hunting you."</description>

      <![CDATA[I'm a longtime fan of Lindy West's columns (and now-defunct Twitter feed), but this is the first book of hers I've read (and now I want to go back and read SHRILL). She is funny without being mean-spirited, and she conveys anecdotes and research-based insights with equal enthusiasm and gravitas....]]>

  <description>The author of &lt;em&gt;It’s Okay to Laugh&lt;/em&gt; and host of the popular podcast &lt;em&gt;Terrible, Thanks for Asking&lt;/em&gt;—interviews that are “a gift to be able to listen [to]” (&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;)—returns with more hilarious meditations on her messy, wonderful, bittersweet, and unconventional life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life has a million different ways to kick you right in the chops. We lose love, lose jobs, lose our sense of self. For Nora McInerny, it was losing her husband, her father, and her unborn second child in one catastrophic year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the wake of loss, we get to assemble something new from whatever is left behind. Some circles call finding happiness after loss “Chapter 2”—the continuation of something else. Today, Nora is remarried and mothers four children aged 16 months to 16 years. While her new circumstances bring her extraordinary joy, they are also tinged with sadness over the loved ones she’s lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life has made Nora a reluctant expert in hard conversations. On her wildly popular podcast, she talks about painful experiences we inevitably face, and exposes the absurdity of the question “how are you?” that people often ask when we’re coping with the aftermath of emotional catastrophe. She knows intimately that when your life falls apart, there’s a mad rush to be okay—to find a silver lining, to get to the happy ending. In this, her second memoir, Nora offers a tragicomic exploration of the tension between finding happiness and holding space for the unhappy experiences that have shaped us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Happy Endings&lt;/em&gt; is a book for people living life after life has fallen apart. It’s a book for people who know that they’re moving forward, not moving on. It’s a book for people who know life isn’t always happy, but it isn’t the end: there will be unimaginable joy and incomprehensible tragedy. As Nora reminds us, there will be no happy endings—but there will be new beginnings.</description>

  <description>From its first magnificent sentence, "In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing," to the last, "I am haunted by waters," "A River Runs Through It" is an American classic.Based on Norman Maclean's childhood experiences, "A River Runs Through It" has established itself as one of the most moving stories of our time; it captivates readers with vivid descriptions of life along Montana's Big Blackfoot River and its near magical blend of fly fishing with the troubling affections of the heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This handsome edition is designed and illustrated by Barry Moser. There are thirteen two-color wood engravings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A masterpiece. . . . This is more than stunning fiction: It is a lyric record of a time and a life, shining with Maclean's special gift for calling the reader's attention to arts of all kinds-- the arts that work in nature, in personality, in social intercourse, in fly-fishing."--Kenneth M. Pierce, "Village Voice"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norman Maclean (1902-90), woodsman, scholar, teacher, and storyteller, grew up in the Western Rocky Mountains of Montana and worked for many years in logging camps and for the United States Forestry Service before beginning his academic career. He retired from the University of Chicago in 1973.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“&lt;i&gt;Separation Anxiety&lt;/i&gt; is a hilarious, heart-breaking and thought-provoking portrait of a difficult marriage, as fierce as it is funny.... My advice: Start reading and don’t stop until you get to the last page of this wise and wonderful novel." —Alice Hoffman&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From bestselling author Laura Zigman, a hilarious novel about a wife and mother whose life is unraveling and the well-intentioned but increasingly disastrous steps she takes to course-correct her relationships, her career, and her belief in herself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judy never intended to start wearing the dog. But when she stumbled across her son Teddy’s old baby sling during a halfhearted basement cleaning, something in her snapped. So: the dog went into the sling, Judy felt connected to another living being, and she’s repeated the process every day since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life hasn’t gone according to Judy’s plan. Her career as a children’s book author offered a glimpse of success before taking an embarrassing nose dive. Teddy, now a teenager, treats her with some combination of mortification and indifference. Her best friend is dying. And her husband, Gary, has become a pot-addled professional “snackologist” who she can’t afford to divorce. On top of it all, she has a painfully ironic job writing articles for a self-help website—a poor fit for someone seemingly incapable of helping herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wickedly funny and surprisingly tender, &lt;em&gt;Separation Anxiety&lt;/em&gt; offers a frank portrait of middle-aged limbo, examining the ebb and flow of life’s most important relationships. Tapping into the insecurities and anxieties that most of us keep under wraps, and with a voice that is at once gleefully irreverent and genuinely touching, Laura Zigman has crafted a new classic for anyone taking fumbling steps toward happiness.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"An absolute original . . . a story that kids will love." --R. J. Palacio, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Wonder&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bea's family may change, but their love for each other does not in this soon-to-be classic by the Newbery Award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;When You Reach Me&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Things are changing, Bea. But there's still a lot you can count on. Okay? Things that won't EVER change."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her parents' divorce, Bea's life became different in many ways. But she can always look back at the list she keeps in her green notebook to remember the things that will stay the same. The first and most important: Mom and Dad will always love Bea, and each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dad tells Bea that he and his boyfriend, Jesse, are getting married, Bea is thrilled. Bea loves Jesse, and when he and Dad get married, she'll finally (finally!) have what she's always wanted--a sister. Even though she's never met Jesse's daughter, Sonia, Bea is sure that they'll be "just like sisters anywhere."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the wedding day approaches, Bea will learn that making a new family brings questions, surprises, and joy, and readers will discover why the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;called Rebecca Stead a "writer of great feeling."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"No author writing today observes young lives with more clarity, tenderness, and grace than the one and only Rebecca Stead." --Newbery Medalist Katherine Applegate, author of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The One and Only Ivan&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Stead truly understands the inner life of kids." --Newbery Medalist Erin Entrada Kelly, author of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Hello, Universe&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;You Go First &lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Carnegie Medal finalist Jenny Valentine comes a bold new story about love and second chances, perfect for fans of the popular film Sliding Doors and David Levithan's Every Day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jude's life is upended when his mother loses her job and moves them to a little town by the sea to live with Henry Lake--an eccentric old man with rooms to rent. Henry is odd, the town is dull, and worst of all, Jude feels out of place and alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Novo turns up in the house across the street, dressed all in black and looking unbearably handsome, Jude's summer takes an immediate turn for the better. But Novo isn't all that he seems to be--or maybe he's more than Jude can possibly understand. Novo is a time traveler, someone who wakes up in different places and at different points in time with utter regularity. He knows that each Now is fleeting, that each moment is only worth the energy it expends on itself, and that each experience he has will be lost to him before long. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Jude and Novo form a bond that shifts reality for both of them. Unlike anything he's ever experienced, Jude begins to question what forever really means--only to find out that Novo knows that forever isn't real. And when things go horribly wrong, he and Novo are faced with an impossible question that may change both of their lives irreparably--what is worth sacrificing for love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A stunningly written, compelling exploration of what it means to love and live in the moment that quite literally defies both logic and time.</description>

  <description>Exploring the psychological dynamics of the relationship between a precocious yet naïve teenage girl and her magnetic and manipulative teacher, a brilliant, all-consuming read that marks the explosive debut of an extraordinary new writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2000. Bright, ambitious, and yearning for adulthood, fifteen-year-old Vanessa Wye becomes entangled in an affair with Jacob Strane, her magnetic and guileful forty-two-year-old English teacher. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2017. Amid the rising wave of allegations against powerful men, a reckoning is coming due. Strane has been accused of sexual abuse by a former student, who reaches out to Vanessa, and now Vanessa suddenly finds herself facing an impossible choice: remain silent, firm in the belief that her teenage self willingly engaged in this relationship, or redefine herself and the events of her past. But how can Vanessa reject her first love, the man who fundamentally transformed her and has been a persistent presence in her life? Is it possible that the man she loved as a teenager—and who professed to worship only her—may be far different from what she has always believed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternating between Vanessa’s present and her past, &lt;i&gt;My Dark Vanessa&lt;/i&gt; juxtaposes memory and trauma with the breathless excitement of a teenage girl discovering the power her own body can wield. Thought-provoking and impossible to put down, this is a masterful portrayal of troubled adolescence and its repercussions that raises vital questions about agency, consent, complicity, and victimhood. Written with the haunting intimacy of &lt;i&gt;The Girls&lt;/i&gt; and the creeping intensity of &lt;i&gt;Room&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;My Dark Vanessa&lt;/i&gt; is an era-defining novel that brilliantly captures and reflects the shifting cultural mores transforming our relationships and society itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In her most revealing and powerful book yet, the beloved activist, speaker, and author of the bestselling sensations &lt;i&gt;Love Warrior&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Carry On, Warrior&lt;/i&gt; explores the joy and peace we discover when we stop striving to meet the expectations of the world, and start trusting the voice deep within us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;i&gt;Untamed&lt;/i&gt; will liberate women—emotionally, spiritually, and physically. I believe Glennon was born to write this book, just this way, at just this moment in history. It is phenomenal.”—Elizabeth Gilbert, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;City of Girls&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Eat Pray Love &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is how you find yourself.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a voice of longing inside every woman. We strive so mightily to be good: good mothers, daughters, partners, employees, citizens, and friends. We believe all this striving will make us feel alive. Instead, it leaves us feeling weary, stuck, overwhelmed, and underwhelmed. We look at our lives, relationships, and world, and wonder: &lt;i&gt;Wasn’t it all supposed to be more beautiful than this?&lt;/i&gt; We quickly silence that question, telling ourselves to be grateful. We hide our simmering discontent—even from ourselves. Until we reach our boiling point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four years ago, Glennon Doyle—bestselling Oprah-endorsed author, renowned activist and humanitarian, wife and mother of three—was speaking at a conference when a woman entered the room. Glennon looked at her and fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind: &lt;i&gt;There She Is&lt;/i&gt;. At first, Glennon assumed these words came to her from on high. Soon she realized that they came to her from within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glennon was finally hearing her own voice—the voice that had been silenced by decades of cultural conditioning, numbing addictions, and institutional allegiances. This was the voice of the girl Glennon had been before the world told her who to be. She vowed to never again abandon herself. She decided to build a life of her own—one based on her individual desire, intuition, and imagination. She would reclaim her true, untamed self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, &lt;i&gt;Untamed&lt;/i&gt; is both a memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It offers a piercing, electrifying examination of the restrictive expectations women are issued from birth; shows how hustling to meet those expectations leaves women feeling dissatisfied and lost; and reveals that when we quit abandoning ourselves and instead abandon the world’s expectations of us, we become women who can finally look at ourselves and recognize: &lt;i&gt;There She Is&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Untamed&lt;/i&gt; shows us how to be brave. As Glennon insists: &lt;i&gt;The braver we are, the luckier we get.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In this poignant and humorous work, Virginia Woolf observes that though illness is part of every human being’s experience, it has never been the subject of literature—like the more acceptable subjects of war and love. We cannot quote Shakespeare to describe a headache. We must, Woolf says, invent language to describe pain. And though illness enhances our perceptions, she observes that it reduces self-consciousness; it is "the great confessional." Woolf discusses the cultural taboos associated with illness and explores how illness changes the way we read. Poems clarify and astonish, Shakespeare exudes new brilliance, and so does melodramatic fiction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On Being Ill &lt;/i&gt;was published as an individual volume by Hogarth Press in 1930. While other Woolf essays, such as &lt;i&gt;A Room of One’s Own &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Three Guineas, &lt;/i&gt;were first published by Hogarth as individual volumes and have since been widely available&lt;i&gt;, On Being Ill&lt;/i&gt; has been overlooked. The Paris Press edition features original cover art by Woolf’s sister, the painter Vanessa Bell. Hermione Lee’s Introduction discusses this extraordinary work, and explores Woolf’s revelations about poetry, language, and illness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Revisiting once again the world of Raymie Nightingale, two-time Newbery Medalist Kate DiCamillo turns her focus to the tough-talking, inescapably tenderhearted Beverly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beverly put her foot down on the gas. They went faster still.&lt;br /&gt;This was what Beverly wanted — what she always wanted. To get away. To get away as fast as she could. To stay away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beverly Tapinski has run away from home plenty of times, but that was when she was just a kid. By now, she figures, it’s not running away. It’s leaving. Determined to make it on her own, Beverly finds a job and a place to live and tries to forget about her dog, Buddy, now buried underneath the orange trees back home; her friend Raymie, whom she left without a word; and her mom, Rhonda, who has never cared about anyone but herself. Beverly doesn’t want to depend on anyone, and she definitely doesn’t want anyone to depend on her. But despite her best efforts, she can’t help forming connections with the people around her — and gradually, she learns to see herself through their eyes. In a touching, funny, and fearless conclusion to her sequence of novels about the beloved Three Rancheros, #1 New York Times best-selling author Kate DiCamillo tells the story of a character who will break your heart and put it back together again.</description>

  <description>In Oak Knoll, a verdant, tight-knit North Carolina neighborhood, professor of forestry and ecology Valerie Alston-Holt is raising her bright and talented biracial son. Xavier is headed to college in the fall, and after years of single parenting, Valerie is facing the prospect of an empty nest. All is well until the Whitmans move in next door―an apparently traditional family with new money, ambition, and a secretly troubled teenaged daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to his thriving local business, Brad Whitman is something of a celebrity around town, and he's made a small fortune on his customer service and charm, while his wife, Julia, escaped her trailer park upbringing for the security of marriage and homemaking. Their new house is more than she ever imagined for herself, and who wouldn't want to live in Oak Knoll? With little in common except a property line, these two very different families quickly find themselves at odds: first, over an historic oak tree in Valerie's yard, and soon after, the blossoming romance between their two teenagers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told from multiple points of view, &lt;i&gt;A Good Neighborhood&lt;/i&gt; asks big questions about life in America today―What does it mean to be a good neighbor? How do we live alongside each other when we don't see eye to eye?―as it explores the effects of class, race, and heartrending star-crossed love in a story that’s as provocative as it is powerful.</description>

  <description>In July 2015, a young black woman named Sandra Bland was pulled over for a minor traffic violation in rural Texas. Minutes later she was arrested and jailed. Three days later, she committed suicide in her cell. What went wrong? &lt;i&gt;Talking to Strangers&lt;/i&gt; is all about what happens when we encounter people we don't know, why it often goes awry, and what it says about us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do we make sense of the unfamiliar? Why are we so bad at judging someone, reading a face, or detecting a lie? Why do we so often fail to 'get' other people?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through a series of puzzles, encounters and misunderstandings, from little-known stories to infamous legal cases, Gladwell takes us on a journey through the unexpected. You will read about the spy who spent years undetected at the highest levels of the Pentagon, the man who saw through the fraudster Bernie Madoff, the suicide of the poet Sylvia Plath and the false conviction of Amanda Knox. You will discover that strangers are never simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one shows us who we are like Malcolm Gladwell. Here he sets out to understand why we act the way we do, and how we all might know a little more about those we don't.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A lush, glittering short story collection exploring female obsession and desire by an award-winning writer Roxane Gay calls "a consummate storyteller."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; From Kentucky to the California desert, these forty-two short stories expose the glossy and matte hearts of girls and women in moments of obsessive desire and fantasy, wildness and bad behavior, brokenness and fearlessness, and more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Teenage girls sneak out on a summer night to meet their boyfriends by the train tracks. A woman escapes suffocating grief through a vivid fantasy life. Members of a cult form an unsettling chorus as they extol their passion for the same man. A love story begins over cabbages in a grocery store. A laundress' life is consumed by obsession for a famous baseball player. Two high school friends kiss all night and binge-watch Winona Ryder movies after the death of a sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Leesa Cross-Smith's sensuous stories will drench readers in nostalgia for summer nights and sultry days, the intense friendships of teenage girls, and the innate bonds felt between women. She evokes the pangs of loss and motherhood, the headiness and destructive potential of desire, and the pure exhilaration of being female. The stories in &lt;i&gt;So We Can Glow&lt;/i&gt;--some long, some gone in a flash, some told over text and emails--take the wild hearts of girls and women and hold them up so they can catch the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Oh my gosh. This book. The stories are smart, thought-provoking, funny, and poignant. Cross-Smith has a gift for turns of phrase and imagery that depict something (a sensation, an emotion, a craving) in such a perfect way you wonder how you never thought of it yourself.

  <description>Lena and Campbell aren't friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lena has her killer style, her awesome boyfriend, and a plan. She knows she's going to make it big. Campbell, on the other hand, is just trying to keep her head down and get through the year at her new school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When both girls attend the Friday-night football game, what neither expects is for everything to descend into sudden mass chaos. Chaos born from violence and hate. Chaos that unexpectedly throws them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They aren't friends. They hardly understand the other's point of view. But none of that matters when the city is up in flames, and they only have each other to rely on if they're going to survive the night.</description>

  <description>"The Grammarians" are Laurel and Daphne Wolfe, identical, inseparable redheaded twins who share an obsession with words. They speak a secret “twin” tongue of their own as toddlers; as adults making their way in 1980s Manhattan, their verbal infatuation continues, but this love, which has always bound them together, begins instead to push them apart. Daphne, copy editor and grammar columnist, devotes herself to preserving the dignity and elegance of Standard English. Laurel, who gives up teaching kindergarten to write poetry, is drawn, instead, to the polymorphous, chameleon nature of the written and spoken word. Their fraying twin-ship finally shreds completely when the sisters go to war, absurdly but passionately, over custody of their most prized family heirloom: &lt;i&gt;Merriam Webster’s New International Dictionary, Second Edition&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cathleen Schine has written a playful and joyful celebration of the interplay of language and life. A dazzling comedy of sisterly and linguistic manners, a revelation of the delights and stresses of intimacy, &lt;i&gt;The Grammarians&lt;/i&gt; is the work of one of our great comic novelists at her very best.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jasmine Guillory makes her hardcover debut with a heartwarming Christmas romance.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivian Forest has been out of the country a grand total of one time, so when she gets the chance to tag along on her daughter Maddie's work trip to England to style a royal family member, she can't refuse. She's excited to spend the holidays taking in the magnificent British sights, but what she doesn't expect is to become instantly attracted to a certain Private Secretary and his charming accent and unyielding formality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malcolm Hudson has been the Queen's Private Secretary for years and has never given a personal, private tour...until now. He is intrigued by Vivian the moment he meets her and finds himself making excuses just to spend time with her. When flirtatious banter turns into a kiss under the mistletoe, things snowball into a full-on fling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite a ticking timer on their holiday romance, they are completely fine with ending their short, steamy fling come New Year's Day...or are they?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Reality and dream collide in Amy Bonnaffons' dazzling, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;darkly playful debut novel about a love affair between the living &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;and the dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For weeks, Rachel has been noticing the same golden-haired young man sitting at her Brooklyn bus stop, staring off with a melancholy air. When, one day, she finally musters the courage to introduce herself, the chemistry between them is undeniable: Thomas is wise, witty, handsome, mysterious, clearly a kindred spirit. There's just one tiny problem: He's dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stuck in a surreal limbo governed by bureaucracy, Thomas is unable to "cross over" to the afterlife until he completes a 90-day stint on earth, during which time he is forbidden to get involved with a member of the living-lest he incur "regrets." When Thomas and Rachel break this rule, they unleash a cascade of bizarre, troubling consequences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in the hallucinatory borderland between life and death, &lt;i&gt;The Regrets&lt;/i&gt; is a gloriously strange and breathtakingly sexy exploration of love, the cataclysmic power of fantasies, and the painful, exhilarating work of waking up to reality, told with uncommon grace and humor by a visionary artist at the height of her imaginative power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Seductive, unsettling, and beautifully written, &lt;i&gt;The Truants&lt;/i&gt; is a debut novel of literary suspense perfect for lovers of Agatha Christie and &lt;i&gt;The Secret History&lt;/i&gt;--a thrilling exploration of deceit, first love, and the depths to which obsession can drive us.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;People disappear when they most want to be seen.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess Walker has come to a concrete campus under the flat grey skies of East Anglia for one reason: To be taught by the mesmerizing and rebellious Dr Lorna Clay, whose seminars soon transform Jess's thinking on life, love, and Agatha Christie. Swept up in Lorna's thrall, Jess falls in with a tightly-knit group of rule-breakers--Alec, a courageous South African journalist with a nihilistic streak; Georgie, a seductive, pill-popping aristocrat; and Nick, a handsome geologist with layers of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when tragedy strikes the group, Jess turns to Lorna. Together, the two seek refuge on a remote Italian island, where Jess tastes the life she's long dreamed of--and uncovers a shocking secret that will challenge everything she's learned.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The first middle grade novel from Julie Murphy, #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Dumplin’ &lt;/em&gt;(now a popular Netflix film), is a funny, heartwarming story perfect for fans of Rebecca Stead, Ali Benjamin, and Holly Goldberg Sloan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patricia “Sweet Pea” DiMarco wasn’t sure what to expect when her parents announced they were getting a divorce. She never could have imagined that they would have the “brilliant” idea of living in nearly identical houses on the same street. In the one house between them lives their eccentric neighbor Miss Flora Mae, the famed local advice columnist behind “Miss Flora Mae I?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dividing her time between two homes is not easy. And it doesn’t help that at school, Sweet Pea is now sitting right next to her ex–best friend, Kiera, a daily reminder of the friendship that once was. Things might be unbearable if Sweet Pea didn’t have Oscar—her new best friend—and her fifteen-pound cat, Cheese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day Flora leaves for a trip and asks Sweet Pea to forward her the letters for the column. And Sweet Pea happens to recognize the handwriting on one of the envelopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What she decides to do with that letter sets off a chain of events that will forever change the lives of Sweet Pea DiMarco, her family, and many of the readers of “Miss Flora Mae I?”</description>

  <description>Gary Janetti, the writer and producer for some of the most popular television comedies of all time, and creator of one of the most wickedly funny Instagram accounts there is, now turns his skills to the page in a hilarious, and poignant book chronicling the pains and indignities of everyday life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary spends his twenties in New York, dreaming of starring on soap operas while in reality working at a hotel where he lusts after an unattainable colleague and battles a bellman who despises it when people actually use a bell to call him. He chronicles the torture of finding a job before the internet when you had to talk on the phone &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;the time, and fantasizes, as we all do, about who to tell off when he finally wins an Oscar. As Gary himself says, "These are essays from my childhood and young adulthood about things that still annoy me."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original, brazen, and laugh out loud funny, &lt;i&gt;Do You Mind if I Cancel?&lt;/i&gt; is something not to be missed.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Wilson’s best book yet—a moving and uproarious novel about a woman who finds meaning in her life when she begins caring for two children with remarkable and disturbing abilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lillian and Madison were unlikely roommates and yet inseparable friends at their elite boarding school. But then Lillian had to leave the school unexpectedly in the wake of a scandal and they’ve barely spoken since. Until now, when Lillian gets a letter from Madison pleading for her help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madison’s twin stepkids are moving in with her family and she wants Lillian to be their caretaker. However, there’s a catch: the twins spontaneously combust when they get agitated, flames igniting from their skin in a startling but beautiful way. Lillian is convinced Madison is pulling her leg, but it’s the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking of her dead-end life at home, the life that has consistently disappointed her, Lillian figures she has nothing to lose. Over the course of one humid, demanding summer, Lillian and the twins learn to trust each other—and stay cool—while also staying out of the way of Madison’s buttoned-up politician husband. Surprised by her own ingenuity yet unused to the intense feelings of protectiveness she feels for them, Lillian ultimately begins to accept that she needs these strange children as much as they need her—urgently and fiercely. Couldn’t this be the start of the amazing life she’d always hoped for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With white-hot wit and a big, tender heart, Kevin Wilson has written his best book yet—a most unusual story of parental love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first sleep book by a leading scientific expert—Professor Matthew Walker, Director of UC Berkeley’s Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab—reveals his groundbreaking exploration of sleep, explaining how we can harness its transformative power to change our lives for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleep is one of the most important but least understood aspects of our life, wellness, and longevity. Until very recently, science had no answer to the question of why we sleep, or what good it served, or why we suffer such devastating health consequences when we don't sleep. Compared to the other basic drives in life—eating, drinking, and reproducing—the purpose of sleep remained elusive.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; An explosion of scientific discoveries in the last twenty years has shed new light on this fundamental aspect of our lives. Now, preeminent neuroscientist and sleep expert Matthew Walker gives us a new understanding of the vital importance of sleep and dreaming. Within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize, and make logical decisions. It recalibrates our emotions, restocks our immune system, fine-tunes our metabolism, and regulates our appetite. Dreaming mollifies painful memories and creates a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge to inspire creativity.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Walker answers important questions about sleep: how do caffeine and alcohol affect sleep? What really happens during REM sleep? Why do our sleep patterns change across a lifetime? How do common sleep aids affect us and can they do long-term damage? Charting cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, and synthesizing decades of research and clinical practice, Walker explains how we can harness sleep to improve learning, mood, and energy levels; regulate hormones; prevent cancer, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes; slow the effects of aging; increase longevity; enhance the education and lifespan of our children, and boost the efficiency, success, and productivity of our businesses. Clear-eyed, fascinating, and accessible, &lt;i&gt;Why We Sleep&lt;/i&gt; is a crucial and illuminating book.</description>

  <description>Already being hailed as "a &lt;i&gt;Grapes of Wrath&lt;/i&gt; for our times" and "a new American classic," &lt;i&gt;American Dirt&lt;/i&gt; is a rare exploration into the inner hearts of people willing to sacrifice everything for a glimmer of hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lydia Quixano Perez lives in the Mexican city of Acapulco. She runs a bookstore. She has a son, Luca, the love of her life, and a wonderful husband who is a journalist. And while there are cracks beginning to show in Acapulco because of the drug cartels, her life is, by and large, fairly comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though she knows they'll never sell, Lydia stocks some of her all-time favorite books in her store. And then one day a man enters the shop to browse and comes up to the register with four books he would like to buy--two of them her favorites. Javier is erudite. He is charming. And, unbeknownst to Lydia, he is the &lt;i&gt;jefe&lt;/i&gt; of the newest drug cartel that has gruesomely taken over the city. When Lydia's husband's tell-all profile of Javier is published, none of their lives will ever be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;American Dirt&lt;/i&gt; will leave readers utterly changed. It is a page-turner; it is a literary achievement; it is filled with poignancy, drama, and humanity on every page. It is one of the most important books for our times.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A retired New York professor's life is thrown into chaos when he takes a young great-nephew to the French Riviera, in hopes of uncovering his own mother's wartime secrets in the next masterpiece from New York Times bestselling author Emma Donoghue.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Noah Selvaggio is a retired chemistry professor and widower living on the Upper West Side, but born in the South of France. He is days away from his first visit back to Nice since he was a child, bringing with him a handful of puzzling photos he's discovered from his mother's wartime years. But he receives a call from social services: Noah is the closest available relative of an eleven-year-old great-nephew he's never met, who urgently needs someone to look after him. Out of a feeling of obligation, Noah agrees to take Michael along on his trip. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much has changed in this famously charming seaside mecca, still haunted by memories of the Nazi occupation. The unlikely duo, suffering from jet lag and culture shock, bicker about everything from steak frites to screen time. But Noah gradually comes to appreciate the boy's truculent wit, and Michael's ease with tech and sharp eye help Noah unearth troubling details about their family's past. Both come to grasp the risks people in all eras have run for their loved ones, and find they are more akin than they knew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with all the tenderness and psychological intensity that made Room an international bestseller, Akin is a funny, heart-wrenching tale of an old man and a boy, born two generations apart, who unpick their painful story and start to write a new one together.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Emmy-Award winning writer and comedian Josh Gondelman’s collection of personal stories of best intentions and mixed results.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh Gondelman knows a thing or two about trying—and failing. The Emmy Award-winning stand-up comic—dubbed a “pathological sweetheart” by the&lt;em&gt; New York Observer&lt;/em&gt;—is known throughout the industry as one of comedy’s true “nice guys.” Not surprisingly, he’s endured his share of last-place finishes. But he keeps on bouncing back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this collection of hilarious and poignant essays (including his acclaimed &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; piece “What if I Bombed at My Own Wedding?”), Josh celebrates a life of good intentions—and mixed results. His true tales of romantic calamities, professional misfortunes, and eventual triumphs reinforce the notion: we get out of the world what we put into it. Whether he’s adopting a dog from a suspicious stranger, mitigating a disastrous road trip, or trying MDMA for the first (and only) time, Josh only wants the best for everyone—even as his attempts to do the right thing occasionally implode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of the warm and relatable humor that’s made him a favorite on the comedy club circuit, &lt;em&gt;Nice Try&lt;/em&gt; solidifies Josh Gondelman’s reputation as not just a good guy, but a skilled observer of the human condition.</description>

  <description>More than twenty years ago, Jon Kabat-Zinn changed the way we thought about awareness in everyday life with his now-classic introduction to mindfulness, &lt;em&gt;Wherever You Go, There You Are&lt;/em&gt;. He followed that up with 2005's &lt;em&gt;Coming to Our Senses&lt;/em&gt;, the definitive book for our time on the connection between mindfulness and our well-being on every level, physical, cognitive, emotional, social, planetary, and spiritual.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Now, &lt;em&gt;Coming to Our Senses&lt;/em&gt; is being repackaged into 4 smaller books, each focusing on a different aspect of mindfulness, and each with a new foreword written by the author. In the fourth of these books, &lt;em&gt;Mindfulness for All &lt;/em&gt;(which was originally published as Part VII and Part VIII of &lt;em&gt;Coming to Our Senses&lt;/em&gt;), Kabat-Zinn focuses on how mindfulness really can be a tool to transform the world--explaining how democracy thrives in a mindful context, and why mindfulness is a vital tool for both personal and global understanding and action in these tumultuous times. By "coming to our senses"--both literally and metaphorically--we can become more compassionate, more embodied, more aware human beings, and in the process, contribute to the healing of the body politic as well as our own lives in ways both little and big.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the acclaimed, Man Booker Prize-shortlisted author of &lt;i&gt;All That Man Is&lt;/i&gt;, a stunning, virtuosic novel about twelve people, mostly strangers, and the surprising ripple effect each one has on the life of the next as they cross paths while in transit around the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman strikes up a conversation with the man sitting next to her on a plane after some turbulence. He returns home to tragic news that has also impacted another stranger, a shaken pilot on his way to another continent who seeks comfort from a journalist he meets that night. Her life shifts subtly as well, before she heads to the airport on an assignment that will shift more lives in turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this wondrous, profoundly moving novel, Szalay's diverse protagonists circumnavigate the planet in twelve flights, from London to Madrid, from Dakar to Sao Paulo, to Toronto, to Delhi, to Doha, en route to see lovers or estranged siblings, aging parents, baby grandchildren, or nobody at all. Along the way, they experience the full range of human emotions from loneliness to love and, knowingly or otherwise, change each other in one brief, electrifying interaction after the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with magic and economy and beautifully exploring the delicate, crisscrossed nature of relationships today, &lt;i&gt;Turbulence&lt;/i&gt; is a dazzling portrait of the interconnectedness of the modern world.</description>

  <description>Cassie Hanwell was born for emergencies. As one of the only female firefighters in her Texas firehouse, she's seen her fair share of them, and she's excellent at dealing with other people's tragedies. But when her estranged and ailing mother asks her to uproot her life and move to Boston, it's an emergency of a kind Cassie never anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tough, old-school Boston firehouse is as different from Cassie's old job as it could possibly be. Hazing, a lack of funding, and poor facilities mean that the firemen aren't exactly thrilled to have a "lady" on the crew, even one as competent and smart as Cassie. Except for the handsome rookie, who doesn't seem to mind having Cassie around. But she can't think about that. Because she doesn't fall in love. And because of the advice her old captain gave her: &lt;i&gt;don't date firefighters. &lt;/i&gt;Cassie can feel her resolve slipping...but will she jeopardize her place in a career where she's worked so hard to be taken seriously?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katherine Center's &lt;i&gt;Things You Save in a Fire&lt;/i&gt; is a heartfelt, affecting novel about life, love, and the true meaning of courage.</description>

  <description>In August 1939, a lonely thirty-year-old Hetty Cartwright arrives at Lockwood Manor as the director of the evacuated Natural History Museum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is unprepared for the scale of protecting her charges from party guests, wild animals, the elements, the tyrannical Major Lockwood and Luftwaffe bombs. Most of all though, she is unprepared for the beautiful and haunted Lucy Lockwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Lucy, who has spent much of her life cloistered at Lockwood suffering from bad nerves, the arrival of the museum brings with it new freedoms. But it also resurfaces memories of her late mother, and nightmares in which Lucy roams Lockwood hunting for something she has lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the animals start to move of their own accord, and exhibits go missing, they begin to wonder what exactly it is that they might need protection from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the disasters mount up, it is not only Hetty’s future employment that is in danger, but her sanity too. There’s something, or someone, in the house. Someone stalking her through its darkened corridors…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its atmospheric setting, beautifully rendered romance and vivid characters, The Animals At Lockwood Manor is perfect for fans of Sarah Waters, Jessie Burton and Alice Hoffman.</description>

  <description>Knowing where your scars come from doesn't make them go away. Growing up on a ranch, feeding bottles to bummer lambs and babysitting her little sister, Jackie Shannon Hollis expected to become a mother someday. But, after a series of failed relationships, she begins to question this expectation. She meets the man she wants to spend her life with, a man who never wanted children. Jackie joyfully commits to a childless life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after the wedding, on a visit to the family ranch in rural Oregon, Jackie holds her newborn niece and falls deep into baby love and longing. As she navigates the overlapping roles of wife, daughter, aunt, sister, survivor, counselor, and friend, she explores what it means to choose a different path. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Particular Happiness delves into the messy and beautiful territory of what we keep and what we abandon to make the space for love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Meet Roxy. She’s a sometimes vegan, always broke artist with a heart the size of Texas and an ex living in her spare bedroom. Her life is messy, but with the help of a few good friends and by the grace of the goddess Venus she’ll discover that good sex, true love, and her life’s purpose are all closer than she realizes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bridget Jones penned a diary; Roxy writes letters. Specifically: she writes letters to her hapless, rent-avoidant ex-boyfriend—and current roommate—Everett. This charming and funny twenty-something is under-employed (and under-romanced), and she’s decidedly fed up with the indignities she endures as a deli maid at Whole Foods (the original), and the dismaying speed at which her beloved Austin is becoming corporatized. When a new Lululemon pops up at the intersection of Sixth and Lamar where the old Waterloo Video used to be, Roxy can stay silent no longer.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As her letters to Everett become less about overdue rent and more about the state of her life, Roxy realizes she’s ready to be the heroine of her own story. She decides to team up with her two best friends to save Austin—and rescue Roxy’s love life—in whatever way they can. But can this spunky, unforgettable millennial keep Austin weird, avoid arrest, and find romance—and even creative inspiration—in the process?</description>

  <description>At the end of the Second World War, Cyril Conroy combines luck and a single canny investment to begin an enormous real estate empire, propelling his family from poverty to enormous wealth. His first order of business is to buy the Dutch House, a lavish estate in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Meant as a surprise for his wife, the house sets in motion the undoing of everyone he loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is told by Cyril’s son Danny, as he and his older sister, the brilliantly acerbic and self-assured Maeve, are exiled from the house where they grew up by their stepmother. The two wealthy siblings are thrown back into the poverty their parents had escaped from and find that all they have to count on is one another. It is this unshakable bond between them that both saves their lives and thwarts their futures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set over the course of five decades, &lt;i&gt;The Dutch House&lt;/i&gt; is a dark fairy tale about two smart people who cannot overcome their past. Despite every outward sign of success, Danny and Maeve are only truly comfortable when they’re together. Throughout their lives, they return to the well-worn story of what they’ve lost with humor and rage. But when at last they’re forced to confront the people who left them behind, the relationship between an indulged brother and his ever-protective sister is finally tested.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A thrilling tale of secretaries turned spies, of love and duty, and of sacrifice—inspired by the true story of the CIA plot to infiltrate the hearts and minds of Soviet Russia, not with propaganda, but with the greatest love story of the twentieth century: &lt;i&gt;Doctor Zhivago&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the height of the Cold War, two secretaries are pulled out of the typing pool at the CIA and given the assignment of a lifetime. Their mission: to smuggle &lt;i&gt;Doctor Zhivago&lt;/i&gt; out of the USSR, where no one dare publish it, and help Pasternak's magnum opus make its way into print around the world. Glamorous and sophisticated Sally Forrester is a seasoned spy who has honed her gift for deceit all over the world--using her magnetism and charm to pry secrets out of powerful men. Irina is a complete novice, and under Sally's tutelage quickly learns how to blend in, make drops, and invisibly ferry classified documents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Secrets We Kept &lt;/i&gt;combines a legendary literary love story—the decades-long affair between Pasternak and his mistress and muse, Olga Ivinskaya, who was sent to the Gulag and inspired Zhivago's heroine, Lara—with a narrative about two women empowered to lead lives of extraordinary intrigue and risk. From Pasternak's country estate outside Moscow to the brutalities of the Gulag, from Washington, D.C. to Paris and Milan, &lt;i&gt; The Secrets We Kept&lt;/i&gt; captures a watershed moment in the history of literature—told with soaring emotional intensity and captivating historical detail. And at the center of this unforgettable debut is the powerful belief that a piece of art can change the world.</description>

  <description>A gripping new novel with a distinctly American edge, THE TRAVELERS highlights the lives of two families--meet James Samuel Vincent--an affluent New York attorney who shirks his modest Irish American upbringing but hews to his father's wily nilly ways; and Agnes Miller Christie--a beautiful African American woman who encounters tragedy on a Georgia road that propels her to a new life in the Bronx; Eddie Christie, a recently married sailor on an air craft carrier in Vietnam and the Tom Stoppard play that becomes his life anchor; an interracial couple, both academic scholars, who travel to far of Brittany to save their aching marriage; Eloise Delaney, the unapologetic lesbian starting life over again in 1970s' Berlin; a black moving man stranded during a Thanksgiving storm in Portsmouth, New Hampshire; and two half-brothers who meet for the first time as adult men in a crayon factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanning the 1950s to Obama's first year as President, THE TRAVELERS is both an intimate family portrait and a sweeping exploration of what it means to be American today. With its piercing humor, dialogue and sense of place, THE TRAVELERS introduces readers to a cast of characters destined to make a lasting impression.</description>

  <description>From Jennifer Weiner, the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Who Do You Love&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;In Her Shoes&lt;/i&gt;, comes a smart, thoughtful, and timely exploration of two sisters’ lives from the 1950s to the present as they struggle to find their places—and be true to themselves—in a rapidly evolving world. &lt;i&gt;Mrs. Everything&lt;/i&gt; is an ambitious, richly textured journey through history—and herstory—as these two sisters navigate a changing America over the course of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do we change or does the world change us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jo and Bethie Kaufman were born into a world full of promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in 1950s Detroit, they live in a perfect “Dick and Jane” house, where their roles in the family are clearly defined. Jo is the tomboy, the bookish rebel with a passion to make the world more fair; Bethie is the pretty, feminine good girl, a would-be star who enjoys the power her beauty confers and dreams of a traditional life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the truth ends up looking different from what the girls imagined. Jo and Bethie survive traumas and tragedies. As their lives unfold against the background of free love and Vietnam, Woodstock and women’s lib, Bethie becomes an adventure-loving wild child who dives headlong into the counterculture and is up for anything (except settling down). Meanwhile, Jo becomes a proper young mother in Connecticut, a witness to the changing world instead of a participant. Neither woman inhabits the world she dreams of, nor has a life that feels authentic or brings her joy. Is it too late for the women to finally stake a claim on happily ever after?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her most ambitious novel yet, Jennifer Weiner tells a story of two sisters who, with their different dreams and different paths, offer answers to the question: How should a woman be in the world?</description>

  <description>It’s been a busy—and expensive—few years for Matt and Elise Sorenson and their young daughter Gracie, whom they affectionately call Little Green. Matt, a Manhattan lawyer, has just been offered a partnership, and Elise’s equestrian ambitions as a competitive dressage rider may finally vault her into the Olympics. But her long absences from home and endless hours of training have strained their relationships nearly to the breaking point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now they’re up in the Adirondacks, preparing to sell the valuable lakefront cabin that’s been in Matt’s family for generations. Both he and Elise agree it’s time to let it go. But as they navigate the memories the cabin holds—and come face to face with Matt’s teenage crush, now an unnervingly attractive single mother living right next door—Gracie disappears without a trace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faced with the possibility that they’ll never see their daughter again, Elise and Matt struggle to come to terms with what their future may bring. The fate of the family property, the history of this not-so-tiny town, and the limits of Matt and Elise’s love for each other are inextricably bound up with Gracie’s disappearance. Everything for the Sorenson family is about to change—the messy tangle of their past, the harrowing truth of their present, and whether or not their love will survive a parent’s worst nightmare.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A propulsive tale of ambition and romance, set in the publishing world of 1980’s New York and the timeless beaches of Cape Cod.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In the summer of 1987, 25-year-old Eve Rosen is an aspiring writer languishing in a low-level assistant job, unable to shake the shadow of growing up with her brilliant brother. With her professional ambitions floundering, Eve jumps at the chance to attend an early summer gathering at the Cape Cod home of famed &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; writer Henry Grey and his poet wife, Tillie. Dazzled by the guests and her burgeoning crush on the hosts’ artistic son, Eve lands a new job as Henry Grey’s research assistant and an invitation to Henry and Tillie’s exclusive and famed "Book Party"— where attendees dress as literary characters. But by the night of the party, Eve discovers uncomfortable truths about her summer entanglements and understands that the literary world she so desperately wanted to be a part of is not at all what it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A page-turning, coming-of-age story, written with a lyrical sense of place and a profound appreciation for the sustaining power of books, &lt;i&gt;The Last Book Party&lt;/i&gt; shows what happens when youth and experience collide and what it takes to find your own voice.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"A refreshingly funny and blisteringly unsentimental coming-of-age memoir." -&lt;b&gt;John Green, #1 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Turtles All The Way Down &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Fault in Our Stars&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Akilah Hughes's world, family--and life--are often complicated, but always funny. Through intimate and hilarious essays, Akilah takes readers along on her journey from the small Kentucky town where she was born--and eventually became a spelling bee champ and 15-year-old high school graduate--to New York City, where she took careful steps to fulfill her dream of becoming a writer and performer. Like Tiffany Haddish's &lt;i&gt;The Last Black Unicorn&lt;/i&gt; or Mindy Kaling's &lt;i&gt;Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?&lt;/i&gt; for the YA set, Akilah pens revealing and laugh-out-loud funny essays about her life, covering everything from her racist fifth grade teacher, her struggles with weight and acne, her failed attempts at joining the cheerleading team, how to literally get to New York (hint: for a girl on a budget, it may include multiple bus transfers) and exactly how to "make it" once you finally get there.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the # 1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Signature of All Things&lt;/i&gt;, a delicious novel of glamour, sex, and adventure, about a young woman discovering that you don't have to be a &lt;i&gt;good girl&lt;/i&gt; to be a good person.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Life is both fleeting and dangerous, and there is no point in denying yourself pleasure, or being anything other than what you are.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beloved author Elizabeth Gilbert returns to fiction with a unique love story set in the New York City theater world during the 1940s. Told from the perspective of an older woman as she looks back on her youth with both pleasure and regret (but mostly pleasure), &lt;i&gt;City of Girls&lt;/i&gt; explores themes of female sexuality and promiscuity, as well as the idiosyncrasies of true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1940, nineteen-year-old Vivian Morris has just been kicked out of Vassar College, owing to her lackluster freshman-year performance. Her affluent parents send her to Manhattan to live with her Aunt Peg, who owns a flamboyant, crumbling midtown theater called the Lily Playhouse. There Vivian is introduced to an entire cosmos of unconventional and charismatic characters, from the fun-chasing showgirls to a sexy male actor, a grand-dame actress, a lady-killer writer, and no-nonsense stage manager. But when Vivian makes a personal mistake that results in professional scandal, it turns her new world upside down in ways that it will take her years to fully understand. Ultimately, though, it leads her to a new understanding of the kind of life she craves-and the kind of freedom it takes to pursue it. It will also lead to the love of her life, a love that stands out from all the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now ninety-five years old and telling her story at last, Vivian recalls how the events of those years altered the course of her life - and the gusto and autonomy with which she approached it. &lt;i&gt;At some point in a woman's life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time,&lt;/i&gt; she muses. &lt;i&gt;After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is.&lt;/i&gt; Written with a powerful wisdom about human desire and connection, &lt;i&gt;City of Girls&lt;/i&gt; is a love story like no other.</description>

  <description>Everyone has a purpose. And, according to Oprah Winfrey, "Your real job in life is to figure out as soon as possible what that is, who you are meant to be, and begin to honor your calling in the best way possible."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That journey starts right here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her latest book, &lt;i&gt;The Path Made Clear, &lt;/i&gt;Oprah shares what she sees as a guide for activating your deepest vision of yourself, offering the framework for creating not just a life of success, but one of significance. The book's ten chapters are organized to help you recognize the important milestones along the road to self-discovery, laying out what you really need in order to achieve personal contentment, and what life's detours are there to teach us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oprah opens each chapter by sharing her own key lessons and the personal stories that helped set the course for her best life. She then brings together wisdom and insights from luminaries in a wide array of fields, inspiring readers to consider what they're meant to do in the world and how to pursue it with passion and focus. These renowned figures share the greatest lessons from their own journeys toward a life filled with purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paired with over 100 awe-inspiring photographs to help illuminate the wisdom of these messages, &lt;i&gt;The Path Made Clear &lt;/i&gt;provides readers with a beautiful resource for achieving a life lived in service of your calling - whatever it may be.</description>

  <description>A tender, witty debut novel about a single mother raising her daughter among the upper crust of New York City society in the late twentieth century from a nine-time Moth StorySLAM champion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura hails from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, born into old money, drifting aimlessly into her early thirties. One weekend in 1981 she meets Jefferson. The two sleep together. He vanishes. And Laura realizes she’s pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Enter: Emma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Despite her progressive values, Laura raises Emma by herself in the same blue-blood world of private schools and summer homes she grew up in, buoyed by a host of indelible characters, including her eccentric mother, who informs her society friends and Emma herself that she was fathered by a Swedish sperm donor; her brother, whose childhood stutter reappears in the presence of their forbidding father; an exceptionally kind male pediatrician; and her overbearing best friend, whose life has followed the Park Avenue script in every way except for childbearing. Meanwhile, the apple falls far from the tree with Emma, who begins to question her environment in a way her mother never could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Told in vignettes that mine the profound from the mundane, with meditations on everything from sex and death to insomnia and the catharsis of crying on the subway, a textured portrait emerges of a woman struggling to understand herself, her daughter, and the changing landscape of New York City in the eighties and nineties.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;M.T. Edvardsson’s &lt;i&gt;A Nearly Normal Family&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping legal thriller that forces the reader to consider: How far would you go to protect the ones you love? In this twisted narrative of love and murder, a horrific crime makes a seemingly normal family question everything they thought they knew about their life—and one another.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eighteen-year-old Stella Sandell stands accused of the brutal murder of a man almost fifteen years her senior. She is an ordinary teenager from an upstanding local family. What reason could she have to know a shady businessman, let alone to kill him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella’s father, a pastor, and mother, a criminal defense attorney, find their moral compasses tested as they defend their daughter, while struggling to understand why she is a suspect. Told in an unusual three-part structure, &lt;i&gt;A Nearly Normal Family&lt;/i&gt; asks the questions: How well do you know your own children? How far would you go to protect them?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Three weeks. Two sisters. One car. A True Story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raina can’t wait to be a big sister. But once Amara is born, things aren’t quite how she expected them to be. Amara is cute, but she’s also a cranky, grouchy baby, and mostly prefers to play by herself. Their relationship doesn’t improve much over the years, but when a baby brother enters the picture and later, when something doesn’t seem right between their parents, they realize they must figure out how to get along. They are sisters, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raina uses her signature humor and charm in both present-day narrative and perfectly placed flashbacks to tell the story of her relationship with her sister, which unfolds during the course of a road trip from their home in San Francisco to a family reunion in Colorado.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Part memoir, part guidebook, and part social history, &lt;i&gt;For Small Creatures Such as We&lt;/i&gt; is the first book from the daughter of Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan--a luminous exploration of Earth's marvels that require no faith in order to be believed. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"What is the meaning of life? Sagan finds its meaning everywhere--with her family, around the world, and especially among the stars of the cosmos. Read her work; you'll have a deeper appreciation for your every step, every bite, and every breath." --Bill Nye&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sasha Sagan was raised by secular parents, the astronomer Carl Sagan and the writer and producer Ann Druyan. They taught her that the natural world and vast cosmos are full of profound beauty, that science reveals truths more wondrous than any myth or fable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sagan herself became a mother, she began her own hunt for the natural phenomena behind our most treasured occasions--from births to deaths, holidays to weddings, anniversaries, and more--growing these roots into a new set of rituals for her young daughter that honor the joy and significance of each experience without relying on religious framework.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Sagan shares these rituals, &lt;i&gt;For Small Creatures Such as We&lt;/i&gt; becomes a moving tribute to a father, a newborn daughter, a marriage, and the natural world--a celebration of life itself, and the power of our families and beliefs to bring us together.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An indispensable guide to welcoming children—from babies to teens—to a lifelong love of reading, written by Pamela Paul and Maria Russo, editors of &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Do you remember your first visit to where the wild things are? How about curling up for hours on end to discover the secret of the Sorcerer’s Stone? Combining clear, practical advice with inspiration, wisdom, tips, and curated reading lists, &lt;i&gt;How to Raise a Reader &lt;/i&gt;shows you how to instill the joy and time-stopping pleasure of reading.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Divided into four sections, from baby through teen, and each illustrated by a different artist, this book offers something useful on every page, whether it’s how to develop rituals around reading or build a family library, or ways to engage a reluctant reader. A fifth section, “More Books to Love: By Theme and Reading Level,” is chockful of expert recommendations. Throughout, the authors debunk common myths, assuage parental fears, and deliver invaluable lessons in a positive and easy-to-act-on way.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>In 1977, Laura Bell, at loose ends after graduating from college, leaves her family home in Kentucky for a wild and unexpected adventure: herding sheep in Wyoming’s Big Horn Basin. Inexorably drawn to this life of solitude and physical toil, a young woman in a man’s world, she is perhaps the strangest member of this beguiling community of drunks and eccentrics. So begins her unabating search for a place to belong and for the raw materials with which to create a home and family of her own. Yet only through time and distance does she acquire the wisdom that allows her to see the love she lived through and sometimes left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By turns cattle rancher, forest ranger, outfitter, masseuse, wife and mother, Bell vividly recounts her struggle to find solid earth in which to put down roots. Brimming with careful insight and written in a spare, radiant prose, her story is a heart-wrenching ode to the rough, enormous beauty of the Western landscape and the peculiar sweetness of hard labor, to finding oneself even in isolation, to a life formed by nature, and to the redemption of love, whether given or received. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quietly profound and moving, astonishing in its honesty, in its deep familiarity with country rarely seen so clearly, and in beauties all its own, &lt;i&gt;Claiming Ground &lt;/i&gt;is a truly singular memoir.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Veronica Clarke never thought she would wish she’d failed a test until she finds herself holding a thick piece of plastic in her hands and staring at two solid pink lines. Even the most consistent use of condoms won’t prevent pregnancy when your boyfriend secretly pokes holes in them to keep you from going out-of-state for college. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veronica needs an abortion, but the closest place she can legally get one is over nine hundred miles away—and Veronica doesn’t have a car. Too ashamed to ask her friends or family for help, Veronica turns to the one person she believes won’t judge her: Bailey Butler, Jefferson High’s own little black cloud of anger and snark—and Veronica’s ex-best friend. Once on the road, Veronica quickly remembers nothing with Bailey is ever simple and that means two days of stolen cars, shotguns, crazed ex-boyfriends, truck stop strippers with pro-life agendas, and a limo driver named Bob. But the pain and betrayal of their broken friendship can’t be outrun. When their fighting leads to a brutal moment of truth, Bailey abandons Veronica. Now Veronica must risk everything in order to repair the hurt she’s caused</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Part autobiography, part philosophical inquiry, and part spiritual quest, &lt;em&gt;Comedy Sex God&lt;/em&gt; is a hilarious, profound, and enlightening romp around the fertile mind of stand-up stand-out, podcast king, and HBO superstar Pete Holmes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pete Holmes is a sold-out-every-night stand-up comedian with two HBO specials and the host of the hugely successful podcast &lt;em&gt;You Made It Weird&lt;/em&gt;, and he was the creator-star of the hit HBO show &lt;em&gt;Crashing&lt;/em&gt;. But it wasn’t always roses for Pete. Growing up, Pete was raised an evangelical Christian, but his religion taught him that being “bad”—smoking, drinking, having doubts or premarital sex—would get him sent to an eternity in hell. So, terrified of the God he loved, Pete devoted his life to being “good,” even marrying his first girlfriend at the age of twenty-two only to discover a few years later he was being cheated on. Thanks for nothing, God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pete’s failed attempt at a picture-perfect life forced him to reexamine his beliefs, but neither atheism, nor Christianity, nor copious bottles of Yellow Tail led him to enlightenment. Pete longed for a model of faith that served him and his newfound uncertainties about the universe, so he embarked on a soul-seeking journey that continues to this day. Through encounters with mind-altering substances, honing his craft in front of thousands of his comedy fans, and spending time with savants like Ram Dass, Pete forged a new life—both spiritually and personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully written and often completely hilarious—imagine Dass’s &lt;em&gt;Be Here No&lt;/em&gt;w if penned by one of the funniest people alive—&lt;em&gt;Comedy Sex God &lt;/em&gt;reveals a man at the top of his game and a seeker in search of the deeper meanings of life, love, and comedy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A debut from &lt;i&gt;Forbes'&lt;/i&gt; third most powerful woman in the world, Melinda Gates, a timely and necessary call to action for women's empowerment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last twenty years, Melinda Gates has been on a mission. Her goal, as co-chair of the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, has been to find solutions for people with the most urgent needs, wherever they live. Throughout this journey, one thing has become increasingly clear to her: If you want to lift a society up, invest in women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this candid and inspiring book, Gates traces her awakening to the link between women's empowerment and the health of societies. She shows some of the tremendous opportunities that exist right now to “turbo-charge" change. And she provides simple and effective ways each one of us can make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced that all women should be free to decide whether and when to have children, Gates took her first step onto the global stage to make a stand for family planning. That step launched her into further efforts: to ensure women everywhere have access to every kind of job; to encourage men around the globe to share equally in the burdens of household work; to advocate for paid family leave for everyone; to eliminate gender bias in all its forms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout, Gates introduces us to her heroes in the movement towards equality, offers startling data, shares moving conversations she's had with women from all over the world—and shows how we can all get involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A personal statement of passionate conviction, this book tells of Gates' journey from a partner working behind the scenes to one of the world's foremost advocates for women, driven by the belief that no one should be excluded, all lives have equal value, and gender equity is the lever that lifts everything.</description>

  <description>Although it has been decades since the historic social upheavals of the 1960s, Americans continue to look to the Civil Rights Movement as the apotheosis of political expression. With an engaged electorate once again confronting questions of social inequality, there's no better time to revisit the lessons of the '60s and no better leader to learn from than Congressman John Lewis. In &lt;i&gt;Across That Bridge&lt;/i&gt;, Lewis draws from his experience as a leader of the Civil Rights Movement to offer timeless guidance to anyone seeking to live virtuously and transform the world. His wisdom, poignant recollections, and powerful ideas will inspire a new generation to usher in a freer, more peaceful society. The Civil Rights Movement gave rise to the protest culture we know today, and the experiences of leaders like Lewis have never been more relevant. Now, more than ever, this nation needs a strong and moral voice to guide an engaged population through visionary change. Lewis was a leader in the American Civil Rights Movement. He was chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and played a key role in the struggle to end segregation. Despite more than forty arrests, physical attacks, and serious injuries, Lewis remained a devoted advocate of the philosophy of nonviolence. He is the author of his autobiography, &lt;i&gt;Walking with the Wind: A Memoir of a Movement&lt;/i&gt;, and is the recipient of numerous awards from national and international institutions, including the Lincoln Medal; the John F. Kennedy "Profile in Courage" Lifetime Achievement Award (the only one of its kind ever awarded); the NAACP Spingarn Medal; and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor, among many others. He lives in Atlanta, Georgia. "The most important lesson I have learned in the fifty years I have spent working toward the building of a better world is that the true work of social transformation starts within. It begins inside your own heart and mind, because the battleground of human transformation is really, more than any other thing, the struggle within the human consciousness to believe and accept what is true. Thus to truly revolutionize our society, we must first revolutionize ourselves. We must be the change we seek if we are to effectively demand transformation from others." --from John Lewis's &lt;i&gt;Across That Bridge&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Whether discussing Barbra Streisand or The Bachelor, working in the West Wing or working on finding a wing woman, Alyssa leaves no stone unturned...and no awkward situation unexamined.&lt;br /&gt;Like her bestseller &lt;i&gt;Who Thought This Was a Good Idea?&lt;/i&gt;, SO HERE'S THE THING... brings a sharp eye and outsize sense of humor to the myriad issues facing women the world over, both in and out of the workplace. Along with Alyssa's personal experiences and hard-won life lessons, interviews with women like Monica Lewinsky, Susan Rice, and Chelsea Handler round out this modern woman's guide to, well, just about everything you can think of.</description>

  <description>The iconic Olive struggles to understand not only herself and her own life but also the lives of those around her in the town of Crosby, Maine. Whether with a teenager coming to terms with the loss of her father, a young woman about to give birth during a hilariously inopportune moment, a nurse who confesses a secret high school crush, or a lawyer who struggles with an inheritance she does not want to accept, the unforgettable Olive will continue to startle us, to move us, and to inspire moments of transcendent grace.</description>

  <description>For fans of &lt;i&gt;Before We Were Yours&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Where the Crawdads Sing&lt;/i&gt;, a magnificent novel about four orphans on a life-changing odyssey during the Great Depression, from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Ordinary Grace&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1932, Minnesota—the Lincoln School is a pitiless place where hundreds of Native American children, forcibly separated from their parents, are sent to be educated. It is also home to an orphan named Odie O’Banion, a lively boy whose exploits earn him the superintendent’s wrath. Forced to flee, he and his brother Albert, their best friend Mose, and a brokenhearted little girl named Emmy steal away in a canoe, heading for the mighty Mississippi and a place to call their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of one unforgettable summer, these four orphans will journey into the unknown and cross paths with others who are adrift, from struggling farmers and traveling faith healers to displaced families and lost souls of all kinds. With the feel of a modern classic, &lt;i&gt;This Tender Land&lt;/i&gt; is an en­thralling, big-hearted epic that shows how the magnificent American landscape connects us all, haunts our dreams, and makes us whole.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A striking and surprising debut novel from an exhilarating new voice, &lt;i&gt;Such a Fun Age&lt;/i&gt; is a page-turning and big-hearted story about race and privilege, set around a young black babysitter, her well-intentioned employer, and a surprising connection that threatens to undo them both.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alix Chamberlain is a woman who gets what she wants and has made a living showing other women how to do the same. A mother to two small girls, she started out as a blogger and has quickly built herself into a confidence-driven brand. So she is shocked when her babysitter, Emira Tucker, is confronted while watching the Chamberlains’ toddler one night. Seeing a young black woman out late with a white child, a security guard at their local high-end supermarket accuses Emira of kidnapping two-year-old Briar. A small crowd gathers, a bystander films everything, and Emira is furious and humiliated. Alix resolves to make it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Emira herself is aimless, broke, and wary of Alix’s desire to help. At twenty-five, she is about to lose her health insurance and has no idea what to do with her life. When the video of Emira unearths someone from Alix’s past, both women find themselves on a crash course that will upend everything they think they know about themselves, and each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With empathy and piercing social commentary, &lt;i&gt;Such a Fun Age&lt;/i&gt; explores the stickiness of transactional relationships, what it means to make someone “family,” the complicated reality of being a grown up, and the consequences of doing the right thing for the wrong reason.</description>

  <description>“&lt;b&gt;All the tawdry details I’m dying for are in these stories, but they’re given out like old sweaters—without shame, without guile. Amy Hempel is the writer who&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;makes me feel most affiliated with other humans; we are all living this way—hiding, alone, obsessed—and that’s ok.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; —Miranda July&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From legendary writer Amy Hempel, one of the most celebrated and original voices in American short fiction: a ravishing, sometimes heartbreaking new story collection—her first in over a decade.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy Hempel is a master of the short story. A multiple award winner, Hempel is highly regarded among writers, reviewers, and readers of contemporary fiction. This new collection, her first since her &lt;i&gt;Collected Stories&lt;/i&gt; published more than a decade ago, is a literary event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These fifteen exquisitely honed stories reveal Hempel at her most compassionate and spirited, as she introduces characters, lonely and adrift, searching for connection. In “A Full-Service Shelter,” a volunteer at a dog shelter tirelessly, devotedly cares for dogs on a list to be euthanized. In “Greed,” a spurned wife examines her husband’s affair with a glamorous, older married woman. And in “Cloudland,” the longest story in the collection, a woman reckons with the choice she made as a teenager to give up her newborn infant. Quietly dazzling, these stories are replete with moments of revelation and transcendence and with Hempel’s singular, startling, inimitable sentences.</description>

  <description>When sisters Sadie and Zuzu Brooks move to Salt Lake City, they discover a secret room in the attic of their new house, with a sign that reads "Palace Beautiful" and containing an old journal. Along with their neighbor, dramatic Belladonna Desolation (real name: Kristin Smith), they take turns reading the story of a girl named Helen living during the flu epidemic of 1918. The journal ends with a tragedy that has a scary parallel to Sadie and Zuzu?s lives, and the girls become obsessed with finding out what happened to Helen after the journal ends. Did she survive the flu? Is she still alive somewhere? Or could her ghost be lurking in the nearby graveyard?Sarah DeFord Williams has created a gripping read that covers two time periods, many fantastic characters, and a can't-put-it-down ending, all with delightful, extraordinary prose.&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“This book is a treasure—a touching story of friendship, loss, and finding beauty in the everyday, with characters who stay with you long after you’ve turned the final page. I absolutely loved it.”—R. J. Palacio, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of Wonder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Laurel Snyder, author of &lt;i&gt;Orphan Island&lt;/i&gt;, returns with another unforgettable story of the moments in which we find out who we are, and the life-altering friendships that show us what we can be.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The school year is over, and it is summer in Atlanta. The sky is blue, the sun is blazing, and the days brim with possibility. But Leah feels. . . lost. She has been this way since one terrible afternoon a year ago, when everything changed. Since that day, her parents have become distant, her friends have fallen away, and Leah’s been adrift and alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she meets Jasper, a girl unlike anyone she has ever known. There’s something mysterious about Jasper, almost magical. And Jasper, Leah discovers, is also lost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, the two girls carve out a place for themselves, a hideaway in the overgrown spaces of Atlanta, away from their parents and their hardships, somewhere only they can find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the days of this magical June start to draw to a close, and the darker realities of their lives intrude once more, Leah and Jasper have to decide how real their friendship is, and whether it can be enough to save them both.</description>

      <![CDATA[Laurel Snyder's latest middle grade novel is a pitch-perfect story of a girl dealing with loss, navigating friendship, and (re)learning to speak up for what she believes in. While it's not magical realism, suggestions of magic sparkle at the edges of the story--this theme parallels Leah's own com...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A very unusual family saga written with unusual intelligence and compassion. Erica Witsell has a gift for depicting complex relationships. —&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Phyllis Rose, author of &lt;i&gt;Parallel Lives, The Year of Reading Proust, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Shelf&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Every summer, Jessie and Emma leave their suburban home in the Central Valley and fly north to Baymont. Nestled among Mendocino's golden hills, with ponies to love and endless acres to explore, Baymont should be a child's paradise. But Baymont belongs to Laurel, the girls' birth mother, whose heedless parenting and tainted judgement cast a long shadow over the sisters' summers---and their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Caught in a web of allegiances, the girls learn again and again that every loyalty has its price, and that even forgiveness can take unexpected turns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Luminous and poignant, &lt;i&gt;Give&lt;/i&gt; is the story of one family's troubled quest to redeem the mistakes of the past and a stirring testament to the bonds of sisterhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;This is a gripping narrative about family, identity, and loyalty . . . Beautifully written! —&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Kate Rademacher, author of &lt;i&gt;Following the Red Bird&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;At times subtle and at times cutting to the quick Give digs deep into the heart and soul of a family as connected as it is torn apart. Give pulls no punches, delivering an honest look into the lengths we will go for family. —&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Amy Willoughby-Burle, author of&lt;i&gt; The Lemonade Year&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A bold, wry, and intimate graphic memoir about American identity, interracial families, and the realities that divide us, from the acclaimed author of The Sleepwalker’s Guide to Dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“By turns hilarious and heart-rending, it’s exactly the book America needs at this moment.”—Celeste Ng&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Who taught Michael Jackson to dance?” &lt;br /&gt;“Is that how people really walk on the moon?”&lt;br /&gt;“Is it bad to be brown?” &lt;br /&gt;“Are white people afraid of brown people?”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like many six-year-olds, Mira Jacob’s half-Jewish, half-Indian son, Z, has questions about everything. At first they are innocuous enough, but as tensions from the 2016 election spread from the media into his own family, they become much, much more complicated. Trying to answer him honestly, Mira has to think back to where she’s gotten her own answers: her most formative conversations about race, color, sexuality, and, of course, love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“How brown is too brown?”&lt;br /&gt;“Can Indians be racist?”&lt;br /&gt;“What does real love between really different people look like?”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Written with humor and vulnerability, this deeply relatable graphic memoir is a love letter to the art of conversation—and to the hope that hovers in our most difficult questions.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;If the grid went down, how would you find someone on the other side of the country? How would you find hope?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After a global economic collapse and failure of the electrical grid, amid escalating chaos, Carson, a high school teacher of history who sees history bearing out its lessons all around him, heads west on foot toward Beatrix, a woman he met and fell hard for during a chance visit to his school. Working his way along a cross-country railroad line, he encounters lost souls, clever opportunists, and those who believe they’ll be delivered from hardship if they can find their way to the evangelical preacher Jonathan Blue, who is broadcasting on all the airwaves countrywide. Meanwhile, on the other side of the country, Beatrix and her neighbors turn to one another for food, water, and solace, and begin to construct the kind of cooperative community that suggests the end could, in fact, be a promising beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But between Beatrix and Carson lie 3,000 miles. With no internet or phone or postal service, can they find their way back to each other, and what will be left of their world when they do? The answers may lie with fifteen-year-old Rosie Santos, who travels reluctantly with her grandmother to Jonathan Blue, finding her voice and making choices that could ultimately decide the fate of the cross-country lovers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lightest Object in the&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Universe&lt;/i&gt; is a story about reliance and adaptation, a testament to the power of community and a chronicle of moving on after catastrophic loss, illustrating that even in the worst of times, our best traits, borne of necessity, can begin to emerge. </description>

  <description>Gorgeously envisioned, and based on a true story, The Magnetic Girl is set at a time when the emerging presence of electricity raised suspicions about the other-worldly gospel of Spiritualism, and when women’s desire for political, cultural, and sexual presence electrified the country. Squarely in the realm of Emma Donoghue's The Wonder and Leslie Parry’s Church of Marvels, The Magnetic Girl is a unique portrait of a forgotten period in history, seen through the story of one young woman’s power over her family, her community, and ultimately, herself.</description>

  <description>In this groundbreaking new look at rape edited by writer and activist Jaclyn Friedman and &lt;i&gt;Full Frontal Feminism&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;He’s A Stud, She’s A Slut&lt;/i&gt; author Jessica Valenti, the way we view rape in our culture is finally dismantled and replaced with a genuine understanding and respect for female sexual pleasure. Feminist, political, and activist writers alike will present their ideas for a paradigm shift from the “No Means No” model—an approach that while necessary for where we were in 1974, needs an overhaul today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yes Means Yes&lt;/i&gt; will bring to the table a dazzling variety of perspectives and experiences focused on the theory that educating all people to value female sexuality and pleasure leads to viewing women differently, and ending rape. &lt;i&gt;Yes Means Yes&lt;/i&gt; aims to have radical and far-reaching effects: from teaching men to treat women as collaborators and not conquests, encouraging men and women that women can enjoy sex instead of being shamed for it, and ultimately, that our children can inherit a world where rape is rare and swiftly punished. With commentary on public sex education, pornography, mass media, &lt;i&gt;Yes Means Yes&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful and revolutionary anthology.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Set against the backdrop of Detroit in the 1960's and 1970's, the story of the life of a one-of-a-kind matriarch whose business in the Numbers made her daughter's dreams come true.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The World According to Fannie Davis is Bridgett Davis's unforgettable coming of age in a family with a secret. The upper middle class splendor in which she and her siblings so happily lived was made possible by her mother's business in the Numbers, the informal lottery that powered African American communities across the United States. A poignant and revealing examination of how one family lifted itself out of poverty and into a completely different life, for good and bad, The World According to Fannie Davis introduces us to an unforgettable matriarch, and her daughter, whose ways of understanding still resonate today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Offering a daughter's perspective on her larger-than-life mother, Bridgett Davis traces her family's story as part of the Great Migration, showing how her mother and father arrived in Detroit from Tennessee carrying with them not just their own hopes but also those of their families. A child gifted with extraordinary powers of perception and understanding, Davis breaks the code of secrecy around her mother's business and in so doing reveals both her mothers' extraordinary sacrifices as well as her seemingly endless generosity. We come to understand just how keenly Fannie Davis believed in the power of money, and family, to make the world right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving, suspenseful and emotionally rewarding, The World According to Fannie Davis will change the way you understand the lengths a mother will go to provide for her family, and the way those sacrifices resonate over time, offering not just a moving portrait of one American family, but also a new way of understanding Detroit.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;A Place at the Table &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;A Soft Place to Land&lt;/i&gt;, an “intense, complex, and wholly immersive” (Joshilyn Jackson, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author) multigenerational novel that explores the complex relationship between two very different women and the secrets they bequeath to their daughters.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve Whalen, privileged child of an old-money Atlanta family, meets Daniella Gold in the fall of 1962, on their first day at Belmont College. Paired as roommates, the two become fast friends. Daniella, raised in Georgetown by a Jewish father and a Methodist mother, has always felt caught between two worlds. But at Belmont, her bond with Eve allows her to finally experience a sense of belonging. That is, until the girls’ expanding awareness of the South’s systematic injustice forces them to question everything they thought they knew about the world and their places in it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Eve veers toward radicalism—a choice pragmatic Daniella cannot fathom. After a tragedy, Eve returns to Daniella for help in beginning anew, hoping to shed her past. But the past isn’t so easily buried, as Daniella and Eve discover when their daughters are endangered by secrets meant to stay hidden.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Spanning more than thirty years of American history, from the twilight of Kennedy’s Camelot to the beginning of Bill Clinton’s presidency, &lt;i&gt;We Are All Good People Here&lt;/i&gt; is “a captivating…meaningful, resonant story” (Emily Giffin, author of &lt;i&gt;All We Ever Wanted&lt;/i&gt;) about two flawed but well-meaning women clinging to a lifelong friendship that is tested by the rushing waters of history and their own good intentions.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Desire as we’ve never seen it before: a riveting true story about the sex lives of three real American women, based on nearly a decade of reporting.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It thrills us and torments us. It controls our thoughts and destroys our lives. It’s all we live for. Yet we almost never speak of it. And as a buried force in our lives, desire remains largely unexplored—until now. Over the past eight years, journalist Lisa Taddeo has driven across the country six times to embed herself with ordinary women from different regions and backgrounds. The result, &lt;i&gt;Three Women&lt;/i&gt;, is the deepest nonfiction portrait of desire ever written.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We begin in suburban Indiana with Lina, a homemaker and mother of two whose marriage, after a decade, has lost its passion. She passes her days cooking and cleaning for a man who refuses to kiss her on the mouth, protesting that “the sensation offends” him. To Lina’s horror, even her marriage counselor says her husband’s position is valid. Starved for affection, Lina battles daily panic attacks. When she reconnects with an old flame through social media, she embarks on an affair that quickly becomes all-consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In North Dakota we meet Maggie, a seventeen-year-old high school student who finds a confidant in her handsome, married English teacher. By Maggie’s account, supportive nightly texts and phone calls evolve into a clandestine physical relationship, with plans to skip school on her eighteenth birthday and make love all day; instead, he breaks up with her on the morning he turns thirty. A few years later, Maggie has no degree, no career, and no dreams to live for. When she learns that this man has been named North Dakota’s Teacher of the Year, she steps forward with her story—and is met with disbelief by former schoolmates and the jury that hears her case. The trial will turn their quiet community upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, in an exclusive enclave of the Northeast, we meet Sloane—a gorgeous, successful, and refined restaurant owner—who is happily married to a man who likes to watch her have sex with other men and women. He picks out partners for her alone or for a threesome, and she ensures that everyone’s needs are satisfied. For years, Sloane has been asking herself where her husband’s desire ends and hers begins. One day, they invite a new man into their bed—but he brings a secret with him that will finally force Sloane to confront the uneven power dynamics that fuel their lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on years of immersive reporting, and told with astonishing frankness and immediacy, &lt;i&gt;Three Women&lt;/i&gt; is a groundbreaking portrait of erotic longing in today’s America, exposing the fragility, complexity, and inequality of female desire with unprecedented depth and emotional power. It is both a feat of journalism and a triumph of storytelling, brimming with nuance and empathy, that introduces us to three unforgettable women—and one remarkable writer—whose experiences remind us that we are not alone.</description>

  <description>A propulsive debut novel with the intensity of Luckiest Girl Alive and Before the Fall, about a young woman determined to survive and a mother determined to find her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When your life is a lie, the truth can kill you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her fiancé’s private plane crashes in the Colorado Rockies, Allison Carpenter miraculously survives. But the fight for her life is just beginning. For years, Allison has been living with a terrible secret, a shocking truth that powerful men will kill to keep buried. If they know she’s alive, they will come for her. She must make it home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the small community of Owl Creek, Maine, Maggie Carpenter learns that her only child is presumed dead. But authorities have not recovered her body—giving Maggie a shred of hope. She, too, harbors a shameful secret: she hasn’t communicated with her daughter in two years, since a family tragedy drove Allison away. Maggie doesn’t know anything about her daughter’s life now—not even that she was engaged to wealthy pharmaceutical CEO Ben Gardner, or why she was on a private plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Allison struggles across the treacherous mountain wilderness, Maggie embarks on a desperate search for answers. Immersing herself in Allison’s life, she discovers a sleek socialite hiding dark secrets. What was Allison running from—and can Maggie uncover the truth in time to save her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told from the perspectives of a mother and daughter separated by distance but united by an unbreakable bond, Freefall is a riveting debut novel about two tenacious women overcoming unimaginable obstacles to protect themselves and those they love.</description>

  <description>If you work hard enough, if you want it enough, if you’re smart and talented and “good enough,” you can do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except get pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her whole life, Lucy Knisley wanted to be a mother. But when it was finally the perfect time, conceiving turned out to be harder than anything she’d ever attempted. Fertility problems were followed by miscarriages, and her eventual successful pregnancy plagued by health issues, up to a dramatic, near-death experience during labor and delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moving, hilarious, and surprisingly informative memoir not only follows Lucy’s personal transition into motherhood but also illustrates the history and science of reproductive health from all angles, including curious facts and inspiring (and notorious) figures in medicine and midwifery. Whether you’ve got kids, want them, or want nothing to do with them, there’s something in this graphic memoir to open your mind and heart.</description>

  <description>It is a companion novel to Dumplin', which follows supporting characters from the first book in the months after Willowdean's star turn in the Clover City pageant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Millie Michalchuk has gone to fat camp every year since she was a girl. Not this year. This year she has new plans to chase her secret dream—and to kiss her crush. Callie Reyes is the pretty girl who is next in line for dance team captain and has the popular boyfriend. But when it comes to other girls, she’s more frenemy than friend. When circumstances bring the girls together over the course of a semester, they will surprise everyone (especially themselves) by realizing they might have more in common than they ever imagined.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this game, even winning can be deadly...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy Whey is proud of her ordinary life and the simple pleasures that come with it—teaching diving lessons, baking cookies for new neighbors, helping her best friend, Charlotte, run their local book club. Her greatest joy is her family: her devoted professor husband, her spirited fifteen-year-old stepdaughter, her adorable infant son. And, of course, the steadfast and supportive Charlotte. But Amy’s sweet, uncomplicated life begins to unravel when the mysterious and alluring Angelica Roux arrives on her doorstep one book club night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sultry and magnetic, Roux beguiles the group with her feral charm. She keeps the wine flowing and lures them into a game of spilling secrets. Everyone thinks it’s naughty, harmless fun. Only Amy knows better. Something wicked has come her way—a she-devil in a pricey red sports car who seems to know the terrible truth about who she is and what she once did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they’re alone, Roux tells her that if she doesn’t give her what she asks for, what she deserves, she’s going to make Amy pay for her sins. One way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To protect herself and her family and save the life she’s built, Amy must beat the devil at her own clever game, matching wits with Roux in an escalating war of hidden pasts and unearthed secrets. Amy knows the consequences if she can’t beat Roux. What terrifies her is everything she could lose if she wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A diabolically entertaining tale of betrayal, deception, temptation, and love filled with dark twists leavened by Joshilyn Jackson’s trademark humor, Never Have I Ever explores what happens when the transgressions of our past come back with a vengeance.</description>

  <description>Allie Abraham has it all going for her—she's a straight-A student, with good friends and a close-knit family, and she's dating cute, popular, and sweet Wells Henderson. One problem: Wells's father is Jack Henderson, America's most famous conservative shock jock...and Allie hasn't told Wells that her family is Muslim. It's not like Allie's religion is a secret, exactly. It's just that her parents don't practice and raised her to keep her Islamic heritage to herself. But as Allie witnesses ever-growing Islamophobia in her small town and across the nation, she begins to embrace her faith—studying it, practicing it, and facing hatred and misunderstanding for it. Who is Allie, if she sheds the façade of the "perfect" all-American girl? What does it mean to be a "Good Muslim?" And can a Muslim girl in America ever truly fit in? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL-AMERICAN MUSLIM GIRL is a relevant, relatable story of being caught between two worlds, and the struggles and hard-won joys of finding your place.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A darkly funny and life-affirming debut novel for readers of &lt;i&gt;Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine&lt;/i&gt; the story of one man who is offered a second chance at life and love when he develops an unexpected friendship--if he can expose the white lie he told years ago that grew into so much more.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew's day-to-day is a little grim, searching for next of kin for those who die alone. Thankfully, he has a loving family waiting for him when he gets home, to help wash the day's cares away. At least, that's what his coworkers believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew didn't mean for the misunderstanding to happen, yet he's become trapped in his own white lie. The fantasy of his wife and two kids has become a pleasant escape from his lonely one bedroom with only his Ella Fitzgerald records for company. But when new employee Peggy breezes into his life like a breath of fresh air, Andrew is shaken out of his routine. She doesn't notice the wall he's been safely hiding behind and their friendship promises to break it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew must choose: Does he tell the truth and start really living his life, but risk losing his friendship with Peggy? Or will he stay safe and alone, behind the façade? &lt;i&gt;How Not to Die Alone &lt;/i&gt;is about the importance of taking a chance in those moments when we have the most to lose. Sharp and funny, warm and real, it's the kind of big-hearted story we all need.</description>

  <description>Meredith Hunt is content with her solo life. She owns and runs a successful Pilates studio, volunteers at the high school every week, and recently bought a house. She can take care of herself, which is good because she has a hard time relying on other people. When she's mugged and a handsome man comes to her rescue, she doesn't know how to accept his help-or how to stop staring into his chocolate-brown eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ace Vance moved to Bridgeport to offer his fifteen-year-old son, Finn, a better life. Here, Finn has a chance to play football for a good team and maybe even earn a college scholarship. And Ace scored a job at a top-notch garage, where he gets to fix up classic cars. Plus, they could both use some distance from Finn's toxic mom. The last thing on his mind is falling in love, but he can't help offering assistance to a gorgeous redhead in need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrown together by a careless criminal, Meredith and Ace can't deny their attraction. But can they open their hearts-and their lives-to make room for love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shelley Shepard Gray's Bridgeport Social Club series explores how communities can come together to support each other, whether it's around a poker table, in a Pilates studio, or anywhere in between. Get ready to fall in love with a group of men and women who, even when they feel lost, refuse to lose hope.</description>

  <description>Melville Heights is one of the nicest neighbourhoods in Bristol, England; home to doctors and lawyers and old-money academics. It’s not the sort of place where people are brutally murdered in their own kitchens. But it is the sort of place where everyone has a secret. And everyone is watching you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the headmaster credited with turning around the local school, Tom Fitzwilliam is beloved by one and all—including Joey Mullen, his new neighbor, who quickly develops an intense infatuation with this thoroughly charming yet unavailable man. Joey thinks her crush is a secret, but Tom’s teenaged son Freddie—a prodigy with aspirations of becoming a spy for MI5—excels in observing people and has witnessed Joey behaving strangely around his father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of Tom’s students, Jenna Tripp, also lives on the same street, and she’s not convinced her teacher is as squeaky clean as he seems. For one thing, he has taken a particular liking to her best friend and fellow classmate, and Jenna’s mother—whose mental health has admittedly been deteriorating in recent years—is convinced that Mr. Fitzwilliam is stalking her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, twenty years earlier, a schoolgirl writes in her diary, charting her doomed obsession with a handsome young English teacher named Mr. Fitzwilliam…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Poet Ocean Vuong's debut novel is a shattering portrait of a family, a first love, and the redemptive power of storytelling.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous&lt;/i&gt; is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born — a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, &lt;i&gt;On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous&lt;/i&gt; is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and how to make of it a kind of joy, powers the most important debut novel of many years.</description>

  <description>For fans of Maria Semple and Rainbow Rowell, a comedy-drama for the digital age: an epistolary debut novel about the ties that bind and break our hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iris Massey is gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;But she’s left something behind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For four years, Iris Massey worked side by side with PR maven Smith Simonyi, helping clients perfect their brands. But Iris has died, taken by terminal illness at only thirty-three. Adrift without his friend and colleague, Smith is surprised to discover that in her last six months, Iris created a blog filled with sharp and often funny musings on the end of a life not quite fulfilled. She also made one final request: for Smith to get her posts published as a book. With the help of his charmingly eager, if overbearingly forthright, new intern Carl, Smith tackles the task of fulfilling Iris’s last wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before he can do so, though, he must get the approval of Iris’ big sister Jade, an haute cuisine chef who’s been knocked sideways by her loss. Each carrying their own baggage, Smith and Jade end up on a collision course with their own unresolved pasts and with each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in a series of e-mails, blog posts, online therapy submissions, text messages, legal correspondence, home-rental bookings, and other snippets of our virtual lives, &lt;em&gt;When You Read This&lt;/em&gt; is a deft, captivating romantic comedy—funny, tragic, surprising, and bittersweet—that candidly reveals how we find new beginnings after loss.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A witty, informative guide to writing "good English" from Random House's longtime copy chief and one of Twitter's leading enforcers of proper grammar--a twenty-first-century &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Elements of Style.&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As authoritative as it is amusing, this book distills everything Benjamin Dreyer has learned from the hundreds of books he has copyedited, including works by Elizabeth Strout, E. L. Doctorow, and Frank Rich, into a useful guide not just for writers but for everyone who wants to put their best foot forward in writing prose. Dreyer offers lessons on the ins and outs of punctuation and grammar, including how to navigate the words he calls "the confusables," like tricky homophones; the myriad ways to use (and misuse) a comma; and how to recognize--though not necessarily do away with--the passive voice. (Hint: If you can plausibly add "by zombies" to the end of a sentence, it's passive.) People are sharing their writing more than ever--on blogs, on Twitter--and this book lays out, clearly and comprehensibly, everything writers can do to keep readers focused on the real reason writers write: to communicate their ideas clearly and effectively. Chock-full of advice, insider wisdom, and fun facts on the rules (and nonrules) of the English language, this book will prove invaluable to everyone who wants to shore up their writing skills, mandatory for people who spend their time editing and shaping other people's prose, and--perhaps best of all--an utter treat for anyone who simply revels in language.</description>

  <description>Trailblazing food writer and beloved restaurant critic Ruth Reichl took the job (and the risk) of a lifetime when she entered the glamorous, high-stakes world of magazine publishing. Now, for the first time, she chronicles her groundbreaking tenure as editor in chief of &lt;i&gt;Gourmet,&lt;/i&gt; during which she spearheaded a revolution in the way we think about food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Condé Nast offered Ruth Reichl the top position at America's oldest epicurean magazine, she declined. She was a writer, not a manager, and had no inclination to be anyone's boss. And yet . . . Reichl had been reading &lt;i&gt;Gourmet&lt;/i&gt; since she was eight; it had inspired her career. How could she say no?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of a former Berkeley hippie entering the corporate world and worrying about losing her soul. It is the story of the moment restaurants became an important part of popular culture, a time when the rise of the farm-to-table movement changed, forever, the way we eat. Readers will meet legendary chefs like David Chang and Eric Ripert, idiosyncratic writers like David Foster Wallace, and a colorful group of editors and art directors who, under Reichl's leadership, transformed stately &lt;i&gt;Gourmet &lt;/i&gt;into a cutting-edge publication. This was the golden age of print media—the last spendthrift gasp before the Internet turned the magazine world upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete with recipes, &lt;i&gt;Save Me the Plums&lt;/i&gt; is a personal journey of a woman coming to terms with being in charge and making a mark, following a passion and holding on to her dreams—even when she ends up in a place she never expected to be.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Evicted&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Nickel and Dimed&lt;/i&gt; in Stephanie Land's memoir about working as a maid, a beautiful and gritty exploration of poverty in America. Includes a foreword by Barbara Ehrenreich. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"My daughter learned to walk in a homeless shelter."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the gap between upper middle-class Americans and the working poor widens, grueling low-wage domestic and service work--primarily done by women--fuels the economic success of the wealthy. Stephanie Land worked for years as a maid, pulling long hours while struggling as a single mom to keep a roof over her daughter's head. In &lt;i&gt;Maid,&lt;/i&gt; she reveals the dark truth of what it takes to survive and thrive in today's inequitable society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While she worked hard to scratch her way out of poverty as a single parent, scrubbing the toilets of the wealthy, navigating domestic labor jobs, higher education, assisted housing, and a tangled web of government assistance, Stephanie wrote. She wrote the true stories that weren't being told. The stories of overworked and underpaid Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in honest, heart-rending prose and with great insight, &lt;i&gt;Maid&lt;/i&gt; explores the underbelly of upper-middle class America and the reality of what it's like to be in service to them. "I'd become a nameless ghost," Stephanie writes. With this book, she gives voice to the "servant" worker, those who fight daily to scramble and scrape by for their own lives and the lives of their children.</description>

  <description>This debut novel by an Arab-American voice,takes us inside the lives of conservative Arab women living in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Brooklyn, eighteen-year-old Deya is starting to meet with suitors. Though she doesn’t want to get married, her grandparents give her no choice. History is repeating itself: Deya’s mother, Isra, also had no choice when she left Palestine as a teenager to marry Adam. Though Deya was raised to believe her parents died in a car accident, a secret note from a mysterious, yet familiar-looking woman makes Deya question everything she was told about her past. As the narrative alternates between the lives of Deya and Isra, she begins to understand the dark, complex secrets behind her community.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What if you had a second chance at first love?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annika Rose likes being alone. &lt;br /&gt;She feels lost in social situations, saying the wrong thing or acting the wrong way. She just can't read people. She prefers the quiet solitude of books or playing chess to being around others. Apart from Jonathan. She liked being around him, but she hasn't seen him for ten years. Until now that is. And she's not sure he'll want to see her again after what happened all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annika Rose likes being alone. &lt;br /&gt;Except that, actually, she doesn't like being alone at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Girl He Used to Know&lt;/i&gt; is an uplifting novel full of surprising revelations that keep you turning the page. &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Perfect for fans of Jojo Moyes, Gail Honeyman, Jill Santopolo and &lt;i&gt;Sliding Doors.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Lara’s searingly honest account of her astonishing rise from hopeless underdog to Mongol Derby Champion leaves grit in your teeth and dust in your hair. I laughed, I cried and I felt every bruise. I was riveted til the last word and left with lasting daydreams of Mongolian horizons."&lt;/b&gt;—Felicity Aston, author of &lt;i&gt;Alone in Antarctica, The First Woman To See Solo Across the Southern Ice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the age of nineteen, Lara Prior-Palmer discovered a website devoted to “the world’s longest, toughest horse race”—an annual competition of endurance and skill that involves dozens of riders racing a series of twenty-five wild ponies across 1,000 kilometers of Mongolian grassland. On a whim, she decided to enter the race. As she boarded a plane to East Asia, she was utterly unprepared for what awaited her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riders often spend years preparing to compete in the Mongol Derby, a course that recreates the horse messenger system developed by Genghis Khan, and many fail to finish. Prior-Palmer had no formal training. She was driven by her own restlessness, stubbornness, and a lifelong love of horses. She raced for ten days through extreme heat and terrifying storms, catching a few hours of sleep where she could at the homes of nomadic families. Battling bouts of illness and dehydration, exhaustion and bruising falls, she decided she had&lt;br /&gt;nothing to lose. Each dawn she rode out again on a fresh horse, scrambling up mountains, swimming through rivers, crossing woodlands and wetlands, arid dunes and open steppe, as American television crews chased her in their Jeeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told with terrific suspense and style, in a voice full of poetry and soul, &lt;i&gt;Rough Magic&lt;/i&gt; captures the extraordinary story of one young woman who forged ahead, against all odds, to become the first female winner of this breathtaking race.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In an exuberant picture book, a glimpse of costumed mermaids leaves one boy flooded with wonder and ready to dazzle the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While riding the subway home from the pool with his abuela one day, Julián notices three women spectacularly dressed up. Their hair billows in brilliant hues, their dresses end in fishtails, and their joy fills the train car. When Julián gets home, daydreaming of the magic he's seen, all he can think about is dressing up just like the ladies in his own fabulous mermaid costume: a periwinkle curtain for his tail, the fronds of a potted fern for his headdress. But what will Abuela think about the mess he makes—and even more importantly, what will she think about how Julián sees himself? Mesmerizing and full of heart, Jessica Love's author-illustrator debut is a jubilant picture of self-love and a radiant celebration of individuality.</description>

  <description>For most of high school, Bijan Majidi has flown under the radar. He gets good grades, reads comics, hangs out with his best friend, Sean, and secretly crushes on Elle, one of the most popular girls in his school. When he’s called off the basketball team’s varsity bench and makes the winning basket in a playoff game, everything changes in an instant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not everyone is happy that Bijan is the man of the hour: an anonymous cyberbully sends the entire school a picture of Bijan photoshopped to look like a terrorist. His mother is horrified, and the school administration is outraged. They promise to find and punish the culprit. All Bijan wants is to pretend it never happened and move on, but the incident isn’t so easily erased. Though many of his classmates rally behind Bijan, some don’t want him or his type to be a part of their school. And Bijan’s finding out it’s not always easy to tell your enemies from your friends . . .</description>

  <description>A sweeping and enchanting new novel from the widely beloved, award-winning author Elizabeth McCracken about three generations of an unconventional New England family who own and operate a candlepin bowling alley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the day she is discovered unconscious in a New England cemetery at the turn of the twentieth century—nothing but a bowling ball, a candlepin, and fifteen pounds of gold on her person—Bertha Truitt is an enigma to everyone in Salford, Massachusetts. She has no past to speak of, or at least none she is willing to reveal, and her mysterious origin scandalizes and intrigues the townspeople, as does her choice to marry and start a family with Leviticus Sprague, the doctor who revived her. But Bertha is plucky, tenacious, and entrepreneurial, and the bowling alley she opens quickly becomes Salford’s most defining landmark—with Bertha its most notable resident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Bertha dies in a freak accident, her past resurfaces in the form of a heretofore-unheard-of son, who arrives in Salford claiming he is heir apparent to Truitt Alleys. Soon it becomes clear that, even in her death, Bertha’s defining spirit and the implications of her obfuscations live on, infecting and affecting future generations through inheritance battles, murky paternities, and hidden wills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a voice laced with insight and her signature sharp humor, Elizabeth McCracken has written an epic family saga set against the backdrop of twentieth-century America. &lt;em&gt;Bowlaway&lt;/em&gt; is both a stunning feat of language and a brilliant unraveling of a family’s myths and secrets, its passions and betrayals, and the ties that bind and the rifts that divide. </description>

  <description>Cadence is a parable of a business owner and triathlon coach named JJ who left his stable job as a teacher to fulfill his dream of becoming an entrepreneur. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, two years after opening his bike shop, JJ finds himself in a place that is all too familiar to most business owners―struggling to stay afloat. That all changes, fast, when an athlete he coaches teaches him how to turn the store’s profitability around with seven key “10% Wins.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cadence uniquely communicates entrepreneur and advisor Pete Williams’s “7 Levers” approach to business growth through the vehicle of a story. Instead of offering a list of do’s and don’ts for business success, Cadence imparts wisdom by inviting readers on a journey into the lives of two characters who each have something valuable to teach the other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the use of down-to-earth dialogue and realistic business challenges, readers will immediately be pulled into the story of JJ and Charlie, and how they each learn to hit their stride and turn profitability around.</description>

  <description>Reclusive literary legend M. M. “Mimi” Banning has been holed up in her Bel Air mansion for years, but now she’s writing her first book in decades and to ensure timely completion her publisher sends an assistant to monitor her progress. Mimi reluctantly complies—with a few stipulations: No Ivy Leaguers or English majors. Must drive, cook, tidy. Computer whiz. Good with kids. Quiet, discreet, sane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Alice Whitley arrives at the Banning mansion, she’s put to work right away—as a full-time companion to Frank, the writer’s eccentric nine-year-old, a boy with the wit of Noël Coward, the wardrobe of a 1930s movie star, and very little in common with his fellow fourth graders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she gets to know Frank, Alice becomes consumed with finding out who his father is, how his gorgeous “piano teacher and itinerant male role model” Xander fits into the Banning family equation—and whether Mimi will ever finish that book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of heart and countless only-in-Hollywood moments,&lt;i&gt; Be Frank With Me&lt;/i&gt; is a captivating and heartwarming story of an unusual mother and son, and the intrepid young woman who finds herself irresistibly pulled into their unforgettable world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heartwarming and refreshing debut novel that proves one thing: there's not enough data in the world to predict what will make your heart tick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Lane thinks math is the only thing that unites the universe. She comes up with algorithms to predict customer purchases — a job that has given her more money than she knows what to do with, and way less experience in the dating department than the average thirty-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't help that Stella has Asperger's and French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth cleaned by pilot fish. Her conclusion: she needs lots of practice — with a professional. Which is why she hires escort Michael Phan. The Vietnamese and Swedish stunner can't afford to turn down Stella's offer, and agrees to help her check off all the boxes on her lesson plan — from foreplay to more-than-missionary position...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Stella not only learns to appreciate his kisses, but to crave all the other things he's making her feel. Soon, their no-nonsense partnership starts making a strange kind of sense. And the pattern that emerges will convince Stella that love is the best kind of logic...</description>

  <description>Two-year-old Greta Greene was sitting with her grandmother on a park bench on the Upper West Side of Manhattan when a brick crumbled from a windowsill overhead, striking her unconscious. She is immediately rushed to the hospital. &lt;i&gt;Once More We Saw Stars&lt;/i&gt; begins with this event, leading the reader into the unimaginable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But although it begins with the anguish Jayson and his wife Stacy confront in the wake of their daughter’s trauma and the hours leading up to her death, it quickly becomes a narrative that is as much about hope and healing as it is about grief and loss. Jayson recognizes, even in the very midst of his ordeal, that there will be a life for him beyond it—that if only he can continue moving forward, from one moment to the next, he will survive what seems un-survivable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With raw honesty, deep emotion, and exquisite tenderness, he captures both the fragility of life and absoluteness of death, and most important of all, the unconquerable power of love. This is an unforgettable memoir of courage and transformation—and a book that will change the way you look at the world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A mother’s advice to her daughter—a guide to daily living, both practical and sublime—with full-color illustrations throughout.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One sleepless night while she was in her early twenties, illustrator/writer Hallie Bateman had a painful realization: Someday, her mother would be gone. The prospect was devastating, and also scary—how would she navigate the world without the person who gave her life? She thought about all the motherly advice she would miss—advice that could help her through the challenges to come, including the ordeal of losing a parent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, Hallie asked her mother, writer Suzy Hopkins, to record step-by-step instructions for her to follow in the event of her mom’s death. The list began: “Pour yourself a stiff glass of whiskey and make some fajitas” and continued from there, addressing issues great and small—from choosing a life partner to baking a quiche. The project became a way for mother and daughter to discuss everyday realities with humor, openness, and gratitude. It led to this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combining Suzy’s witty and heartfelt advice with Hallie’s quirky and colorful style, &lt;i&gt;What to Do When I’m Gone&lt;/i&gt; is the illustrated instruction manual for getting through life without one’s mom. It’s also a poignant look at loss, love, and taking things one moment at a time. By turns whimsical, funny, touching, and pragmatic, it will leave readers laughing and teary-eyed. And it will spur conversations that enrich family members’ understanding of one another.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The next novel of psychological suspense and obsession from the authors of the blockbuster bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seeking women ages 18–32 to participate in a study on ethics and morality. Generous compensation. Anonymity guaranteed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jessica Farris signs up for a psychology study conducted by the mysterious Dr. Shields, she thinks all she’ll have to do is answer a few questions, collect her money, and leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #1: Could you tell a lie without feeling guilt?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the questions grow more and more intense and invasive and the sessions become outings where Jess is told what to wear and how to act, she begins to feel as though Dr. Shields may know what she’s thinking… and what she’s hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #2: Have you ever deeply hurt someone you care about?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jess’s paranoia grows, it becomes clear that she can no longer trust what in her life is real, and what is one of Dr. Shields’ manipulative experiments. Caught in a web of deceit and jealousy, Jess quickly learns that some obsessions can be deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #3: Should a punishment always fit the crime?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the authors of the blockbuster bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; comes an electrifying new novel about doubt, passion, and just how much you can trust someone.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling author, psychotherapist, and national advice columnist, a hilarious, thought-provoking, and surprising new book that takes us behind the scenes of a therapist's world--where her patients are looking for answers (and so is she).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One day, Lori Gottlieb is a therapist who helps patients in her Los Angeles practice. The next, a crisis causes her world to come crashing down. Enter Wendell, the quirky but seasoned therapist in whose office she suddenly lands. With his balding head, cardigan, and khakis, he seems to have come straight from Therapist Central Casting. Yet he will turn out to be anything but.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her patients' lives -- a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen threatening to end her life on her birthday if nothing gets better, and a twenty-something who can't stop hooking up with the wrong guys -- she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very ones she is now bringing to Wendell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With startling wisdom and humor, Gottlieb invites us into her world as both clinician and patient, examining the truths and fictions we tell ourselves and others as we teeter on the tightrope between love and desire, meaning and mortality, guilt and redemption, terror and courage, hope and change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Maybe You Should Talk to Someone &lt;/i&gt;is revolutionary in its candor, offering a deeply personal yet universal tour of our hearts and minds and providing the rarest of gifts: a boldly revealing portrait of what it means to be human, and a disarmingly funny and illuminating account of our own mysterious lives and our power to transform them.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

To my happy surprise, Lori Gottlieb’s book was one I couldn’t put down—I read it for a couple of days almost non-stop.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An incredibly timely, terrifically witty and moving debut about a young writer's assistant on a late night comedy show and what transpires when she accepts an invitation from its enigmatic host to spend a long weekend at his mansion in Connecticut.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June Bloom is a broke, cynical twenty-nine-year-old writer's assistant on the late-night comedy show, &lt;i&gt;Stay Up with Hugo Best. &lt;/i&gt;Hugo Best is in his sixties, a beloved icon of TV and humor, and a notorious womanizer. After he unexpectedly retires and a party is held for his now unemployed staff, June ends up at a dive bar for an open-mic night and prepares for the sad return to the anonymous comedian lifestyle. What she’s not prepared for is a run-in with Hugo at that dive bar. Nor for the invitation that swiftly follows: Hugo asks June to come to his mansion in Greenwich for the long Memorial Day weekend. “No funny business,” he insists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June, in need of a job and money, confident she can handle herself, but secretly harboring the remains of a childhood crush on the charming older comedian and former role model, accepts. The exact terms of the visit are never spelled out, but June is realistic and clear-eyed enough to guess. Even so, as the weekend unfolds and the enigmatic Hugo gradually reveals himself, their dynamic proves to be much more complicated and less predictable than she expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At once hilarious and poignant, brilliantly incisive and terrifically propulsive, &lt;i&gt;Stay Up with Hugo Best &lt;/i&gt;is an incredibly timely exploration of sexual politics in the #MeToo age, and the unforgettable story of one young woman’s poignant stumbling into adulthood.</description>

  <description>New York, 1993. Seventeen-year-old Lucy Adler, a street-smart, trash-talking baller, is often the only girl on the public courts. At turns quixotic and cynical, insecure and self-possessed, Lucy is in unrequited love with her best friend and pick-up teammate Percy, scion to a prominent New York family who insists he wishes to resist upper crust fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she navigates this complex relationship with all its youthful heartache, Lucy is seduced by a different kind of life—one less consumed by conventional success and the approval of men. A pair of provocative female artists living in what remains of New York’s bohemia invite her into their world, but soon even their paradise begins to show cracks.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bridget Jones’s Diary&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Americanah&lt;/i&gt; in this disarmingly honest, boldly political, and truly inclusive novel that will speak to anyone who has gone looking for love and found something very different in its place.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Queenie Jenkins is a 25-year-old Jamaican British woman living in London, straddling two cultures and slotting neatly into neither. She works at a national newspaper, where she’s constantly forced to compare herself to her white middle class peers. After a messy break up from her long-term white boyfriend, Queenie seeks comfort in all the wrong places…including several hazardous men who do a good job of occupying brain space and a bad job of affirming self-worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Queenie careens from one questionable decision to another, she finds herself wondering, “What are you doing? Why are you doing it? Who do you want to be?”—all of the questions today’s woman must face in a world trying to answer them for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With “fresh and honest” (Jojo Moyes) prose, &lt;i&gt;Queenie&lt;/i&gt; is a remarkably relatable exploration of what it means to be a modern woman searching for meaning in today’s world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How much can a family forgive?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A profoundly moving novel about two neighboring families in a suburban town, the bond between their children, a tragedy that reverberates over four decades, the daily intimacies of marriage, and the power of forgiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Francis Gleeson and Brian Stanhope, two rookie cops in the NYPD, live next door to each other outside the city. What happens behind closed doors in both houses—the loneliness of Francis’s wife, Lena, and the instability of Brian’s wife, Anne—sets the stage for the explosive events to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ask Again, Yes&lt;/i&gt; is a deeply affecting exploration of the lifelong friendship and love that blossoms between Francis and Lena’s daughter, Kate, and Brian and Anne’s son, Peter. Luminous, heartbreaking, and redemptive, &lt;i&gt;Ask Again, Yes&lt;/i&gt; reveals the way childhood memories change when viewed from the distance of adulthood—villains lose their menace and those who appeared innocent seem less so. Kate and Peter’s love story, while tested by echoes from the past, is marked by tenderness, generosity, and grace.</description>

  <description>After years of chasing the American dream, the Zhen family has moved back to China. Settling into a luxurious serviced apartment in Shanghai, Wei, Lina, and their daughter, Karen, join an elite community of Chinese-born, Western-educated professionals who have returned to a radically transformed city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One morning, in the eighth tower of Lanson Suites, Lina discovers that a childhood keepsake, an ivory bracelet, has gone missing. The incident contributes to a wave of unease that has begun to settle throughout the Zhen household. Wei, a marketing strategist, bows under the guilt of not having engaged in nobler work. Meanwhile, Lina, lonely in her new life of leisure, assumes the modern moniker taitai--a housewife who does no housework at all. She spends her days haunted by the circumstances surrounding her arranged marriage to Wei and her lingering feelings for his brother, Qiang. Lina and Wei take pains to hide their anxieties, but their housekeeper, Sunny, a hardworking girl with secrets of her own, bears witness to their struggles. When Qiang reappears in Shanghai after decades on the run with a local gang, the family must finally come to terms with the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a silk-producing village in rural China, up the corporate ladder in suburban America, and back again to the post-Maoist nouveau riche of modern Shanghai, WHAT WE WERE PROMSED explores the question of what we owe to our country, our families, and ourselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Shortlisted for the British Book Award - Fiction Book of the Year and the Orwell Prize for Political Writing &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the Best Books of the Year: New York Public Library, &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second novel in the Man Booker Prize-nominated author's Seasonal cycle; the much-anticipated follow-up to &lt;i&gt;Autumn&lt;/i&gt; (a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;, NPR, &lt;i&gt;Financial Times&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Southern Living&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt; best book of the year).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter. Bleak. Frosty wind, earth as iron, water as stone, so the old song goes. And now Art's mother is seeing things. Come to think of it, Art's seeing things himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When four people, strangers and family, converge on a fifteen-bedroom house in Cornwall for Christmas, will there be enough room for everyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter. It makes things visible. Ali Smith's shapeshifting &lt;i&gt;Winter&lt;/i&gt; casts a warm, wise, merry and uncompromising eye over a post-truth era in a story rooted in history and memory and with a taproot deep in the evergreens, art and love.</description>

  <description>In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</description>

      <![CDATA[BECOMING is an invigorating, emotional, and eye-opening read. Learning about Michelle’s life in and out of the spotlight was such a joy; her candid accounts of what it was to live as the First Lady feed into many Americans’ curiosity about what things are “really” like in the White House.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Discover how mindfulness can help you with healing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than twenty years ago, Jon Kabat-Zinn showed us the value of cultivating greater awareness in everyday life with his now-classic introduction to mindfulness, &lt;i&gt;Wherever You Go, There You Are&lt;/i&gt;. Now, in &lt;i&gt;The Healing Power of Mindfulness&lt;/i&gt;, he shares a cornucopia of specific examples as to how the cultivation of mindfulness can reshape your relationship with your own body and mind--explaining what we're learning about neuroplasticity and the brain, how meditation can affect our biology and our health, and what mindfulness can teach us about coming to terms with all sorts of life challenges, including our own mortality, so we can make the most of the moments that we have. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Originally published in 2005 as part of a larger book titled &lt;i&gt;Coming to Our Senses&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Healing Power of Mindfulness &lt;/i&gt;features a new foreword by the author and timely updates throughout the text. If you are interested in learning more about how mindfulness &lt;i&gt;as a way of being&lt;/i&gt; can help us to heal, physically and emotionally, look no further than this deeply personal and also "deeply optimistic book, grounded in good science and filled with practical recommendations for moving in the right direction" (Andrew Weil, MD), from one of the pioneers of the worldwide mindfulness movement.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; From Out of the Binders co-founder Lux Alptraum, a controversial look at women, sex, and lying--why myths about women's deceit persist, how they came to be, and ultimately why we must trust women &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we talk about sex, we talk about women as mysterious, deceptive, and - above all - untrustworthy. Women lie about orgasms. Women lie about being virgins. Women lie about who got them pregnant, about whether they were raped, about how many people they've had sex with and what sort of experiences they've had - the list goes on and on. Over and over we're reminded that, on dates, in relationships, and especially in the bedroom, women just aren't telling the truth. But where does this assumption come from? Are women actually lying about sex, or does society just think we are?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Faking It&lt;/i&gt;, Lux Alptraum tackles the topic of seemingly dishonest women; investigating whether women actually lie, and what social situations might encourage deceptions both great and small. Using her experience as a sex educator and former CEO of Fleshbot (the foremost blog on sexuality), first-hand interviews with sexuality experts and everyday women, Alptraum raises important questions: are lying women all that common - or is the idea of the dishonest woman a symptom of male paranoia? Are women trying to please men, or just avoid their anger? And what affect does all this dishonesty - whether real or imagined - have on women's self-images, social status, and safety?&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Through it all, Alptraum posits that even if women are lying, we're doing it for very good reason--to protect ourselves ("My boyfriend will be here any minute," to a creep who won't go away, for one), and in situations where society has given us no other choice.</description>

  <description>John Fried's THE MARTIN CHRONICLES, pitched as in the vein of Tom Perrotta's BAD HAIRCUT and the movie BOYHOOD, set in 1980s Manhattan, about a boy from age eleven to seventeen as he runs into a series of life-changing firsts: first kiss, first enemies, first love, first death, and ultimately, his first awareness that the world is not as simple or as safe a place as he once imagined, to Karen Kosztolnyik in her first deal at Grand Central, in a pre-empt, by Mitch Hoffman at Aaron Priest Literary Agency (NA).</description>

  <description>On the morning of April 29, 1986, a fire alarm sounded in the Los Angeles Public Library. As the moments passed, the patrons and staff who had been cleared out of the building realized this was not the usual fire alarm. As one fireman recounted, “Once that first stack got going, it was ‘Goodbye, Charlie.’” The fire was disastrous: it reached 2000 degrees and burned for more than seven hours. By the time it was extinguished, it had consumed four hundred thousand books and damaged seven hundred thousand more. Investigators descended on the scene, but more than thirty years later, the mystery remains: Did someone purposefully set fire to the library—and if so, who?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaving her lifelong love of books and reading into an investigation of the fire, award-winning &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; reporter and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Susan Orlean delivers a mesmerizing and uniquely compelling book that manages to tell the broader story of libraries and librarians in a way that has never been done before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Library Book&lt;/i&gt;, Orlean chronicles the LAPL fire and its aftermath to showcase the larger, crucial role that libraries play in our lives; delves into the evolution of libraries across the country and around the world, from their humble beginnings as a metropolitan charitable initiative to their current status as a cornerstone of national identity; brings each department of the library to vivid life through on-the-ground reporting; studies arson and attempts to burn a copy of a book herself; reflects on her own experiences in libraries; and reexamines the case of Harry Peak, the blond-haired actor long suspected of setting fire to the LAPL more than thirty years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, Orlean introduces us to an unforgettable cast of characters from libraries past and present—from Mary Foy, who in 1880 at eighteen years old was named the head of the Los Angeles Public Library at a time when men still dominated the role, to Dr. C.J.K. Jones, a pastor, citrus farmer, and polymath known as “The Human Encyclopedia” who roamed the library dispensing information; from Charles Lummis, a wildly eccentric journalist and adventurer who was determined to make the L.A. library one of the best in the world, to the current staff, who do heroic work every day to ensure that their institution remains a vital part of the city it serves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brimming with her signature wit, insight, compassion, and talent for deep research, &lt;i&gt;The Library Book&lt;/i&gt; is Susan Orlean’s thrilling journey through the stacks that reveals how these beloved institutions provide much more than just books—and why they remain an essential part of the heart, mind, and soul of our country. It is also a master journalist’s reminder that, perhaps especially in the digital era, they are more necessary than ever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A searing poetic memoir and call to action from the bestselling and award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Speak&lt;/i&gt;, Laurie Halse Anderson!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling author Laurie Halse Anderson is known for the unflinching way she writes about, and advocates for, survivors of sexual assault. Now, inspired by her fans and enraged by how little in our culture has changed since her groundbreaking novel &lt;i&gt;Speak&lt;/i&gt; was first published twenty years ago, she has written a poetry memoir that is as vulnerable as it is rallying, as timely as it is timeless. In free verse, Anderson shares reflections, rants, and calls to action woven between deeply personal stories from her life that she's never written about before. Searing and soul-searching, this important memoir is a denouncement of our society's failures and a love letter to all the people with the courage to say #metoo and #timesup, whether aloud, online, or only in their own hearts. &lt;i&gt;Shout&lt;/i&gt; speaks truth to power in a loud, clear voice-- and once you hear it, it is impossible to ignore.</description>

  <description>The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Flight Behavior, The Lacuna,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Poisonwood Bible&lt;/em&gt; and recipient of numerous literary awards—including the National Humanities Medal, the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, and the Orange Prize—returns with a timely novel that interweaves past and present to explore the human capacity for resiliency and compassion in times of great upheaval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willa Knox has always prided herself on being the embodiment of responsibility for her family. Which is why it’s so unnerving that she’s arrived at middle age with nothing to show for her hard work and dedication but a stack of unpaid bills and an inherited brick home in Vineland, New Jersey, that is literally falling apart. The magazine where she worked has folded, and the college where her husband had tenure has closed. The dilapidated house is also home to her ailing and cantankerous Greek father-in-law and her two grown children: her stubborn, free-spirited daughter, Tig, and her dutiful debt-ridden, ivy educated son, Zeke, who has arrived with his unplanned baby in the wake of a life-shattering development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an act of desperation, Willa begins to investigate the history of her home, hoping that the local historical preservation society might take an interest and provide funding for its direly needed repairs. Through her research into Vineland’s past and its creation as a Utopian community, she discovers a kindred spirit from the 1880s, Thatcher Greenwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A science teacher with a lifelong passion for honest investigation, Thatcher finds himself under siege in his community for telling the truth: his employer forbids him to speak of the exciting new theory recently published by Charles Darwin. Thatcher’s friendships with a brilliant woman scientist and a renegade newspaper editor draw him into a vendetta with the town’s most powerful men. At home, his new wife and status-conscious mother-in-law bristle at the risk of scandal, and dismiss his financial worries and the news that their elegant house is structurally unsound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliantly executed and compulsively listenable, &lt;em&gt;Unsheltered&lt;/em&gt; is the story of two families, in two centuries, who live at the corner of Sixth and Plum, as they navigate the challenges of surviving a world in the throes of major cultural shifts. In this mesmerizing story told in alternating chapters, Willa and Thatcher come to realize that though the future is uncertain, even unnerving, shelter can be found in the bonds of kindred—whether family or friends—and in the strength of the human spirit.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Every day a new body. Every day a new life. Every day a new choice.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as A can remember, life has meant waking up in a different person's body every day, forced to live as that person until the day ended. A always thought there wasn't anyone else who had a life like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But A was wrong. There are others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A has already been wrestling with powerful feelings of love and loneliness. Now comes an understanding of the extremes that love and loneliness can lead to—and what it's like to discover that you are not alone in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Someday&lt;/i&gt;, David Levithan takes readers further into the lives of A, Rhiannon, Nathan, and the person they may think they know as Reverend Poole, exploring more deeply the questions at the core of Every Day and Another Day: What is a soul? And what makes us human?</description>

      <![CDATA[I love David Levithan‘s Every Day series. This volume, the third, zooms out a bit so we can learn more about how and why people like a switch bodies—and what nefarious people might do was such power. SOMEDAY is a great read!]]>

  <description>Robinson's latest essay collection is a call to arms. She tackles a wide range of topics, such as giving feminism a tough-love talk in hopes it can become more intersectional; telling society's beauty standards to kick rocks; and demanding that toxic masculinity close its mouth and legs (enough with the manspreading already!), and get out of the way so true progress can happen.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Dear Martin&lt;/i&gt; comes this exploration of old friendships, new crushes, and the path to self-discovery.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courtney "Coop" Cooper&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dumped. Again. And normally I wouldn't mind. But right now, my best friend and source of solace, Jupiter Sanchez, is ignoring me to text some girl. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rae Evelyn Chin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assumed "new girl" would be synonymous with "pariah," but Jupiter and Courtney make me feel like I'm right where I belong. I also want to kiss him. And her. Which is . . . perplexing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jupiter Charity-Sanchez&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing worse than losing the girl you love to a boy is losing her to your boy. That means losing him, too. I have to make a move. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;One story.&lt;br /&gt;Three sides.&lt;br /&gt;No easy answers.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Wild Milk is like Borscht Belt meets Leonora Carrington; it’s like Donald Barthelme meets Pony Head; it’s like the Brothers Grimm meet Beckett in his swim trunks at the beach. In other words, this remarkable collection of stories is unlike anything else you’ve read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Sabrina Orah Mark is a writer of strangeness &amp;amp; tenderness &amp;amp; undeniable brilliance. I wanted to read this book aloud to everyone I’ve ever loved, &amp;amp; to fold it into a locket to keep close to my heart.” Elizabeth McCracken</description>

  <description>At school Connell and Marianne pretend not to know each other. He’s popular and well-adjusted, star of the school soccer team while she is lonely, proud, and intensely private. But when Connell comes to pick his mother up from her housekeeping job at Marianne’s house, a strange and indelible connection grows between the two teenagers—one they are determined to conceal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, they’re both studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Marianne has found her feet in a new social world while Connell hangs at the sidelines, shy and uncertain. Throughout their years in college, Marianne and Connell circle one another, straying toward other people and possibilities but always magnetically, irresistibly drawn back together. Then, as she veers into self-destruction and he begins to search for meaning elsewhere, each must confront how far they are willing to go to save the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Rooney brings her brilliant psychological acuity and perfectly spare prose to a story that explores the subtleties of class, the electricity of first love, and the complex entanglements of family and friendship.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For fans of Thirteen Reasons Why, This Is How It Ends, and All the Bright Places, comes a new novel about life after. How do you put yourself back together when it seems like you've lost it all?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May is a survivor. But she doesn't feel like one. She feels angry. And lost. And alone. Eleven months after the school shooting that killed her twin brother, May still doesn't know why she was the only one to walk out of the band room that day. No one gets what she went through--no one saw and heard what she did. No one can possibly understand how it feels to be her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zach lost his old life when his mother decided to defend the shooter. His girlfriend dumped him, his friends bailed, and now he spends his time hanging out with his little sister...and the one faithful friend who stuck around. His best friend is needy and demanding, but he won't let Zach disappear into himself. Which is how Zach ends up at band practice that night. The same night May goes with her best friend to audition for a new band. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is how May meets Zach. And how Zach meets May. And how both might figure out that surviving could be an option after all.</description>

  <description>In 1979, &lt;i&gt;Daisy Jones and The Six&lt;/i&gt; split up. Together, they had redefined the 70’s music scene, creating an iconic sound that rocked the world. Apart, they baffled a world that had hung on their every verse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is an attempt to piece together a clear portrait of the band’s rise to fame and their abrupt and infamous split. The following oral history is a compilation of interviews, emails, transcripts, and lyrics, all pertaining to the personal and professional lives of the members of the band The Six and singer Daisy Jones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have aimed for a comprehensive and exhaustive approach, I must acknowledge that full and complete accounts from all parties involved has proved impossible. Some people were easier to track down than others, some were more willing to talk than others, and some, unfortunately, have passed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of which is to say that while this is the first and only authorised account from all represented perspectives, it should be noted that, in matters both big and small, reasonable people disagree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth often lies, unclaimed, in the middle.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The executive chairman and former CEO of Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin Robbins reflects on the unique, results-oriented discipline he's developed over decades of leadership, which provides a blueprint for any organization to achieve prosperity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live in an era in which successful organizations can fail in a flash. But they can cope with change and thrive by creating a culture that supports positive pushback: questioning everything without disrespecting anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nigel Travis has forty years of experience as a leader in large and successful organizations, as well as those facing existential crisis-such as Blockbuster as it dawdled in the face of the Netflix challenge. In his ten years as CEO and chairman of Dunkin' Brands, Travis fine-tuned his ideas about the challenge culture and perfected the practices required to build it. He argues that the best way for organizations to succeed in today's environment is to embrace challenge and encourage pushback. Everyone-from the new recruit to the senior leader-must be given the freedom to speak up and question the status quo, must learn how to talk in a civil way about difficult issues, and should be encouraged to debate strategies and tactics-although always in the spirit of shared purpose. How else will new ideas emerge? How else can organizations steadily improve?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through colorful storytelling, with many examples from his own career-including his leadership in turning around the fear-ridden culture of the London-based Leyton Orient Football Club, of which he is part owner-Travis shows how to establish a culture that welcomes challenge, achieves exceptional results, and ensures a prosperous future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;American Housewife&lt;/i&gt; is back with a fiercely funny collection of essays on marriage and manners, thank-you notes and three-ways, ghosts, gunshots, gynecology, and the Calgon-scented, onion-dipped, monogrammed art of living as a Southern Lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helen Ellis has a mantra: "If you don't have something nice to say, say something not-so-nice in a nice way." Say "weathered" instead of "she looks like a cake left out in the rain." Say "early-developed" instead of "brace face and B cups." And for the love of Coke Salad, always say "Sorry you saw something that offended you" instead of "Get that stick out of your butt, Miss Prissy Pants." In these twenty-three raucous essays Ellis transforms herself into a dominatrix Donna Reed to save her marriage, inadvertently steals a $795 Burberry trench coat, witnesses a man fake his own death at a party, avoids a neck lift, and finds a black-tie gown that gives her the confidence of a drag queen. While she may have left her home in Alabama, married a New Yorker, forgotten how to drive, and abandoned the puffy headbands of her youth, Helen Ellis is clinging to her Southern accent like mayonnaise to white bread, and offering readers a hilarious, completely singular view on womanhood for both sides of the Mason-Dixon.</description>

  <description>Could ten days at a health resort really change you forever? In Liane Moriarty’s latest page-turner, nine perfect strangers are about to find out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nine people gather at a remote health resort. Some are here to lose weight, some are here to get a reboot on life, some are here for reasons they can’t even admit to themselves. Amidst all of the luxury and pampering, the mindfulness and meditation, they know these ten days might involve some real work. But none of them could imagine just how challenging the next ten days are going to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances Welty, the formerly best-selling romantic novelist, arrives at Tranquillum House nursing a bad back, a broken heart, and an exquisitely painful paper cut. She’s immediately intrigued by her fellow guests. Most of them don’t look to be in need of a health resort at all. But the person that intrigues her most is the strange and charismatic owner/director of Tranquillum House. Could this person really have the answers Frances didn’t even know she was seeking? Should Frances put aside her doubts and immerse herself in everything Tranquillum House has to offer – or should she run while she still can?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not long before every guest at Tranquillum House is asking exactly the same question.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A powerful, darkly glittering novel of violence, love, faith, and loss, as a young woman at an elite American university is drawn into acts of domestic terrorism by a cult tied to North Korea.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Phoebe Lin and Will Kendall meet their first month at prestigious Edwards University. Phoebe is a glamorous girl who doesn't tell anyone she blames herself for her mother's recent death. Will is a misfit scholarship boy who transfers to Edwards from Bible college, waiting tables to get by. What he knows for sure is that he loves Phoebe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Grieving and guilt-ridden, Phoebe is increasingly drawn into a religious group—a secretive extremist cult—founded by a charismatic former student, John Leal. He has an enigmatic past that involves North Korea and Phoebe's Korean American family. Meanwhile, Will struggles to confront the fundamentalism he's tried to escape, and the obsession consuming the one he loves. When the group bombs several buildings in the name of faith, killing five people, Phoebe disappears. Will devotes himself to finding her, tilting into obsession himself, seeking answers to what happened to Phoebe and if she could have been responsible for this violent act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Incendiaries&lt;/i&gt; is a fractured love story and a brilliant examination of the minds of extremist terrorists, and of what can happen to people who lose what they love most.</description>

  <description>Insomnia is on the rise. More than a third of all adults report experiencing it, with the figure climbing steeply among those over sixty-five. Marina Benjamin takes on her personal experience of the condition--her struggles with it, her insomniac highs, and her dawning awareness that states of sleeplessness grant us valuable insights into the workings of our unconscious minds. Although insomnia is rarely entirely welcome, Benjamin treats it less as an affliction than as an encounter that she engages with and plumbs. She adds new dimensions to both our understanding of sleep (and going without it) and of night, of how we perceive darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, &lt;i&gt;Insomnia&lt;/i&gt; trips through illuminating material from literature, art, philosophy, psychology, pop culture, and more. Benjamin pays particular attention to the relationship between women and sleep--Penelope up all night, unraveling her day's weaving for Odysseus; the Pre-Raphaelite artists' depictions of deeply sleeping women; and the worries that keep contemporary females awake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Insomnia&lt;/i&gt; is an intense, lyrical, witty, and humane exploration of a state we too often consider only superficially. "This is the song of insomnia, and I shall sing it," Marina Benjamin declares.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A hilarious and nostalgic trip through the history of paperback pre-teen series of the '80s and '90s.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every twenty- or thirty-something woman knows these books. The pink covers, the flimsy paper, the zillion volumes in the series that kept you reading for your entire adolescence. Spurred by the commercial success of Sweet Valley High and The Babysitters Club, these were not the serious-issue YA novels of the 1970s, nor were they the blockbuster books of the Harry Potter and Twilight ilk. They were cheap, short, and utterly beloved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PAPERBACK CRUSH dives in deep to this golden age with affection, history, and a little bit of snark. Readers will discover (and fondly remember) girl-centric series on everything from correspondence (Pen Pals and Dear Diary) to sports (The Pink Parrots, Cheerleaders, and The Gymnasts) to a newspaper at an all-girls Orthodox Jewish middle school (The B.Y. Times) to a literal teen angel (Teen Angels: Heaven Can Wait, where an enterprising guardian angel named Cisco has to earn her wings “by helping the world’s sexist rock star.”) Some were blatant ripoffs of the successful series (looking at you, Sleepover Friends and The Girls of Canby Hall), some were sick-lit tearjerkers à la Love Story (Abby, My Love) and some were just plain perplexing (Uncle Vampire??) But all of them represent that time gone by of girl-power and endless sessions of sustained silent reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In six hilarious chapters (Friendship, Love, School, Family, Jobs, Terror, and Tragedy), Bustle Features Editor Gabrielle Moss takes the reader on a nostalgic tour of teen book covers of yore, digging deep into the history of the genre as well as the stories behind the best-known series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From bestselling author Patrick deWitt, a brilliant and darkly comic novel about a wealthy widow and her adult son who flee New York for Paris in the wake of scandal and financial disintegration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances Price – tart widow, possessive mother, and Upper East Side force of nature – is in dire straits, beset by scandal and impending bankruptcy. Her adult son Malcolm is no help, mired in a permanent state of arrested development. And then there’s the Prices' aging cat, Small Frank, who Frances believes houses the spirit of her late husband, an infamously immoral litigator and world-class cad whose gruesome tabloid death rendered Frances and Malcolm social outcasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting penury and pariahdom behind them, the family decides to cut their losses and head for the exit. One ocean voyage later, the curious trio land in their beloved Paris, the City of Light serving as a backdrop not for love or romance, but self destruction and economical ruin – to riotous effect. A number of singular characters serve to round out the cast: a bashful private investigator, an aimless psychic proposing a seance, a doctor who makes house calls with his wine merchant in tow, and the inimitable Mme. Reynard, aggressive houseguest and dementedly friendly American expat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brimming with pathos and wit, French Exit is a one-of-a-kind ‘tragedy of manners,’ a riotous send-up of high society, as well as a moving mother/son caper which only Patrick deWitt could conceive and execute</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A delightful, funny story of friendship, ghost chores, a spooky house and a professional haunter.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Sir Simon, Super Scarer. He's a professional ghost who has been transferred to his first house. And just in time! He was getting tired of haunting bus stops and forests and potatoes. And to top it off, this house is occupied by an old lady -- they're the easiest to haunt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things don't go as planned when it turns out a KID comes with this old lady. Chester spots Simon immediately and peppers him with questions. Simon is exasperated. . . until he realizes he can trick Chester into doing his ghost chores. Spooky sounds, footsteps in the attic, creaks on the stairs -- these things don't happen on their own, you know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a long night of haunting, it seems that maybe Chester isn't cut out to be a ghost, so Simon decides to help with Chester's human chores. Turns out Simon isn't cut out for human chores either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But maybe they're both cut out to be friends . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NATIONAL BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“I've spent my adult life prowling bookshelves for the modern-day reincarnation of my favorite authors—Nora Ephron, Erma Bombeck, Jean Kerr, and Laurie Colwin—all rolled into one...Good news: I have finally found their successor.” —Elisabeth Egan, &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acclaimed essayist and bookseller Mary Laura Philpott presents a charmingly relatable and wise memoir-in-essays about what happened after she checked off all the boxes on her successful life’s to-do list and realized she might need to reinvent the list—and herself. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Laura Philpott thought she’d cracked the code: Always be right, and you’ll always be happy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But once she’d completed her life’s to-do list (job, spouse, house, babies—check!), she found that instead of feeling content and successful, she felt anxious. Lost. Stuck in a daily grind of overflowing calendars, grueling small talk, and sprawling traffic. She’d done everything “right,” but she felt all wrong. What’s the worse failure, she wondered: smiling and staying the course, or blowing it all up and running away? And are those the only options?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this memoir-in-essays full of spot-on observations about home, work, and creative life, Philpott takes on the conflicting pressures of modern adulthood with wit and heart. She offers up her own stories to show that identity crises don’t happen just once or only at midlife; reassures us that small, recurring personal re-inventions are both normal and necessary; and advises that if you’re going to faint, you should get low to the ground first. Most of all, Philpott shows that when you stop feeling satisfied with your life, you don’t have to burn it all down and set off on a transcontinental hike (unless you want to, of course). You can call upon your many selves to figure out who you are, who you’re not, and where you belong. Who among us isn’t trying to do that?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like a pep talk from a sister, &lt;i&gt;I Miss You When I Blink&lt;/i&gt; is the funny, poignant, and deeply affecting book you’ll want to share with all your friends, as you learn what Philpott has figured out along the way: that multiple things can be true of us at once—and that sometimes doing things wrong is the way to do life right.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The "hilarious and poignant" story of one chronically anxious woman's quest to become braver by seeking out the kinds of experiences she's spent her life avoiding. &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;(Cheryl Strayed) &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;For most of her life (and even during her years as the host of a popular radio show), Courtenay Hameister lived in a state of near-constant dread and anxiety. She fretted about &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;. Her age. Her size. Her romantic prospects. How likely it was that she would get hit by a bus on the way home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Until a couple years ago, when, in her mid-forties, she decided to fight back against her debilitating anxieties by spending a year doing little things that scared her--things that the average person might consider doing for a half second before deciding: "nope." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Things like: attending a fellatio class. She did that. She also spent an afternoon in a sensory deprivation tank, got (legally) high in the middle of a workday, had a session with a professional cuddler, braved twenty-eight first dates, and (perhaps scariest of all) actually met someone who might possibly appreciate her for who she is.&lt;br /&gt;Refreshing, relatable, and pee-your-pants funny, &lt;i&gt;Okay Fine Whatever&lt;/i&gt; is Courtenay's hold-nothing-back account of her adventures on the front lines of Mere Human Woman vs. Fear, reminding us that even the tiniest amount of bravery is still bravery, and that no matter who you are, it's possible to fight complacency and become bold, or at least bold-ish, a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the highly acclaimed, bestselling National Book Award finalist and author of &lt;i&gt;A Short History of Women, &lt;/i&gt;a searing and timely novel about a teenaged girl, a charismatic teacher, and a dark, open secret.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were on a lark, three teenaged girls speeding across the greens on a “borrowed” golf cart, at night, drunk. The cart crashes and one of the girls lands violently in the rough, killed instantly. The driver, Jo, flees the hometown that has turned against her and enrolls at a prestigious boarding school. Her past weighs on her. She is responsible for the death of her best friend. She has tipped her parents’ rocky marriage into demise. She is ready to begin again, far away from the accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Taut, propulsive and devastating, &lt;i&gt;His Favorites &lt;/i&gt; reveals the interior life of a young woman determined to navigate the treachery in a new world. Told from her perspective many years later, the story coolly describes a series of shattering events and the system that failed to protect her. Walbert, who brilliantly explored a century of women’s struggles for rights and recognition in her award-winning &lt;i&gt;A Short History of Women&lt;/i&gt;, limns the all-too-common violations of vulnerability and aspiration in the lives of young women in this suspenseful short novel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; From the publisher of the classic &lt;i&gt;A Separate Peace,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;His Favorites&lt;/i&gt; is an urgent book by a “wickedly smart writer” (&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review)&lt;/i&gt; whose work is “fascinating, moving and significant” (&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post).&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Since she was seven years old, Yvonne has had her trusted violin to keep her company, especially in those lonely days after her mother walked out on their family. But with graduation just around the corner, she is forced to face the hard truth that she just might not be good enough to attend a conservatory after high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of doubt about her future, and increasingly frustrated by her strained relationship with her successful but emotionally closed-off father, Yvonne meets a street musician and fellow violinist who understands her struggle. He’s mysterious, charming, and different from Warren, the familiar and reliable boy who has her heart. But when Yvonne becomes unexpectedly pregnant, she has to make the most difficult decision yet about her future.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The story of an intense female friendship fueled by affection, envy and pride--and each woman's fear that she would be nothing without the other.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skinny, nine-year-old orphaned Dores is working in the kitchen of a sugar plantation in 1930s Brazil when in walks a girl who changes everything. Graça, the spoiled daughter of a wealthy sugar baron, is clever, well fed, pretty, and thrillingly ill behaved. Born to wildly different worlds, Dores and Graça quickly bond over shared mischief, and then, on a deeper level, over music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One has a voice like a songbird; the other feels melodies in her soul and composes lyrics to match. Music will become their shared passion, the source of their partnership and their rivalry, and for each, the only way out of the life to which each was born. But only one of the two is destined to be a star. Their intimate, volatile bond will determine each of their fortunes--and haunt their memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traveling from Brazil's inland sugar plantations to the rowdy streets of Lapa in Rio de Janeiro, from Los Angeles during the Golden Age of Hollywood back to the irresistible drumbeat of home, The Air You Breathe unfurls a moving portrait of a lifelong friendship--its unparalleled rewards and lasting losses--and considers what we owe to the relationships that shape our lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A mesmerizing debut novel by Chip Cheek, &lt;i&gt;Cape May&lt;/i&gt; explores the social and sexual mores of 1950s America through the eyes of a newly married couple from the genteel south corrupted by sophisticated New England urbanites.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late September 1957. Henry and Effie, very young newlyweds from Georgia, arrive in Cape May, New Jersey, for their honeymoon only to find the town is deserted. Feeling shy of each other and isolated, they decide to cut the trip short. But before they leave, they meet a glamorous set of people who sweep them up into their drama. Clara, a beautiful socialite who feels her youth slipping away; Max, a wealthy playboy and Clara’s lover; and Alma, Max’s aloof and mysterious half-sister, to whom Henry is irresistibly drawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The empty beach town becomes their playground, and as they sneak into abandoned summer homes, go sailing, walk naked under the stars, make love, and drink a great deal of gin, Henry and Effie slip from innocence into betrayal, with irrevocable consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erotic and moving, this is a novel about marriage, love and sexuality, and the lifelong repercussions that meeting a group of debauched cosmopolitans has on a new marriage.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A tale of a single night. The story of a lifetime.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you had to pick five people to sum up your life, who would they be? If you were to raise a glass to each of them, what would you say? And what would you learn about yourself, when all is said and done?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of Maurice Hannigan, who, over the course of a Saturday night in June, orders five different drinks at the Rainford House Hotel. With each he toasts a person vital to him: his doomed older brother, his troubled sister-in-law, his daughter of fifteen minutes, his son far off in America, and his late, lamented wife. And through these people, the ones who left him behind, he tells the story of his own life, with all its regrets and feuds, loves and triumphs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully written, powerfully felt, &lt;i&gt;When All Is Said&lt;/i&gt; promises to be the next great Irish novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this powerful and provocative memoir, genre-bending essayist and novelist Kiese Laymon explores what the weight of a lifetime of secrets, lies, and deception does to a black body, a black family, and a nation teetering on the brink of moral collapse.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiese Laymon is a fearless writer. In his essays, personal stories combine with piercing intellect to reflect both on the state of American society and on his experiences with abuse, which conjure conflicted feelings of shame, joy, confusion and humiliation. Laymon invites us to consider the consequences of growing up in a nation wholly obsessed with progress yet wholly disinterested in the messy work of reckoning with where we’ve been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Heavy&lt;/i&gt;, Laymon writes eloquently and honestly about growing up a hard-headed black son to a complicated and brilliant black mother in Jackson, Mississippi. From his early experiences of sexual violence, to his suspension from college, to his trek to New York as a young college professor, Laymon charts his complex relationship with his mother, grandmother, anorexia, obesity, sex, writing, and ultimately gambling. By attempting to name secrets and lies he and his mother spent a lifetime avoiding, Laymon asks himself, his mother, his nation, and us to confront the terrifying possibility that few in this nation actually know how to responsibly love, and even fewer want to live under the weight of actually becoming free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A personal narrative that illuminates national failures, &lt;i&gt;Heavy&lt;/i&gt; is defiant yet vulnerable, an insightful, often comical exploration of weight, identity, art, friendship, and family that begins with a confusing childhood—and continues through twenty-five years of haunting implosions and long reverberations.</description>

  <description>Set in an America where half the population has been silenced, &lt;i&gt;VOX&lt;/i&gt; is the harrowing, unforgettable story of what one woman will do to protect herself and her daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the day the government decrees that women are no longer allowed to speak more than 100 words daily, Dr. Jean McClellan is in denial—this can't happen here. Not in America. Not to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is just the beginning.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon women can no longer hold jobs. Girls are no longer taught to read or write. Females no longer have a voice. Before, the average person spoke sixteen thousand words a day, but now women only have one hundred to make themselves heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is not the end.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For herself, her daughter, and every woman silenced, Jean will reclaim her voice.</description>

  <description>In this must-read book for anyone striving to succeed, pioneering psychologist Angela Duckworth shows parents, educators, students, and business people both seasoned and new that the secret to outstanding achievement is not talent but a focused persistence called grit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do some people succeed and others fail? Sharing new insights from her landmark research on grit, Angela Duckworth explains why talent is hardly a guarantor of success. Rather, other factors can be even more crucial such as identifying our passions and following through on our commitments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on her own powerful story as the daughter of a scientist who frequently bemoaned her lack of smarts, Duckworth describes her winding path through teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience, which led to the hypothesis that what really drives success is not genius, but a special blend of passion and long-term perseverance. As a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Duckworth created her own character lab and set out to test her theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, she takes readers into the field to visit teachers working in some of the toughest schools, cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she's learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers; from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to the cartoon editor of &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winningly personal, insightful, and even life-changing, &lt;i&gt;Grit&lt;/i&gt; is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down, and how that not talent or luck makes all the difference.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;"&lt;/i&gt;Believe in the unexpected" with this hilarious, heartwarming, and much-anticipated sequel to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Fourteenth Goldfish&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellie's grandpa Melvin is a world-renowned scientist . . . in the body of a fourteen-year-old boy. His feet stink, and he eats everything in the refrigerator--and Ellie is so happy to have him around. Grandpa may not exactly fit in at middle school, but he certainly keeps things interesting. When he and Ellie team up for the county science fair, no one realizes just how groundbreaking their experiment will be. The formula for eternal youth may be within their reach! And when Ellie's cat, Jonas Salk, gets sick, the stakes become even higher. But is the key to eternal life really the key to happiness? Sometimes even the most careful experiments yield unexpected--and wonderful--results.</description>

  <description>Fred Rogers (1928–2003) was an enormously influential figure in the history of television and in the lives of tens of millions of children. As the creator and star of &lt;i&gt;Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood&lt;/i&gt;, he was a champion of compassion, equality, and kindness. Rogers was fiercely devoted to children and to taking their fears, concerns, and questions about the world seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Good Neighbor,&lt;/i&gt; the first full-length biography of Fred Rogers, tells the story of this utterly unique and enduring American icon. Drawing on original interviews, oral histories, and archival documents, Maxwell King traces Rogers’s personal, professional, and artistic life through decades of work, including a surprising decision to walk away from the show to make television for adults, only to return to the neighborhood with increasingly sophisticated episodes, written in collaboration with experts on childhood development. An engaging story, rich in detail, &lt;i&gt;The Good Neighbor&lt;/i&gt; is the definitive portrait of a beloved figure, cherished by multiple generations.</description>

      <![CDATA[Mr. Rogers was a key figure for me as a kid. I loved the documentary that was released this year, and I figured a book wouldn’t reveal much more. I was wrong. As someone with a degree in educational psychology, I was fascinated to learn about how much research Fred Rogers did in crafting his show...]]>

  <description>In an isolated college town in the hills of Southern California, a freshman girl stumbles into her dorm room, falls asleep—and doesn’t wake up. She sleeps through the morning, into the evening. Her roommate, Mei, cannot rouse her. Neither can the paramedics who carry her away, nor the perplexed doctors at the hospital. Then a second girl falls asleep, and then another, and panic takes hold of the college and spreads to the town. As the number of cases multiplies, classes are canceled, and stores begin to run out of supplies. A quarantine is established. The National Guard is summoned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mei, an outsider in the cliquish hierarchy of dorm life, finds herself thrust together with an eccentric, idealistic classmate. Two visiting professors try to protect their newborn baby as the once-quiet streets descend into chaos. A father succumbs to the illness, leaving his daughters to fend for themselves. And at the hospital, a new life grows within a college girl, unbeknownst to her—even as she sleeps. A psychiatrist, summoned from Los Angeles, attempts to make sense of the illness as it spreads through the town. Those infected are displaying unusual levels of brain activity, more than has ever been recorded. They are dreaming heightened dreams—but of what?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; Business Bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Financial Times&lt;/i&gt; Business Book of the Month&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Named by &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; as One of the 11 Leadership Books to Read in 2018&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling coauthor of &lt;i&gt;Great by Choice&lt;/i&gt; comes an authoritative, practical guide to individual performance—based on analysis from an exhaustive, groundbreaking study.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do some people perform better at work than others? This deceptively simple question continues to confound professionals in all sectors of the workforce. Now, after a unique, five-year study of more than 5,000 managers and employees, Morten Hansen reveals the answers in his “Seven Work Smarter Practices” that can be applied by anyone looking to maximize their time and performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of Hansen’s seven practices is highlighted by inspiring stories from individuals in his comprehensive study. You’ll meet a high school principal who engineered a dramatic turnaround of his failing high school; a rural Indian farmer determined to establish a better way of life for women in his village; and a sushi chef, whose simple preparation has led to his restaurant (tucked away under a Tokyo subway station underpass) being awarded the maximum of three Michelin stars. Hansen also explains how the way Alfred Hitchcock filmed &lt;i&gt;Psycho&lt;/i&gt; and the 1911 race to become the first explorer to reach the South Pole both illustrate the use of his seven practices (even before they were identified).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each chapter contains questions and key insights to allow you to assess your own performance and figure out your work strengths, as well as your weaknesses. Once you understand your individual style, there are mini-quizzes, questionnaires, and clear tips to assist you focus on a strategy to become a more productive worker. Extensive, accessible, and friendly, &lt;i&gt;Great at Work&lt;/i&gt; will help you achieve more by working less, backed by unprecedented statistical analysis.</description>

  <description>What does it mean to lose your roots—within your culture, within your family—and what happens when you find them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicole Chung was born severely premature, placed for adoption by her Korean parents, and raised by a white family in a sheltered Oregon town. From early childhood, she heard the story of her adoption as a comforting, prepackaged myth. She believed that her biological parents had made the ultimate sacrifice in the hopes of giving her a better life; that forever feeling slightly out of place was simply her fate as a transracial adoptee. But as she grew up—facing prejudice her adoptive family couldn’t see, finding her identity as an Asian American and a writer, becoming ever more curious about where she came from—she wondered if the story she’d been told was the whole truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With warmth, candor, and startling insight, Chung tells of her search for the people who gave her up, which coincided with the birth of her own child. &lt;i&gt;All You Can Ever Know&lt;/i&gt; is a profound, moving chronicle of surprising connections and the repercussions of unearthing painful family secrets—vital reading for anyone who has ever struggled to figure out where they belong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Finalist, National Book Critics Circle Award for Autobiography / Longlisted for the PEN Open Book Award / Named a Best Book of the Year by The Washington Post, NPR, The Boston Globe, TIME, Newsday, Library Journal, BuzzFeed, Real Simple, Paste Magazine, Chicago Public Library, Seattle Public Library, Goodreads, Shelf Awareness, Electric Literature, and more&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A life-changing secret destroys an unlikely friendship in this "magnetic" (Meg Wolitzer) psychological thriller from the Edgar Award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Dare Me&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You told each other everything. Then she told you too much. &lt;br /&gt;Kit has risen to the top of her profession and is on the brink of achieving everything she wanted. She hasn't let anything stop her. &lt;br /&gt;But now someone else is standing in her way - Diane. Best friends at seventeen, their shared ambition made them inseparable. Until the day Diane told Kit her secret - the worst thing she'd ever done, the worst thing Kit could imagine - and it blew their friendship apart.&lt;br /&gt;Kit is still the only person who knows what Diane did. And now Diane knows something about Kit that could destroy everything she's worked so hard for. &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How far would Kit go, to make the hard work, the sacrifice, worth it in the end? What wouldn't she give up? Diane thinks Kit is just like her. Maybe she's right. Ambition: it's in the blood . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;"In her amazing, wildly inventive collection, Amy Bonnaffons writes about transformation, each story further complicating the world as we know it. With a style that blends humor and sincerity in such strange, perfect ratios, Bonnaffons reveals the mysteries inside of us, just waiting to make themselves known. &lt;i&gt;The Wrong Heaven,&lt;/i&gt; so wondrous, will alter you in all the necessary ways." —Kevin Wilson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Wrong Heaven&lt;/i&gt;, anything is possible: bodies can transform, inanimate objects come to life, angels appear and disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonnaffons draws us into a delightfully strange universe, in which her conflicted characters seek to solve their sexual and spiritual dilemmas in all the wrong places. The title story's heroine reckons with grief while arguing with loquacious Jesus and Mary lawn ornaments that come to life when she plugs them in. In "Horse," we enter a world in which women transform themselves into animals through a series of medical injections. In "Alternate," a young woman convinces herself that all she needs to revive a stagnant relationship is the perfect poster of the Dalai Lama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some of the worlds to which Bonnaffons transports us are more recognizable than others, all of them uncover the mysteries beneath the mundane surfaces of our lives. Enormously funny, boldly inventive, and as provocative as they are deeply affecting, these stories lay bare the heart of our deepest longings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first collection of short fiction from the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jeffrey Eugenides&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeffrey Eugenides’s bestselling novels have shown him to be an astute observer of the crises of adolescence, self-discovery, family love, and what it means to be American in our times. The stories in &lt;i&gt;Fresh Complaint&lt;/i&gt; explore equally rich­­—and intriguing—territory. Ranging from the bitingly reproductive antics of “Baster” to the dreamy, moving account of a young traveler’s search for enlightenment in “Air Mail” (selected by Annie Proulx for &lt;i&gt;Best American Short Stories&lt;/i&gt;), this collection presents characters in the midst of personal and national emergencies. We meet a failed poet who, envious of other people’s wealth during the real-estate bubble, becomes an embezzler; a clavichordist whose dreams of art founder under the obligations of marriage and fatherhood; and, in “Fresh Complaint,” a high school student whose wish to escape the strictures of her immigrant family lead her to a drastic decision that upends the life of a middle-aged British physicist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Narratively compelling, beautifully written, and packed with a density of ideas despite their fluid grace, these stories chart the development and maturation of a major American writer.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Simple, science-based tools to &lt;i&gt;stop&lt;/i&gt; procrastination&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with overflowing inboxes, thousands of unread notifications, and unmet deadlines, most people still can't manage to take control of their time and stop procrastinating. &lt;i&gt;The End of Procrastination&lt;/i&gt; tackles this ubiquitous issue head on, helping you stop putting off work and reclaim your time. Author Petr Ludwig shows that ending procrastination is more than a wise time management strategy--&lt;b&gt;it's essential to developing a sense of purpose and leading a happier more fulfilled life. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The keys to overcoming procrastination are simple. With &lt;b&gt;eight clear, approachable tools&lt;/b&gt;--from quick daily worksheets to shift your perspective to to-do lists that actually help you get things done--&lt;i&gt;The End of Procrastination&lt;/i&gt; provides everything you need to change the way you manage your time and live your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the latest research, &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;End of Procrastination&lt;/i&gt; synthesizes &lt;b&gt;over one hundred scientific studies&lt;/b&gt; to create a program that is based on the way our brains actually work. By understanding exactly why procrastination happens and how our brains respond to motivation and self-discipline, the book provides readers with the knowledge to conquer procrastination on an everyday basis.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A hilarious send-up of writing workshops, for-profit education, and the gulf between believers and nonbelievers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marianne is in a slump: barely able to support herself by teaching, not making progress on her poetry, about to lose her Brooklyn apartment. When her novelist ex-fiancé, Eric, and his venture capitalist brother, Mark, offer her a job directing a low-residency school for Christian writers at a motel they’ve inherited on Florida’s Gulf Coast, she can’t come up with a reason to say no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Genesis Inspirational Writing Ranch is born, and liberal, atheist Marianne is soon knee-deep in applications from writers whose political and religious beliefs she has always opposed but whose money she’s glad to take. Janine is a schoolteacher whose heartfelt poems explore the final days of Terri Schiavo’s life. Davonte is a former R&amp;amp;B superstar who hopes to reboot his career with a bestselling tale of excess and redemption. Lorraine and Tom, eccentric writers in need of paying jobs, join the Ranch as instructors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark finds an investor in God’s Word God’s World, a business that develops for-profit schools for the Christian market, but the conditions that come along with their support become increasingly problematic, especially as Marianne grows closer to the students. As unsavory allegations mount, a hurricane bears down on the Ranch, and Marianne is faced with the consequences of her decisions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With sharp humor and deep empathy, &lt;i&gt;The Gulf&lt;/i&gt; is a memorable debut novel in which Belle Boggs plumbs the troubled waters dividing America.</description>

  <description>Originally performed at the Kennedy Center for the unveiling of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, and later as a tribute to Walter Dean Myers, this stirring and inspirational poem is &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author and National Book Award finalist Jason Reynolds’s rallying cry to the dreamers of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;For Every One &lt;/i&gt;is just that: for every one. For every one person. For every one dream. But especially for every one kid. The kids who dream of being better than they are. Kids who dream of doing more than they almost dare to dream. Kids who are like Jason Reynolds, a self-professed dreamer. Jason does not claim to know how to make dreams come true; he has, in fact, been fighting on the front line of his own battle to make his own dreams a reality. He expected to make it when he was sixteen. Then eighteen. Then twenty-five. Now, some of those expectations have been realized. But others, the most important ones, lay ahead, and a lot of them involve kids, how to inspire them. All the kids who are scared to dream, or don’t know how to dream, or don’t dare to dream because they’ve NEVER seen a dream come true. Jason wants kids to know that dreams take time. They involve countless struggles. But no matter how many times a dreamer gets beat down, the drive and the passion and the hope never fully extinguish—because just having the dream is the start you need, or you won’t get anywhere anyway, and that is when you have to take a leap of faith.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A pitch perfect graduation, baby, or love my kid gift.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A poignant new novel that combines humour and heartache, from the brilliant mind of Governor General’s Award finalist Claudia Dey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen years after falling from a stolen car into a remote northern town, Billie Jean Fontaine is still an outsider. She may follow the stifling rules of this odd place, but no one will forget that she came from elsewhere. When Billie Jean vanishes one cold October night in her bare feet and track suit with only her truck keys, those closest to her begin a frantic search. Her daughter, Pony, a girl struggling against being a teen in the middle of nowhere; her killer dog to whom she cannot tell a lie; her husband, The Heavy, a man haunted by his past; and the charismatic Supernatural, a teenage boy longing only to be average. Each holding a different piece of the puzzle, they must come together to understand the darkest secrets of their beloved, and lay bare the mysteries of the human heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her luminous prose, wry humour and dead-on cultural observations, Claudia Dey has created a storytelling tour de force about what it means to love, no matter the consequences.</description>

  <description>Daphne Maritch doesn't quite know what to make of the heavily annotated high school yearbook she inherits from her mother, who held this relic dear. Too dear. The late June Winter Maritch was the teacher to whom the class of '68 had dedicated its yearbook, and in turn she went on to attend every reunion, scribbling notes and observations after each one—not always charitably—and noting who overstepped boundaries of many kinds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In a fit of decluttering (the yearbook did not, Daphne concluded, "spark joy"), she discards it when she moves to a small New York City apartment. But when it's found in the recycling bin by a busybody neighbor/documentary filmmaker, the yearbook's mysteries—not to mention her own family's—take on a whole new urgency, and Daphne finds herself entangled in a series of events both poignant and absurd. </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Paris Wife&lt;/i&gt; returns to the subject of Ernest Hemingway in a novel about his passionate, stormy marriage to Martha Gellhorn—a fiercely independent, ambitious young woman who would become one of the greatest war correspondents of the twentieth century&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; In 1937, twenty-eight-year-old Martha travels alone to Madrid to report on the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War and becomes drawn to the stories of ordinary people caught in devastating conflict. She also finds herself unexpectedly—and uncontrollably—falling in love with Hemingway, a man already on his way to becoming a legend. In the shadow of the impending Second World War, and set against the tumultuous backdrops of Madrid, Finland, China, Key West, and especially Cuba, where Martha and Ernest make their home, their relationship and professional careers ignite. But when Ernest publishes the biggest literary success of his career, &lt;i&gt;For Whom the Bell Tolls&lt;/i&gt;, they are no longer equals, and Martha must make a choice: surrender to the confining demands of being a famous man's wife or risk losing Ernest by forging a path as her own woman and writer. It is a dilemma that will force her to break his heart, and her own.</description>

Then, suddenly, on what should have been one of the happiest days of her life, everything she worked for is taken away in one tumultuous moment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the hospital and forced to face the possibility that nothing will ever be the same again, Margaret must figure out how to move forward on her own terms while facing long-held family secrets, devastating heartbreak, and the idea that love might find her in the last place she would ever expect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Walk Away&lt;/i&gt; is Katherine Center at her very best: an utterly charming, hopeful, and romantic novel that will capture reader’s hearts with every page.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;David Sedaris returns with his most deeply personal and darkly hilarious book. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've ever laughed your way through David Sedaris's cheerfully misanthropic stories, you might think you know what you're getting with &lt;i&gt;Calypso.&lt;/i&gt; You'd be wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he buys a beach house on the Carolina coast, Sedaris envisions long, relaxing vacations spent playing board games and lounging in the sun with those he loves most. And life at the Sea Section, as he names the vacation home, is exactly as idyllic as he imagined, except for one tiny, vexing realization: it's impossible to take a vacation from yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Calypso, &lt;/i&gt; Sedaris sets his formidable powers of observation toward middle age and mortality. Make no mistake: these stories are very, very funny-it's a book that can make you laugh 'til you snort, the way only family can. Sedaris's powers of observation have never been sharper, and his ability to shock readers into laughter unparalleled. But much of the comedy here is born out of that vertiginous moment when your own body betrays you and you realize that the story of your life is made up of more past than future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is beach reading for people who detest beaches, required reading for those who loathe small talk and love a good tumor joke. &lt;i&gt;Calypso&lt;/i&gt; is simultaneously Sedaris's darkest and warmest book yet-and it just might be his very best.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Darkly humorous as usual, Sedaris's most recent essay collection finds the author older, wiser, and perhaps more introspective than in past works. I did laugh aloud many times during CALYPSO, but I found myself wiping away tears as often as I giggled. ]]>

  <description>Written in taut, mesmerizing, often hilarious scenes, &lt;i&gt;Night Moves&lt;/i&gt; captures the fierce friendships and small moments that form us all. Drawing on her personal journals from the aughts, Jessica Hopper chronicles her time as a DJ, living in decrepit punk houses, biking to bad loft parties with her friends, exploring Chicago deep into the night. And, along the way, she creates an homage to vibrant corners of the city that have been muted by sleek development. A book birthed in the amber glow of Chicago streetlamps, &lt;i&gt;Night Moves&lt;/i&gt; is about a transformative moment of cultural history--and how a raw, rebellious writer found her voice.</description>

  <description>Willa Drake can count on one hand the defining moments of her life: when she was eleven and her mother disappeared, being proposed to at twenty-one, the accident that would make her a widow at forty-one. At each of these moments, Willa ended up on a path laid out for her by others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when she receives a phone call telling her that her son’s ex-girlfriend has been shot and needs her help, she drops everything and flies across the country. The spur-of-the-moment decision to look after this woman – and her nine-year-old daughter, and her dog – will lead Willa into uncharted territory. Surrounded by new and surprising neighbours, she is plunged into the rituals that make a community and takes pleasure in the most unexpected things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bittersweet novel of hope and regret, fulfillment and renewal, &lt;i&gt;Clock Dance&lt;/i&gt; brings us the everyday life of a woman who decides it’s never too late to change direction, and choose your own path.</description>

  <description>In the near future, world wars have transformed the earth into a battleground. Fleeing the unending violence and the planet’s now-radioactive surface, humans have regrouped to a mysterious platform known as CIEL, hovering over their erstwhile home. The changed world has turned evolution on its head: the surviving humans have become sexless, hairless pale-white creatures floating in isolation, inscribing stories upon their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the ranks of the endless wars rises Jean de Men, a charismatic and bloodthirsty cult leader who turns CIEL into a quasi-corporate police state. A group of rebels unite to dismantle his iron rule—galvanized by the heroic song of Joan, a child-warrior who possesses a mysterious force that lives within her and communes with the earth. When de Men and his armies turn Joan into a martyr, the consequences are astonishing. And no one—not the rebels, Jean de Men, or even Joan herself—can foresee the way her story and unique gift will forge the destiny of an entire world for generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A riveting tale of destruction and love found in direst of places—even at the extreme end of post-human experience—Lidia Yuknavitch’s &lt;i&gt;The Book of Joan&lt;/i&gt; raises questions about what it means to be human, the fluidity of sex and gender, and the role of art as means for survival.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For fans of &lt;i&gt;Nudge&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sway&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Art of Thinking Clearly&lt;/i&gt;, a fascinating dive into the many ways in which "competing truths" shape our opinions, behaviors, and beliefs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We like to think that there is a clear distinction between true and false. The reality is far murkier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hector Macdonald has spent much of his career exploring the ways that two completely true statements about the same thing can give wildly different impressions to the people listening. For instance, the Internet can be described as a tool to disseminate knowledge or a system that spreads misinformation and hatred. Both statements are true, but they would paint radically different pictures for a cyber-novice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in &lt;i&gt;Truth: A User's Guide&lt;/i&gt;, Macdonald explains how these so-called "competing truths" are used both constructively and misleadingly by businesses, media, politicians, advertisers, and even regular people having regular conversations. He shows how understanding competing truths makes us better at navigating the world and more influential within it. Combining great storytelling with practical takeaways and a litany of fascinating, funny, and insightful case studies, &lt;i&gt;Truth&lt;/i&gt; is a sobering and engaging read about how profoundly our mindsets and actions are influenced by the truths that those around us choose to tell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Nora Tucker is looking forward to summer vacation in Wolf Creek--two months of swimming, popsicles, and brushing up on her journalism skills for the school paper. But when two inmates break out of the town's maximum security prison, everything changes. Doors are locked, helicopters fly over the woods, and police patrol the school grounds. Worst of all, everyone is on edge, and fear brings out the worst in some people Nora has known her whole life. Even if the inmates are caught, she worries that home might never feel the same. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in letters, poems, text messages, news stories, and comics--a series of documents Nora collects for the Wolf Creek Community Time Capsule Project.</description>

  <description>The New Orleans mayor who removed the Confederate statues confronts the racism that shapes us and argues for white America to reckon with its past. A passionate, personal, urgent book from the man who sparked a national debate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"There is a difference between remembrance of history and reverence for it." When Mitch Landrieu addressed the people of New Orleans in May 2017 about his decision to take down four Confederate monuments, including the statue of Robert E. Lee, he struck a nerve nationally, and his speech has now been heard or seen by millions across the country. In his first book, Mayor Landrieu discusses his personal journey on race as well as the path he took to making the decision to remove the monuments, tackles the broader history of slavery, race and institutional inequities that still bedevil America, and traces his personal relationship to this history. His father, as state senator and mayor, was a huge force in the integration of New Orleans in the 1960s and 19070s. Landrieu grew up with a progressive education in one of the nation's most racially divided cities, but even he had to relearn Southern history as it really happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Equal parts unblinking memoir, history, and prescription for finally confronting America's most painful legacy, &lt;i&gt; In the Shadow of Statues &lt;/i&gt;will contribute strongly to the national conversation about race in the age of Donald Trump, at a time when racism is resurgent with seemingly tacit approval from the highest levels of government and when too many Americans have a misplaced nostalgia for a time and place that never existed.</description>

  <description>Monday Charles is missing, and only Claudia seems to notice. Claudia and Monday have always been inseparable—more sisters than friends. So when Monday doesn’t turn up for the first day of school, Claudia’s worried. When she doesn’t show for the second day, or second week, Claudia knows that something is wrong. Monday wouldn’t just leave her to endure tests and bullies alone. Not after last year’s rumors and not with her grades on the line. Now Claudia needs her best—and only—friend more than ever. But Monday’s mother refuses to give Claudia a straight answer, and Monday’s sister April is even less help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Claudia digs deeper into her friend’s disappearance, she discovers that no one seems to remember the last time they saw Monday. How can a teenage girl just vanish without anyone noticing that she’s gone?</description>

  <description>From the New York Times-bestselling author Sloane Crosley comes &lt;i&gt;Look Alive Out There&lt;/i&gt;―a brand-new collection of essays filled with her trademark hilarity, wit, and charm. The characteristic heart and punch-packing observations are back, but with a newfound coat of maturity. A thin coat. More of a blazer, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of &lt;i&gt;I Was Told There'd Be Cake&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;How Did You Get This Number&lt;/i&gt; know Sloane Crosley's life as a series of relatable but madcap misadventures. In &lt;i&gt;Look Alive Out There&lt;/i&gt;, whether it's scaling active volcanoes, crashing shivas, playing herself on &lt;i&gt;Gossip Girl&lt;/i&gt;, befriending swingers, or staring down the barrel of the fertility gun, Crosley continues to rise to the occasion with unmatchable nerve and electric one-liners. And as her subjects become more serious, her essays deliver not just laughs but lasting emotional heft and insight. Crosley has taken up the gauntlets thrown by her predecessors―Dorothy Parker, Nora Ephron, David Sedaris―and crafted something rare, affecting, and true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Look Alive Out There&lt;/i&gt; arrives on the tenth anniversary of &lt;i&gt;I Was Told There'd be Cake&lt;/i&gt;, and Crosley's essays have managed to grow simultaneously more sophisticated and even funnier. And yet she's still very much herself, and it's great to have her back―and not a moment too soon (or late, for that matter).</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Beatriz Williams brings us the blockbuster novel of the season—an electrifying postwar fable of love, class, power, and redemption set among the inhabitants of an island off the New England coast . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the summer of 1951, Miranda Schuyler arrives on elite, secretive Winthrop Island as a schoolgirl from the margins of high society, still reeling from the loss of her father in the Second World War. When her beautiful mother marries Hugh Fisher, whose summer house on Winthrop overlooks the famous lighthouse, Miranda’s catapulted into a heady new world of pedigrees and cocktails, status and swimming pools. Isobel Fisher, Miranda’s new stepsister—all long legs and world-weary bravado, engaged to a wealthy Island scion—is eager to draw Miranda into the arcane customs of Winthrop society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beneath the island’s patrician surface, there are really two clans: the summer families with their steadfast ways and quiet obsessions, and the working class of Portuguese fishermen and domestic workers who earn their living on the water and in the laundries of the summer houses. Uneasy among Isobel’s privileged friends, Miranda finds herself drawn to Joseph Vargas, whose father keeps the lighthouse with his mysterious wife. In summer, Joseph helps his father in the lobster boats, but in the autumn he returns to Brown University, where he’s determined to make something of himself. Since childhood, Joseph’s enjoyed an intense, complex friendship with Isobel Fisher, and as the summer winds to its end, Miranda’s caught in a catastrophe that will shatter Winthrop’s hard-won tranquility and banish Miranda from the island for nearly two decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in the landmark summer of 1969, Miranda returns at last, as a renowned Shakespearean actress hiding a terrible heartbreak. On its surface, the Island remains the same—determined to keep the outside world from its shores, fiercely loyal to those who belong. But the formerly powerful Fisher family is a shadow of itself, and Joseph Vargas has recently escaped the prison where he was incarcerated for the murder of Miranda’s stepfather eighteen years earlier. What’s more, Miranda herself is no longer a naïve teenager, and she begins a fierce, inexorable quest for justice for the man she once loved . . . even if it means uncovering every last one of the secrets that bind together the families of Winthrop Island.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From neuroscientist and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Still Alice&lt;/i&gt; comes a powerful exploration of regret, forgiveness, freedom, and what it means to be alive.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An accomplished concert pianist, Richard received standing ovations from audiences all over the world in awe of his rare combination of emotional resonance and flawless technique. Every finger of his hands was a finely calibrated instrument, dancing across the keys and striking each note with exacting precision. That was eight months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard now has ALS, and his entire right arm is paralyzed. His fingers are impotent, still, devoid of possibility. The loss of his hand feels like a death, a loss of true love, a divorce—his divorce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He knows his left arm will go next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years ago, Karina removed their framed wedding picture from the living room wall and hung a mirror there instead. But she still hasn’t moved on. Karina is paralyzed by excuses and fear, stuck in an unfulfilling life as a piano teacher, afraid to pursue the path she abandoned as a young woman, blaming Richard and their failed marriage for all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Richard becomes increasingly paralyzed and is no longer able to live on his own, Karina becomes his reluctant caretaker. As Richard’s muscles, voice, and breath fade, both he and Karina try to reconcile their past before it’s too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poignant and powerful, &lt;i&gt;Every Note Played &lt;/i&gt;is a masterful exploration of redemption and what it means to find peace inside of forgiveness.</description>

  <description>Our narrator should be happy, shouldn't she? She's young, thin, pretty, a recent Columbia graduate, works an easy job at a hip art gallery, lives in an apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan paid for, like the rest of her needs, by her inheritance. But there is a dark and vacuous hole in her heart, and it isn't just the loss of her parents, or the way her Wall Street boyfriend treats her, or her sadomasochistic relationship with her best friend, Reva. It's the year 2000 in a city aglitter with wealth and possibility; what could be so terribly wrong?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Year of Rest and Relaxation&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful answer to that question. Through the story of a year spent under the influence of a truly mad combination of drugs designed to heal our heroine from her alienation from this world, Moshfegh shows us how reasonable, even necessary, alienation can be. Both tender and blackly funny, merciless and compassionate, it is a showcase for the gifts of one of our major writers working at the height of her powers.</description>

  <description>Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her "head-for-the-hills bag". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Educated&lt;/em&gt; is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.</description>

  <description>One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A masterful true crime account of the Golden State Killer—the elusive serial rapist turned murderer who terrorized California for over a decade—from Michelle McNamara, the gifted journalist who died tragically while investigating the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;"You’ll be silent forever, and I’ll be gone in the dark."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more than ten years, a mysterious and violent predator committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before moving south, where he perpetrated ten sadistic murders. Then he disappeared, eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three decades later, Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, was determined to find the violent psychopath she called "the Golden State Killer." McNamara pored over police reports, interviewed victims, and embedded herself in the online communities that were as obsessed with the case as she was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time of the crimes, the Golden State Killer was between the ages of eighteen and thirty, Caucasian, and athletic—capable of vaulting tall fences. He always wore a mask. After choosing a victim—he favored suburban couples—he often entered their home when no one was there, studying family pictures, mastering the layout. He attacked while they slept, using a flashlight to awaken and blind them. Though they could not recognize him, his victims recalled his voice: a guttural whisper through clenched teeth, abrupt and threatening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll Be Gone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;—the masterpiece McNamara was writing at the time of her sudden death—offers an atmospheric snapshot of a moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a portrait of a woman’s obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. Framed by an introduction by Gillian Flynn and an afterword by her husband, Patton Oswalt, the book was completed by McNamara's lead researcher and a close colleague. Utterly original and compelling, it is destined to become a true crime classic—and may at last unmask the Golden State Killer.</description>

  <description>From a celebrated literary talent comes a brilliant, propulsive novel about family, the traumas and secrets that test our deepest bonds, and the stories that hold us together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warm, West Texas November night, a shy boy named Oliver Loving joins his classmates at Bliss County Day School’s annual dance, hoping for a glimpse of the object of his unrequited affections, an enigmatic Junior named Rebekkah Sterling. But as the music plays, a troubled young man sneaks in through the school’s back door. The dire choices this man makes that evening —and the unspoken story he carries— will tear the town of Bliss, Texas apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly ten years later, Oliver Loving still lies wordless and paralyzed at Crockett State Assisted Care Facility, the fate of his mind unclear. Orbiting the still point of Oliver’s hospital bed is a family transformed: Oliver’s mother, Eve, who keeps desperate vigil; Oliver’s brother, Charlie, who has fled for New York City only to discover he cannot escape the gravity of his shattered family; Oliver’s father, Jed, who tries to erase his memories with bourbon. And then there is Rebekkah Sterling, Oliver’s teenage love, who left Texas long ago and still refuses to speak about her own part in that tragic night. When a new medical test promises a key to unlock Oliver’s trapped mind, the town’s unanswered questions resurface with new urgency, as Oliver’s doctors and his family fight for a way for Oliver to finally communicate — and so also to tell the truth of what really happened that fateful night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A moving meditation on the transformative power of grief and love, a slyly affectionate look at the idiosyncrasies of family, and an emotionally-charged page-turner, Oliver Loving is an extraordinarily original novel that ventures into the unknowable and returns with the most fundamental truths.​</description>

  <description>The zoo is nearly empty as Joan and her four-year-old son soak up the last few moments of playtime. They are happy, and the day has been close to perfect. But what Joan sees as she hustles her son toward the exit gate minutes before closing time sends her sprinting back into the zoo, her child in her arms. And for the next three hours—the entire scope of the novel—she keeps on running.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Joan’s intimate knowledge of her son and of the zoo itself—the hidden pathways and under-renovation exhibits, the best spots on the carousel and overstocked snack machines—is all that keeps them a step ahead of danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A masterful thrill ride and an exploration of motherhood itself—from its tender moments of grace to its savage power—&lt;em&gt;Fierce Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; asks where the boundary is between our animal instinct to survive and our human duty to protect one another. For whom should a mother risk her life?</description>

  <description>Some might say Julian is sheltered. But he lives large, and his eternal optimism allows him to see infinite possibilities wherever he looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite his optimism, he is anxious about his stressed family falling apart. Even his ability to "uni-sense" what's happening with his sister is gone. If he can make his family focus on the magic in the universe, surely they'll appreciate life again. Now that they are moving from Washington, DC, to rural Maine, Julian can use his beloved telescope without any light pollution. He can discover a comet, name it for himself, and show his family how they're all truly connected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Julian searches the night sky, he encounters a force that may drive his plan apart. His neighbor, Mr. X, could bring an end to his parents' dream of opening their B&amp;amp;B. Could one negative force unravel everything? An avid student of science, Julian understands that there is much about the universe that we don't yet know. Who is to say what's possible and what's not?</description>

  <description>Six responsible adults. Three cute kids. One small dog. It’s just a normal weekend. What could possibly go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam and Clementine have a wonderful, albeit, busy life: they have two little girls, Sam has just started a new dream job, and Clementine, a cellist, is busy preparing for the audition of a lifetime. If there’s anything they can count on, it’s each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clementine and Erika are each other’s oldest friends. A single look between them can convey an entire conversation. But theirs is a complicated relationship, so when Erika mentions a last minute invitation to a barbecue with her neighbors, Tiffany and Vid, Clementine and Sam don’t hesitate. Having Tiffany and Vid’s larger than life personalities there will be a welcome respite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months later, it won’t stop raining, and Clementine and Sam can’t stop asking themselves the question: What if we hadn’t gone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Truly Madly Guilty, Liane Moriarty takes on the foundations of our lives: marriage, sex, parenthood, and friendship. She shows how guilt can expose the fault lines in the most seemingly strong relationships, how what we don’t say can be more powerful than what we do, and how sometimes it is the most innocent of moments that can do the greatest harm.</description>

  <description>The popular Beijing Duck House in Rockville, Maryland has been serving devoted regulars for decades, but behind the staff's professional smiles simmer tensions, heartaches and grudges from decades of bustling restaurant life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owner Jimmy Han has ambitions for a new high-end fusion place, hoping to eclipse his late father's homely establishment. Jimmy's older brother, Johnny, is more concerned with restoring the dignity of the family name than his faltering relationship with his own teenage daughter, Annie. Nan and Ah-Jack, longtime Duck House employees, yearn to turn their thirty-year friendship into something more, while Nan's son, Pat, struggles to stay out of trouble. When disaster strikes and Pat and Annie find themselves in a dangerous game that means tragedy for the Duck House, their families must finally confront the conflicts and loyalties simmering beneath the red and gold lanterns.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Bri wants to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. Or at least make it out of her neighborhood one day. As the daughter of an underground rap legend who died before he hit big, Bri’s got big shoes to fill. But now that her mom has unexpectedly lost her job, food banks and shutoff notices are as much a part of Bri’s life as beats and rhymes. With bills piling up and homelessness staring her family down, Bri no longer just wants to make it—she has to make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Come Up&lt;/i&gt; is Angie Thomas’s homage to hip-hop, the art that sparked her passion for storytelling and continues to inspire her to this day. It is the story of fighting for your dreams, even as the odds are stacked against you; of the struggle to become who you are and not who everyone expects you to be; and of the desperate realities of poor and working-class black families.</description>

  <description>Harry Tabor is about to be named Man of the Decade, a distinction that feels like the culmination of a life well lived. Gathering together in Palm Springs for the celebration are his wife, Roma, a distinguished child psychologist, and their children: Phoebe, a high-powered attorney; Camille, a brilliant social anthropologist; and Simon, a big-firm lawyer, who brings his glamorous wife and two young daughters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But immediately, cracks begin to appear in this smooth facade: Simon hasn’t been sleeping through the night, Camille can’t decide what to do with her life, and Phoebe is a little too cagey about her new boyfriend. Roma knows her children are hiding things. What she doesn’t know, what none of them know, is that Harry is suddenly haunted by the long-buried secret that drove him, decades ago, to relocate his young family to the California desert. As the ceremony nears, the family members are forced to confront the falsehoods upon which their lives are built. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set over the course of a single weekend, and deftly alternating between the five Tabors, this provocative, gorgeously rendered novel reckons with the nature of the stories we tell ourselves and our family and the price we pay for second chances.</description>

  <description>From the first story of Elizabeth McKenzie's beguiling debut collection, we are drawn into the offbeat worldview of sharp-eyed, intrepid Ann Ransom. "Stop That Girl" chronicles Ann's colorful coming-of-age travails, from her childhood in a disjointed family through her tender adolescence and beyond. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the captivating title story, our eight-year-old heroine is sent by her pregnant mother on a whirlwind jaunt to Europe with her iconoclast grandmother—known even to her family as Dr. Frost—and comes home to find her family completely reconfigured. In "SOS," Dr. Frost returns to haunt Ann in college, her visit colliding with a famous poet's appearance on campus. "We Know Where We Are, But Not Why" is set during a summer at the Grand Canyon and contrasts Ann's angst-ridden yearning for a philosophical schoolmate back home to her mother's happier pursuits of a lively Australian activist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, Ann discovers the absurdities that lurk around every corner of a young woman's life, by way of oafish neighbors, overzealous boyfriends, prurient vegetable salesmen, and sour landlords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In these keenly funny, highly original stories, Ann and the people around her are forced to reassess their complex relationships and, along the way, find happiness on the brink of calamity. "Stop That Girl" is a brilliant examination of the exigencies of love and the fragile fabric of family, and heralds the emergence of a remarkable new voice in fiction.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Operating Instructions&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; for the Millennial set: a fiercely honest account of becoming a mother before feeling like a grown up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meaghan O'Connell always felt totally alienated by the cutesy, sanctimonious, sentimental tone of most writing about motherhood. After getting accidentally pregnant in her twenties, she realized that the book she needed—a brutally honest, agenda-less take on the emotional and existential impact of motherhood—didn't exist. So she decided to write it herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And Now We Have Everything&lt;/i&gt; is O'Connell's brave exploration of transitioning into motherhood as a fledgling young adult. With her dark humor and hair-trigger B.S. detector, O'Connell addresses the pervasive imposter syndrome that comes with unplanned pregnancy, the second adolescence of a changing postpartum body, the problem of sex post-baby, the weird push to make "mom friends," and the fascinating strangeness of stepping into a new, not-yet-comfortable identity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most unforgettably, O'Connell brings us into the delivery room as no writer has before, rendering childbirth in all its feverish gore and glory, and shattering the fantasies of a "magical" or "natural" experience that warp our expectations and erode maternal self-esteem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Channeling fears and anxieties that are, shockingly, still taboo and often unspoken, &lt;i&gt;And Now We Have Everything&lt;/i&gt; is an unflinchingly frank, funny, and intimate motherhood story for our times, about needing to have a baby in order to stop being one yourself.</description>

  <description>What are the two most important days in your life? -The day you are born and the day you find out why, - Mark Twain famously wrote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search for happiness is hardwired in our DNA. It transcends age, gender, geography, vocation, and personal circumstances. But how do you achieve it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through inspirational storytelling, scientific evidence, practical advice, captivating exercises, and poetry, Dr. Sanjiv Chopra and Gina Vild present a powerful message that shows you how to achieve happiness no matter the challenges and stumbling blocks you face along the way. They also reveal the best way to be happy: Discover and live your life's purpose. It's a sure path to human flourishing. In fact, you may be surprised to learn that living with purpose can even add years to your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you know your life's purpose? This book offers a path to discovering it by illuminating the value of gratitude, forgiveness, meditation, music, friendship and so much more. It will set you on the right path and spark sustained happiness, joy and bliss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This majestic book has much wisdom to savor and practical steps to help you navigate life's many forks. I promise it will delight!”&lt;br /&gt;—Deepak Chopra&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This delightful book will instruct and entertain. I can’t think of anyone who would not find this useful; for many a reader it will be life- changing.”&lt;br /&gt;—Abraham Verghese, author of Cutting for Stone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Everyone will find warm, down-to-earth, common-sense approaches to making life richer and more satisfying. You will be inspired as you read it cover-to-cover and then return for practical reminders of what you can do today, in this moment, to bring more joy and meaning to your life.”&lt;br /&gt;—Robert Waldinger, M.D., director of Harvard Study of Adult Development &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This book is a refreshing refuge from simplistic happiness prescriptions. The treasures found here illuminate the moment to moment choices we can make to build immunity and well being as we take a stand on what matters most.” &lt;br /&gt;—Ellen Wingard, Global Leadership Coach for Social Impact&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Radiating a sense of joy and wonder throughout its pages, this book inspires reflection and offers simple yet important changes that will bring renewal and purpose to one’s life. Grounded in science, it illuminates a path forward with practical and engaging exercises and inspirational poetry.” &lt;br /&gt;— Andrew Carroll, New York Times bestselling author and co-founder, with the Nobel Laureate Joseph Brodsky, of the American Poetry &amp;amp; Literacy Project&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Sanjiv Chopra and Gina Vild have gracefully woven the wisdom of generations and recent scientific research into a delightfully practical understanding of how each of us can achieve happiness. And, importantly, how we can share it with others. You will definitely find yourself saying ‘Wow, I can do that!’ And, smiling to yourself.” &lt;br /&gt;—Richard Celeste, former Governor of Ohio and US Ambassador to India &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“As the world gets more connected, Sanjiv Chopra and Gina Vild remind us of the most important connection: with yourself.” &lt;br /&gt;—Bharat Anand, Henry R. Byers Professor of Business Administration, Harvard Business School, author The Content Trap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Dr. Sanjiv Chopra and Gina Vild have created a pith compilation of life meaning and purpose—a book you can open to any page on any day and find ways to manifest your unique path.” &lt;br /&gt;—Kyra Bobinet, M.D. MPH, author of Well-Designed Life, CEO, engagedIN, Consulting Faculty, Stanford School of Medicine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Vild and Chopra show exactly how to create happiness that is authentic, inspiring, and sustainable for anyone willing to open themselves to ask the questions and take the journey.”&lt;br /&gt;—Mark Bonchek, Ph.D., CEO of Shift Thinking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Chopra and Vild prescribe a simple recipe of practicing Gratitude, Forgiveness, and Compassion to achieve Happiness. It is hard not to internalize it and accept it by the time you reach the end of the book.” &lt;br /&gt;—Desh Deshpande, serial entrepreneur, founder of Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation at MIT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The most practical, comprehensive, and evidence-based guide to happiness I’ve ever read! A must-read that can change your life!” &lt;br /&gt;—Elan Divon, author, spiritual teacher, and cofounder of The Einstein Legacy Project and Genius 100 Visions, the world’s first 3D printed book&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This fun book offers practical advice to help you become a happier and more fulfilled person. In the process you may actually end up making the world a better place for all.”&lt;br /&gt;—Peng Fan, M.D., professor of Clinical Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“A true gift you will both richly enjoy and want to share with others.” &lt;br /&gt;—Lachlan Forrow, M.D., Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, President Emeritus, The Albert Schweitzer Fellowship&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“For those who wonder what to do next after hearing Joseph Campbell’s advice—‘find your bliss.’” &lt;br /&gt;—Sum P Lee, M.D. Ph.D, professor emeritus of Medicine, University of Washington; Dean of Medicine, University of Hong Kong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Chopra and Vild cleverly combine scientific research, poignant stories, and insightful strategies for making the most of your life on earth and being happy.” &lt;br /&gt;—Valerie Mosley, investor, global wealth strategist &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Perfectly inspiring and exquisitely uplifting.”&lt;br /&gt;—Debbie Phillips, founder, Women on Fire®&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A trove of powerful insights, exquisitely chosen poetry, and profoundly instructive quotes that evoke an authentic path to human happiness that I can reference and share for years to come.” &lt;br /&gt;—Christine Roess, cofounder of Cybeleum Consulting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Takes the reader on an adventurous journey of wisdom, stories and inspirations leaving one with much to reflect on and much to be looking forward to in this world.” &lt;br /&gt;—Zainab Salbi, founder of Women for Women International, author, and media personality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Read this wonder-filled book and find out why you are here.” &lt;br /&gt;—Scott Snook, MBA Class of 1958 Senior Lecturer of Business Administration, Harvard Business School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Chopra and Vild bring true happiness within our grasp with simple, wonderfully illustrated steps using self awareness, service, and kindness. A delightful, happy, purposeful read.”&lt;br /&gt;—Venkat Srinivasan, author of The Intelligent Enterprise in the Era of Big Data&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This book is a gem: a timely offering on a timeless topic, chock-full of time-tested ideas. Don’t just read it; inhale it!”&lt;br /&gt;—Vikas P. Sukhatme, M.D. ScD, Victor J. Aresty Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Chief Academic Officer, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The book soars high with inspiring philosophy and poetry and at the same time is grounded in fascinating studies, neuroscience, psychology, and surprising facts.” &lt;br /&gt;—Meta Wagner, author of What’s Your Creative Type?: Harness the Power of Your Artistic Personality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A must-read for anyone committed to their own happiness and the happiness of those they love.”&lt;br /&gt;—Adrian Wilkins, author of The Way of the Superior Dentist</description>

  <description>Jacquie Red Feather and her sister Opal grew up together, relying on each other during their unsettled childhood. As adults they were driven apart, but Jacquie is newly sober and trying to make it back to the family she left behind. That’s why she is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dene is there because he has been collecting stories to honour his uncle's death. Edwin is looking for his true father. Opal came to watch her boy Orvil dance. All of them are connected by bonds they may not yet understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them are there for the celebration of culture that is the Big Oakland Powwow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Tony Loneman is also there. And Tony has come to the Powwow with darker intentions.</description>

  <description>Being the middle child has its ups and downs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for Grace, an only child who was adopted at birth, discovering that she is a middle child is a different ride altogether. After putting her own baby up for adoption, she goes looking for her biological family, including—&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maya, her loudmouthed younger bio sister, who has a lot to say about their newfound family ties. Having grown up the snarky brunette in a house full of chipper redheads, she’s quick to search for traces of herself among these not-quite-strangers. And when her adopted family’s long-buried problems begin to explode to the surface, Maya can’t help but wonder where exactly it is that she belongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Joaquin, their stoic older bio brother, who has no interest in bonding over their shared biological mother. After seventeen years in the foster care system, he’s learned that there are no heroes, and secrets and fears are best kept close to the vest, where they can’t hurt anyone but him.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first novel from Sarah Jessica Parker’s new imprint, SJP for Hogarth, &lt;i&gt;A Place for Us&lt;/i&gt; is a deeply moving and resonant story of love, identity and belonging&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Place for Us&lt;/i&gt; unfolds the lives of an Indian-American Muslim family, gathered together in their Californian hometown to celebrate the eldest daughter, Hadia’s, wedding – a match of love rather than tradition. It is here, on this momentous day, that Amar, the youngest of the siblings, reunites with his family for the first time in three years. Rafiq and Layla must now contend with the choices and betrayals that lead to their son’s estrangement – the reckoning of parents who strove to pass on their cultures and traditions to their children; and of children who in turn struggle to balance authenticity in themselves with loyalty to the home they came from. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; In a narrative that spans decades and sees family life through the eyes of each member, &lt;i&gt;A Place For Us&lt;/i&gt; charts the crucial moments in the family's past, from the bonds that bring them together to the differences that pull them apart. And as siblings Hadia, Huda, and Amar attempt to carve out a life for themselves, they must reconcile their present culture with their parent's faith, to tread a path between the old world and the new, and learn how the smallest decisions can lead to the deepest of betrayals.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; A deeply affecting and resonant story, &lt;i&gt;A Place for Us&lt;/i&gt; is truly a book for our times: a moving portrait of what it means to be an American family today, a novel of love, identity and belonging that eloquently examines what it means to be both American and Muslim -- and announces Fatima Farheen Mirza as a major new literary talent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Is there a method to our madness when it comes to shopping? Hailed by the San Francisco Chronicle as "a Sherlock Holmes for retailers," author and research company CEO Paco Underhill answers with a definitive "yes" in this witty, eye-opening report on our ever-evolving consumer culture. Why We Buy is based on hard data gleaned from thousands of hours of field research–in shopping malls, department stores, and supermarkets across America. With his team of sleuths tracking our every move, Paco Underhill lays bare the struggle among merchants, marketers, and increasingly knowledgeable consumers for control.</description>

  <description>A missing girl on a journey of revenge. A &lt;i&gt;Serial&lt;/i&gt;―like podcast following the clues she's left behind. And an ending you won't be able to stop talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadie hasn't had an easy life. Growing up on her own, she's been raising her sister Mattie in an isolated small town, trying her best to provide a normal life and keep their heads above water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Mattie is found dead, Sadie's entire world crumbles. After a somewhat botched police investigation, Sadie is determined to bring her sister's killer to justice and hits the road following a few meager clues to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When West McCray―a radio personality working on a segment about small, forgotten towns in America―overhears Sadie's story at a local gas station, he becomes obsessed with finding the missing girl. He starts his own podcast as he tracks Sadie's journey, trying to figure out what happened, hoping to find her before it's too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtney Summers has written the breakout book of her career. Sadie is propulsive and harrowing and will keep you riveted until the last page.</description>

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The L Magazine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Named one of the best short story collections of 2015 by &lt;i&gt;Bookpage &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Kansas City Star&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rebecca Makkai’s first two novels, &lt;i&gt;The Borrower&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Hundred-Year House&lt;/i&gt;, have established her as one of the freshest and most imaginative voices in fiction. Now, the award-winning writer, whose stories have appeared in four consecutive editions of &lt;i&gt;The Best American Short Stories,&lt;/i&gt; returns with a highly anticipated collection bearing her signature mix of intelligence, wit, and heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A reality show producer manipulates two contestants into falling in love, even as her own relationship falls apart. Just after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a young boy has a revelation about his father’s past when a renowned Romanian violinist plays a concert in their home. When the prized elephant of a traveling circus keels over dead, the small-town minister tasked with burying its remains comes to question his own faith. In an unnamed country, a composer records the folk songs of two women from a village on the brink of destruction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These transporting, deeply moving stories—some inspired by her own family history—amply demonstrate Makkai’s extraordinary range as a storyteller, and confirm her as a master of the short story form. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Richly imagined.”&lt;br /&gt; —&lt;i&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “Impressive.”&lt;br /&gt; —&lt;i&gt;O, &lt;/i&gt;The Oprah&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Magazine&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “Engrossing.”&lt;br /&gt; —&lt;i&gt;Minneapolis Star-Tribune&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “Inventive.”&lt;br /&gt; —&lt;i&gt;W &lt;/i&gt;Magazine&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>In Lauren Groff’s &lt;i&gt;Florida&lt;/i&gt;, the hot sun shines, but a wild darkness lurks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her thrilling new book, Lauren Groff brings the reader into a physical world that is at once domestic and wild—a place where the hazards of the natural world lie waiting to pounce, yet the greatest threats and mysteries are still of an emotional, psychological nature. A family retreat can be derailed by a prowling panther, or by a sexual secret. Among those navigating this place are a resourceful pair of abandoned sisters; a lonely boy, grown up; a restless, childless couple, a searching, homeless woman; and an unforgettable, recurring character—a steely and conflicted wife and mother. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stories in this collection span characters, towns, decades, even centuries, but Florida—its landscape, climate, history, and state of mind—becomes its gravitational center: an energy, a mood, as much as a place of residence. Groff transports the reader, then jolts us alert with a crackle of wit, a wave of sadness, a flash of cruelty, as she writes about loneliness, rage, family, and the passage of time. With shocking accuracy and effect, she pinpoints the moments and decisions and connections behind human pleasure and pain, hope and despair, love and fury—the moments that make us alive. Startling, precise, and affecting, &lt;i&gt;Florida&lt;/i&gt; is a magnificent achievement.</description>

  <description>In 1985, Yale Tishman, the development director for an art gallery in Chicago, is about to pull off an amazing coup, bringing in an extraordinary collection of 1920s paintings as a gift to the gallery. Yet as his career begins to flourish, the carnage of the AIDS epidemic grows around him. One by one, his friends are dying and after his friend Nico's funeral, the virus circles closer and closer to Yale himself. Soon the only person he has left is Fiona, Nico's little sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty years later, Fiona is in Paris tracking down her estranged daughter who disappeared into a cult. While staying with an old friend, a famous photographer who documented the Chicago crisis, she finds herself finally grappling with the devastating ways AIDS affected her life and her relationship with her daughter. The two intertwining stories take us through the heartbreak of the eighties and the chaos of the modern world, as both Yale and Fiona struggle to find goodness in the midst of disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Great Believers&lt;/i&gt; has become a critically acclaimed, indelible piece of literature; it was selected as one of New York Times Best 10 Books of the Year, a Washington Post Notable Book, a Buzzfeed Book of the Year, a Skimm Reads pick, and a pick for the New York Public Library’s Best Books of the year.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The riveting story of two sets of twins separated at birth and improbably reunited as adults, a dream case for exploring nature vs. nurture.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Accidental Brothers&lt;/i&gt; tells the unique story of two sets of identical Colombian twin brothers who discovered at age 25 that they were mistakenly raised as fraternal twins--when they were not even biological brothers. Due to an oversight that presumably occurred in the hospital nursery, one twin in each pair was switched with a twin in the other pair. The result was two sets of unrelated "fraternal" twins--Jorge and Carlos, who were raised in the lively city of Bogota; and William and Wilber, who were raised in the remote rural village of La Paz, 150 miles away. Their parents and siblings were aware of the enormous physical and behavioral differences between the members of each set, but never doubted that the two belonged in their biological families.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone's life unraveled when one of the twins--William--was mistaken by a young woman for his real identical twin, Jorge. Her "discovery" led to the truth--that the alleged twins were not twins at all, but rather unrelated individuals who ended up with the wrong families.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blending great science and human interest, &lt;i&gt;Accidental Brothers&lt;/i&gt; will inform and entertain anyone interested in how twin studies illuminate the origins of human behavior, as well as mother-infant identification and the chance events that can have profound consequences on our lives.</description>
