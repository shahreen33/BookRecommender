  <description>One, two, things are changing for you. &lt;br /&gt;Three, four, monsters at your door. &lt;br /&gt;Five, six, no one could predict. &lt;br /&gt;Seven, eight, you learn they're your mates. &lt;br /&gt;Nine, ten, it's time to fight again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Paige Alice has changed, but she's not sure if that’s a good or bad thing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The good. &lt;br /&gt;Four annoying and different types of men, who she trusts with her life. A scary but faithful sidekick, and of course, her crazy family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bad. &lt;br /&gt;...Everything else. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*This is the first in a reverse harem romance trilogy. There's adult themes, course language, humor, and mm scenes, for 18+ only. &lt;br /&gt;*Sorry about the cliffhanger, but the second book will be released in early December 2019. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Meghan March comes a new deliciously dangerous alpha hero in &lt;i&gt;The Fall of Legend&lt;/i&gt;, the first book in the brand new and utterly addictive Legend trilogy.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We come from two different worlds. &lt;br /&gt;I’m from the streets. She might as well live in an ivory tower. &lt;br /&gt;I made my living with my fists. I doubt she could even throw a punch. &lt;br /&gt;Our paths never should have crossed. &lt;br /&gt;We never should have met. &lt;br /&gt;That doesn’t change the facts. &lt;br /&gt;I would sell my soul to taste those red lips. &lt;br /&gt;Fight the devil himself to hear her laugh. &lt;br /&gt;Burn in hell to have a single night. &lt;br /&gt;Scarlett Priest shouldn’t even know men like me exist, but sometimes temptation is stronger than will. &lt;br /&gt;If this is how I go down, it’ll be worth every second of the fall. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Meghan March comes a story of untold truths and one man’s redemption in the Dirty Mafia Duet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every family has a black sheep. &lt;br /&gt;In the infamous Casso crime family, that black sheep is me—Cannon Freeman. &lt;br /&gt;Except I’m not a free man. I’ve never been free. Not since the day I was born. &lt;br /&gt;I owe my loyalty to my father, Dominic Casso, even if he won’t publicly acknowledge me as his blood. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve never had a reason to go against his wishes… until I met her. &lt;br /&gt;Drew Carson turned my world upside when she walked into my club looking for a job. &lt;br /&gt;Now, my honor and my life are on the line. &lt;br /&gt;Going against my father’s wishes might buy me a bullet straight from his gun, but black sheep or not, it’s time to make my stand. &lt;br /&gt;She's worth the fallout. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>I thought he bought me to save me… but he’s keeping me for himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was a girl’s night out gone wrong. Like some awful horror movie, my friends and I were grabbed in a dark parking lot and shoved into the back of a van. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Coming from powerful families, we thought we were untouchable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We thought wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our captors trapped us, violated us, and put us up for sale on the black market. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Johnathan was sent to buy me so his boss, Lucifer, could have leverage over my father. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He was supposed to save me, protect me, and return me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not claim me and keep me for himself…</description>

Two words and my world turned dark. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Take her”.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owing the most ruthless crime lord in Garden City five million dollars, my husband chose to trade me and my children away to save himself. &lt;br /&gt;I was on the cusp of freedom, so close to divorcing that scumbag I was married to. &lt;br /&gt;Now I’m enslaved to a man who is obsessed with me. A man so wicked and beautiful, they call him Lucifer. &lt;br /&gt;So alluring, he makes the angels weep with envy. He’s so powerful, I can’t stop myself from bending to his will. &lt;br /&gt;He’s determined to master me, and he won’t rest until I give him all. &lt;br /&gt;He wants my light, and he wants my dark. &lt;br /&gt;He wants my body, and he wants my heart. &lt;br /&gt;But most of all, he wants the one thing I can’t give him.

  <description>Una &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m running. &lt;br /&gt;I have more enemies than even I can fight, and a five-million-dollar price tag on my head, all because I helped Nero. The hunter has become the hunted, and now I have a life to protect—an innocent baby. And that suddenly feels like the most important mission I’ve ever had. I’ve never been so invested in surviving, so let them come. I’ll kill them all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nero &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had a plan and it was perfect. &lt;br /&gt;She was my queen, my ultimate weapon. She played her part and helped bring me the power I sought above all else, but at what cost? Now she’s all I want, all I need. Una is mine. I will kill anyone who stands between us and burn the world to ash just to keep her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A pending war. A test of survival. A partnership that would see their enemies tremble in their wake. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A ruthless king. A savage queen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kill me or kiss me?</description>

  <description>Una &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To many, I am little more than a myth. The Kiss of Death, a hired killer, revered by some of the greatest criminal organisations in the world. Trained by the bratva themselves, without conscience, without mercy, the perfect soldier. I’ll kill anyone… for a price. Death doesn’t discriminate, she sells to the highest bidder, but even I have a weakness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nero &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I want one thing—power. But power is merely a game of strategy. The pieces are on the chess board. Death is my queen, and also my pawn. She’ll paint this city red in exchange for the one thing she wants. Now all I have to do is watch it all play out. She’s nothing more than a weapon, and yet, I find myself wanting to dance with death, to possess her. And I always get what I want. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A game of power. A risk that could cost her everything. An obsession that would see the world burn at their feet. A bloodied king. A broken queen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kill me or kiss me?</description>

  <description>When she was sold to Master Elliot Lyon of House Chimera, Fawn could have never imagined he was the same person as Elliot, the man beneath a well placed mask. A victim. Just like her. She would have never thought he was grooming her for the Wolf she’d already escaped once. That he planned to deliver her to the beast’s jaws in exchange for his wife. Master Jäger will stop at nothing to have her—even if that means using others as collateral. With more than just their lives on the line, Fawn must become someone else, and Master Lyon distances himself further from Elliot as her transfer looms. &lt;br /&gt;The roots of the Order run deep within them, but Fawn is beginning to realize another bond has formed between her and her Owner, a man she vowed to destroy along with the rest of their tangled branches. &lt;br /&gt;In a world where trust is just a tool and love isn’t meant for people like them, Fawn is determined to beat the powerful at their own elaborate games of make-believe. Even the man who Owns her. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Gabriel Luca Maldonado, III and Francesca Leandra Solomon were meant to be. They were so in love that everybody prayed for what they had. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everything was glorious. They would get married, have children and live a perfect life. She would be a doctor in the emergency room once she finished her doctorate, and he would be a badass Navy SEAL and save people for a living. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But then Luca is deployed across the world, and per military regulations, Frankie isn’t allowed to follow. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They’ve overcome a lot in their short relationship, and they can overcome this, too. Two years was a piece of cake. She’d finish her schooling and wait for him. And when he finally returned home, they would marry. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But two months into Luca’s deployment, the unthinkable happens, and Frankie is left alone and heartbroken, knowing that she’ll have to face the rest of life without Luca at her side. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fast forward two years, and Frankie is exactly where her fiancé’s father left her, in a pit of despair that she has no hope of ever finding her way out of. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She lives life one second at a time, depressed and alone, hoping tomorrow won’t hurt like today. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She finds a job, moves, and hopes that the nightmares won’t swallow her whole. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But just as she thinks that she’s getting better, one of her nightmares walks through the doors of her ER, and that nightmare has a name. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gabriel Luca Maldonado, III. In the flesh. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also healthy and whole, and definitely no longer missing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sadly, it only takes her a half a second to realize that the man that left her isn’t the same man that returned. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The old one wanted her. The new one? Well, he’s definitely not interested anymore. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Given to The Grimm Order as an infant, Fawn was raised in a world shaped by the rich and powerful. When she was sold at the age of nine to a Suitor, Fawn believed he would protect her from the “Mainworld”, where those who know nothing about the Order live. Living with the cruel man who bought her freedom, she finds just what the Order is about: money, control, and status for the Owner and humiliation and abuse for those they own. &lt;br /&gt;Unwilling to accept the expectations of being Owned, Fawn goes from golden girl to maid, content to live in the shadows of the Order as long as she isn’t Owned again.&lt;br /&gt;It’s been ten years since she disgraced her former Owner’s name, and now the brooding Frenchman Elliot Lyon wants her. Master Lyon is kind, smart, and unlike any man she’s met. She doesn’t want to admit it to herself, but Fawn is drawn to him despite constantly planning her next escape. &lt;br /&gt;Even the prettiest flowers have thorns, and Master Lyon is hiding secrets that will uproot everything she thinks she knows about him.</description>

  <description>When Kate Watts abandoned her law career to open a food pantry in Northeast Minneapolis, she never dreamed it would be this difficult. Facing the heartbreaking prospect of turning hungry people away, she is grateful for the anonymous donations that begin appearing at the end of each month. Determined to identify and thank her secret benefactor, she launches a plan and catches Ian —a charismatic hacker with a Robin Hood complex—in the act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ian intrigues Kate in a way no man ever has. But after learning he’s snooped around on her personal computer, she demands retribution. Impressed with her tolerance and captivated by her spirit, he complies and begins to slowly charm his way past her defenses. Time spent with Ian is never boring, and Kate soon finds herself falling for the mysterious hacker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ian has enemies and they’re growing restless. In the hacking world, exploiting a target’s weakness is paramount, and no price is too high to stop an attack. And when Kate learns exactly how much Ian has paid, she’ll discover just how strong her love is for the man who has hacked his way into her heart.</description>

  <description>It is 1939. Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will be busier still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By her brother's graveside, Liesel's life is changed when she picks up a single object, partially hidden in the snow. It is The Gravedigger's Handbook, left behind there by accident, and it is her first act of book thievery. So begins a love affair with books and words, as Liesel, with the help of her accordian-playing foster father, learns to read. Soon she is stealing books from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor's wife's library, wherever there are books to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these are dangerous times. When Liesel's foster family hides a Jew in their basement, Liesel's world is both opened up, and closed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Meadow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was four years old when I learnt what evilness the world could bring. I fought through life with my scarred soul, wrangled through the dark empty nights where I’d pray I didn’t wake up the next morning. I would shut my eyes and mentally take myself to my happy place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Red roses&lt;br /&gt;The sound of waves crashing on the sand under my feet. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final time the cold blade pushed up against my thigh, and I waited for my blood to trickle over the other One hundred and thirty-six scars that covered my skin— never came. Who was this man who just saved me? He had no idea how close I came to ending myself that day. I was ready to blow my brains all over the bedroom walls and I had a nine sitting under my pillow to prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have families, I had engineered human killing machines surrounding me my whole life. I’d been a part of this unit since I was a baby, raised in a community that was shut off from the real world. A community where we were nothing but empty vessels, until Hella (my best friend) and I escaped. Hella took us to a girl who was in foster care with him before he was summoned into The Army. After finding out yet another complication in my life, I needed space. I booked in to a run down apartment, ready to clear my head. Only my head didn’t clear, because I was haunted every night from the screams that would vibrate through my walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a story of a perfect man coming in to save the day. This is a story of what happens when fate interferes and two completely broken souls collide.</description>

  <description>A dark, gripping and witty thriller in which the only thing humanity has control over is death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world where disease, war and crime have been eliminated, the only way to die is to be randomly killed ("gleaned") by professional scythes. Citra and Rowan are teenagers who have been selected to be scythes' apprentices, and despite wanting nothing to do with the vocation, they must learn the art of killing and understand the necessity of what they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one of them will be chosen as a scythe's apprentice and as Citra and Rowan come up against a terrifyingly corrupt Scythedom, it becomes clear that the winning apprentice's first task will be to glean the loser.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Eleanor West’s Home for Wayward Children&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Solicitations&lt;br /&gt;No Visitors&lt;br /&gt;No Quests&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children have always disappeared under the right conditions; slipping through the shadows under a bed or at the back of a wardrobe, tumbling down rabbit holes and into old wells, and emerging somewhere... else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But magical lands have little need for used-up miracle children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy tumbled once, but now she’s back. The things she’s experienced... they change a person. The children under Miss West’s care understand all too well. And each of them is seeking a way back to their own fantasy world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Nancy’s arrival marks a change at the Home. There’s a darkness just around each corner, and when tragedy strikes, it’s up to Nancy and her new-found schoolmates to get to the heart of the matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter the cost.</description>

  <description>My name is Dove Hendry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mine is Kingston Axton.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was captured by darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;She has always been ours…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They groomed me for Midnight Mayhem. Like a trained possession, weak against their control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;She has been conditioned with our blood for years. She just doesn’t know it yet...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Midnight Mayhem was the stained glass that concealed a very dark culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A culture that she is about to become the center of.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brothers of Kiznitch come in fours, and they’re not happy about me being hustled into their acts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Or are we? Careful, Little Bird. A warning is a warning for a reason…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind-tricks.&lt;br /&gt;Stunts.&lt;br /&gt;Deceit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Power.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there’s something uglier that has been haunting me for years upon years. So ugly that I have never seen its face. I never had to. I’d hear his whispers through my internal screams, feel his shadow brush against my nightmares. He was my the monster that tormented me.&lt;br /&gt;And maybe lived under your bed…&lt;br /&gt;When I started Midnight Mayhem, his presence faded.&lt;br /&gt;His whispers were silenced.&lt;br /&gt;His shadow dissolving without a trace.&lt;br /&gt;I wondered why that was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; She didn’t have to wonder for long…&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;My name is Elizabeth Anne Hawksmith, and my age is three hundred and eighty-four years. Each new settlement asks for a new journal, and so this Book of Shadows begins.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the spring of 1628, the Witchfinder of Wessex finds himself a true Witch. As Bess Hawksmith watches her mother swing from the Hanging Tree she knows that only one man can save her from the same fate at the hands of the panicked mob: the Warlock Gideon Masters, and his Book of Shadows. Secluded at his cottage in the woods, Gideon instructs Bess in the Craft, awakening formidable powers she didn't know she had and making her immortal. She couldn't have foreseen that even now, centuries later, he would be hunting her across time, determined to claim payment for saving her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In present-day England, Elizabeth has built a quiet life for herself, tending her garden and selling herbs and oils at the local farmers' market. But her solitude abruptly ends when a teenage girl called Tegan starts hanging around. Against her better judgment, Elizabeth begins teaching Tegan the ways of the Hedge Witch, in the process awakening memories—and demons—long thought forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part historical romance, part modern fantasy, &lt;i&gt;The Witch’s Daughter&lt;/i&gt; is a fresh, compelling take on the magical, yet dangerous world of Witches. Readers will long remember the fiercely independent heroine who survives plagues, wars, and the heartbreak that comes with immortality to remain true to herself, and protect the protégé she comes to love.</description>

  <description>Wings of silver. Wings of blue. Mortal heart. Broken dreams. Shatter. Shatter. Shatter. A sundering. A grave. I see the end. I see. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world is in chaos as the power surge of the Cascade rises to a devastating crescendo. In furiously resisting its attempts to turn Elena into a vessel for Raphael’s power, Elena and her archangel are irrevocably changed. . .far beyond the prophecy of a cursed Ancient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, violent and eerie events around the world threaten to wipe out entire populations. And in the Archangel Lijuan’s former territory, an unnatural fog weaves through the land, leaving only a bone-chilling silence in its wake. Soon it becomes clear that even the archangels are not immune to this deadly evil. This time, even the combined power of the Cadre may not be enough. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This war could end them all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Return to New York Times bestselling author Nalini Singh’s darkly passionate Guild Hunter world, where human-turned-angel Elena Deveraux, consort to Archangel Raphael, is thrust center stage into an eons-old prophecy….&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Midnight and dawn, Elena’s wings are unique among angelkind…and now they’re failing. The first mortal to be turned into an immortal in angelic memory, she’s regressing. Becoming more and more human. Easier to hurt. Easier to kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elena and Raphael must unearth the reason for the regression before it’s too late and Elena falls out of the sky. Yet even as they fight a furious battle for Elena’s very survival, violent forces are gathering in New York and across the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In China, the Archangel Favashi is showing the first signs of madness. In New York, a mysterious sinkhole filled with lava swallows a man whole. In Africa, torrential monsoon rains flood rolling deserts. And in Elena’s mind whispers a haunting voice that isn’t her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, survival may not be possible…not even for the consort of an archangel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;New York Times bestselling author Nalini Singh takes us into a dangerous and exhilarating world where a deadly, beautiful archangel and his once-mortal consort are caught in a fury of twisted darkness…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most vicious archangels in the world has disappeared. No one knows if Lijuan is dead or has chosen to Sleep the long sleep of an immortal. But with her lands falling into chaos under a rising tide of vampiric bloodlust, a mysterious and ancient order of angels known as the Luminata calls the entire Cadre together to discuss the fate of her territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accompanying her archangelic lover Raphael to the Luminata compound, guild hunter-turned-angel Elena senses that all is not as it seems. Secrets echo from within the stone walls of the compound, and the deeper Elena goes, the uglier the darkness. But neither Raphael nor Elena is ready for the brutal truths hidden within—truths that will change everything Elena thinks she knows about who she is…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing will ever be the same again.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In a manor by the sea, twelve sisters are cursed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annaleigh lives a sheltered life at Highmoor, a manor by the sea, with her sisters, their father, and stepmother. Once they were twelve, but loneliness fills the grand halls now that four of the girls' lives have been cut short. Each death was more tragic than the last—the plague, a plummeting fall, a drowning, a slippery plunge—and there are whispers throughout the surrounding villages that the family is cursed by the gods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disturbed by a series of ghostly visions, Annaleigh becomes increasingly suspicious that the deaths were no accidents. Her sisters have been sneaking out every night to attend glittering balls, dancing until dawn in silk gowns and shimmering slippers, and Annaleigh isn't sure whether to try to stop them or to join their forbidden trysts. Because who—or what—are they really dancing with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Annaleigh's involvement with a mysterious stranger who has secrets of his own intensifies, it's a race to unravel the darkness that has fallen over her family—before it claims her next.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In New York Times Bestselling author Nalini Singh’s newest contemporary romance, passion ignites between a gorgeous, sinfully sexy man who built himself up from nothing and a shy woman who has a terrible secret in her past…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wealthy businessman Gabriel Bishop rules the boardroom with the same determination and ruthlessness that made him a rock star on the rugby field. He knows what he wants, and he’ll go after it no-holds-barred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what he wants is Charlotte Baird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte knows she’s a mouse. Emotionally scarred and painfully shy, she just wants to do her job and remain as invisible as possible. But the new CEO—a brilliant, broad-shouldered T-Rex of a man who growls and storms through the office, leaving carnage in his wake—clearly has other plans. Plans that may be equal parts business and bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Charlotte intends to survive this battle of wits and hearts, the mouse will have to learn to wrangle the T-Rex. Game on.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Opposites don't just attract... sometimes they BOOM!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Valerie Dawson&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All I've ever wanted is to make my father proud. All he ever wanted was sons. I've never felt like I was enough… then everything changes when I'm assigned to audit the Broken Eagle's Motorcycle Shop and meet Rowan Pryor for the first time. The minute his eyes lock on mine, I know this gorgeous man is trouble. He's looking at me as if I'm his everything, his eyes telling me he's thinking of a thousand ways to get me dirty. And I like it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I have plans for myself and none of them include some hot, motorcycle guy in a small town. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rowan Pryor&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I traded a broken past for a brotherhood I could count on. War changes people, bonds them together, so when our time in the Navy is served, I join my fellow SEALS in Nashville to help start up a motorcycle repair shop. A big city guy like me is enjoying a distraction free small town life. But then Valerie Dawson walks into the shop, wearing those nerdy glasses like it's her mission to steal my breath away and I know I’m in dangerous territory. She makes me feel things I never thought I could feel and I am determined to make her mine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didn't believe in love at first sight... Until Valerie.</description>

  <description>Paranormal Dragon Romance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raven Casino loves solving mysteries. So it was only natural that she take to the Alaskan wild to find her missing friend, Juliet. She is ready to take on the world to figure out where Juliet could be. But she wasn’t expecting to meet not one, but two hunks in the icy small town of Antler, Alaska. These two were so sexy they radiated enough heat to melt the polar ice caps. Hot damn! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Frost and Ice were hired to make sure Raven was safe, but the minute they saw her, they knew she was the missing piece to their triad. Now to explain to her that she was meant to be with them both. Shared by both. And not freak her out. That was going to be harder than stopping her from getting herself killed in their little town. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s something going on in Antler and Raven’s out to find out what they’re hiding. With a missing friend and clues at every corner she turns, she’s taking this bull by the horns. The fantasies with Frost and Ice are a side effect of being so close to them, but she’d get over it. Right? Uh… When she solves a puzzle that’s bigger than she realized, it’s going to take two very alpha dragons to keep her alive long enough to get her freak on.</description>

  <description>Discover a brand new race of Alpha males ready to find their mates in a dangerous warrior planet. Sassy women traveling with Gerri Wilder are in for the journey of a lifetime and a mate that will love them through the galaxy. Are you ready? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grab the next Galaxan romance between a sexy warrior and his fiery mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Attention is something Riley Parks usually shies away from, but when she finds herself on a shifter planet in a distant galaxy, attention is exactly what she's getting. Especially from one smokin' hot hunk of a man. Jag. The man sends her body into heat and her mind to a scramble whenever he's near, but she's not having it. No way. A little taste might not hurt, though, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Royal prince, warrior, and womanizer, Jag Kasaval has his sights set on Riley. She turns his world upside down and his inner lion is clawing to claim her. Not used to rejection, he's willing to do anything to get his mate. What he didn't expect was a feisty hellcat waiting to be unleashed beneath her quiet exterior. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Riley and Jag are thrown together to help plan a royal wedding and coronation. She refuses to admit Jag is exactly the man she wants, even if matchmaker Gerri Wilder says it's in the cards. In the midst of palace intrigue, Riley's swept up in scandal and danger that drags her beyond the Galaxa she's come to know. With her life in the balance, Jag will have to find her before it's too late or lose her forever.</description>

  <description>Ivy Grimaldi can’t stand change. Ever. But change is something she’s had to deal with a lot lately. Like when her cousin Cassandra moved away to start a new life, baby and all. That all changes when Gerri Wilder shows up at her door with a letter from her cousin. Cassie wants her to come visit. Sure, why not? There’s just one problem. Cassie lives on another planet. A far-the-heck-away planet, with her hotter than hell shifter mate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vander Kasval, King of the shifter warrior planet Galaxa, has his own problems with change. A lead by example kind of a king, he’s between a rock and a hard place. He needs to find a mate to help put an end to a brewing civil war. None of this would be happening if not for a plague affecting only the females of his planet. His warriors and the men of the Palladian Capitol are ready to riot. Vander reluctantly agrees to send for matchmaker, Gerri Wilder. If she can find a match for him and his men, then his world might be saved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivy agrees to go, if only to make sure Cassie’s okay. Oh, alright, and to maybe find an intergalactic hookup for herself in the process. In a planet full of big, bad, sexy shifters, anything’s possible, right? Ivy’s in for the time of her life in a planet of unimaginable beauty and dangers she had no idea existed. But Ivy isn’t one to sit idly by and let something happen. With two new friends, they’re about to take Galaxa by storm.</description>

  <description>Royal St. James got her name when she was born. Not because her mother loved her royally, but because Royal was a giant pain in the ass. She’s spent her entire life fighting to live, and the last thing she needs is to deal with some pretty-boy police officer who wouldn’t know a hardship if it came up and bit him in the…you know. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Justice Rector wasn’t born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He was raised to work hard and always fight for what he believed in. His father was a cop, and ever since he could remember, he wanted to be one, too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was a complete coincidence that he ends up going undercover and meeting Royal St. James. It was just one day, a single moment in time. All routine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just do the buy, make the bust, and get out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Royal St. James, aptly named, screws everything up. Royally. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All of a sudden, he has a decision to make: blow his cover and save the girl, or save himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course, he does the most stupid thing possible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By saving the girl who most assuredly did not want to be saved.</description>

  <description>On a floating junkyard beneath a radiation sky, a deadly secret lies buried in the scrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve isn’t looking for secrets—she’s too busy looking over her shoulder. The robot gladiator she’s just spent six months building has been reduced to a smoking wreck, and the only thing keeping her Grandpa from the grave was the fistful of credits she just lost to the bookies. To top it off, she’s discovered she can destroy electronics with the power of her mind, and the puritanical Brotherhood are building a coffin her size. If she’s ever had a worse day, Eve can’t remember it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Eve discovers the ruins of an android boy named Ezekiel in the scrap pile she calls home, her entire world comes crashing down. With her best friend Lemon Fresh and her robotic conscience, Cricket, in tow, she and Ezekiel will trek across deserts of irradiated glass, infiltrate towering megacities and scour the graveyard of humanity’s greatest folly to save the ones Eve loves, and learn the dark secrets of her past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if those secrets were better off staying buried.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For both Zane and Darby, their small town roots hold a terrible secret. Now, decades later, they've come together to build a new life. But will the past set them free or pull them under?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zane Bigelow grew up in a beautiful, perfectly kept house in North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains. Strangers―and even Zane’s own aunt across the lake―see his parents as a successful surgeon and his stylish wife, making appearances at their children’s ballet recitals and baseball games. Only Zane and his sister know the truth, until one brutal night finally reveals cracks in the facade, and Zane escapes for college without a thought of looking back...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, Zane returns to his hometown determined to reconnect with the place and people that mean so much to him, despite the painful memories. As he resumes life in the colorful town, he meets a gifted landscape artist named Darby, who is on the run from ghosts of her own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together they will have to teach each other what it means to face the past, and stand up for the ones they love.</description>

  <description>A story of love and demons, family and witchcraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nova Huang knows more about magic than your average teen witch. She works at her grandmothers' bookshop, where she helps them loan out spell books and investigate any supernatural occurrences in their New England town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One fateful night, she follows reports of a white wolf into the woods, and she comes across the unexpected: her childhood crush, Tam Lang, battling a horse demon in the woods. As a werewolf, Tam has been wandering from place to place for years, unable to call any town home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pursued by dark forces eager to claim the magic of wolves and out of options, Tam turns to Nova for help. Their latent feelings are rekindled against the backdrop of witchcraft, untested magic, occult rituals, and family ties both new and old in this enchanting tale of self-discovery.</description>

  <description>Mia Corvere has found her place among the Blades of Our Lady of Blessed Murder, but many in the Red Church hierarchy think she's far from earned it. Plying her bloody trade in a backwater of the Republic, she's no closer to ending the men who destroyed her familia; in fact, she's told directly that Consul Scaeva is off limits. But after a deadly confrontation with an old enemy, Mia's suspicions about the Red Church's true motives begin to grow.</description>

  <description>Rose Drayton lives on the Edge, between the world of the Broken (where people drive cars, shop at Wal-Mart, and magic is a fairy tale) and the Weird (where blueblood aristocrats rule, changelings roam, and the strength of your magic can change your destiny). Only Edgers like Rose can easily travel from one world to the next, but they never truly belong in either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose thought if she practiced her magic, she could build a better life for herself. But things didn’t turn out how she planned, and now she works a minimum wage, off the books job in the Broken just to survive. Then Declan Camarine, a blueblood noble straight out of the deepest part of the Weird, comes into her life, determined to have her (and her power).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a terrible danger invades the Edge from the Weird, a flood of creatures hungry for magic, Declan and Rose must work together to destroy them—or they’ll devour the Edge and everyone in it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sexy category romance from Entangled's Brazen imprint...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seducing Mr. Wrong never felt so right...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prim and proper art gallery coordinator Elle Walser is no good at seducing men. Heck, she’s been throwing hints at her boss for months, but he’s completely clueless. Desperate to escape her mother’s matchmaking efforts, she comes up with a plan—buy some lingerie and climb into her boss’s bed. The plan goes brilliantly…until she accidentally seduces a sexy stranger instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad boy nightclub mogul Gabe Schultz just had the best almost-sex of his life. Too bad the smoking hot blonde thought he was his brother and bolted before he could finish what they started. Though her holier-than-thou attitude puts a serious damper his mood, Gabe’s never been one to give up on something he wants. And he wants Elle. But does a man who lives on the dark side really have a chance with a proper lady?</description>

  <description>From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Kristen Ashley comes a new story in her Dream Man series… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charlotte “Lottie” McAlister is in the zone. She’s ready to take on the next chapter of her life, and since she doesn’t have a man, she’ll do what she’s done all along. She’ll take care of business on her own. Even if that business means starting a family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem is, Lottie has a stalker. The really bad kind. The kind that means she needs a bodyguard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enter Mo Morrison. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enormous. Scary. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Quiet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mo doesn’t say much, and Lottie’s used to getting attention. And she wants Mo’s attention. Badly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Mo has a strict rule. If he’s guarding your body, that’s all he’s doing with it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, the longer Mo has to keep Lottie safe, the faster he falls for the beautiful blonde who has it so together, she might even be able to tackle the demons he’s got in his head that just won’t die. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But in the end, Lottie and Mo don’t only have to find some way to keep hands off until the threat is over, they have to negotiate the overprotective Hot Bunch, Lottie’s crazy stepdad, Tex, Mo’s crew of frat-boy commandos, not to mention his nutty sisters. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All before Lottie finally gets her Dream Man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And Mo can lay claim to his Dream Girl. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Every 1001 Dark Nights novella is a standalone story. For new readers, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.**</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;People lived because she killed.&lt;br /&gt;People died because he lived.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zafira is the Hunter, disguising herself as a man when she braves the cursed forest of the Arz to feed her people. Nasir is the Prince of Death, assassinating those foolish enough to defy his autocratic father, the king. If Zafira was exposed as a girl, all of her achievements would be rejected; if Nasir displayed his compassion, his father would punish him in the most brutal of ways. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are legends in the kingdom of Arawiya—but neither wants to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;War is brewing, and the Arz sweeps closer with each passing day, engulfing the land in shadow. When Zafira embarks on a quest to uncover a lost artifact that can restore magic to her suffering world and stop the Arz, Nasir is sent by the king on a similar mission: retrieve the artifact and kill the Hunter. But an ancient evil stirs as their journey unfolds—and the prize they seek may pose a threat greater than either can imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in a richly detailed world inspired by ancient Arabia, &lt;i&gt;We Hunt the Flame&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping debut of discovery, conquering fear, and taking identity into your own hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;

  <description>Oakley Spurlock is dying. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She only has weeks to live thanks to a freak infection that totally and completely destroyed her kidneys. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite her family’s desperation, not a single one of them is a match. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a last-ditch attempt, Oakley’s father takes to social media to beg for help to save his daughter’s life. &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pace Vineyard is lost. So lost, in fact, that he’s not sure he wants to be found. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But then a beautiful woman’s face is splashed across social media, and Pace finds a spark in his soul for the first time since a bomb went off beside him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s already missing two legs. What’s one more kidney? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At least, that’s what he tells himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What he doesn’t expect is to give his heart to the woman, too. Or for the woman to run away with it and force him to follow. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;WARNING: Author believes in soul mates and insta-love. Proceed with caution if you're not a romantic at heart.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Romance and poetry, ivy, lichens, and wallflowers, need ruin to make them grow.” ~ Nathaniel Hawthorne &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say money is the root of all evil, but sometimes, evil lurks in the most unlikely places. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Calla Lily Armstrong spent her whole life shielding her heart. Now she's ready to break down her walls and see what's hiding on the other side. With the help of her new friends, Poppy Gentry and Sienna Miller, the three band together to find their happily ever after. One Wallflower at a time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Former Atlanta Homicide Detective, Devin Hawthorne, moved to Savannah for a change of pace and a fresh start as a Private Investigator. He finds it right under his nose in the form of a Southern beauty who drives him to distraction, and deadly secrets that threaten her very life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rated mature for language and sexual content.

  <description>Winter lasts most of the year at the edge of the Russian wilderness, and in the long nights, Vasilisa and her siblings love to gather by the fire to listen to their nurse’s fairy tales. Above all, Vasya loves the story of Frost, the blue-eyed winter demon. Wise Russians fear him, for he claims unwary souls, and they honor the spirits that protect their homes from evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Vasya’s widowed father brings home a new wife from Moscow. Fiercely devout, Vasya’s stepmother forbids her family from honoring their household spirits, but Vasya fears what this may bring. And indeed, misfortune begins to stalk the village. As its defenses weaken and evil from the forest creeps nearer, Vasilisa must call upon dangerous gifts she has long concealed.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;INSTANT &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the #1&lt;i&gt; New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;In a Dark, Dark Wood&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Woman in Cabin 10&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Lying Game&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Death of Mrs. Westaway&lt;/i&gt; comes Ruth Ware’s highly anticipated fifth novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she stumbles across the ad, she’s looking for something else completely. But it seems like too good an opportunity to miss—a live-in nannying post, with a staggeringly generous salary. And when Rowan Caine arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten—by the luxurious “smart” home fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture-perfect family.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What she doesn’t know is that she’s stepping into a nightmare—one that will end with a child dead and herself in prison awaiting trial for murder.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the unravelling events that led to her incarceration. It wasn’t just the constant surveillance from the cameras installed around the house, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time. It wasn’t just the girls, who turned out to be a far cry from the immaculately behaved model children she met at her interview. It wasn’t even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman, Jack Grant.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was everything.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She knows she’s made mistakes. She admits that she lied to obtain the post, and that her behavior toward the children wasn’t always ideal. She’s not innocent, by any means. But, she maintains, she’s not guilty—at least not of murder. Which means someone else is.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Full of spellbinding menace and told in Ruth Ware’s signature suspenseful style, &lt;i&gt;The Turn of the Key&lt;/i&gt; is an unputdownable thriller from the Agatha Christie of our time.</description>

  <description>Piper Mackenzie first sees him shirtless, standing in front of the military plane she was about to board, with one rather large wrench in his hand. The fact that he has the plane—the one that she’s about to be flying on for hours—in pieces only minutes before she’s set to take off on it doesn’t faze her. At least not until a flippant joke about dying in mid-air leaves his lips. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The second time she sees him, he’s helping her from the wreckage of her car. The wreckage that he helped cause. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The third, he’s laying across from her in the same bed, and there’s no denying what happened the night before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The fourth, well that time would be the first of many. Being Mrs. Jonah Crew has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jonah Crew saw her for the first time as she stared at him in awe. It was snowing, the temp was in the negative degrees, and he couldn’t think about anything but her and the look of horror on her face when he tells a badly-timed joke. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The second time he sees her, his heart skips a beat, but not for the reason that one might think. Mainly, it’s due in part to the fact that his truck smashed into her car so hard that his chest hits the steering wheel and his heart decides to stop working right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The third time, he’s fairly positive that he’s died and gone to heaven. At least, that’s what waking up next to a beautiful woman like her signifies, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The fourth? Well, he’s not quite sure how he got there, but he’s already said ‘I do’ so what’s a guy to do? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Defeated, crushed, and driven almost to extinction, the remnants of the human race are trapped on a planet that is constantly attacked by mysterious alien starfighters. Spensa, a teenage girl living among them, longs to be a pilot. When she discovers the wreckage of an ancient ship, she realizes this dream might be possible—assuming she can repair the ship, navigate flight school, and (perhaps most importantly) persuade the strange machine to help her. Because this ship, uniquely, appears to have a soul.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland&lt;/i&gt; is a work of children's literature by the English mathematician and author, the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, written under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit-hole into a fantasy realm populated by grotesque figures like talking playing cards and anthropomorphic creatures. The Wonderland described in the tale plays with logic in ways that have made the story of lasting popularity with adults as well as children. It is considered to be one of the most characteristic examples of the genre of literary nonsense.</description>

  <description>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child—not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power—the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.</description>

  <description>Destined to destroy empires Mia Covere is only ten years old when she is given her first lesson in death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six years later, the child raised in the shadows takes her first steps towards keeping the promise she made on the day that she lost everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the chance to strike against such powerful enemies will be fleeting, so if she is to have her revenge, Mia must become a weapon without equal. She must prove herself against the deadliest of friends and enemies, and survive the tutelage of murderers, liars and demons at the heart of a murder cult. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Red Church is no Hogwarts, but Mia is no ordinary student. The shadows loves her. And they drink her fear.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Midnight Crossroad,&lt;/i&gt; Charlaine Harris “capture[d] the same magic as the world of Bon Temps, Louisiana, and [took] it to another level" (&lt;i&gt;Houston Press&lt;/i&gt;). Now the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Sookie Stackhouse novels returns to the one-traffic-light town you see only when you’re on the way to someplace else…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There is no such thing as bad publicity, except in Midnight, Texas, where the residents like to keep to themselves. Even in a town full of secretive people, Olivia Charity is an enigma. She lives with the vampire Lemuel, but no one knows what she does; they only know that she’s beautiful and dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Psychic Manfred Bernardo finds out just how dangerous when he goes on a working weekend to Dallas and sees Olivia there with a couple who are both found dead the next day. To make matters worse, one of Manfred’s regular—and very wealthy—clients dies during a reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Manfred returns from Dallas embroiled in scandal and hounded by the press. He turns to Olivia for help; somehow he knows that the mysterious Olivia can get things back to normal. As normal as things get in Midnight…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;My Firstlife is over, but my Everlife is only now beginning.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her last living breath, Tenley "Ten" Lockwood made her choice and picked her realm in the Everlife. Now, as the war between Troika and Myriad rages, she must face the consequences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Ten possesses a rare supernatural ability to absorb and share light, the Powers That Be have the highest expectations for her future—and the enemy wants her neutralized. Fighting to save her Secondlife, she must learn about her realm from the ground up while launching her first mission: convincing a select group of humans to join her side before they die. No pressure, right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ten's competition is Killian, the boy she can't forget—the one who gave up everything for her happiness. He has only one shot at redemption: beating Ten at a game she's never even played. As their throw-downs heat up, so do their undeniable feelings, and soon, Ten will have to make another choice. Love…or victory.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Step one...you die.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ONE CHOICE. TWO REALMS. NO SECOND CHANCE.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tenley "Ten" Lockwood is an average seventeen-year-old girl…who has spent the past thirteen months locked inside the Prynne Asylum. The reason? Not her obsession with numbers, but her refusal to let her parents choose where she’ll live — after she dies. There is an eternal truth most of the world has come to accept: Firstlife is merely a dress rehearsal, and real life begins after death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Everlife, two realms are in power: Troika and Myriad, long-time enemies and deadly rivals. Both will do anything to recruit Ten, including sending their top Laborers to lure her to their side. Soon, Ten finds herself on the run, caught in a wild tug-of-war between the two realms that will do anything to win the right to her soul. Who can she trust? And what if the realm she's drawn to isn't where the boy she's falling for lives? She just has to stay alive long enough to make a decision…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Branches and stones, daggers and bones,&lt;br /&gt;They locked the Beast away.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the death of her sister, seventeen-year-old Violet Saunders finds herself dragged to Four Paths, New York. Violet may be a newcomer, but she soon learns her mother isn't: They belong to one of the revered founding families of the town, where stone bells hang above every doorway and danger lurks in the depths of the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justin Hawthorne's bloodline has protected Four Paths for generations from the Gray—a lifeless dimension that imprisons a brutal monster. After Justin fails to inherit his family's powers, his mother is determined to keep this humiliation a secret. But Justin can't let go of the future he was promised and the town he swore to protect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since Harper Carlisle lost her hand to an accident that left her stranded in the Gray for days, she has vowed revenge on the person who abandoned her: Justin Hawthorne. There are ripples of dissent in Four Paths, and Harper seizes an opportunity to take down the Hawthornes and change her destiny-to what extent, even she doesn't yet know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gray is growing stronger every day, and its victims are piling up. When Violet accidentally unleashes the monster, all three must band together with the other Founders to unearth the dark truths behind their families' abilities—before the Gray devours them all.</description>

      <![CDATA[I really enjoyed this book, and was very happy to see that there will be more. <br />I’d heard some negative things about this novel - but I didn’t find them as problematic as some obviously had. <br />Great start to a series here - definitely recommended.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Charlaine Harris, the bestselling author who created Sookie Stackhouse and her world of Bon Temps, Louisiana, comes a darker locale - populated by more strangers than friends. But then, that’s how the locals prefer it...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Midnight, Texas, a town with many boarded-up windows and few full-time inhabitants, located at the crossing of Witch Light Road and Davy Road. It’s a pretty standard dried-up western town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a pawnshop (someone lives in the basement and is seen only at night). There’s a diner (people who are just passing through tend not to linger). And there’s new resident Manfred Bernardo, who thinks he’s found the perfect place to work in private (and who has secrets of his own).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stop at the one traffic light in town, and everything looks normal. Stay awhile, and learn the truth...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I found this a difficult book to get into originally - but that did pick up a bit about half way through. The characters were all interesting- but none that I really connected with. <br />The who-didit was also intriguing and I was surprised with the result. <br />Into book 2 in the trilogy. ]]>

  <description>Rule #1: No hot guys.&lt;br /&gt;It might sound ridiculous. I get it. It kind of is, but college was supposed to be my sanctuary. It was my place to start over. The rumors, the whispers, and the jealousy I endured through high school would all be gone.&lt;br /&gt;No one would know me at college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rule #2: No drama.&lt;br /&gt;I’d major in pre-law. I’d make a few loyal friends. Everything would be easy breezy. No one was going to use me or hurt me. I wouldn’t let them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rule #3: New year. New place. New me.&lt;br /&gt;Right?&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;And all because of Shay Coleman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Football captain and quarterback, he was the big guy on campus. The cocky guy in my political science class with a smirk. I hated him on sight . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. . . and he was about to break all my rules.</description>

  <description>Hazel Camille Bradford knows she’s a lot to take—and frankly, most men aren’t up to the challenge. If her army of pets and thrill for the absurd don’t send them running, her lack of filter means she’ll say exactly the wrong thing in a delicate moment. Their loss. She’s a good soul in search of honest fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh Im has known Hazel since college, where her zany playfulness proved completely incompatible with his mellow restraint. From the first night they met—when she gracelessly threw up on his shoes—to when she sent him an unintelligible email while in a post-surgical haze, Josh has always thought of Hazel more as a spectacle than a peer. But now, ten years later, after a cheating girlfriend has turned his life upside down, going out with Hazel is a breath of fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that Josh and Hazel date. At least, not each other. Because setting each other up on progressively terrible double blind dates means there’s nothing between them...right?</description>

  <description>A #GeekLove Ménage Romance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andi’s been denied funding—again—to expand her cookie business, and walked in on her boyfriend screwing another woman. Saying she’s had better days is an understatement. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kane and Isaiah, her online gaming partners and the cutest couple ever as far as Andi’s concerned, know exactly how to cheer her up. They’re thinking road trip to Las Vegas, compete in a national first person shooter competition for a cash grand prize, and find her a one night stand to take her mind off her cheating ex. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Andi’s all in… except she’s not sure she can seduce a random hookup. Isaiah and Kane offer to give her some hands-on experience. With each new lesson, it becomes harder for Andi to remember the guys are just friends. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If Andi can’t put some distance between their seductive three-way hookups and her heart, it will cost their team the competition, and she’ll lose two of the best friends she’s ever had. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher's Note:&lt;/b&gt; This book was previously released as Will Game for Cookies (For the Win Book 1)&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In Ireland, where female witches have been hunted to near extinction, she’s a rare jewel that glows like the moon. He’s a vampire, blood thirsty and not ashamed of it. When he sees a woman being abducted by two burly men, he can’t quite keep himself from trying to step in to help. Too bad Willow didn’t really need his help and instead he ends up in her not so gentle care. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Witches and Vampires aren’t supposed to mix. It makes them too big of a target… too much of a threat. Especially when there are so few female witches in Ireland to continue their species. The last thing Cavan wants is to be attracted to the tiny, red headed woman, but his traitorous heart won’t stop beating every time she’s near... A heart that hasn’t beat in four hundred years; a heart that would only begin to beat again once he found his true mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If he pursues feisty Willow he will be breaking every taboo there is among their species. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forever Bound is a novella featured in the Vampire Brides series. All books in the Vampire Brides series are standalone and can be read in any order. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Clay Cooper and his band were once the best of the best -- the meanest, dirtiest, most feared crew of mercenaries this side of the Heartwyld. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their glory days long past, the mercs have grown apart and grown old, fat, drunk - or a combination of the three. Then an ex-bandmate turns up at Clay's door with a plea for help. His daughter Rose is trapped in a city besieged by an enemy one hundred thousand strong and hungry for blood. Rescuing Rose is the kind of mission that only the very brave or the very stupid would sign up for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's time to get the band back together for one last tour across the Wyld.</description>

  <description>I'm kind of a lady, but definitely more of a weirdo. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hearing the woman at the table behind him say that to her friend should've turned Logan Gibbs off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't. In all honesty, it only makes him listen harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's had enough weird in his life to last a lifetime. The last thing his complicated life needs is a woman in it who has no clue what color you get when you mix yellow and blue together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, her obvious blonde moments aren't enough to deter him. Nor is her lack of finger-painting skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm a cop, not a miracle worker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hearing the man in the group behind her say that should've had Katy Roberts running away as fast as her feet would carry her. Katy's father's a cop, and it's hard enough to live her life with Daddy trying to dictate her every move. She needs another cop in her life like she needs yet another thing to go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add onto that, she can't find a job, has no love life to speak of, and has to be the oldest known virgin in Kilgore, Texas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, when she sees his painting—a painting that resembles a piece of the male anatomy more than the lighthouse they were supposed to be painting—she knows that she has to give him a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very last thing the two of them expect is for her father and his boss to force them to marry after an eensy-weensy accident. An accident that, surprisingly, both of them want.</description>

  <description>She was my princess. &lt;br /&gt;I was her psycho. &lt;br /&gt;Two worlds colliding with a BOOM. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There was a sh*tstorm brewing. Whispers. Rumbles. A rot—fueled by greed and protected by corruption—that’d seeped like sewage, eating away at everything it touched. The only people I trusted were my brother by blood, my brothers by patch, and the crazy Irish-Scottish bastard I did jobs for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That was why, when the hot-as-hell blonde started trailing my brothers and me, I had to act. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe Ophelia Kline was working with the enemy—playing me with lies from that damn mouth. Or maybe she was innocent—caught in the spread of toxic rot. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Either way, she was mine. And when push came to glock-in-the-face, I wouldn’t let her go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because all good relationships start with a BOOM and a little kidnapping… right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a Happily Ever Alpha novella featuring crossover from the Hyde Series and Aurora Rose Reynolds' Until Series. It can be read as a standalone, but it's recommended you read Until Nox first since a certain accented someone shows up often. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Not recommended for readers under the age of 18 due to alllll the good things: Adult language. Adult situations. Biker hotties who work in the gray. And an OTT hero who knows what he wants when he gets hit by the BOOM.</description>

  <description>Can be read as a standalone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I flew across the country with one goal in my mind.... finish my book.... and maybe lick the wounds of my shredded heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My editor was screaming for the first draft, my agent was nagging for teasers, and my publisher was reminding me that my strict deadline was only months away. However, there was a dilemma. I had writer's block. Not just a little spanner thrown into the works writer's block. Writers. Block. As in staring at the blinking light on my Mac monitor for days begging for a stream of words to magically appear on the screen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This was not my first rodeo, though. I am a well known and respected author with a New York Times best-selling status to my pen name. I just can't write about romance, flowers, and butterfly kisses when all I want to pen is my own rendition of Basic Instinct. Ice picks to the heart, forks in eyes, and knees being slammed into assholes crotches are not solid key pointers for a sweet romance novel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just as I was about to throw down the gauntlet and call in my defeat, I spotted him. The bearded, tattooed man who lives in the glasshouse next door. He was in a venereal, lust filled twist with a pretty blonde who had buxom bosoms and legs that went for miles. I should have looked away. I should have respected his privacy. I should not have opened up my notepad and took detailed dot points on his technique. However, every precise thrust of his hips, snippets of his well-carved physique, and droplets of sweat running down his glistening torso had words flowing quicker than I was able to write them. He was my inspiration, my muse, my next book alpha male. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My plan was working. The words were flowing, and they were magnificent, by far my best work to date. My editor was in love with the first half of my draft, my agent was using snippets of the first two chapters to secure big endorsement deals, and my publicist was talking about a new three book deal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everything was perfect.... until the bearded stranger spotted me spying on him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Adult content, sexual references, recommended for 18+ readers.</description>

  <description>“You don’t belong.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No words whispered in anger have ever rung more true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re the Kings of Brayshaw with the world at their feet, destined for greatness and in need of control. &lt;br /&gt;I’m the girl from the ghetto with nothing to offer and as defiant as they come. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say it doesn’t matter, that I’m one of them now, and nothing could ever change that. Not even me, should I dare try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they’re wrong.&lt;br /&gt;They underestimate how far I’ll go to protect them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trouble is coming...and they have no idea.&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trouble At Brayshaw High is the the highly anticipated follow up to Boys of Brayshaw High, and should be read only after having read book one. &lt;br /&gt;Find book one, Boys of Brayshaw High, here: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/BOBHUniversal" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://bit.ly/BOBHUniversal&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Not all heroes are good guys. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With a body count on his soul and blood on his hands, Killian Nox lived in the gray. Ruthlessly single-minded, if he wanted something, it was his. And when it came to the gorgeous lass with a fiery attitude, he didn’t just want her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He needed her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With southern-bred manners and a snark all her own, Augusta ‘Gus’ Allan was a connoisseur of cheap wine, delicious Mexican food, and good TV. Unfortunately, her taste in men wasn’t as well-developed. When her knight in shining armor turned out to be a douche in tinfoil, Gus never expected her real hero to be a sexy-accented, tattooed beast of a man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But he was exactly who she needed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gus had no clue how comforting a monster in the dark could be... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until Nox. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Recommended for readers 18+ due to awesome things like adult content and language... wink, wink, nudge, nudge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This Happily Ever Alpha World novella is a crossover of The Hyde Series and Aurora Rose Reynolds' Until Series. It features glimpses of familiar faces from Hyde and Seek, Best Kase Scenario, and Until November. However, it can be enjoyed as a standalone.</description>

  <description>Contradictions... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tall and short. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Inked and unmarked. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Golden and porcelain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Soft dreads and wild red. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dark and… darker. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Keeping more secrets than a teenage girl's diary, Harlow Cooper hides a lot behind her bubbly personality. College student and intern. Loyal friend and loving daughter. Fangirl and girly girl. Lover of strong coffee and even stronger margaritas. Former bartender and current… Well, let’s just say she’s suddenly in need of pasties and an industrial sized drum of glitter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Quick with a smile and joke, people assume Kase Teo is all ego with a slacker follow-through. But lurking behind his hauntingly beautiful blue eyes is an ocean. Knowledge, quick wit, experience, pain… There are depths to Kase that most don’t see. If there’s one thing he’s learned, it’s that life’s all about appreciating the beauty. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Kase, that means going after the redhead that’s set up residence in his mind. And his fantasies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now he needs her to see life’s more than just a best case scenario. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***Warning: This book is intended for adults. It contains frequent adult language and situations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Though it can be read as a standalone, it is STRONGLY recommended you read Hyde and Seek first.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's note: Alternate cover edition of ASIN B00UZSTI28.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piper Skye is rock ‘n’ roll. She’s party all night, sleep all day. She’s get wild and be free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or she would be if she had the time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the energy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And not being so awkward would probably help, too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the owner of a thriving dessert business, Piper spends her days at school and her nights elbow deep in batter and frosting. She’s confident her hard work and sacrifice will pay off as long as she stays focused and sticks to the plan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake Hyde is a workaholic with a jaded outlook on life. Surrounding himself with employees he considers his brothers, he long ago made the decision that his custom garage would be his focus. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fate, as it often does, has other ideas. Plus, a killer sense of humor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrown together by coincidence, the gruff mechanic and the sweet as sin baker have instant sparks. Suddenly, all of their carefully made plans have taken a giant freakin’ left turn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they do it on the back of a Harley. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Warning: This book is intended for adults. It contains frequent adult language and situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t try this at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least not without stretching first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe keep the sneakers on for traction, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***This is book one in a series, but each book will be a STANDALONE with a new couple. NO cliffhanger.***</description>

  <description>Isadora MacPherson is having a horrible week. What should have been a simple mission turned out to be a well-laid trap by the Prince of the Hybrids. Held captive, unable to escape his hold or his heated kisses, her entire world is spun from its axis, and everything she’s believed and known is challenged by the egotistical, self-centered, dreamy-eyed monster whose kisses leave her breathless, and his bites leave her craving more. &lt;br /&gt;Cian had one mission. Take out the hunter’s strongest weapon and make her into one he could use against them. What should have been an easy task is anything but simple. Isadora’s blood sings to him, awakening his inner beast who craves her innocent kisses. She’s supposed to be easy to break, but the more he learns of her, the more he craves the beautiful siren that lures him into her murky depths with her sassy mouth and quirky personality. &lt;br /&gt;There’s also a big problem: She’s his mate, the one who awakens the protective beast within him wants nothing more to keep her safe. &lt;br /&gt;When enemies turn into lovers, how far will they be willing to go to test their mating bonds? &lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading Forever Immortal, a Vampire Brides novella. There are eleven total novellas in this shared world, each of them a standalone paranormal romance. We, the Midnight Coven authors, hope you’ll check out all of them. For the complete list, just turn the page. They all share a world, but can be read in any order. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don’t miss a single bride! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forever Bound by Karpov Kinrade &lt;br /&gt;Forever Claimed by Kim Loraine &lt;br /&gt;Forever Magnolia by Dyan Chick &lt;br /&gt;Forever Blood by Lisa Manifold &lt;br /&gt;Forever Kept by Patricia D. Eddy &lt;br /&gt;Forever Still by Corinne O’Flynn &lt;br /&gt;Forever Desired by Ariel Marie &lt;br /&gt;Forever Onyx by Alice K. Wayne &lt;br /&gt;Forever Chosen by K.L. Bone &lt;br /&gt;Forever Immortal by Amelia Hutchins &lt;br /&gt;Forever Taboo by Nichole Chase &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Midnight Coven will be back soon with our next collaboration—Vampire Mates.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Now the Beast has found me. &lt;br /&gt;And he’ll never let me go.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;JADE&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Women aren't safe on Earth, not since the Big Mistake. &lt;br /&gt;Around here, there’s one rule: Don't go into town. That's where the men are. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I live in hiding with Zoey, Dev and Makayla. It’s a hard life, but we make it work. Or we did, until Zoey got sick. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now I have no choice but to head into town. I can’t sit and watch her wither away. I must find her a cure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My disguise fails me, my eyes giving me away. Men descend upon me like a pack of rabid wolves. Then a savage, alien warrior steps up. Eight feet of muscle, horns and claws. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The beast throws me over his shoulder and carries me off like he owns me. I have no idea what the wants, but the brooding look in his alien eyes makes me tremble and fear the worst... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;VUKAROR&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kysus lies in ruins. Sickness has ravaged our people, our women are barren. &lt;br /&gt;I am their King. I must save my people. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I need an heir. &lt;br /&gt;I must find a mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Earth is my last hope. If I do not find a suitable &lt;i&gt;nera&lt;/i&gt;, the Kaizon will die. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She is at the first human settlement I come across, in a group mating ritual. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A human female. &lt;br /&gt;Shapely. &lt;br /&gt;Curvy. &lt;br /&gt;She’s soft and so perfect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I swoop on the ritual and take her. She's special. I don't only want to claim her body. I want her &lt;i&gt;soul&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She will submit to me. She will be pregnant before the next moon. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This I swear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contains scenes of spanking.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BEAST is the first book in a brand new series, Warriors of Kaizon, by Luna Hunter. Each book follows a different couple and can be read as a standalone. No cheating, HEA guaranteed!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>I knew something was wrong the second she walked in the door tonight; I just couldn’t put my finger on what it was.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Same hair color.&lt;br /&gt;Same legs.&lt;br /&gt;Same face.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except… I look harder.&lt;br /&gt;At the small dimple beneath her lip that wasn’t there the last time we went out. And her laugh — that laugh isn’t as loud.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This isn’t the girl I’ve gone out with the past few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It’s her twin sister, and they’ve switched places on me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only I’m not quite ready to let them switch back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Originally published as part of TEAM PLAYER: AN ANTHOLOGY.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>CRUDE. ARROGANT. A**HOLE.&lt;br /&gt;No doubt about it, Sebastian ‘Oz’ Osborne is the university’s most celebrated student athlete—and possibly the biggest douchebag. A walking, talking cliché, he has a filthy mouth, a fantastic body, and doesn’t give a sh*t about what you or anyone else thinks.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;SMART. CLASSY. CONSERVATIVE.&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake, Jameson Clarke may be the university’s most diligent student—but she is no prude. Spending most of her time in the hallowed halls of the library, James is wary of pervs, jocks, and douchebags—and Oz Osborne is all three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s smart, sarcastic—and not what he expected.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;…EVERY DOUCHBAG HAS HIS WEAKNESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wants to be friends.&lt;br /&gt;He wants to spend time with her.&lt;br /&gt;He wants to drive her crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wants…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her.</description>

  <description>Tobias Gamble knew from a young age precisely the kind of woman he was going to make his. She was not going to be like his mother. She was going to be like the mother he claimed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In other words, she was going to be just right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And when Toby returns to his hometown of Matlock, Kentucky and claps eyes on Adeline Forrester, he knows she’s the one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem is, his brother Johnny has a new girlfriend. And Addie is her sister. Last, Toby would do nothing to hurt Johnny’s chance at happiness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Toby hangs around town to get to know the woman Johnny fell in love with. He also hangs around to get to know Addie. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But he’s fallen hard, and he knows the best thing for him—and Addie—is for him to leave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Addie Forrester is thrilled her sister Eliza found a good, solid man. Johnny Gamble is the salt of the earth. The best guy in the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The best except for his brother, Toby. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Toby doesn’t know it, but Addie’s fallen hard too. He’s perfect, except for the fact that he’s hands off and it’s torture, being friends with Toby when she wants so much more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Addie also has a lot on her mind. She’s got bills to pay, her young son needs food, Christmas is coming and her job at the grocery store just isn’t cutting it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Toby is steering clear of Addie. Addie is steering clear of Toby. But everyone around them knows this is the slow burn. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because just like Eliza and Johnny, Addie and Toby were made for each other. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When the new girl in town, Eliza “Izzy” Forrester decides to hit the local drinking hole, she’s not ready to meet the town’s good, solid guy. She’s definitely not prepared to engage in her very first hookup with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Izzy wakes up the next morning in Johnny Gamble’s bed and good girl Izzy finds she likes being bad for Johnny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, Izzy feels Johnny holding her at arm’s length. But Johnny makes it clear he wants more and Izzy already knows she wants as much of hot-in-bed, sweet-out-of-it Johnny Gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floating on air thinking this is going somewhere, Izzy quickly learns why Johnny holds distant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s in love with someone else. Someone who left him and did it leaving him broken. Whoever was up next would be runner up, second best. Knowing the stakes, Izzy will take what she can get from the gentleman that’s Johnny Gamble. And even knowing his heart might never mend, Johnny can’t seem to stay away from Izzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until out of nowhere, his lost love comes back to town. He’s not going back, but Johnny still knows the right thing to do is let Izzy go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Izzy knew the stakes, so she makes it easy and slips through his fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that’s before Johnny realizes Eliza moved to town to escape danger that’s been swirling around her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that’s why Johnny decides to wade in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That and the fact Eliza Forrester makes breakfast with a canary singing on her shoulder and fills out tight dresses in a way Johnny Gamble cannot get out of his head.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Danni: Mortal&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember nothing of my abduction two years ago. Sounds and scents trigger horrific flashes, but it’s all a blur except for one man with brilliant green eyes. When the tatted six foot two Adonis shows up at my door, my knowledge of the world is shattered. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bound to the immortal Scar by an ancient spell, we are on the run. Because Balen is the hunted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And if he dies, so do I.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Balen: Scar Tracker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My code of honor was respected without question … until I consumed the blood of a vampire in exchange for a mortal woman’s freedom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Scars want me imprisoned. The Wraiths want me dead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the woman I can’t forget needs me. And I’ll risk everything to protect her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it means killing her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Because in order for her to live—first she must die.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Full-length novel.&lt;/i&gt; Come meet the &lt;b&gt;Scars&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scars:&lt;/b&gt; Immortal warriors with capabilities derived from the senses: Trackers, Sounders, Healers, Tasters, Visionaries, and the rare Reflectors. They each have what is known as an &lt;b&gt;Ink&lt;/b&gt;, a tattoo that can be called to life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Stygian was originally titled JUMP.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Wanted: one hot guy with rock-hard abs and a big stick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Broke and desperate, Sugar Ryan has no use for arrogant, bad boy athletes . . . until she’s forced to bargain with the cockiest of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only he knew she was alive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her mission? Get on this hockey player’s radar any way possible.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zack Morgan is the king of the ice and the bedroom—but nothing prepares him for the mystery girl who shows up everywhere he does—frat parties, his favorite bar, and finally his front door with an offer he can’t refuse. The only rule in her boyfriend bargain: &lt;b&gt;no falling in love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after one (um, two) smoking-hot hookups, he’s done with pretending and vows to make their fake relationship real. Too bad she can’t trust a player with a reputation for breaking hearts.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will this hockey star score his forever girl or will their Boyfriend Bargain end in heartbreak? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A standalone hockey romance.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>You murder a man, and all of a sudden people are scared of you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Slate Solis went from being a guy that people went to in times of need to an ex-con that people crossed the street to avoid being too close to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He knows he’s done wrong, but out of all of his sins, only one really bothers him—coveting thy neighbor’s wife. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Harleigh Belle—the cute little lady that never gives him a second glance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After seeing her for the first time while he was in prison, she’s stayed on his mind for three long years. Each time she comes in to visit with her friend on family day, he can’t help but stare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then the day comes that he’s set free, and he’s almost disappointed that he’ll never see her again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except fate has different plans. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He hasn’t been back in his house for more than three hours when he sees her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Harleigh Belle in all her glory…oh, and her husband that is everything Slate isn’t. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He tells himself that her being fifty feet away from him, all day every day, is a complete coincidence. One that he shouldn’t take advantage of. The more time passes, the harder it gets to stay away. Until one day, and one very ill-timed thunderstorm, ruin everything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Who knew that baby-making-weather was a real thing? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Reed Bradford and Joey Lawson's story&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How far would you go to keep a promise? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reed Bradford never should have made that promise. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’d barely survived the first time around, but now she was back, his best friend’s little sister, his one-time neighbor, and the woman that he never should have promised to protect. He never should have done a lot of things, like cross that line, but once he did… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There was no turning back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Joey Lawson always had a plan, but unfortunately, mostly for her, sometimes those plans backfired. On her. This time would be no different. After the unfortunate incident that she felt was better not to think about, she found herself doing the one thing that she’d never survive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Falling in love with a Bradford.</description>

  <description>Cursed, numb, rejected, scorned, wicked, sinister, dark, twisted...my name is Tex Campisi and this is my legacy. I killed my father in cold blood and lost my soul right along with him. &lt;br /&gt;I crave war more than peace, and I'm about to take my place in history as the youngest Capo dei Capi in the Cosa Nostra...that is until someone stops me, saves me from myself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the only person able to do that...is my best friends sister, Mo Abandonato, and she just ripped my heart out and asked me to hold it in my hands while she put bullets through it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Im cursed so I did it. &lt;br /&gt;I'm numb so I held it. &lt;br /&gt;I'm wicked so I liked it. &lt;br /&gt;I used the pain Mo caused as a catalyst to turn into my biggest nightmare--the five families greatest enemy. It's my turn to take a stand, knowing full well I'm going to lose my mind to the madness that is the American Mafia. I've always been told Blood is thicker than life. I wish I would have listened. Because regardless of who you love? You will betray. You will kill. &lt;br /&gt;Blood Always Wins. &lt;br /&gt;The only way out is death...yours. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the Dark Side of the Family.</description>

  <description>From #1 New York Times Bestselling author Rachel Van Dyken comes the third book in the bestselling Eagle Elite Series...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“As burns this saint, so burns my soul. I enter alive, and I will have to get out dead.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chase Winter let the love of his life slip through his fingers and into the hands of his best friend and mafia boss of the Abandanato family. Now that he's been given a second chance to right a wrong--he refuses to let his own selfishness stand in the way. The only problem? He's not fully in possession of his heart, so when Mil De Lange, the girl who's innocence he stole, and heir to the worst of the worst mafia families in the US, asks him for a favor. He actually says yes, not realizing that that one yes has the power to destroy them all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mil's been in love with Chase as long as she can remember, but as the years went by, the love turned to hate, and now that he's agreed to help her, she's wondering if she made a fatal error. Because Chase isn't a teenager anymore. He's a hot blooded male, bent on owning every part of her body and soul, and willing to kill anyone in his path who dares stand in the way. &lt;br /&gt;It's time for secrets to finally be revealed...but make no mistake, it's going to take a lot of bloodshed for those truths to be discovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You've never read a New Adult Mafia story like this before...loyalties will be tested, lovers reunited, and friendships obliterated. Welcome to the Family. Blood in--No out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entice (Eagle Elite Book 3) May 13, 2014....Are you in?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Would you die for the one you love?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nixon Abandonato made his choice. And now he has to pay the price. Tracey is the love of his life, but being with him has made her a target of his family's enemies. The only way to keep Trace alive is convince the world she means nothing to him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trace Rooks has fallen irrevocably in love with the son of her family's sworn rival, and she knows in her bones nothing can tear them apart. Until Nix suddenly pushes her away and into the arms of his best friend... But Trace isn't ready to give up on a future with Nix--and if he won't fight for them, she will. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, a sacrifice must be made. A life for a life. For what better way to cover a multitude of sins than with the blood of a sinner . . .</description>

  <description>* The Rebel of Raleigh High is the first book in the Raleigh Rebels Series. Please be advised, this book comes with a trigger warning. Intended for readers 17+ * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Silver &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hit me. &lt;br /&gt;Kick me. &lt;br /&gt;Hurt me. &lt;br /&gt;Hate me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s nothing that the students of Raleigh High can do to Silver Parisi anymore. Over the past year, she’s had to endure more pain and suffering than most people are asked to bear in their lifetimes. She’s a pariah, an outcast, a ghost. She’s also never been one to take shit lying down, though…despite what half the football team might say. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With only one hundred and sixty-eight days left of the school year, it won’t be long until graduation, and Silver’s planning on skipping town and leaving Raleigh firmly in her rearview mirror… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until he comes along… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alex &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Orphan. &lt;br /&gt;Degenerate. &lt;br /&gt;Reprobate. &lt;br /&gt;Deviant. &lt;br /&gt;Alex Moretti’s earned most of his labels, and he’s not ashamed of a single one of them. He’ll earn far worse before he’s finished with his new found ‘friends’ at Raleigh High. Having spent years being ground down under the boot heel of society, it’s time for a little payback. And if exacting revenge upon the heads of the Raleigh elite means he can also help the beautiful girl who hovers in the shadows, then that’s all for the better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oil and water. Fire and ice. The differences between Silver and Alex are broader than any chasm. To reach one another, they must take a leap of faith and fall into the divide. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And falling? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nothing good ever came from falling.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My body wants a mate. But I sure wasn't counting on three…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's the most embarrassing time of any female shifter's life. My body is desperate to be mated, and it's willing to do whatever it has to to get the job done. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have no home to go to, no place on this earth that feels safe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Intent on riding out my mating season alone, I travel into the wilderness, when a freak blizzard leaves me stranded. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course, the only house around for miles is home to three ripped, wolf-shifter guys. They take me in—no strings attached. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In any normal situation, they'd be fighting each other for the right to claim me. But this isn't normal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These men take their pack-bond seriously, and they share everything. If I let them, they'll share me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being so close to them as my season approaches is too much for me to bear. I need their hands on my skin, their touch. I beg them to help me scratch my itch and soothe my ache. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only they don't just want to sleep with me. They want to take me as their lover. Their mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They want to keep me—for life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Snowed In With The Pack is a steamy reverse harem paranormal romance, with dirty language and hot wolf-shifter alpha males. It is only recommended for readers 18+. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is 22,000 words, and has a guaranteed happy ending. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>It all started with a sexy selfie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texted to the wrong number. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oops.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not my finest moment — but I have nothing to be ashamed of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She thought I was no better, and I quote, than the &lt;i&gt;knuckle-dragging douche-bags she was never dating again.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a stupid dare from a girl I’d met online, but since she’d given me a fake number, I didn’t feel bad that my interests were suddenly focused elsewhere — on the fiery and sharp-tongued, Peyton that I found myself sparring with over text for the rest of the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following day, my case of mistaken identity came back to bite me in the banana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I strolled into the office, I was introduced to Peyton as the new client I needed to win over. &lt;i&gt;The Peyton&lt;/i&gt;, in case you're not tracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let’s just say she had my &lt;i&gt; full&lt;/i&gt; attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brains? &lt;i&gt;Check.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty? &lt;i&gt;Oh yeah.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part? She hated me on sight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear God, do I love a challenge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let the games begin.</description>

  <description>Poor judgment: knowing better yet doing it anyway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Flint Stone is a professional in every way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s a police officer with the K-9 unit and works at Gun Barrel High as the school resource officer. In his spare time, he’s working his heart out to create a successful gym from the ground up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s loved by every single person he ever encounters—student, faculty, and employees—Everyone but Camryn Elvis Presley. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing they have in common is their mothers’ poor excuses for names. &lt;br /&gt;Period. The end. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So why is it every time she crosses his path that he has the urge to mess up her perfectly curled hair? Or unbutton a few of her prim and proper buttons? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He knows he should stay away, yet like the high schoolers he’s around every day, he has no choice but to react first and think about the consequences later. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Side note—bad decisions are made, leading to lapses in judgment that threaten both of their jobs. Yet when the time comes, neither one can seem to find the wherewithal to care. Why? Because being bad feels so good.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;WARNING: Author believes in soul mates and insta-love. Proceed with caution if you're not a romantic at heart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six hundred minutes. That’s all it took ex-SEAL Kade Kingston to find trouble his first day home. He’d managed to survive covert operations in the hostile mountains of Afghanistan, only to be brought down by a baseball bat. If he had the first five hundred minutes back, he would have only had one drink before insisting his old friend tell him what the hell was going on. As it stood now, he and Sutton were both dead in the water—literally and figuratively. Six hundred minutes. That’s all it took for Kade Kingston to walk back into hell in his own backyard, losing everything in the process . . . including his freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inmate dog trainer, Harley Dash, knew Kade briefly as a teenager and was convinced of his innocence. Wanting to help the brooding ex-SEAL, she took it upon herself to force Kade into the Inmate Dog Training Program while she looked for a killer. With Kade confined, Harley and her father, along with two sexy SEALs, looked for evidence that would set Kade free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, for Kade, Sutton's murder was just the tip of the iceberg in a case of corruption and murder, one that will send Kade and Harley into the Florida Everglades with a killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will they survive the alligators of the Florida Everglades, or will the Dread Pirate Roberts exact his revenge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;US &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/1LFytgT" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://amzn.to/1LFytgT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UK &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B012HNX9QO" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0...&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;CA &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B012HNX9QO" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B012H...&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;AU &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B012HNX9QO" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B...&lt;/a&gt;…</description>

  <description>He told me to 'settle, girl.' &lt;br /&gt;He asked if 'something was wrong with me?' &lt;br /&gt;He said I was an ‘easy target.’ &lt;br /&gt;That was within minutes when I first met Caden Banks. &lt;br /&gt;I labeled him an *sshole, but he was more than that. Arrogant. Smug. Alpha. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was also to-die-for gorgeous, and my stepbrother’s fraternity brother. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, yes I was a little naive, a tad bit socially awkward, and the smallest amount of stalker-ish, but if Caden Banks thought he could tell me what to do, he had another thing coming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to college with daydreams about being with my stepbrother, but what if I fell for the anti-stepbrother instead?</description>

  <description>Carter bought his way out of the mafia to protect Emma, but when an old ghost returns to the Mauricio Family, a chain of events starts that can harm everyone. While Carter must decide to return to the Mauricio Family or not, a face that is oddly familiar to Emma comes into her life. She’s given the chance to discover more about her family while tension between the rivaling Mauricio and Bertal Family comes to a head in an explosive way. The truce is officially off, and when the two worlds collide, Carter’s decision is made. &lt;br /&gt;He didn’t start this war, but he will end it. &lt;br /&gt;He will do anything to protect Emma.</description>

  <description>Good vs Bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light vs Dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right vs Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are always two sides to every coin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josiah ‘Liner’ Paldecki knew the moment he laid eyes on her that there was something different about her. Something special. Something so unique that it practically poleaxed him the moment that their eyes met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except, the next time he saw her, it was like she was a different woman altogether. There was a blankness to her eyes that concerned him. An air of menace about her that honestly scared him to death. He’s more than man enough to admit it.&lt;br /&gt;At first, Liner thinks it’s because she’s bi-polar, or possibly psychopathic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he realizes the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That there isn’t a single person that exhibits such different personalities, but two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two identical twin sisters, both completely different, yet exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One with a soul, and one without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One that has his heart, and one that only wants to destroy it.</description>

  <description>They rule my new town, my school, and with more money than God, there’s very little out of their reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four gorgeous, perfect, scary boys. There used to be five, but one of them died, leaving a fifth position that I now fill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't ask for this. I didn't want to be part of this billionaire-boys-club. But no one cares about what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian Beckett is the worst of them. Their leader. He draws me in, and strips me of every defense I have. He calls me Butterfly, but it's not a pet name, it's a threat. Beck wants nothing more than to break my wings, pin me to a board and watch me writhe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wants to see me broken. Body, heart and soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what these elite want, they get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only they've never met Riley Jameson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let the battle begin.&lt;br /&gt;**This dark romance features four sexy, dangerous boys but is NOT a reverse harem.**</description>

  <description>New York Times bestselling author Meghan March continues the story of ruthless, calculating billionaire Jericho Forge in Luck of the Devil. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My poker face has always been one of my greatest assets, along with my grit and determination. I was beholden to no one. Asked permission for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Then Jericho Forge took my life by storm.&lt;br /&gt;I traded my freedom for something infinitely more precious, but I didn’t realize he was holding an unbeatable hand.&lt;br /&gt;Now, all I have to do is survive the high-stakes game that is my life—with my heart intact.&lt;br /&gt;But not falling in love with Forge? That will take the luck of the devil. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Luck of the Devil is the second book of the Forge Trilogy, and should be read following Deal with the Devil. The Forge Trilogy concludes in Heart of the Devil.</description>

  <description>Seven years ago, the Atargatis set off on a voyage to the Mariana Trench to film a “mockumentary” bringing to life ancient sea creatures of legend. It was lost at sea with all hands. Some have called it a hoax; others have called it a maritime tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a new crew has been assembled. But this time they’re not out to entertain. Some seek to validate their life’s work. Some seek the greatest hunt of all. Some seek the truth. But for the ambitious young scientist Victoria Stewart this is a voyage to uncover the fate of the sister she lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the truth may be, it will only be found below the waves. But the secrets of the deep come with a price.</description>

      <![CDATA[Just finished Into The Drowning Deep from Mira Grant. It was a very interesting story and the telling of that story was extremely engaging. Throughly enjoyed this book, I’m rating it 🌟🌟🌟. - it would have been a four star book, except I felt that the ending was very rushed and just anti-climatic....]]>

  <description>Ghosts are real. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, technically speaking, maybe not. But the ones that haunt a man’s soul? Those are very real. So real, in fact, that there are times when Castiel would rather silence them forever in the worst way possible than to go on living with them haunting his every step. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All it took was one single second in time for his attention to drift, and everything changed. &lt;br /&gt;Life as he once knew it, is over. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he’s struggling to make sense of the pieces that are left, and he’s fairly sure at least half of them are missing. &lt;br /&gt;He’s living for three things now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His club—the Bear Bottom Guardians. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His work as a police officer for Bear Bottom Police Department. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the occasional glimpse of a girl that makes his spirit feel free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the ghosts that haunt him, he’s not willing to present them with another target. Which is why he has to stay away from her. He can’t touch her. He can’t talk to her. He can’t get anywhere near her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not and live with himself afterward. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is, Turner doesn’t care what Castiel wants. She also has a solution for his ghosts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may call her Ms. Ghostbuster.</description>

  <description>Zee + Annmarie and Tan + Jubilee. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forever. No exceptions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They were to have the picture-perfect life together. Everything was all planned out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jubilee was to marry Eitan and Ezekiel was to marry Annmarie. That’s how it was always supposed to be from the moment that they met. Textbook, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eitan and Annmarie die in a freak accident that never should have happened, leaving the two survivors reeling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sixteen years later, Jubilee and Zee can’t even be in the same room with each other before things begin to deteriorate. Too many memories. Too much pain. Not enough forgiveness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They’re like hellfire and holy water, and neither one of them is willing to admit that they’re wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then one day things change, and all of a sudden, they’re looking at each other like maybe they aren’t each other’s enemies after all. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>There were always whispers about my roommate at Hillcrest Academy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wealthiest of the wealthy sent their kids to our boarding school, and Brooke Bennett had been at the top, though I never quite knew why. She was fun and outgoing, but she kept quiet about her family. The only things she showed me were photographs of her brothers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became fascinated with her second-oldest brother. Kai Bennett. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was the most of them all. Smoldering. Hypnotic. Alluring. &lt;br /&gt;Kai had eyes that pulled me in and a face that haunted my dreams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I met him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He came to our school with their father, and that’s when I learned what kind of family Brooke came from. They were mafia, and Brooke’s oldest brother was dead. Her father said accident, but Brooke said murder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three months later, her father died, and Kai became the head of the Bennett Family. Brooke left Hillcrest for good, and that was the last time I saw her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourteen years later, I’m staring at her face on the television. Brooke is missing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later, Kai Bennett kidnaps me.</description>

      <![CDATA[Once again Tijan has gifted us with a book with such an amazingly well written roller coaster of a story. The characters reach out and grab you and you have to keep turning the page to see what emotional tortures she was inflicting next. Definitely a recommendation if you love Mafia stories.]]>

What isn't in doubt is that someone is dead. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madeline is a force to be reckoned with: witty, noisy and passionate. She remembers everything and forgives no one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celeste is the kind of beautiful woman who makes the world stop and stare.

  <description>Massachusetts State Investigator Win Garano is given one of his most challenging cases yet when he is asked to investigate the death of a young British woman murdered more than forty years ago. Assumed to be a victim of the Boston Strangler, blind Janie Brolin was raped and left for dead in 1962. With no DNA and sketchy police records, this is a case that will test Garano to his limits. It will take him on a journey through the archives, into the latest innovations in forensic technology, and into partnership with senior officers at London's New Scotland Yard. And as Garano unearths deadly secrets from the past, his hard-nosed boss Monique Lamont is putting both their lives in jeopardy with her lust for power and success. With past and present colliding, the tension mounts with every page...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this sequel to Kerri Maniscalco's &lt;i&gt;Stalking Jack the Ripper, &lt;/i&gt;bizarre murders are discovered in the castle of Prince Vlad the Impaler, otherwise known as Dracula. Could it be a copycat killer...or has the depraved prince been brought back to life? Now in paperback!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the grief and horror of her discovery of Jack the Ripper's true identity, Audrey Rose Wadsworth has no choice but to flee London and its memories. Together with the arrogant yet charming Thomas Cresswell, she journeys to the dark heart of Romania, home to one of Europe's best schools of forensic medicine...and to another notorious killer, Vlad the Impaler, whose thirst for blood became legend. &lt;br /&gt;But her life's dream is soon tainted by blood-soaked discoveries in the halls of the school's forbidding castle, and Audrey Rose is compelled to investigate the strangely familiar murders. What she finds brings all her terrifying fears to life once again.</description>

  <description>Audrey Rose Wadsworth and her partner-in-crime-investigation, Thomas Cresswell, are en route to New York to help solve another blood-soaked mystery. Embarking on a week-long voyage across the Atlantic on the opulent RMS Etruria, they’re delighted to discover a traveling troupe of circus performers, fortune tellers, and a certain charismatic young escape artist entertaining the first-class passengers nightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then, privileged young women begin to go missing without explanation, and a series of brutal slayings shocks the entire ship. The disturbing influence of the Moonlight Carnival pervades the decks as the murders grow ever more freakish, with nowhere to escape except the unforgiving sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's up to Audrey Rose and Thomas to piece together the gruesome investigation as even more passengers die before reaching their destination. But with clues to the next victim pointing to someone she loves, can Audrey Rose unravel the mystery before the killer's horrifying finale?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An all-the-feels novel of fierce love overcoming a dark past from the author of the #1 New York Times bestselling THIS MAN series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Izzy White knows of the darkness in this world. After all, she escaped it long ago. Determined not to let her past beat her, Izzy has a secure, stable life with a job she loves in nursing. But one act of kindness will completely upend everything she's so carefully built-putting her right back in the crosshairs of danger she's been so desperate to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Theo Kane shows up like a knight in shining armor, Izzy can't help thinking she's been saved from one threat and exposed to another. His imposing physique, the harsh lines of his face, and the wariness of everyone who comes close are just a few clues to Theo Kane's notorious reputation. The man is positively terrifying. But with Izzy, he's tender and a complete gentleman, and her fascination with the mysterious beast of a man becomes too powerful for her to walk away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Theo's demons come to light, running becomes even more impossible. And yet staying together could doom them both.</description>

  <description>"Girls like you aren't exactly welcomed at a place like this, so keep your head down and look the other way." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those were the exact words of my social worker when she dropped me in my newest hellhole, a place for "troubled teens". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't listen, and now I'm on their radar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They expect me to play along in their games of hierarchy, to fall in line in the social order they've deemed me fit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad for them, I don't follow rules. &lt;br /&gt;Too bad for me, they're determined to make sure I do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inconceivably attractive and treated like kings...these are the boys of Brayshaw High.&lt;br /&gt;And I'm the girl who got in their way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Releasing January 17th, 2019&lt;br /&gt;Note: This is book one in a three book series</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;DEVIL'S NIGHT is returning! Hiding places, chases, and all the games are back...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BANKS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buried in the shadows of the city, there’s a hotel called The Pope. Ailing, empty, and dark—it sits abandoned and surrounded by a forgotten mystery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you think it’s true, don’t you, Kai Mori? The story about the hidden twelfth floor. The mystery of the dark guest who never checked in and never checks out. You think I can help you find that secret hideaway and get to him, don’t you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You and your friends can try to scare me. You can try to push me. Because even though I struggle to hide everything I feel when you look at me—and have ever since I was a girl—I think maybe what you seek is so much closer than you’ll ever realize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never betray him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So sit tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Devil’s Night, the hunt will be coming to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KAI&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have no idea what I seek, Little One. You don’t know what I had to become to survive three years in prison for a crime I would gladly commit again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one can know what I’ve turned into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want that hotel, I want to find him, and I want this over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want my life back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the more I’m around you, the more I realize this new me is exactly who I was meant to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come on, kid. Don’t chicken out. My house is on the hill. So many ways in, and good luck finding your way out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve seen your hideaway. Time to see mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Hideaway is a romantic suspense suitable for ages 18+. While the romance is a stand-alone, the plot is a continuation of events that began in CORRUPT (Devil's Night, #1). It is strongly recommended that you have read Corrupt prior to reading this.</description>

  <description>There are supernatural prisons hidden across the globe. Contained within these fortresses are some of the deadliest criminals from the five supernatural races: vampire, shifter, fey, magic users and demi-fey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessa Lebron, twenty-two, has spent her entire life in Stratford, Connecticut, one of the gateway towns adjoining these prisons which protect the fortified borders. She’s a wolf shifter, and her father leads the town council. She learns that much of her life has been hidden from her, secrets which threaten to tear apart the very fabric of her world. Especially the biggest secret of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is dragon marked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessa only knows what she’s been told about the dragon marked, that they are dangerous and must be eliminated to prevent the rise of the dragon king, the powerful warmonger who had his head removed a thousand years ago. So now Jessa's on the biggest hit list of all. Dragon mark hunters are lethal and her only hope to evade detection is to keep the energy contained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As more secrets unfold she finds herself locked up in Vanguard, the notorious American supernatural prison. Thankfully she’s not alone. Braxton, the dragon-shifter has her back. Together they must survive long enough to free themselves and the other dragon marked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it’s time for the dragon marked to rise.</description>

  <description>A Jamie Begley Anthology&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEAVEN SENT&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There wasn’t anything Shade didn’t know about his wife, or so he thought. When another man wanted Lily, it didn’t come as a surprise. What did was that she hadn’t told him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His “Angel” had been sent from heaven just for him, not for another who was trying to steal what was his. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some lessons had to be learned the hard way and “when you burn, you learn” was his favorite lesson to teach.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CHASING RAINBOWS&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ice had never believed in happily ever after … until he fell in love with Grace. He had put a ring on her finger, trying to tie her to him before she came to her senses and realized there was nothing redeeming about him. So, he wasn’t surprised that their marriage was on the rocks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might be chasing rainbows, trying to find the man she believed he was, but rainbows never lasted, and Ice had never pretended to be anything but what he was—a cold-blooded Predator. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn’t realize you don’t have to chase after something that’s already been caught.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;HALO FOR THREE&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hammer and Jonas were on the hunt for a woman to share. However, either they couldn’t agree on the right woman, or she wanted no part of being in a ménage. That they found Mika on Valentine’s Day gave them hope that they had finally found the woman that they could spend the rest of their lives with … until she disappeared the next day, leaving them with an empty bed and no way to find her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might have escaped for now, believing she had gotten off scot-free, but the bounty hunters were determined to catch their fleeing third. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might not know it yet, but some halos were made to be shared.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A friend’s duty.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tyler Murphy was an LAPD detective, single and happy—until a near-fatal tragedy crippled his friend, fellow detective Eric Catalano. While Tyler supported Eric, he also became a shoulder for Eric’s wife, Delaney, to lean on. But with one naughty suggestion from Eric, a drunken night with Delaney spilled into erotic abandon. Before it was over, Tyler saw his best friend’s wife as a woman and yearned for more. When Eric struggled to deal with the aftermath, Delaney begged Tyler to leave. Crushed, he fled to Louisiana, hoping to escape his longing for the one woman he could never have again…and unaware of what he’d left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A lover’s desire.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After two years of living with regret, Tyler finds Delaney on his doorstep, her husband having abandoned her long ago. She’s protecting a shocking secret and desperately needs refuge from a stalker determined to see her dead. As they fight to stay alive and catch the killer, they struggle to resolve the guilt of their past pleasures. But they can’t deny that what was once a spark is now a flame burning out of control. To possess Delaney—body and soul—Tyler must heal her pain and thwart the evil that’s a mere breath behind her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; MATURE AUDIENCE</description>

  <description>She’s undercover and in over her head…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When FBI analyst Tara Jacobs’s fellow agent and best friend goes missing while investigating a sex ring, Tara goes undercover as a submissive in a Dallas BDSM club called Dominion. But no man can top a woman with Tara’s moxie convincingly enough—until an edgy, dangerous Dom takes control of the scene and sets her heart racing with a single, commanding glance. Too bad he’s also the man who stole her innocence years ago—and one to whom she will never submit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; He’s got everything under control…until he falls for her again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Navy SEAL Logan Edgington once left the woman he loved to save her life. He knows Tara will never forgive him, but he has no doubt that he possesses the knowledge to help her master her fears and the strength to guide her through an unfamiliar world of pleasure and pain. He alone can protect her on a dangerous mission that reveals both wicked depravities and terrible secrets. Logan relishes the exquisite torture of holding her again and feeling her uninhibited response. No matter how much Tara insists their fling will end after this mission, he’s determined that she will be his once more—and this time, he’ll never let her go.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A secret fantasy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hunter had everything until a bullet put his career as a Navy SEAL on hold. Restless and in need of distraction, he accepts an intriguing proposition: share an acquaintance’s girlfriend and fulfill her fantasy of a ménage. It should have been just one night of sexual adventure among three consenting adults. But Kata is like no other girl Hunter has ever met. By turns audacious and sexy, then vulnerable and aloof, she’s a heartbreaker he is determined to master. But he needs more than one night. And he wants to do it alone.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An uncontrollable obsession.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kata never expected to leave her comfortable relationship and explore something so dangerously forbidden with a stranger. Though she tries to resist, the guilty pleasure overwhelms her and she surrenders herself, inch by inch, to the hard-core warrior who wants her for himself. Consumed by blazing desire, they’re soon threatened by the shadows of the past. To keep Kata safe, Hunter makes her a bold proposition of his own. Saying yes will destroy her heart, but saying no could cost Kata her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MATURE AUDIENCE</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She may not be what she seems...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can a virgin seeking happily-ever-after with a hot pop star who has a penchant for threesomes win her fantasy man? Kimber Edgington desperately needs a plan to convince Jesse McCall, who’s been her secret crush since they spent a summer together as teenagers, that they are meant for each other. But all the tabloid stories about his sexual escapades make her feel oh so inadequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But she’s exactly what men want.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to prove she’s woman enough for Jesse, Kimber turns to bodyguard Deke Trenton for sexual education. Bold and brash, Deke warns Kimber that playing with him is playing with fire. But he can’t bear to imagine the innocent beauty in someone else’s arms. So Deke and his super-sexy cousin, Luc, take Kimber under their wings and dangerously close to the edge of ecstasy. Though she’s saved herself for Jesse, Kimber soon learns he’s not the man adept at stoking her aching, endless need. That’s Deke, and he can’t resist when Kimber begs for more—and more...</description>

  <description>***This novel contains graphic sexual content and harsh language. It is only appropriate for adult readers age 18+. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever been so angry that hitting things felt good? Or so numb that you actually felt high? The past few years have been like that for me. Traveling between fury and indifference with no stops in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people hate me for it, while others are scared of me. But none of them can hurt me, because I don't care about anything or anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except Tatum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love her so much that I hate her. We used to be friends, but I found out that I couldn't trust her or anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I hurt her. I pushed her away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I still need her. The sight of her centers me, and I can pool all of my anger into her. Engaging her, challenging her, bullying her...they are my food, my air, and the last part of me that feels anything human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she left. She went to France for a year, and came back a different girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, when I push, she pushes back.</description>

  <description>My name is Tate. He doesn't call me that, though. He would never refer to me so informally, if he referred to me at all. No, he'll barely even speak to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he still won't leave me alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were best friends once. Then he turned on me and made it his mission to ruin my life. I've been humiliated, shut out, and gossiped about all through high school. His pranks and rumors got more sadistic as time wore on, and I made myself sick trying to stay out of his way. I even went to France for a year, just to avoid him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I'm done hiding from him now, and there's no way in hell I'll allow him to ruin my senior year. He might not have changed, but I have. It's time to fight back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not going to let him bully me anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***This novel contains adult/mature young adult situations. It is only suitable for ages 18+ due to language, violence, and sexual situations.</description>

  <description> In the Alaska wilderness, four streetwise boys became men—and brothers &lt;p&gt;Now the crazy ex-military survivalist who plucked Gabriel and three other boys from an abusive foster care home has died. But the sarge leaves them a final mission--to revive the dying town of Rescue. &lt;/p&gt; Gabe is done with being a hero. &lt;p&gt;Wounded in body and soul, the retired SEAL simply wants to remain holed up in his isolated cabin. He sure doesn’t want to be chief of police in some defunct town. But he has his orders.&lt;/p&gt; Audrey needs a place to hide &lt;p&gt;After the Chicago librarian discovers a horrendous crime, she wakes to an assassin in her bedroom. Injured and terrified, she flees, covering her trail every inch of the way. New name, new ID. New home. As Audrey learns to survive in Rescue, she begins to fall for the town…and the intimidating chief of police who protects it. &lt;/p&gt; Can the shy introvert and the deadly police chief find a life together? &lt;p&gt;Despite the discord in town, Gabe is finding his own peace…with the quiet young woman who seems to have no past. She’s adorable and caring and so very lost. But how can he trust someone who lies to him with every breath she takes?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Lacey Adams lives in the small town of Magic, New Mexico, where she devotes herself to the animals at her Touch of Magic Animal Shelter. The strange assortment of animals helps heal the pain and loneliness inside her since the death of her husband three years before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frost is a Star Ranger. He travels the star systems, bringing intergalactic fugitives to justice. When a maximum-security fugitive escapes from the mining prison, he is sent after him. Only this time, the fugitive has violated a major law… he has traveled to a distant forbidden planet inhabited by a race that has not mastered space travel yet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, he is in a race to find the fugitive before those on the planet known as Earth discover there are not one, but two aliens on their world. Things become complicated when Frost discovers his heart is not as frozen as he thought when a young human female is taken hostage by the fugitive. What he doesn’t anticipate is her unexpected resistance – both to the fugitive and to him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frost is forced to make a decision that is guaranteed to put him on the most wanted list when he follows his heart and kidnaps Lacey. He knows that some things are worth the risk. What he doesn’t know is that Lacey has a few secrets of her own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;* First published in the anthology,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22846776-feel-the-heat-box-set" rel="nofollow"&gt;Feel the Heat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Prince Viper d’Rojah, a warrior from the Sarafin cat shifter species, is not happy when he is sent on a special mission by his older brother Vox, King of the Sarafin. The mission is to deliver important documents to the human authorities before kidnapping the sister and grandmother of Vox’s mate, Riley. He has handled tougher assignments in his sleep and just wants to get back to finding the traitors trying to kill him and his family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tina St. Claire was finally happy with her life until her big sister, Riley, suddenly disappeared. Even Grandma Pearl suspected that Riley’s ex-employer was hiding something. Determined to find Riley, Tina’s research unwittingly leads the danger to her and Grandma Pearl. The unexpected arrival of a strange man causes things to go from bad to worse when he gives her and Grandma Pearl a packet of material he claims is from Riley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riley had warned Viper that neither her sister nor Grandma Pearl would willingly come with him. Viper could care less whether the females wanted to come or not, he had never failed a mission and wasn’t about to start now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viper soon discovers this mission has turned into the most important one of his life when both he and his cat recognize that Tina is their mate. Now, he has to keep Tina and her gun toting Grandmother alive. The question is, who is going to save him when both women discover his plans to kidnap them?</description>

  <description>"You can put that man in a suit, but he'll never be tame." &lt;br /&gt;One look at Jericho Forge and I knew the rumors were true. He was a predator, and he had set his sights on me.&lt;br /&gt;I knew better than to bet more than I could afford to lose that night. I knew better than to bet myself. But desperation leads to bad decisions, and I thought there was no way I could lose.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong. &lt;br /&gt;Now I have no choice but to make a deal with the devil.</description>

  <description>They’re the Vendetti crime familia, the most powerful mafia name in New York... &lt;br /&gt;Matteo Vendetti is a man who gets what he wants. As heir to the Vendetti Empire and the capo dei capi’s throne, he’s only required to do one thing. He must get married to prove that he’s matured and is stable enough to take over. The stipulation doesn’t sound like much of a challenge until he realizes who his betrothed is. Violet’s the Bottaro Princessa, not just a random woman he met by chance in another country. She’s young—too young by his standards. She’s headstrong—a problem for a dominant man like Matteo. She’s desirable—the biggest issue of all. &lt;br /&gt;Before long, Matteo’s questioning himself, wondering if Violet’s really such a burden, or if just maybe, he’s falling in love with something other than the Empire. &lt;br /&gt;*Brand new mafia series from Sapphire Knight! VERY steamy, so be ready!* OTTA * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WOW! Matteo and his brothers are HOT! By the time you finish The Vendetti Empire you’re not going to know which one you love the most. I’ll happily take them all! – Victoria Ashley, New York Times Bestselling Author &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Holy hotness batman, what did I just read! I won't spoil a single thing as this is one book you should truly read blind. Don't have a single thought as you open the book and devour the pages. There is nothing more b*d*ss than a crime family romance for me. I just can't get enough. Sapphire Knight draws you into this world with these strong characters and takes you deep into this place page by page. I couldn't stop and I'm dying for more! &lt;br /&gt;- Author Chelsea Camaron &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Holy flaming Kindles!! This is hands down one of the most panty-melting books I've ever read, AND it has a storyline. It's every b**kwh*re's dream come true! Sapphire Knight, you have some deliciously naughty words in your head, and I loved every single one of them! -Author Teagan Brooks &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I read the entire thing last night, obsessively, and holy wow. That has to be dirtiest, yet hottest book I’ve ever read. I was not expecting that level of heat. Dang girl. Dannnng! Sapphire Knight you’re a dirty bird and I love it! &lt;br /&gt;-Author Jaci J &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Holy heck in a hamper! GIRL! For one, I think I may now have hypertension. For two, you have absolutely knocked this one out of the MF Park. Hot AF! Sweet Jesus. Someone get me some dang ice water, open a window, something! &lt;br /&gt;- Author Kristine Allen &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you have ever met Sapphire Knight she is the sweetest little thing...but man does she write twisted and hot men! I hated the Vendettis and then I loved them! - Author P. Marie &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>I’m Beatrice Kennedy, but everyone calls me Beat. I live a low-key life, fresh out of college and drifting from town to town until I find my home. &lt;br /&gt;I love music, and how it stirs even the deepest and untouched parts of your soul. Depending on what you choose to listen to, would depend on what it touches. It’s the drug we all damper in, only different strains. My strain is Jazz. The smooth instrumental strums that take over me. The sound of cigar smoke, bourbon and an old dusty fedora hat. My strain wasn’t rap, and it sure wasn’t laced with some A-class shit like murky blue eyes casted down from the Lord and the Devil’s handcrafted smile. I knew who he was—the whole world did. One fateful night set off a chain of events, events that no one was coming back from. You can’t save people who don’t want to be saved. You can’t pull them up from the ocean when they’ve latched themselves to an anchor. Love was my anchor, destruction was the water that was drowning me, and the rope that was so tightly clamped around my ankles, was woven with the lyrics of Aeron Romanov-Reed, also known as, 'Manik. He steals hearts from all around the world, but one night, he stole something that wasn’t his to steal. &lt;br /&gt;Me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*this is a full length standalone.</description>

  <description>Gavriel Ambrosios has been dreaming of his accident prone mate for weeks. Now that he is nearing the apex of his vampiric transition, she has made her way to Lycaonia, just when he is at his most dangerous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Monroe was planning on staying in Lycaonia while humans forgot about the swan dive she took out of her boss’s office window. Little did she know that this short side trip was about to become permanent. Gavriel is the mate she has always dreamed of. Even as he sweeps her off her feet his need to protect her has him pushing her away. She’s both concerned with and drawn to his darker nature, but is determined to see him through his transition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the shadows their enemy has targeted Gavriel when they know he is at his most vulnerable. They creep ever closer to the Alpha estate putting the men on high alert. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the days get shorter and the nights get longer Elizabeth begins to wonder, which is the bigger threat? The enemy or her mate?</description>

  <description>In book one you meet our delicious Alpha Unit leader Aiden McKenzie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the topic of grandchildren comes up during a weekly sewing circle the matriarchs of the founding families seek out the witch Elder to scry to see if their sons have mates. They are shocked to discover that many of their sons' mates are out in the world and are human!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fearing that their future human daughters-in-law will end up dead before being claimed and providing them with grandchildren to spoil, they convince their own mates that something must be done. After gathering all of the warriors together in a fake award ceremony the witch Elder casts a spell to pull the men’s mates to them, whether they want it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aiden is adamant that he doesn’t need a mate and that they would only get in the way, little does he realize Fate is sending him his mate first! He meets his destined mate Meryn Evans and things go downhill from there. In the first twenty four hours she kicks, screams and knocks her bear shifting mate unconscious. They eventually discover that life before finding each other may have been good, but life afterwards is perfect, even if it involves super soaker battles and accidentally discharging hand grenades.</description>

  <description>This isn’t how fairy tales typically begin, but it’s where mine starts…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No money, no phone, and abandoned on the streets of Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my baby in my arms, I wander into a bar in a shady neighborhood and ask to use their phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my father turns us away and completely disowns me, the bar owner, and total hottie, offers us a place to stay…no strings attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m leery at first.&lt;br /&gt;Hot alpha guy.&lt;br /&gt;Down on her luck single mother.&lt;br /&gt;I mean, who wouldn’t be wary?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucio Gallo isn’t like most men, though. He’s fiercely protective, loyal, and did I mention he’s covered in nothing but muscle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all else, he’s everything I need but never knew I wanted.</description>

  <description>Linc has two very important things on his mind—professional football and his motorcycle club. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What he does not have on his mind is the woman that drives him crazy and makes him want to do stupid things, like throw caution to the wind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nope, not Linc. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At least, that’s the lie he tells everyone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In reality, every time Conleigh’s name is mentioned, he squirms. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s everything that he wants, wrapped up in a cute little package that is stamped ‘hands freakin’ off.’ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s four years younger than him, in school to be a doctor, and thinks football is stupid. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even more, Linc and Conleigh get along like oil and water. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s not a single second that they’re in each other’s presence that they’re not at each other’s throats. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But all it takes is hearing that she’s in trouble for Linc to drop every single thing—football and MC duties alike—and head to her side. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A side that he’ll remain at until they either kill each other, or finally give into the heat between them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Either way you look at it, he’s well and truly screwed. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Wade had everything he could ever want in life…then he lost it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, his life—his forever girl—is living in a house he built for her while he’s struggling to move on and find meaning where there isn’t any to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Landry Hill was his girl. His everything. His first kiss. His first and only love. His old lady and wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day he does something monumentally stupid, and she walks away knowing she’ll never come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward two years, and he’s still just as in love with her now as he was when she left. The only problem is that she’s moved on with her life, found a new man, and has seemingly forgotten him. Then there’s Wade—stuck in the same awful place where she abandoned him. The only thing he has left is his job as a police officer and the Bear Bottom MC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when they both think things can’t get any worse, life kicks them both in the teeth, and Landry finds out really quick that the only person she can depend on is the one that let her walk away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that understanding comes a deal. One that Landry has no hope of ever breaking free from, and one Wade will do everything in his power to make a reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one thing is still certain. The force that split them apart is still out there, and there’s no hope of escaping fate.</description>

  <description>Benson Bayou Beauregard is the president of the Bear Bottom Guardians MC, and the grandson of the Sergeant at Arms for the Dixie Wardens MC. He’s a mountain of a man and the warden of a prison, and there’s only one thing that can scare him—being told that he’s the father of a three-year-old little girl. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A three-year-old little girl that has no clue who he is. Hell, he only finds out about the little cherub when a woman from child protective services comes by and rocks his world before leaving the girl in his shocked arms. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every single thing he thinks he knows goes up in a cloud of smoke. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, the woman that he’s been trying to convince to give him a chance takes one look at the little girl and tells him that he’s just not in the right place to handle both of them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Bayou was never one to back down from a challenge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He can handle a three-year-old girl that acts exactly like him, and he can more than take on the fiery red-head that sets flame to his blood while he’s at it.</description>

  <description>Hoax knows two things very well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One, he’s not relationship material. Two, the nurse that treats him for erectile dysfunction is the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen, and practically has ‘the marrying type’ stamped on her forehead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Does that stop him from wanting her? No. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, he learned a long time ago that Army Delta Force and long-lasting relationships don’t go hand in hand. &lt;br /&gt;But beautiful hazel eyes, curly blonde hair, and the prettiest lips he’s ever seen play havoc with his resolve, making him forget his earlier convictions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All it takes is one teeny, tiny kiss for every shred of control he has to disappear, along with the problem in his pants. &lt;br /&gt;Soon he finds himself doing things that he knows that he shouldn’t. He doesn’t know that he’s found the woman that’s meant to be his. Nor does he realize that her father is the man he’s idolized from the moment he joined the army at the age of eighteen. Because, maybe if he had, he would’ve tried a little harder to ignore the pull he felt between them instead of making her his the night before he deployed for six months. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He also might’ve tried a little harder not to knock her up. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>What’s wrong with my butt? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She means those words to be directed toward the woman beside her, not him. But he can’t stop himself from answering. Not when her ass is the most magnificent thing he’s seen in his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Apparently, answering her with ‘not a damn thing’ wasn’t what she was expecting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She likely wasn’t expecting the baseball she took to the face at his next at bat, either. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All it takes is one ill-fated foul ball, and George Hoffman, Lumberjacks center fielder, falls head over heels in love with Wrigley Field—and yes, that is her real name. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From that point forward, George and Wrigley fall into a fast whirlwind love that ends with them eloping to Vegas. And he has his potty mouth, titty bar owning, pain in the ass grandmother to thank for it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not that he’s complaining or anything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Who wouldn’t want to be married to a woman that made his heart race like he was in the final game of the World Series? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only problem is trying to convince her of that.</description>

  <description>July Dupree and Dean ‘PD’ Hargrove fell head over heels in love. When PD comes home to tell July the good news about joining the SWAT team as a tactical medic, everything changes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;July can’t fathom why PD would want to be a cop in this day and age. Wasn’t it enough that he already had a dangerous job with the fire department? Now he has to add another, even more dangerous, job to the equation? With so many cruel people in the world who make a sport out of hurting cops just because of the badge they wear, she has to make him understand. But when he refuses to listen to her reasoning, she feels she has no other choice but to issue an ultimatum: her or the SWAT team. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dean doesn’t like ultimatums. He’s furious with July for putting him in the awful position of having to choose between a dream and her. &lt;br /&gt;July never believes for a second that he’d choose the SWAT team over her, but she is wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A year later, they’re both still in love with each other, but neither one is willing to budge regardless of their feelings. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;July’s feelings for Dean haven’t changed, in fact her love for him has only grown. But seeing him living his life seemingly unaffected by the loss of what they had breaks her heart over and over each time she sees him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dean has a good poker face, though. He’s just going through the motions of his life until finally, the smoldering embers of his feelings erupt into a full-on blaze of emotion, burning through everything but his love for July. When the smoke clears, Dean wants to know if they can reignite the fire of their love or is he destined to live his life in a constant state of controlled burn?</description>

  <description>Winnie thinks she has the perfect life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two beautiful, healthy children. A police officer husband. A job that she loves. Oh, and let’s not forget that she’s a nationally ranked marathon runner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fast forward six months, and her perfect life has imploded. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Winnie finds herself in a completely new world, and this new world is a brutal bitch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this new life of hers, her husband is gone. He realizes, at the worst possible time, that he’s no longer in love with her. He’s in love with her best friend. He leaves, and doesn’t look back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her sixteen-year-old daughter is in trouble with the law, and she’s barely making ends meet thanks to losing the job that was keeping her and her tiny family afloat. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then, the last thing that could make it all bearable, her running, is ripped out from under her, too. Thanks to a spinal stroke that leaves her unable to walk, let alone run, she’s having to relearn how to do the simplest of tasks—such as putting on her own pants. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s at the lowest of lows, and the last thing she wants is a sexy, bearded, motorcycle riding alpha to tell her how to live her life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Steel Cross never asks her what she wants. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The moment Steel Cross sees Winnie’s daughter steal some shoes for her younger brother, he knows he’s in trouble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s a sucker for misunderstood teens. After all, he was once one himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He knows he can’t just walk away, and the moment he sees that troubled teen’s mother, he doesn’t just know it, he feels it. Down to the very bottom of his soul. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With his share of hard knocks, he knows that he shouldn’t step in and make his move on a fellow police officer’s ex. There’s a code, after all, yet he just can’t seem to help himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s done being the good guy. Sometimes he just wants to be bad. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And Winnie makes him realize that being bad is still kind of good. As long as you’re with the right person. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Ghost [gohst] noun: the soul of a dead person, a disembodied, vague, shadowy spirit wandering among or haunting living persons; a mere shadow or semblance; a trace. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That noun sums up Ghost and what his life has become with painful precision. He is barely living, merely existing but never thriving. There wasn’t much that could pull him from the darkness he willingly inhabits…except one thing. Her. &lt;br /&gt;She is the reason he’s done what he’s done, and his life has become what it has become. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He haunts his former life, lurking in the background, surviving on occasional glimpses of the only thing good that is left in his miserable life. The horror he has inflicted upon her is nothing compared to the terror that waits for her when someone moves in to take her from him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The thing about being stuck in the past is that it is like walking through life backwards. She is always looking back, so she doesn’t see what is happening in front of her. Unfortunately for her, it turns out that the ghosts of the past aren’t nearly as terrifying as the monsters of the future. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say that true love is like a ghost, something that many talk about but few have seen. It’s a good thing for that, too, because he’ll need that element of surprise to protect her. Hopefully when the dust settles, he’ll be able to resurrect more than just himself.</description>

  <description>No take-backs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That was the motto that Drew lived by in all things, including his love life. &lt;br /&gt;He’s a player, pure and simple. &lt;br /&gt;He’s learned the hard way that women aren’t all hearts and flowers. Sometimes their sexy bodies and beautiful faces are just a pretty shield to hide the crazy, and he’s so freakin’ over crazy. &lt;br /&gt;Been there, done that. He has the divorce papers to prove it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Karma hits like a bitch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aspen needs a break. A long one that doesn’t include anything with a Y chromosome. Not even one as tempting as her new neighbor who just moved in across the street. Men are trouble with a capital freakin’ T, and she has the ankle monitor to prove it. &lt;br /&gt;The last man she gave her heart to was a police officer. A man whose life was dedicated to protection; he was supposed to protect her heart—not break it. &lt;br /&gt;She decides right then and there that she’s done with being the better person. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everything happens for a reason. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A rash decision—undoubtedly regrettable, undeniably unforgettable. In the heat of the moment, Aspen’s actions with a tire iron and her ex-boyfriend’s brand new SUV land him in the ER getting stitches and have her seeing the inside of a jail cell for the first time. &lt;br /&gt;It’s just her luck that the whole town is there to witness the result of her poor decision, including her police officer brother and the neighbor that already made it more than clear she was more trouble than she was worth. &lt;br /&gt;House arrest never looked so good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hide your crazy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Drew enjoyed the show, though. For the first time in a year, he’s thinking about his life, and how it would be a lot more enjoyable with a woman like Aspen at his side. &lt;br /&gt;Maybe crazy isn’t so bad after all.</description>

  <description>He knows that pain makes you stronger… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wolf isn’t always a good person, and he doesn’t hesitate to say what’s on his mind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is who he is, and he doesn’t offer apologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He isn’t out to impress anyone, and he doesn’t make excuses for his actions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She knows that fear makes you braver… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raven has made some bad decisions, and she’d give anything to go back in time and choose a different path. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reality is that she can’t go back, and the day Wolf walks into her life, she finally realizes that maybe she doesn’t want to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wolf is everything she’s ever wanted, and the exact opposite of what she needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both know heartbreak makes you wiser… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wolf knows that this is not a good idea. There are a million reasons—all of them bad—telling him exactly why he should stay away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Raven’s nightmares burst out of her dreams and into her reality, he doesn’t have a choice anymore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has to protect her, while somehow protecting his battered heart.</description>

  <description>The road to hell is paved with good intentions… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Apple “Core” Drew needs The Uncertain Saints MC like he needs air. He is barely making it through the day, and each one that goes by takes him closer and closer to hell. Literally, not figuratively. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s a half breath away from killing himself—maybe not by taking his own life, but he’s not against making someone else do it for him. &lt;br /&gt;Then he meets her. One of his club member’s sister, and his whole outlook on life changes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And not for the better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just as surely as he ruined his life, he ruins her life, too. One lapse in judgement on his part, and his one night of happiness turns into the worst nine months of his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Which he would’ve thought was damn near impossible with the things he’s done and seen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She never saw it coming… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was the beard. The beard made her do it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That is a good excuse for having sex with a man she barely knows, isn’t it? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yeah, who was she kidding? It wasn’t the beard. It was the way he looked so dejected and solemn. The sad look in his eyes pulls her in, and the way his rough hands touch her makes her stay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All she wants to do is take that look out of his eyes, but the consequences to her actions only make things worse, not better. &lt;br /&gt;One day is all she gets, and he’s not willing to give her more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until she dies, that is. Then it’s too late.</description>

  <description>There are rules to life that one just obeys in order in her attempt to stay on the right path. For example: &lt;br /&gt;1. You don’t wear dirty panties out of the house. You just never know who’s going to see them. &lt;br /&gt;2. A lady must always have chocolate at the ready—just in case the world as she knows it comes to an end. &lt;br /&gt;3. You don’t egg on a drunk woman who’s pissed off at life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why, you ask? Because they start bar fights, that’s why. &lt;br /&gt;Casten Red, the unofficial enforcer of The Uncertain Saints MC, wasn’t necessarily trying to urge her into doing anything illegal, and he definitely wasn’t trying to get her into a fight with a group of men who were all twice her size. &lt;br /&gt;No, he only intended to give her the confidence to stand up for herself, just a little nudge in the right direction. How the hell was he supposed to know she’d go all Chuck Norris on them and put three of them in the hospital with concussions? &lt;br /&gt;He should’ve followed his gut instinct and turned around that first moment he saw her in the bar, but Casten has never liked following the rules. Why the hell would he start now? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Jules has got a score to settle against the drug dealers of Denver. Vance has made it his mission that Jules won’t get dead while dishing out vigilante justice. Jules doesn’t have time for romance, she’s too busy saving the world and she enlists Zip (the gunstore owner), Heavy (an ex-PI) and Frank (a mysterious recluse) to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rock Chicks of Fortnum’s Bookstore get involved to provide romantic advice and guidance, none of which Jules accepts at first. The Hot Bunch of Nightingale Investigations adopt Jules as one of their own. Even though Jules tries to hang on to her inner Head Crackin’ Mamma Jamma, the Rock Chicks; Hot Bunch; Jules’s long-suffering Uncle Nick; Jules’s friend the rotund, African-American, Jackie-O wannabe, May; and especially Vance will stop at nothing to wear her down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Jules makes some bad guys pretty angry and one is dedicated to taking her out. Vance and the Hot Bunch have to pull out all the stops to keep her alive. At the same time, Jules and Vance learn the true meaning of home but once they find this precious entity they’ve been searching for all their lives, will Jules’s enemies tear it away?</description>

When he finds the terrified beauty, he vows to keep her safe—but he isn’t sure he has the strength to shield her from his own desires.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; As an unquenchable fire sparks between them, Lily’s tormentor stalks ever closer, and she must overcome her darkest fear to survive. Can she trust the bond she and Stone have formed as they’re falling in deeper?</description>

  <description>Arial knows the rules that keep her safe. She's been following them since she was a little girl: Do not tell. Do not show. But in a moment of terror, facing an attacker intent on taking more than just her life, Ari has no choice but to unleash the psychic powers she's been hiding since childhood.&lt;br /&gt;Now, with her abilities revealed, a bigger threat looms - something that makes her question everything she thought she knew about her parents and her secretive upbringing. But this isn't a fight she can face on her own.&lt;br /&gt;As the head of Devereaux Security, Beau Devereaux is no stranger to the strange. But when he takes on a new client - a beautiful young woman with an extraordinary gift - Beau isn't prepared for the extent of his attraction to her. What began as a simple assignment, just another job, quickly turns personal as Beau discovers he'll do anything at all to protect Ari. No matter what it costs him personally. Even his heart and soul.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What's worse than being pursued by the Four Horsemen?&lt;br /&gt;Discovering you're the Fifth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verity Jameson's day switches from mundane to disastrous when she runs down a stranger with her car. &lt;b&gt;Fortunately for Vee, she can't kill Death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Death, who just happens to be one of the Four Horsemen, and he's looking for her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Four Horsemen spend life preventing the end of the world, not bringing on an apocalypse. As gatekeepers of the portals which exist between the human world and other realms, the team fight to keep the portals closed and the supernatural forces under control. Without their fifth member, the Four Horsemen are losing the battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now they've found Verity and what they tell her goes far beyond the conspiracy theories Vee spends her free time investigating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new life with four dark, sexy and dangerous men fighting demons, vampires and fae? &lt;/b&gt;Not what Vee had planned, but a hell of a lot more interesting than her boring job in tech support.&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;So what happens when the unbreakable bond of the Five takes control in a way none of them expected? &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;The Four Horsemen: Legacy is the first novella in an exciting new paranormal REVERSE HAREM series f&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;rom USA Today bestselling author, LJ Swallow. &lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/i&gt;

  <description>*Paranormal Romance*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Draven Delano fled his coven, he vowed he’d never take an innocent human’s life again. To survive on his own, he became a doctor, allowing himself easy access to blood bags and a means of survival without harming a soul. But an immortal can never stay in one place for too long. And he can never fall in love. When he moves to the sleepy town of Burn Falls, he thinks he’s found the perfect place to temporarily settle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until he meets the one woman who could change everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calla O’Bannion believed monsters lived only in fairy tales. The night her father was attacked and left to die, Calla knew that monsters were real. When the inevitable happens, Calla makes the decision to move home to Burn Falls and take over the family’s distillery. As fate would have it, she begins a relationship with the only one who can protect her from the thing she fears the most. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she finds out what Draven’s been hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evil has chased Draven for eighty-six years. Soon, he’ll be forced to face those demons and break his vow—a decision that could save both him and Calla. Or it could kill them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forever.</description>

  <description>When Emma moves to Astoria, Oregon, she is given two rules:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1&lt;/strong&gt; – Don’t cross to “their” side of the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2&lt;/strong&gt; – Don’t mess with the elites, especially Lexen Darken, top elite and resident bad boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While she finds this both weird and insulting, Emma has no actual intention of breaking these rules - until her guardians go missing. Now all bets are off. Only a single line separates her side of the street from the elites', and she's crossing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captured and held by Lexen and his brothers, she learns the rules are in place for a very good reason. There's a secret world hidden in this small town which goes far beyond the one she knows and understands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A world not for humans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** This is a full length (105,000 words) fantasy/paranormal romance story. It's Upper YA, with cursing and some non-detailed sex scenes/references.</description>

  <description>“When you’re with me, you’re not vulnerable. When you’re with me, you are safe. When you’re with me, you will never be alone. And as for your heart, Sera Lafferty…I’ll make it beat so fast you’ll never feel it ache.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sera Lafferty isn’t insane. &lt;br /&gt;She’s always made the smart decisions. &lt;br /&gt;She has a career. A loving sister. The carefully mapped out, peaceful life in Seattle that she’s craved since childhood. So why, then, does she suddenly find herself on a scavenger hunt, traveling across the country with a stranger? And not just any stranger. A maddeningly sexy hitman, who’s been paid to end her life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His past is shrouded in secrets, and his eyes are filled with ghosts. Sera knows she should head back to Seattle, to sever all ties with her handsome man in black. But leaving him might not just hurt Sera in the end. It might end up getting her killed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fix Marcosa damn well knows better. &lt;br /&gt;He’s been focused on his goals ever since the fateful day he swore to avenge his friend’s brutal attack. Booze. Drugs. Violence. Sex. Nothing has distracted him from his mission. But Sera is more potent than alcohol, more addicting than any opiate. She makes the fury in his blood sing. And her body? Her body is utter perfection, and he just can’t keep his hands off it. Or his mouth for that matter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fix is determined. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Screw the money. Screw the consequences, and screw anybody stupid enough to stand in his way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He isn’t going to end Sera Lafferty’s life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s damn well going to save it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Some call him a rock god. &lt;br /&gt;Others a celebrity bad boy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me? I call him the arrogant bastard who stole my concert venue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His apology? To take me and my violin on tour with the band. &lt;br /&gt;It's an offer I can't refuse, even if it does come with strings attached. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Because Rey Thomas isn't who he seems. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life isn't pretty behind the deviant frontman's facade. &lt;br /&gt;It's raw, ugly, and at times downright painful. &lt;br /&gt;But it's real. &lt;br /&gt;And far better than the lie he presents to the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The man behind the face of Dark Tide is beautiful in his chaos. &lt;br /&gt;All I have to do is keep him alive long enough to see that too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DOWN BEAT deals firmly with the subject of mental illness and its associated effects on not only the sufferer, but those around them. If this is something you feel may be a potential trigger for you, I advise you stop, consider if this book is right for you, and if you decide yes, ensure you have a support person available. &lt;br /&gt;Rey's story is an immensely personal one for me and I would love for you to experience it, but not at the cost of your own health and wellbeing.</description>

  <description>Everything I do has purpose. Everything I do has reason. Until her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Vasiliev name is a powerful one. &lt;br /&gt;We rule with an iron fist and we do it well. &lt;br /&gt;Being the eldest, I am Father’s best hope at keeping us at the top of the food chain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everything I do has purpose. &lt;br /&gt;Everything I do has reason. &lt;br /&gt;Until her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I play my games thinking several moves ahead. &lt;br /&gt;Power. Power. Power. &lt;br /&gt;Until her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The next move requires I marry and soon. &lt;br /&gt;This will strengthen us and secure our position. &lt;br /&gt;But I am not to marry her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am to wed the eldest Volkov. &lt;br /&gt;Problem is, her younger sister is the one who awakens my dead heart. &lt;br /&gt;It is her I want in my bed and by my side forever. &lt;br /&gt;Her. Her. Her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this game, though, it’s not about what I want. &lt;br /&gt;But maybe it can be about what she wants. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am Vlad. &lt;br /&gt;Vile. Vicious. Villainous. Vasiliev. &lt;br /&gt;And I will win eventually.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Vanessa Mazur knows she's doing the right thing. She shouldn't feel bad for quitting. Being an assistant/housekeeper/fairy godmother to the top defensive end in the National Football Organization was always supposed to be temporary. She has plans and none of them include washing extra-large underwear longer than necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Aiden Graves shows up at her door wanting her to come back, she's beyond shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two years, the man known as The Wall of Winnipeg couldn't find it in him to tell her good morning or congratulate her on her birthday. Now? He's asking for the unthinkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you say to the man who is used to getting everything he wants?</description>

  <description>When everything is on the line, how far will you go to protect those you love? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What if the cost of saving them is your soul? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Would you pay it? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I thought I was prepared for what was coming; that if I made sacrifices, I could win this game. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I’m no longer afraid of the darkness or the monsters that hide in the shadows. I’ve become what I feared most, allowing it in to protect those I loved. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it takes a monster to win. Sometimes to fight monsters, you have to become one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only fear is…can I come back from it? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: 18 and older &lt;br /&gt;About the hero: chances are you may not fall instantly in love with him, that’s because I don’t write men you instantly love; you grow to love them. I don’t believe in instant-love. I write flawed, raw, caveman-like assholes that eventually let you see their redeeming qualities. They are aggressive, assholes, one step above a caveman when we meet them. You may not even like him by the time you finish this book, but I promise you will love him by the end of this series. &lt;br /&gt;About the heroine: There is a chance, that you might think she’s a bit naïve, or weak, but then again who starts out as a badass? Badasses are a product of growth and I am going to put her through hell, and you get to watch her come up swinging every time I knock her on her ass. That’s just how I do things. How she reacts to the set of circumstances she is put through, may not be how you as the reader, or I as the author would react to that same situation. Everyone reacts differently to circumstances and how Magdalena responds to her challenges, is how I see her as a character and as a person. &lt;br /&gt;I don’t write love stories: I write fast paced, knock you on your ass, make you sit on the edge of your seat wondering what happens next books. If you’re looking for cookie cutter romance, this isn’t for you. If you can’t handle the ride, un-buckle your seatbelt and get out of the roller-coaster car now. If not, you’ve been warned. If nothing outlined above bothers you, carry on and enjoy the ride!</description>

  <description>EVEN THE BROKEN, THROUGH LOVE, CAN FIND GRACE...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secrets never stay hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The burden of guilt never lifts from the heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born and raised in The Order of David, Sister Phebe knows nothing but cult life. Head of the Sacred Sisters of New Zion, Phebe was groomed from childhood for one purpose: to seduce. Prized as a harlot, as a New Zion whore, Phebe is taken from the doomed cult by Meister, the notorious leader of the Aryan Brotherhood. Taken as his possession. Taken to be the woman who will obey his every sexual demand. Under his heavy hand, Phebe finds herself in a place much worse than she could ever have imagined... with absolutely no one to help. And no glimpse of hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xavier ‘AK’ Deyes is content with his life as Sergeant-At-Arms of the Hades Hangmen. Leader of the infamous ‘Psycho Trio’ and ex-special ops sniper, AK knows how to fight. Experienced in warfare and schooled in military operations, AK is vital to the Hangmen. When his Vice President needs help retrieving his missing sister-in-law, Phebe, from a Klan-funded trafficking ring, AK volunteers to go in. AK remembers the redhead from New Zion. Remembers everything about her from the single time they met—her red hair, blue eyes and freckled face. But when he finds her, heavily drugged and under Meister’s control, her sorry condition causes him to remember more than the beautiful woman he once tied to a tree. Saving Phebe forces hidden demons from his past to return. A past he can never move on from, no matter how hard he tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As AK fights to help Phebe, and in turn she strives to help him, they realize their secret sins will never leave them alone. Kindred broken souls, they realize the only way they can be rid of their ghosts is to face them together and try to find peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despair soon turns to hope, and damaged hearts soon start to heal. But when their deep, painful scars resurface, becoming too much to bear, the time comes when they must make a heavy choice: stay forever damned; or together, find grace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark Contemporary Romance. Contains explicit sexual situations, violence, disturbingly sensitive and taboo subjects, offensive language and very mature topics. Recommended for age 18 and over.</description>

  <description>In a world where there’s only one woman for every twelve men, a lottery is the chance for five lucky men to win the prize of a lifetime… her hand in marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nix never put his name in the marriage raffle for a reason. &lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t need a woman. &lt;br /&gt;There aren’t that many to go around anyway, not after a genetically engineered virus wiped out 90% of the female population. &lt;br /&gt;He has his job as head of the Security Squadron and it’s all he needs. He looks out for the township. He protects the few women who are left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when his name is called to be one of the five husbands to the woman rescued from the badlands, he doesn’t speak up to correct the error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Audrey’s like no one he’s ever met before. &lt;br /&gt;Fiesty. &lt;br /&gt;That’s the name for her. &lt;br /&gt;She might be just the woman to handle a rough, brutal man like him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharing her with four other men is a small price to pay. &lt;br /&gt;In fact, the closer they all grow, the more Nix realizes he might finally have again what he lost so long ago—a real family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Audrey’s life is endangered, will Nix be able to save the woman he’s just learned how to love?</description>

  <description>Face of an angel. &lt;br /&gt;Body of a god. &lt;br /&gt;And a mouth so dirty he could make the devil blush… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fix Marcosa’s time can be bought with money, but he isn’t selling sex. Murderers, rapists, criminals: if you’re on the wrong side of Fix’s moral code, you’re in trouble. The kind of trouble that winds up getting you killed. As a hitman for hire, Fix is no stranger to violence. He’s merciless. Relentless. A true savage, down to the roots of his very soul. You can beg. You can plead. You can pray, but it won’t do you any good. Once the tall, dark stranger arrives at your doorstep, it’s already too late to repent. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sera Lafferty’s no stranger to heartbreak. With an abusive father and a dependant sister, her life has been one of sacrifice and compromise. As soon as she sets eyes on Felix ‘Fix’ Marcosa, she recognizes the darkness in him and makes a vow: she will not get involved. But trapped inside a motel room with the sexiest man to ever walk the earth? Throw in some tequila and the storm to end all storms, and Sera finds herself worshipping at the altar of Marcosa. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She knows she made a mistake. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She knows she needs to run. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when she witnesses the assassin at work first hand, she knows it’s far too late. Thrown into the back of his sleek black ride, Sera finds herself trapped, and in more way than one. Fix is deadly. He’s demanding, he’s dirty, and he’s determined to claim her for his own.</description>

  <description>A stranger online. Dark hair and even darker eyes that knew my dirty desires before I did. &lt;br /&gt;A fantasy that should never be spoken. But he pulled the confession from me. &lt;br /&gt;And now he’s coming for me.&lt;br /&gt;Rough. Dirty. Dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;It’s supposed to be one night to get me off and make me forget.&lt;br /&gt;He’ll make me his and I’ll pretend I don’t want him to.&lt;br /&gt;I’ll run and he’ll chase. &lt;br /&gt;Because I asked him for this.&lt;br /&gt;I begged him for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight, in the darkness, he’s the hunter.&lt;br /&gt;And I’m the bait.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Scarlett-&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When going to war, there are three very simple rules one must abide by.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. Know thy enemy &lt;br /&gt;2. Be prepared to sacrifice. &lt;br /&gt;3. Always wear good shoes &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After all, revenge is a dish best served in stilettos. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve got an eye for it, and nothing’s going to stand in my way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not even Rory ‘The Saint’ Brodrick. &lt;br /&gt;He’s a fool if he thinks he can change me. By the time I’m through with him, I’ll make his mafia look like child’s play. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cross me, Mr. Brodrick? &lt;br /&gt;You better cross your heart and hope to die. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rory-&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’m a fighter. A hustler. A mobster.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve seen a few things in my day. &lt;br /&gt;But I’ve never encountered anything like her. &lt;br /&gt;She's a beauty with a beast of a heart. The poison apple I just can't resist. And in her trail she leaves a wake of men crawling on their knees. &lt;br /&gt;What she doesn’t know is that I like my women wild. &lt;br /&gt;It only makes it that much more fun to tame them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**This is a DARK mafia romance. A full-length standalone novel with HEA and no cheating.** &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Talia.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I have always been a bird.&lt;/b&gt; Caged by one prison or another when the only thing I ever wanted was to fly away. &lt;br /&gt;Sold.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sasha.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He’s dark and mysterious.&lt;/b&gt; Quiet and lethal. &lt;br /&gt;An Irish mobster. &lt;br /&gt;Pure sin wrapped up in a beautiful package. &lt;br /&gt;But there’s also something off about him. &lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t feel anything. He shows no emotions. &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I question his humanity. &lt;br /&gt;He hasn’t spoken to me in two years. Not a single word. &lt;br /&gt;But we share a secret, he and I. &lt;br /&gt;And if it ever comes out, I have no doubt in my mind… &lt;br /&gt;He won’t have a problem killing me too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ronan.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve slain for her. I’ll do it again. &lt;br /&gt;When it comes to Sasha, there isn’t a line I won’t cross. &lt;br /&gt;I watch her. She doesn’t know it. &lt;br /&gt;She thinks I hate her. Sometimes, I think I might too. &lt;br /&gt;But I’m always there, lurking in the shadows. &lt;br /&gt;Craving her. Trying to keep the beast within at bay. &lt;br /&gt;I’ll keep her safe. I’ll slaughter anyone who tries to hurt her. &lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can’t do… is protect her from myself. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“I thought I knew who I was, but I was wrong.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Silver Swan&lt;br /&gt;- 1. &lt;i&gt; A girl who is tarnished. Tainted. One who does not fit into the confinement of legend.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Silver Swan&lt;br /&gt;-2. &lt;b&gt;Madison Montgomery.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lied to.&lt;br /&gt;I was cheated.&lt;br /&gt;Resigned to pick up the scraps of empty memories and disarrayed thoughts, I left. After finally cutting the strings of manipulation, I resorted to do what I’ve done since I was a child, something my father drilled into my brain since I could handle my first rifle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Run.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a mere shadow of the girl they all knew.&lt;br /&gt;Lies and deceit change you. They alter your entire outlook on life.&lt;br /&gt;I’m Madison Montgomery, and I want to play a game.&lt;br /&gt;Here’s what happens when I &lt;i&gt;win&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Riddle me this, Mads.&lt;br /&gt;What goes bump in the night,&lt;br /&gt;but is something you can’t see with sight?&lt;br /&gt;You may run, and you may hide.&lt;br /&gt;If by happily ever after, you mean Bonnie &amp;amp; Clyde.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>For Tracey Rooks, life with her grandparents on a Wyoming farm has always been simple. But after her grandmother's death, Tracey is all her grandfather has. So when Eagle Elite University announces its annual scholarship lottery, Tracey jumps at the opportunity to secure their future and enters. She isn't expecting much-but then she wins. And life as she knows it will never be same . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The students at Eagle Elite are unlike any she's ever met . . . and they refuse to make things easy for her. There's Nixon, gorgeous, irresistible, and leader of a group that everyone fears: The Elect. Their rules are simple. 1. Do not touch The Elect. 2. Do not look at The Elect. 3. Do not speak to The Elect. No matter how hard she tries to stay away, The Elect are always around her and it isn't long until she finds out the reason why they keep their friends close and their enemies even closer. She just didn't realize she was the enemy -- until it was too late. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>From bestselling author L.J. Shen, comes a new, &lt;b&gt;standalone&lt;/b&gt;, contemporary romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should have been easy.&lt;br /&gt;I needed the money. He needed a babysitter to keep him from snorting himself to death.&lt;br /&gt;I was cherry-picked especially for him. Responsible. Optimistic. Warm. Innocent.&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that I should have known better.&lt;br /&gt;Alex Winslow. British rock star. Serial heartbreaker. Casanova with whiskey eyes.&lt;br /&gt;“Don’t get near the devil in a leather jacket. He’ll chew you up and spit you out.”&lt;br /&gt;Guess what? I didn’t listen.&lt;br /&gt;I signed the contract.&lt;br /&gt;World tour. Three months. Four Continents. One hundred shows.&lt;br /&gt;My name is Indigo Bellamy, and I sold my soul to a tattooed god.&lt;br /&gt;Problem was, my soul wasn’t enough for Alex Winslow. He ended up taking my body, too.&lt;br /&gt;Then he took my heart.&lt;br /&gt;Then he took my all.</description>

  <description>My name is Camille Richards. I'm a simple woman and I love my quiet life and work hard to keep it that way. I write romance stories, the kind where the man crashes into her life and completes her world while they fall madly in love with each other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damon Deverick is the epitome of complicated. What this man does to me is unlike anything I’ve ever dealt with and I think that’s my problem. I don’t know how to respond to him. He’s powerful even when he stands completely still, not saying a word… but when he touches me it’s as if everything before that very moment was minuscule in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knew I'd be this intrigued after a single day with him? It’s supposed to be easy... but there’s just one problem, to him this is work and I’m not sure I can separate business from pleasure because it seems to be one in the same when it involves him.</description>

  <description>Beware of what you wish for; it might just come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Train swore never to let a woman get under his skin unless it meant forever, and forever only meant belonging to The Last Riders. He had believed his one brief sexual encounter with Killyama was a hit it and quit it. Instead, her green eyes haunted his memories. Then when he tried to convince the woman he was serious as his “more the merrier” lifestyle became a painful reminder of the life he lived, Killyama used his own club against him to keep him from what he wanted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killyama was holding out for a man who could offer her forever, and Train wasn’t the forever kind of man. He was a Mr. Here and Now; the wicked warrior in her dreams. He might be a walking, talking sex machine, but she needed more than that. So, until he proved she was the only one sharing his bed, the only part of her body he was going to see was her ass walking away.</description>

  <description>Revenge is a seven-letter word that isn’t for the faint of heart. It’s a word for those who have been wronged. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jo Turner has been waiting five, long years to finally turn revenge into vengeance. Using Rider, the pretty-faced manwhore, is simply the price she is willing to pay to satiate her desire for revenge. Little does she know, she makes herself a target from the one thing Rider has sworn to give his life to protect—The Last Riders.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When you wake the soldier, be prepared for the consequences. &lt;br /&gt;Rider is going to teach her a hard lesson: revenge is a double-edged sword … and it always cuts both ways.</description>

  <description>Four simple rules when you’re a man on parole:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Don’t lust after your best friend’s daughter.&lt;br /&gt;2. Don’t get into a physical fight over her.&lt;br /&gt;3. Definitely don’t f*ck her.&lt;br /&gt;4. And whatever you do, don’t fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a bad habit of breaking rules.</description>

  <description>He’s wanted her since he repossessed her car and made her cry. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Baylor Hail knew two things. One, he hated crying females. Two, it was even worse when he was the one to make that female cry. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He never meant to do anything but his job, but when one thing leads to another, suddenly all he can think about is the broken woman whose car he towed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s wanted him since he patted her back and told her it was okay to cry even though she knew he was lying. &lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever goes right for Lark. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not when she got married. Not when she tried to leave her abusive husband, and not when she arrived in a new town with a fresh, clean slate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That clean slate came courtesy of a secret organization that specializes in helping abused women find a way out. They set her up with a whole new life. It just turns out that it happened to be right smack dab in the middle of another woman’s old one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That woman also happens to be down on her luck, something that Lark learns the hard way when on her first day there, her car is towed by a handsome stranger. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s been two years since she’s felt any kind of sexual attraction toward a man, and she reacts badly. We’re talking full-on, hysterical breakdown as he loads her car onto his tow truck while looking at her like she’s lost it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe being crazy isn’t all that bad. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The next thing she knows, she’s spending time with the sexy stranger and life couldn’t be better—even though she still doesn’t have a car. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She thinks she’s in the clear, that she’s got it all figured out… well, that is until her ex-husband finds her again. &lt;br /&gt;Now the ball is in her sexy stranger’s court as he decides whether or not her kind of crazy is worth getting killed over. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Turns out, for Baylor Hail, maybe it is. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Get out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He yelled those words at the love of his life twelve years ago, and to this day, Reed Hail regrets them. He’s always been the type of person to speak before he thinks, and apologies have never come easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been over a decade since she was his, and he stubbornly thinks that he can keep on living without her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He couldn’t be more wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing he needs is her vagina anywhere near his exam table. But nobody ever asks him what he wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe he should’ve gone into the auto-recovery business after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Krisney Shaw would take those words back in a heartbeat if she could. In fact, she would take back everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never meeting him would be the perfect place to start. The memory of Reed Hail haunts her—morning, noon, and night. Then, to add insult to injury, she has to see him being happy while she’s breaking a little more inside every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reed Hail is her worst nightmare because she’s constantly reminded of exactly what she’s missing—the other half of her soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when she thinks things can’t get worse, she sees his sexy, bearded face over the top of her paper gown, and she’s lost all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t ever let me go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Reed and Krisney are determined to avoid each other. They do a great job of it, too…not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One ill-timed gynecological exam changes everything. One single second in time shows Reed what he’s missing—literally and figuratively—and suddenly he’s back at square one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with being back at square one? He won’t be able to leave her a second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially since the first time around he didn’t have a child with her to consider.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Riddle me this...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I am neither dead, nor alive, and I’m not something little Madison can hide.&lt;br /&gt;But you will be dead, by the time this is done...&lt;br /&gt;the timer starts now, and the games have just begun…”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madison Montgomery comes from money and power, but when someone close to her commits the ultimate crime, Madison must live with her tainted name for the rest of her life. When she begins Riverside Preparatory Academy, the private school her father has swept her into in The Hamptons, she hopes for a fresh start. What she wasn't hoping for was the pack of bad boys who run the school; ten, to be exact. When Madison gains the attention of their leader, Bishop Vincent Hayes, a whole new world that she didn't think existed is exposed to her. A whole world that starts and ends with The Elite Kings Club and these boys, are about to flip her world upside down. Secrets are overflowing and family lies are about to be exposed. Is there more to Madison Montgomery than even she knows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About this book: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to admit something right now. The Silver Swan is &lt;i&gt;f*cked&lt;/i&gt;. It might be the most &lt;i&gt;insane&lt;/i&gt; story I've ever written with equally &lt;i&gt;insane&lt;/i&gt; characters. Who knew? You know, when I started this book, it was supposed to be YA. I wanted to write a book that my sisters could read. A book that won't have people look at my mum like &lt;i&gt;"damn... what sort of messed up shit happened to your kid?"&lt;/i&gt;. The angst, the assholeness, the games, the f**kery, the &lt;b&gt;WHAT THE F**KING F**K ARE YOU DOING???!!!...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I cannot even.... anyway, this is a &lt;b&gt;warning&lt;/b&gt; (and the only one I'll give you). It's crazy. I don't compare my work to my others, but this book is f**ked. It will most likely stomp all the f**k over people's hard limits (and not give a sh*t while it's doing it) and will make you second guess all the morals you thought you had.&lt;br /&gt;This most definitely is not looking like a love story right now... more like a..... I don't even....*shakes head* anyway, I apologise now. You asked for it..........</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I was light, and I was pure. Until I &lt;b&gt;wasn’t.&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Millie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m Millie Hart, and for as long as I can remember, I’ve dedicated my life to my Catholic faith. It was a part of me every step of the way. So when I decided to join a nunnery, no one in my family was surprised. I’m not sure at what point my life changed or where it went extremely wrong. My nightmares are becoming realities as my world starts to slowly tremble under the ground I’m presently shackled to. I was taken. Everything I thought I knew was about to rain down on me in drops of lies, deceit, and undiluted evil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tripp/Raze&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m more machine than man. I’m the alpha and the omega of The Army, and the leader of The 6 masked huntsmen. I live and bleed this life. The arms that raised me weren’t carrying love— they were carrying knives and AKs. I’m agent 000, the executioner, and the damn devil who walks in the flesh. No one can break through my hard shell— not even her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This is book Three in The Devil’s Own series but can be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>The event that shook one small town to its core was never solved. The domino effect of one person’s crime going unpunished is beyond measure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s no saint. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dover ‘Collector’ Ragnes rides with only five brothers at his back. Nomads with no place to call home, they never stay in one place too long. Together, they are the Devil’s Due MC, and their only purpose is to serve justice their way for unsolved crimes everywhere they go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s not afraid to call herself a sinner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Emerson Flint still remembers the loss of her elementary school best friend. She is all grown up, but the memories still haunt her of the missing girl. Surrounding herself with men at the tattoo shop, she never questions her safety. Her life is her art. Her canvas is the skin of others. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, danger is at her door. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Dover overcome the history he shares with Emerson in time? Will Emerson lead him to the retribution he has always sought? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Love, hate, anger, and passion collide as the time comes, and the devil demands his due. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Each book in the Devil's Due MC is a stand alone, full length novel. Contains adult content, language, and violence not suitable for readers under the age of 18. This is not an exact depiction of life in a motorcycle club, but rather a work of fiction meant to entertain. (Paperback page count is 324 in a 5x8 sizing)</description>

  <description>I’m a former SEAL and battle-hardened, trained to neutralize an enemy with ruthless precision. But this target is unlike no other I’ve encountered before. &lt;br /&gt;My job is clear cut. &lt;br /&gt;Isolate and hold my target for one week in a remote location. &lt;br /&gt;Easy. Until the moment I catch sight of her. &lt;br /&gt;Innocent. Untouched. Vulnerable. &lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Reed is the pawn in a dangerous game. &lt;br /&gt;And I hold her safety in my grasp. &lt;br /&gt;All it takes is one look at her fresh-faced beauty and generous curves and I am driven to make her mine. &lt;br /&gt;Using my brand of carnal interrogation, I break through her shyness, forcing Charlotte to share her most private thoughts and dreams. Nothing is off limits. I want to know every secret, every hope. &lt;br /&gt;The sweet and smart woman is left with no place to hide. &lt;br /&gt;So why do I feel like I’m the one whose defenses have been smashed? &lt;br /&gt;My ice-cool self-control melts under the primitive need to protect and win her—body and soul. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bad Boy SEAL is a quick and naughty page turner involving an obsessed alpha hero, one shy heroine, and enough insta-love and sizzling romantic suspense to melt your kindle. HEA and no cheating in this emotional tale. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Mount Trilogy continues with &lt;i&gt;Defiant Queen&lt;/i&gt;... &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m his entertainment. His toy. Payment on a debt. &lt;br /&gt;I tell myself I hate him, but every time he walks into the room, my body betrays me. How can I want him and fear him in the same moment? &lt;br /&gt;They told me he’d mess with my head. Make it go to war with my body. &lt;br /&gt;But I didn’t realize it would be complete anarchy. &lt;br /&gt;I should’ve known better. When Mount’s involved, there are no rules. &lt;br /&gt;I will not surrender. I will not show weakness. I’ll stand my ground and make it out of this bargain with my heart and soul intact. &lt;br /&gt;But he has other plans . . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Defiant Queen&lt;/i&gt; is the second book of the Mount Trilogy. Mount and Keira's story concludes in &lt;i&gt;Sinful Empire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.</description>

  <description>She stood in Purgatory and studied death. The blood and gore of it, the ferocity of its glee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An elite drinking club - Purgatory - where the sinful commit more sin. And where a young, undercover cop has met a grisly end: bludgeoned to death, his body scattered with thirty silver pieces. A message is being sent to a shocked police force. And homicide lieutenant Eve Dallas is furious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things are not as they seem. Helped by her billionaire husband's extensive hacking skills, Eve identifies a sickening web of corruption that has taken over the entire police department. Dangerous secrets are being hidden and time is running out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An old enemy and an old flame, a criminal driven mad by drugs and a killer acting on revenge - as the elements become twisted and confused in Eve's mind, she must rely on her instincts as never before.</description>

Consume her. Maybe even keep her. &lt;br /&gt;It’s time to collect what I’m owed. &lt;br /&gt;Keira Kilgore, you’re now the property of Lachlan Mount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Ruthless King is book 1 of the Mount Trilogy. Mount and Keira’s story is anticipated to be completed in Fall 2017 with Defiant Queen and Sinful Empire.*</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A gripping new fantasy series by USA today bestselling authors Jaymin Eve and Leia Stone.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arianna is a queen heir and at 20 years old she's now eligible for the crown of wolf shifters. Heirs are trained and groomed so that they're ready, should the queen perish during their time of eligibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, there's little chance of that happening. The Red Queen has stood for a century, and her power is beyond reckoning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so Arianna believes, right up until the final tolling of the bells. The queen has fallen. Four heirs will now fight it out for the crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let the summit begin.</description>

  <description>Brotherhood. Club. Family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They live and ride by their own rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the Raven Riders . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raven Riders Motorcycle Club President Dare Kenyon rides hard and values loyalty above all else. He’ll do anything to protect the brotherhood of bikers—the only family he’s got—as well as those who can’t defend themselves. So when mistrustful Haven Randall lands on the club’s doorstep scared that she’s being hunted, Dare takes her in, swears to keep her safe, and pushes to learn the secrets overshadowing her pretty smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven fled from years of abuse at the hands of her criminal father and is suspicious of any man’s promises, including those of the darkly sexy and overwhelmingly intense Ravens’ leader. But as the powerful attraction between them flares to life, Dare pushes her boundaries and tempts her to want things she never thought she could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The past never dies without a fight, but Dare Kenyon’s never backed down before . . .</description>

  <description>Everybody has problems. But Travis? Yeah, he has so many problems that he finds it hard to breathe sometimes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He spends five years catering to his ex-wife’s every want and need—all to make it possible to continue to see his child. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He isn’t supposed to fall in love with a woman, but he does. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He isn’t supposed to find someone that is willing to put up with his ex-wife’s crazy antics, but he has. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He isn’t supposed to be happy, but he is. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And all it takes is his ex-wife finding out about his new-found peace for things to change. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hannah saw him and knew he was the one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All it took was one look into that haunted man’s eyes, and she was lost, never to be found again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She thinks she has it all. His love, a new baby made with that love, and a house to raise their blended family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s wrong, and Travis’ ex-wife is out to prove it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Travis doesn’t deserve Hannah. All he’s done is hurt her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s done everything in her power to keep everyone happy, but the more she tries, the harder his ex-wife pushes. Until one day, there’s nothing left to push. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hannah leaves, and Allegra wins. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Travis isn’t willing to let her have her way any longer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He fights back, and only gets a bullet to the chest to show for it. &lt;br /&gt;</description>
