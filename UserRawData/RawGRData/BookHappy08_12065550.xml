  <description>Our narrator should be happy, shouldn't she? She's young, thin, pretty, a recent Columbia graduate, works an easy job at a hip art gallery, lives in an apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan paid for, like the rest of her needs, by her inheritance. But there is a dark and vacuous hole in her heart, and it isn't just the loss of her parents, or the way her Wall Street boyfriend treats her, or her sadomasochistic relationship with her best friend, Reva. It's the year 2000 in a city aglitter with wealth and possibility; what could be so terribly wrong?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Year of Rest and Relaxation&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful answer to that question. Through the story of a year spent under the influence of a truly mad combination of drugs designed to heal our heroine from her alienation from this world, Moshfegh shows us how reasonable, even necessary, alienation can be. Both tender and blackly funny, merciless and compassionate, it is a showcase for the gifts of one of our major writers working at the height of her powers.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The dreamers walk among us . . . and so do the dreamed. Those who dream cannot stop dreaming – they can only try to control it. Those who are dreamed cannot have their own lives – they will sleep forever if their dreamers die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there are those who are drawn to the dreamers. To use them. To trap them. To kill them before their dreams destroy us all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ronan Lynch is a dreamer. He can pull both curiosities and catastrophes out of his dreams and into his compromised reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jordan Hennessy is a thief. The closer she comes to the dream object she is after, the more inextricably she becomes tied to it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carmen Farooq-Lane is a hunter. Her brother was a dreamer . . . and a killer. She has seen what dreaming can do to a person. And she has seen the damage that dreamers can do. But that is nothing compared to the destruction that is about to be unleashed. . . .</description>

  <description>Rachel’s parents, Linda and Marcus, have their hobbies: reading Shakespeare, crocheting blankets, and killing people who trespass near their cabin in the North Georgia woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being adopted by killers with a taste for cannibalism shouldn’t be the highlight of Rachel’s life, but for her, it’s a chance to heal and find the love she’s desperately craved. No one has empathized with her more than Linda and Marcus. After losing her biological parents when she was a child and enduring neglect and abuse, Rachel has a family again, and her new parents will go to extreme measures to protect her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a stranger connected to one of Marcus and Linda’s victims comes into her life, Rachel must juggle secrets that may lead to her undoing, and meanwhile, she has to decide whether she should save this new person at the risk of abandoning the only family she has—or lose what humanity she has left.</description>

  <description>Is it a knock on the door, or a gust of wind? A trick of the light, or someone who’ll see what you’ve done?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Little Paranoias: Stories” features twenty tales of the little things that drive our deepest fears. It tells the stories of terror and sorrow, lust at the end of the world and death as an unwanted second chance. It dives into the darkest corners of the minds of men, women, and children. It wanders into the forest and touches every corner of the capital. Everyone has something to fear — but after all, it’s those little paranoias that drive our day-to-day.</description>

  <description>In this fast-paced new novel from Sara Shepard, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Pretty Little Liars, a tight-knit college town scrambles for answers when an e-mail hack reveals life-changing secrets and scandals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aldrich University is rocked to its core when a hacker dumps 40,000 people's e-mails—the entire faculty, staff, students, alums—onto an easily searchable database. Rumors and affairs immediately leak, but things turn explosive when Kit Manning's handsome husband, Dr. Greg Strasser, is found murdered. Kit's sister, Willa, returns for the funeral, setting foot in a hometown she fled fifteen years ago, after a night she wishes she could forget. As an investigative reporter, Willa knows something isn't right about the night Greg was killed, and she's determined to find the truth. What she doesn't expect is that everyone has something to hide. And with a killer on the loose, Willa and Kit must figure out who killed Greg before someone else is murdered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told from multiple points of view, Reputation is full of twists, turns, and shocking reveals. It's a story of intrigue, sabotage, and the secrets we keep—and how far we go to keep them hidden. Number one bestseller Sara Shepard is at the top of her game in this brand-new adult novel.</description>

  <description>When a woman conceals her sister’s death to claim their joint inheritance, her deception exposes a web of dangerous secrets in this addictive new thriller for fans of Megan Abbott, Gillian Flynn, and Paula Hawkins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Like most of the dead, I want to be remembered.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robin Voigt is dead. If Leslie had arrived at her sister’s cramped Las Vegas apartment just hours earlier, this would have been their first reunion in a decade. In the years since Robin ran away from home as a teenager, Leslie has stayed in New Mexico, taking care of their dying father even as she began building a family of her own. But when their father passed away, Leslie received a rude awakening: She and Robin would receive the inheritance he left them together—or not at all. Now her half of the money may be beyond her grasp. And unbeknownst to anyone, even her husband, Leslie needs it desperately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she meets a charismatic young woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Robin—and has every reason to leave her past behind—the two make a reckless bargain: Mary will impersonate Robin for a week in exchange for Robin’s half of the cash. But neither realizes how high the stakes will become when Mary takes a dead woman’s name. Even as Mary begins to suspect Leslie is hiding something, and Leslie realizes the stranger living in her house, babysitting her newborn son, and charming her husband has secrets of her own, Robin’s wild, troubled legacy threatens to eclipse them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An electric, twisted portrait of sisterhood and the ties that bind, The Better Liar is a stunning debut with a heart-stopping, twist-after-twist finale that will beg the question: How far would you go to get what’s yours?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advance praise for The Better Liar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I thought I’d just skim a page or two before putting The Better Liar on my ‘to-read’ shelf, but I couldn’t help becoming so drawn in that I had to keep going. Tanen Jones has written a compulsively page-turning story. She cleverly drip-feeds nuggets of information, each more surprising than the last, until the final shocking revelation.”—Claire Fuller, author of Bitter Orange and Swimming Lessons</description>

  <description>Perfect Mexican daughters do not go away to college. And they do not move out of their parents’ house after high school graduation. Perfect Mexican daughters never abandon their family.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Julia is not your perfect Mexican daughter. That was Olga’s role. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then a tragic accident on the busiest street in Chicago leaves Olga dead and Julia left behind to reassemble the shattered pieces of her family. And no one seems to acknowledge that Julia is broken, too. Instead, her mother seems to channel her grief into pointing out every possible way Julia has failed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it’s not long before Julia discovers that Olga might not have been as perfect as everyone thought. With the help of her best friend Lorena, and her first kiss, first love, first everything boyfriend Connor, Julia is determined to find out. Was Olga really what she seemed? Or was there more to her sister’s story? And either way, how can Julia even attempt to live up to a seemingly impossible ideal?</description>

  <description>When Joe and Danny take on the job of housesitting Snowden Manor, they fail to realize they won’t be in the house alone. Inside the walls swarms a specter made of equal parts ghost, succubus and witch, and she uses the manse as a prison for souls. Now that October’s supermoon is falling over the mountains, she is ready to rise and reclaim her flesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kayla has a crush on Joe, so when he asks her to come to a party at the manor she accepts his invitation. But no sooner do they get there than strange things start to unfold. People go missing, a mysterious dog appears, and then the boys begin to change . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wraiths warn Kayla to save her friends before they’re devoured by the seductive witch. But she must hurry. For as Halloween approaches, the manor becomes a vessel for the black magic of the mountains, and the shadows that rule the woods return home.</description>

  <description>There is a grocery store. The last grocery store in the world. It stands alone in the middle of a vast wasteland that was once our world. The open sign is still illuminated, brightening the black landscape. It can be seen from miles away, even through the poisonous red ash. Every night at the exact same time, the store comes alive. It becomes exactly as it was before the world ended. Its shelves are replenished with fresh food and water. Ghostly shoppers walk the aisles. The scent of freshly baked breads can be smelled from the rust-caked parking lot. For generations, a small community of survivors, hideously mutated from the toxic atmosphere, have survived by collecting goods from the store. But it is not an easy task. Decades ago, before the world was destroyed, there was a terrible thing that happened in this place. A group of armed men in brown paper masks descended on the shopping center, massacring everyone in sight. This horrible event reoccurs every night, in the exact same manner. And the only way the wastelanders can gather enough food for their survival is to traverse the killing spree, memorize the patterns, and escape the bloodbath before it's too late. &lt;br /&gt; From the godfather of bizarro fiction, Carlton Mellick III, comes an absurd horror story unlike anything you've read before.</description>

  <description>Harleen is a tough, outspoken, rebellious kid who lives in a ramshackle apartment above a karaoke cabaret owned by a drag queen named MAMA. Ever since Harleen's parents split, MAMA has been her only family. When the cabaret becomes the next victim in the wave of gentrification that's taking over the neighborhood, Harleen gets mad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Harleen decides to turn her anger into action, she is faced with two choices: join Ivy, who's campaigning to make the neighborhood a better place to live, or join The Joker, who plans to take down Gotham one corporation at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Harley Quinn: Breaking Glass&lt;/i&gt; is at once a tale of the classic Harley readers know and love, and a heartfelt story about the choices teenagers make and how they can define—or destroy—their lives. This is the first title in DC's new line of original graphic novels for middle grade and young adult readers.</description>

  <description>Juliet Milagros Palante is leaving the Bronx and headed to Portland, Oregon. She just came out to her family and isn’t sure if her mom will ever speak to her again. But Juliet has a plan, sort of, one that’s going to help her figure out this whole “Puerto Rican lesbian” thing. She’s interning with the author of her favorite book: Harlowe Brisbane, the ultimate authority on feminism, women’s bodies, and other gay-sounding stuff. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Juliet be able to figure out her life over the course of one magical summer? Is that even possible? Or is she running away from all the problems that seem too big to handle? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With more questions than answers, Juliet takes on Portland, Harlowe, and most importantly, herself. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Claire is only seven years old when her college-age sister, Alison, disappears on the last night of their family vacation at a resort on the Caribbean island of Saint X. Several days later, Alison’s body is found in a remote spot on a nearby cay, and two local men&lt;b&gt;–&lt;/b&gt;employees at the resort&lt;b&gt;–&lt;/b&gt;are arrested. But the evidence is slim, the timeline against it, and the men are soon released. The story turns into national tabloid news, a lurid mystery that will go unsolved. For Claire and her parents, there is only the return home to broken lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, Claire is living and working in New York City when a brief but fateful encounter brings her together with Clive Richardson, one of the men originally suspected of murdering her sister. It is a moment that sets Claire on an obsessive pursuit of the truth&lt;b&gt;–&lt;/b&gt;not only to find out what happened the night of Alison’s death but also to answer the elusive question: Who exactly was her sister? At seven, Claire had been barely old enough to know her: a beautiful, changeable, provocative girl of eighteen at a turbulent moment of identity formation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Claire doggedly shadows Clive, hoping to gain his trust, waiting for the slip that will reveal the truth, an unlikely attachment develops between them, two people whose lives were forever marked by the same tragedy.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"Everything is sixty-nine."&lt;/i&gt;It happened suddenly. Overnight. Inside Spring Lakes Assisted Living, seven residents - sixty-nine years of age - died mysterious deaths. Only... they aren't really dead. Their bodies remain still, their staring eyes void of life; yet their hearts continue to beat, their lungs fight for oxygen, and somewhere within their petrified bodies their souls cling to life. No one has a rational explanation for what's happening. Three investigators from the CDC are dispatched to the facility in hopes of finding answers, but what they discover is far beyond human comprehension. Something terrifying has come to town. An unseen entity that leeches off the living, the dead, and everything in between. &lt;i&gt;69&lt;/i&gt; is a brand new short novel of cosmic horror from Tim Meyer, author of &lt;i&gt;The Switch House&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kill Hill Carnage. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Dory wakes up in the padded room of a psychiatric hospital with no recollection of how she wound up there. She soon finds out she’s been Blued-Papered—involuntarily committed. When she is sent to the wrong counseling group, she discovers a whole new world of drug addicts she’d never known existed. When she learns that those grotesque scars they all have are from cutting into their own bodies, it makes her skin itch. Why do they do it?—They get high off bone dust. They carve down to the bone, then chisel and scrape until they get that free drug. When they realize Dory’s never been “dusted”, she becomes their target. After all, dust from a “Freshie” is the most intense high, and pain free—for the carver. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of that first meeting Dory is running scared, afraid of being “dusted”, though the psych. hospital staff doesn’t believe a word she says. She’s delusional—at least that’s what they tell her. They end up sending her to that same counseling group every day, though Dory knows that all those junkie cutters want is what’s inside of her, and they won’t give up until they get what they’re after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Girl Interrupted and “The Yellow Wallpaper”, The Bone Cutters is one woman’s dark and surreal experience with a madness that is not necessarily her own.</description>

  <description>Charlotte has everything in life that she ever could have hoped for: a doting, artistic husband, a small-but-thriving flower shop, and her sweet, smart five-year-old daughter, Daisy. Her relationship with her mother might be strained, but the distance between them helps. And her younger brother Rocco may have horrible taste in women, but when he introduces his new girlfriend to Charlotte and her family, they are cautiously optimistic that she could be The One. Daisy seems to love Ruth, and she can’t be any worse than the klepto Rocco brought home the last time. At least, that’s what Charlotte keeps telling herself. But as Rocco and Ruth’s relationship becomes more serious, Ruth’s apparent obsession with Daisy grows more obvious. Then Daisy is kidnapped, and Charlotte is convinced there’s only one person who could have taken her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruth has never had much, but now she’s finally on the verge of having everything she’s ever dreamed of. A stable job at a start-up company, a rakish, handsome boyfriend with whom she falls more in love with every day—and a chance at the happy family she’s always wanted, adorable niece included. The only obstacle standing in her way is her boyfriend’s sister Charlotte, whose attitude swerves between politely cold and outright hostile. Rebuffing Ruth’s every attempt to build a friendship with her and Daisy, Charlotte watches over her daughter with a desperate protectiveness that sends chills down Ruth’s spine. Ruth knows that Charlotte has a deeply-buried secret, the only question is: what? A surprise outing with Daisy could be the key to finding out, and Ruth knows she must take the chance while she has it—for everyone’s sake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the two women follow each other down a chilling rabbit hole, unearthing winding paths of deceit, lies, and trauma, a family and a future will be completely—and irrevocably—shattered.</description>

  <description>Lune's mother cannot stop crying after all the hospitals shut down. She cries and cries and finally she is exiled to the cenote, where her tears endlessly fill the giant sinkhole. She becomes a big tourist attraction. People come from miles to see Marcrina cry into the cenote--part prisoner, part carnival attraction, part saint, Marcrina's story is one of heartbreak, love, and endurance. This is the story of Lune, of Marcrina, of Lune's son Nico, and of a strange place called Cenote City, where the world of magic and the dead entwines with daily life in enchanting and unsettling ways. Monique Quintana's words will pull you under, down to the depths, where tears flow, hearts break, and dreams are reborn every day.</description>

  <description>Cathy Ulrich’s Ghosts of You is a collection of stories from her Murdered Ladies series about seeking the lost and finding the person behind the sensationalism. It examines and subverts the tropes of mystery and crime storytelling in which the narrative always begins with the body of yet another murdered woman. They are mothers and daughters, teachers and students, lovers and wives, actresses and extras. They have been taken, but their stories still remain. This is how they set the plot in motion.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Hailed as a “marvel of a book” and “brilliant and unflinching,” Alexis Schaitkin’s stunning debut &lt;i&gt;Saint X&lt;/i&gt; is a haunting portrait of grief, obsession, and the bond between two sisters never truly given the chance to know one another.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claire is only seven years old when her college-age sister, Alison, disappears on the last night of their family vacation at a resort on the Caribbean island of Saint X. Several days later, Alison’s body is found in a remote spot on a nearby cay, and two local men―employees at the resort―are arrested. But the evidence is slim, the timeline against it, and the men are soon released. The story turns into national tabloid news, a lurid mystery that will go unsolved. For Claire and her parents, there is only the return home to broken lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, Claire is living and working in New York City when a brief but fateful encounter brings her together with Clive Richardson, one of the men originally suspected of murdering her sister. It is a moment that sets Claire on an obsessive pursuit of the truth―not only to find out what happened the night of Alison’s death but also to answer the elusive question: Who exactly was her sister? At seven, Claire had been barely old enough to know her: a beautiful, changeable, provocative girl of eighteen at a turbulent moment of identity formation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Claire doggedly shadows Clive, hoping to gain his trust, waiting for the slip that will reveal the truth, an unlikely attachment develops between them, two people whose lives were forever marked by the same tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For readers of Emma Cline’s &lt;i&gt;The Girls&lt;/i&gt; and Lauren Groff’s &lt;i&gt;Fates and Furies&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Saint X&lt;/i&gt; is a flawlessly drawn and deeply moving story that culminates in an emotionally powerful ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Here is a marvel of a book, a kaleidoscopic examination of race and privilege, family and self, told with the propulsive, kinetic focus of a crime thriller. Brilliant and unflinching, &lt;i&gt;Saint X&lt;/i&gt; marks the debut of a stunningly gifted writer. I simply couldn’t stop reading." &lt;br /&gt;–CHANG-RAE LEE, author of &lt;i&gt;On Such A Full Sea&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Saint X is a 2020 mystery / drama release, and it's definitely one you'll want to keep an eye out for. This book is on the slower side, so I wouldn't really call it a thriller, but it's full of mysteries and drama. The writing is so pretty, and I was immediately hooked.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A supernatural thriller in the vein of A Head Full of Ghosts about two young girls, a scary story that becomes far too real, and the tragic--and terrifying--consequences that follow one of them into adulthood.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Red Lady, Red Lady, show us your face...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1991, Heather Cole and her friends were members of the Dead Girls Club. Obsessed with the macabre, the girls exchanged stories about serial killers and imaginary monsters, like the Red Lady, the spirit of a vengeful witch killed centuries before. Heather knew the stories were just that, until her best friend Becca began insisting the Red Lady was real--and she could prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That belief got Becca killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been nearly thirty years, but Heather has never told anyone what really happened that night--that Becca was right and the Red Lady was real. She's done her best to put that fateful summer, Becca, and the Red Lady, behind her. Until a familiar necklace arrives in the mail, a necklace Heather hasn't seen since the night Becca died. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night Heather killed her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, someone else knows what she did...and they're determined to make Heather pay.</description>

  <description>Margaret Willow has never met an eleven-year-old as dangerous as Natalie Glasgow. Natalie spends her days comatose, but at night she prowls her mother’s home, unnaturally strong and insatiably carnivorous. With doctors baffled, Natalie’s mother reaches out to Margaret, an expert in the supernatural. But even Margaret is mystified and terrified by Natalie’s condition. She’s dying, and before she dies, she might kill someone. Has a demon clawed its way inside an eleven-year-old girl? Or does the source of this nightmare lie with Natalie’s dead father?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tight, tense novella, &lt;i&gt;The Possession of Natalie Glasgow&lt;/i&gt; twists the exorcism tale at every turn down to its final grave confrontation.</description>

  <description>Lewis is a town of secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have long been rumors of something unnatural in the swamp, and more than one person has gone missing. Many blame the Royce family while others believe in a local monster, rising from the dark waters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a child, Caleb witnessed something inexplicable the night the Royce place mysteriously burned to the ground. As an adult, Caleb returns to take over his father's role as sheriff, and the long shadow of the Royce family returns to haunt him. Caleb struggles to solve an eerily familiar crime and finds himself face to face with another old mystery--the legend of Catfish John.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A gripping psychological thriller about iconic superstar, Kelly Trozzo, and her suspected killer, the author she commissioned to pen her shocking Hollywood memoir.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A Star is Born meets Gone Girl, in this dark and twisted love story with an unforgettable conclusion.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The headline read: “Hollywood Superstar Kelly Trozzo Found Dead.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With no suspect in custody, authorities turn their attention to best-selling author Kaleb Reed, whose obsessive relationship with the star has been followed by social media and tabloids alike. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In his online confession, Reed claims that his relationship with Trozzo began with a tweet, an unexpected endorsement from the pop star herself. Almost overnight, Reed’s novel garners national attention, and the reclusive writer is thrust into the spotlight. But according to Reed, the endorsement came with a price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the days that follow, Reed is invited to Trozzo’s Los Angeles mansion, where he is solicited to write her memoir. Lured by her physical appeal and charisma, Reed delves further and further into Trozzo’s fantasy world, ensnared by a twisted story of betrayal and vengeance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the night of Trozzo’s death, Reed finally discovers his true role in this story, as well as the pop star’s alternative ending to his famous novel—one that leads to his arrest. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Set in Hollywood, She Died Famous is an innovative thriller that exposes the dark side of fame and obsession in today’s digital landscape. The story’s shocking twists and unreliable narrator will have every reader asking: Who killed Kelly Trozzo? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In 1998, a sixteen-year-old girl is found dead on school property, dressed in white and posed on a swing, with no known cause of death. The novel opens with this image, as related to us by the narrator, Violet, looking back on the night it happened from the present day, before returning to relate the series of events leading up to the girl’s murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an accident involving her Dad and sister, Violet joins Elm Hollow Academy, a private girls school in a quiet coastal town, which has an unpleasant history as the site of famous 17th century witch trials. Violet quickly finds herself invited to become the fourth member of an advanced study group, alongside Robin, Grace, and Alex - led by their charismatic art teacher, Annabel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Annabel claims her classes aren’t related to ancient rites and rituals - warning the girls off the topic, describing it as little more than mythology - the girls start to believe that magic is real, and that they can harness it. But when the body of a former member of the society - Robin’s best friend, with whom Violet shares an uncanny resemblance - is found dead on campus nine months after she disappeared, Violet begins to wonder whether she can trust her friends, teachers, or even herself.</description>

The night the golden boys choose Elle as their next target. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They picked the wrong girl. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sworn to vengeance, Elle transfers to St. Andrew’s.

And she and her coven have the perfect way in: a boy named Mack, whose ambition could turn deadly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Foul is Fair&lt;/i&gt; is a bloody, thrilling revenge fantasy for the girls who have had enough. Golden boys beware: something wicked this way comes.</description>

  <description>John F.D. Taff's epic apocalypse of terror, &lt;i&gt;The Fearing&lt;/i&gt;, continues in &lt;i&gt;Book Two: Water &amp;amp; Wind&lt;/i&gt; when a group of battle-worn seniors pick up the pieces of their ravaged lives and grapple with survival after the end of the world. And for the first time, they begin to notice an ominous pattern in the deluge of fears now roaming the earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teenagers Kyle, Sarah and Carli sift through the devastation of their lost lives to find anything resembling hope for a future. But when Carli goes missing, the stakes get higher as the search for her takes a diabolical turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the enigmatic Adam retains his tight-fisted grip on his submissive minion Jelnik as a series of unspeakable horrors follow in their wake as the two men travel west toward their dark destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proudly presented by Grey Matter Press, the multiple Bram Stoker Award-nominated independent publisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grey Matter Press: Where Dark Thoughts Thrive.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In book three of the popular Jumbies series, Corinne must use her emerging supernatural powers to battle the angry god who would destroy her Caribbean island home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When an out-of-season hurricane sweeps through Corinne’s seaside village, Corinne knows it’s not a typical storm. At first Corinne believes Mama D’Leau—the powerful and cruel jumbie who rules the ocean—has caused the hurricane. Then a second, even more ferocious storm wrecks the island, sending villagers fleeing their houses for shelter in the mountains, and Corinne discovers the storms weren’t caused by a jumbie, but by the angry god Huracan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now Corinne, with the help of her friends and even some of her enemies, must race against time to find out what has angered Huracan and try to fix it before her island home is destroyed forever.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>Sometimes it is the one who loves you who hurts you the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up&lt;br /&gt; — she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.</description>

  <description>When &lt;em&gt;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&lt;/em&gt; first hit movie screens in 1974 it was both reviled and championed. To critics, it was either "a degrading, senseless misuse of film and time" or "an intelligent, absorbing and deeply disturbing horror film." However it was an immediate hit with audiences. Banned and celebrated, showcased at the Cannes film festival and included in the New York MoMA's collection, it has now come to be recognized widely as one of the greatest horror movies of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A six-foot-four poet fresh out of grad school with limited acting experience, Gunnar Hansen played the masked, chain-saw-wielding Leatherface. His terrifying portrayal and the inventive work of the cast and crew would give the film the authentic power of nightmare, even while the gritty, grueling, and often dangerous independent production would test everyone involved, and lay the foundations for myths surrounding the film that endure even today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Critically-acclaimed author Hansen here tells the real story of the making of the film, its release, and reception, offering unknown behind-the-scenes details, a harrowingly entertaining account of the adventures of low-budget filmmaking, illuminating insights on the film's enduring and influential place in the horror genre and our culture, and a thoughtful meditation on why we love to be scared in the first place.</description>

  <description>Hannah's a witch, but not the kind you're thinking of. She's the real deal, an Elemental with the power to control fire, earth, water, and air. But even though she lives in Salem, Massachusetts, her magic is a secret she has to keep to herself. If she's ever caught using it in front of a Reg (read: non-witch), she could lose it. For good. So, Hannah spends most of her time avoiding her ex-girlfriend (and fellow Elemental Witch) Veronica, hanging out with her best friend, and working at the Fly by Night Cauldron selling candles and crystals to tourists, goths, and local Wiccans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But dealing with her ex is the least of Hannah's concerns when a terrifying blood ritual interrupts the end-of-school-year bonfire. Evidence of dark magic begins to appear all over Salem, and Hannah's sure it's the work of a deadly Blood Witch. The issue is, her coven is less than convinced, forcing Hannah to team up with the last person she wants to see: Veronica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the pair attempt to smoke out the Blood Witch at a house party, Hannah meets Morgan, a cute new ballerina in town. But trying to date amid a supernatural crisis is easier said than done, and Hannah will have to test the limits of her power if she's going to save her coven and get the girl, especially when the attacks on Salem's witches become deadlier by the day.</description>

      <![CDATA[These Witches Don't Burn is such a fun read! This is a YA fantasy / horror / contemporary blend, and I really enjoyed it. This story had several elements that reminded me of things I like about Buffy the Vampire Slayer (except focused on witches). I like the characters, and it seems like there's...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The new tenants have a terrible secret. So do the landlord and his daughter…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since Lucy was two, she’s been on the run alongside her mother. She’s never understood the reason for a lifetime of paranoia, aliases, and lies. All she understands are the rules: never lock eyes with strangers, never let down your guard, and always be ready to move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after thirteen years and eleven states, their next hideaway seems perfect. An isolated, fortresslike place in the New Hampshire woods is the new home they share with its owner, a gentlemanly pianist, and his lonely daughter, Gretchen. She’s Lucy’s age and soon becomes Lucy’s first real friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Gretchen and her father have secrets of their own—and an obsession with puzzles that draws Lucy into a terrifying new game of hide-and-seek. Lucy’s dark past is about to come calling. And this time, for her and her mother in the house on the hill, it might be too late to run.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian Note: Alternate/new cover edition of ASIN: B00FIOHII0.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alayna Withers has only had one kind of relationship: the kind that makes her obsessive and stalker-crazy. Now that Hudson Pierce has let her into his heart, she’s determined to break down the remaining walls between them so they can build a foundation that’s based on more than just amazing sex. Except Hudson’s not the only one with secrets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With their pasts pulling them into a web of unfounded mistrust, Alayna turns to the one person who knows Hudson the best—Celia, the woman he almost married. Hoping for insight from someone who understands all sides of the story, Alayna forms a bond with Celia that goes too far—revealing things about Hudson that could end their love for good.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the first relationship where Alayna hasn’t spiraled out of control. And she might lose Hudson anyway…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian Note: Alternate/new cover edition for ISBN: 0991379632 (ISBN13: 978-0991379637).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fixed on You&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in a trilogy but ends without a cliffhanger. Due to mature material, it is recommended for ages 17+.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stalking and restraining orders are a thing of Alayna Wither's past. With her MBA newly in hand, she has her future figured out--move up at the nightclub she works at and stay away from any guy who might trigger her obsessive love disorder. A perfect plan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Alayna didn't figure on is Hudson Pierce, the new owner of the nightclub. He's smart, rich, and gorgeous--the kind of guy Alayna knows to stay away from if she wants to keep her past tendencies in check. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except, Hudson's fixed his sights on her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wants her in his bed and makes no secret of it. Avoiding him isn't an option after he offers a business proposition she can't turn down and she's drawn further into his universe, unable to resist his gravitational pull. When she learns Hudson has a dark history of his own, she realizes too late that she's fallen for the worst man she could possibly get involved with. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe their less than ideal pasts give them an opportunity to heal each other and finally find the love their lives have been missing.</description>

After a scuffle with a local bully puts Jake's arch-nemesis in the hospital, Sheriff Theresa McLelland starts poking her nose into their feud. During a trip to the family cabin for the opening weekend of deer-hunting season, Jake and Matthew kick their plan into action, leaving Dad tied to a chair as they flee into the night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, the bully and his father have their own plans for revenge, and the events to follow will forever change the lives of everyone involved...</description>

  <description>The town of Christchurch has everything: rustic houses, quaint people, and a carnivorous briar patch that consumes anyone who ventures too close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a meltdown at work, Oliver Crum needs an escape, and Christchurch seems to be the perfect destination, at first. His aunt provides free room and board in exchange for his help at the local bakery, and the picturesque town appears picked from the cover of a magazine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Oliver learns the ins and outs of the bakery business, no amount of kneading or mixing can prepare him for the mysterious murders that rock the sleepy village.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the townsfolk point fingers in his direction, Oliver must fight to clear his name by uncovering the murderous culprit and the secrets that live in the woods at the edge of town. And underneath the facade of the carefully manicured lawns and prim and proper people of Christchurch, Oliver discovers a dark history that goes back centuries—a supernatural legacy that’s back for blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oliver Crum and the Briarwood Witch is a quirky supernatural mystery with twists and turns that’ll leave readers flipping pages from beginning to nail-biting conclusion.</description>

  <description>Great art demands sacrifice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucien Beaumont is a teenage misfit and musical prodigy ostracized by his peers and haunted by familial tragedy. When he discovers an unfinished song written by his dead father—a song that holds terrible power—Lucien becomes obsessed. As he chases after the secret nature of his father's music, the line between gruesome fantasy and real life violence begins to blur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To complete his father's work Lucien believes that he and his group of outcast friends must appease a demonic force trapped within the music with increasingly sadistic offerings. As things spiral out of control he finds that the cost of his art will be the lives of everyone around him, and perhaps his very soul.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;LAST ONES LEFT ALIVE is the story of Orpen, a young woman who must walk on foot across a ravaged Ireland in the desperate hope of saving herself, and her guardian Maeve, from the zombie-like menace known as the skrake. Sarah Davis-Goff's strikingly original debut will appeal to readers of dystopian literary fiction such as STATION 11 or THE END WE START FROM.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Watch your six. Beware tall buildings. Always have your knives.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up on a tiny island off the coast of a post-apocalyptic Ireland, Orpen's life has revolved around physical training and necessity. After Mam died, it's the only way she and her guardian Maeve have survived the ravenous skrake (zombies) who roam the wilds of the ravaged countryside, looking for prey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Maeve is bitten and infected, Orpen knows what she should do - sink a knife into her eye socket, and quickly. Instead, she tries to save Maeve, and following rumours of a distant city on the mainland, guarded by fierce banshees, she sets off, pushing Maeve in a wheelbarrow and accompanied by their little dog, Danger. It is a journey on which Orpen will need to fight repeatedly for her life, drawing on all of her training and instincts. In the course of it, she will learn more about the Emergency that destroyed her homeland, and the mythical Phoenix City - and discover a starting truth about her own identity.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"She felt no remorse for drawing blood. In the context of their relationship, it had its place." &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Max and Laurel, nothing is off limits when they meet in room 553. Their illicit affair is exhilarating, passionate--and dangerous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driven as much by compulsion as pleasure, Max can't stop. His mistress is Jesus on the streets, and Satan in the sack. But when things take a sharp and sudden turn for the worse, he finds himself ensnared in a trap of his own making. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under heavy scrutiny by the police and the media, Max is hailed as a cold and evasive womanizer. He made mistakes, to be sure. But does that make him a killer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unnerving and addictive,&lt;i&gt; Room 553&lt;/i&gt; is a vivid and sensual psychological thriller that weaves a story of cruelty, reckless desire, and blind, bloody justice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A Manhattan socialite turns her spin instructor into a fitness superstar to impress her friends. But can she keep her little project under control? Or has she created a monster?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julia Summers seems to have it all: a Fifth Avenue apartment, a successful husband, and two adorable children attending the best private school in the city. She relishes wielding influence over her well-heeled girlfriends . . . but her star appears to be fading. That's why, when stranded in Manhattan for the summer as the entire Upper East Side flees to the Hamptons, Julia is on the hunt for the next big thing--the hot, new fad that will put her back on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Flame, the new elite fitness craze. Seductive and transformative, Flame is exactly what Julia needs--and demure, naïve instructor Tatum is her ticket in. Turning Tatum from giggly blonde to trendy guru proves hard work. Yet Julia's triumphant comeback at summer's end doesn't quite go as planned, and when things suddenly get ugly--and even deadly--she realizes she may have been in way over her head. And Tatum, waiting in the wings, begins to grasp just how much power her newfound stardom holds . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, with Julia's life already spiraling out of control, her husband is arrested for fraud and bribery. As her so-called friends turn their backs on her, and Tatum pursues her own agenda, Julia is forced to rethink everything she knew about her world to reclaim her perfect life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But does she even want it back?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A provocative and unputdownable psychological suspense about two women locked in a desperate fight over a child each believes is rightfully hers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Libby needs a break. Three years ago her husband split, leaving her to raise their infant son Ethan alone as she struggled to launch her writing career. Now for the first time in years, things are looking up. She's just sold her first novel, and she and Ethan are going on a much-needed vacation. Everything seems to be going their way, so why can't she stop looking over her shoulder or panicking every time Ethan wanders out of view? Is it because of what happened when Ethan was born? Except Libby's never told anyone the full story of what happened, and there's no way anyone could find her and Ethan at a faraway resort . . . right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But three days into their vacation, Libby's fears prove justified. In a moment of inattention, Ethan wanders into an elevator before Libby can reach him. When the elevator stops and the doors open, Ethan is gone. Hotel security scours the building and finds no trace of him, but when CCTV footage is found of an adult finding the child wandering alone and leading him away by the hand, the police are called in. The search intensifies, a lost child case turning into a possible abduction. Hours later, a child is seen with a woman stepping through an emergency exit. Libby and the police track the woman down and corner her, but she refuses to release Ethan. Asked who she is, the woman replies:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"I'm his mother."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is one of the most shocking, twist-y, and provocative works of psychological suspense ever written. A story of stolen identity, of surrogacy gone horribly wrong, and of two women whose insistence that each is the "real" mother puts them at deadly cross-purposes, &lt;i&gt;Lost You &lt;/i&gt;is sure to be one of 2019's most buzzed-about novels.</description>

  <description>Choking Back the Devil by Donna Lynch is an invocation, an ancient invitation that summons the darkness within and channels those lonely spirits looking for a host. It's a collection that lives in the realm of ghosts and family curses, witchcraft and urban legends, and if you're brave enough to peek behind the veil, the hauntings that permeate these pages will break seals and open doorways, cut throats and shatter mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, these poems are small drownings, all those subtle suffocations that live in that place between our ribs that swells with panic, incubates fear. Lynch shows her readers that sometimes our shadow selves--our secrets--are our sharpest weapons, the knives that rip through flesh, suture pacts with demons, cut deals with entities looking for more than a homecoming, something better, more intimate than family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's about the masks we wear and the reflections we choose not to look at, and what's most terrifying about the spells is these incantations show that we are the possessed, that we are our greatest monster, and if we look out of the corner of our eyes, sometimes--if we've damned ourselves enough--we can catch a glimpse of our own burnings, what monstrosities and mockeries we're to become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So cross yourselves and say your prayers. Because in this world, you are the witch and the hunter, the girl and the wolf.</description>

  <description>Welcome to historic Lea Bay, home of maritime lore and the region’s most popular pirate festival. It was also the landing site of the infamous Lords of the Deep, ruthless pirates who once pillaged the area and said to have hidden a chest full of cursed treasure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But this year’s pirate festival will be different. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This year, the Lords of the Deep are coming home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Recovering from the death of her husband, Daphne Jordan is thrust into a series of bizarre events leading up to the big celebration. Lea Bay locals have been reporting strange incidents. Green mist. Seismic activity. Sinister sightings in the harbor, things with scales and long, sharp teeth. Monsters. Joined by her brother-in-law and a local police officer, Daphne must solve the mystery before whatever is swimming beneath the shore surfaces for all eternity. Before the Lords of the Deep resurrect their long-dormant leader upon the Bay—and the world.</description>

  <description>Galaxy “Alex” Stern is the most unlikely member of Yale’s freshman class. Raised in the Los Angeles hinterlands by a hippie mom, Alex dropped out of school early and into a world of shady drug dealer boyfriends, dead-end jobs, and much, much worse. By age twenty, in fact, she is the sole survivor of a horrific, unsolved multiple homicide. Some might say she’s thrown her life away. But at her hospital bed, Alex is offered a second chance: to attend one of the world’s most elite universities on a full ride. What’s the catch, and why her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still searching for answers to this herself, Alex arrives in New Haven tasked by her mysterious benefactors with monitoring the activities of Yale’s secret societies. These eight windowless “tombs” are well-known to be haunts of the future rich and powerful, from high-ranking politicos to Wall Street and Hollywood’s biggest players. But their occult activities are revealed to be more sinister and more extraordinary than any paranoid imagination might conceive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The mesmerizing adult debut from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Leigh Bardugo.&lt;/i&gt;

      <![CDATA["Mors irrumat omnia. Death fucks us all."<br /><br />Ninth House is Leigh Bardugo's adult debut. I love her YA books, and I was so excited to check this one out. She killed it, and this is definitely one that you need to add to your TBR if you haven't already. <br /><br />Ninth House gets off to a slow start...]]>

  <description>A tender and terrifying literary horror novel - the author's debut - that tells the story of a family (creators of a haunted house attraction called the Wandering Dark) and the hereditary monsters - both metaphorical and all-too-real - that haunt them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monsters both figurative and &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; literal stalk the Turner family. The youngest child, Noah, narrates the family history: how in the late '60s, his bookish mother Margaret marries Lovecraft-lover Harry against her better judgment. The couple has two daughters - Sydney, born for the spotlight, and the brilliant but awkward Eunice, a natural writer and storyteller. But finances are tight, Margaret and Eunice are haunted by horrific dreams, and Harry starts acting strangely. He becomes obsessed with the construction of an elaborately crafted haunted house attraction, christened the Wandering Dark. The family tries to shield baby Noah from the house's faux horrors, but unbeknownst to them, he's being visited by a furry beast with glowing orange eyes - the same ghastly being glimpsed by both his mother and sister. However, unlike them, Noah decides to let the creature in...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he approaches the conclusion of his family's tale, it becomes more and more apparent that there's only one way the story can end: with Noah making the ultimate sacrifice.</description>

  <description>These Royals will ruin you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easton Royal has it all: looks, money, intelligence. His goal in life is to have as much fun as possible. He never thinks about the consequences because he doesn’t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Hartley Wright appears, shaking up his easy life. She’s the one girl who’s said no, despite being attracted to him. Easton can’t figure her out and that makes her all the more irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hartley doesn’t want him. She says he needs to grow up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rivals. Rules. Regrets. For the first time in Easton’s life, wearing a Royal crown isn’t enough. He’s about to learn that the higher you start, the harder you fall.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;These Royals will ruin you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since Hartley Wright met Easton Royal, her life hasn’t been the same. There are enemies behind every corner and dangers beyond each door. When tragedy strikes and steals her memories, she can’t trust anyone, not even the blue-eyed boy who promises her that everything will be all right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because while Hartley’s memory is full of gaps, her instincts tell her Easton is dangerous. She doesn’t know if he’s the snake in the garden or her chance at salvation. The chaos he brings wherever he goes is too much to handle, the intense feelings he evokes are too confusing to unravel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easton wants her to remember. Hartley thinks it’s better to forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tragedy. Treachery. Trust.&lt;/b&gt; Hartley has to face the facts—in this world, you can’t escape the Royals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Either you live by their rules or you die by them.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>These Royals will ruin you…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From mortal enemies to unexpected allies, two teenagers try to protect everything that matters most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella Harper has met every challenge that life has thrown her way. She’s tough, resilient, and willing to do whatever it takes to defend the people she loves, but the challenge of a long-lost father and a boyfriend whose life is on the line might be too much for even Ella to overcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reed Royal has a quick temper and even faster fists. But his tendency to meet every obstacle with violence has finally caught up with him. If he wants to save himself and the girl he loves, he’ll need to rise above his tortured past and tarnished reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one believes Ella can survive the Royals. Everyone is sure Reed will destroy them all.&lt;br /&gt;They may be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With everything and everyone conspiring to keep them apart, Ella and Reed must find a way to beat the law, save their families, and unravel all the secrets in their Twisted Palace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Are you trying to kill us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, but we love Ella so much and her adventures with the Royals that we needed to write this third book. You’ll see when you read it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Who’s in this book? And don’t say Ella!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella, the five Royal brothers, and a few more huge surprises.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;From wharf fights and school brawls to crumbling lives inside glittery mansions, one guy tries to save himself. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THESE ROYALS WILL RUIN YOU...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reed Royal has it all—looks, status, money. The girls at his elite prep school line up to date him, the guys want to be him, but Reed never gave a damn about anyone but his family until Ella Harper walked into his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What started off as burning resentment and the need to make his father’s new ward suffer turned into something else entirely—keep Ella close. Keep Ella safe. But when one foolish mistake drives her out of Reed’s arms and brings chaos to the Royal household, Reed’s entire world begins to fall apart around him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella doesn’t want him anymore. She says they’ll only destroy each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHE MIGHT BE RIGHT. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Secrets. Betrayal. Enemies. It’s like nothing Reed has ever dealt with before, and if he’s going to win back his princess, he’ll need to prove himself Royally worthy. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A smart, juicy, compulsively readable novel of parental ambition, social pressure, and privilege. Perfect for fans of Celeste Ng, Tom Perrotta, Nick Hornby, and Liane Moriarty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good schools, stately houses, safe neighborhoods, all set against a beautiful landscape. What else could a family want? It was with high hopes for the future that four young couples separately chose this Colorado town as the place to raise their children over a decade ago. Finding each other as friends further buoyed them over the ensuing years, as they juggled the stresses of parenthood, careers, and marriage. Even now, as the kids head for middle school, their individual interests and abilities becoming more and more distinct, the group of families has remained tight. But when an exclusive new school is introduced into the mix - an elite new standard to meet - it represents, at long last, one pressure too many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gradually, throughout the community, cracks begin to form, and spread. As children are pitted against each other for coveted spots in the school, some parents shock themselves with the lengths they are secretly willing to go in the pursuit of prestige and recognition. Soon, long-buried resentments arise between friends and spouses alike, as ever more toxic instincts keep emerging. And the most shattering secret of all still lies waiting to be exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gifted School is a knowing, wickedly entertaining novel that at once provokes, skewers, and forgives, loves and understands its keenly observed characters. A riveting tale of parenting and privilege, custom-made for our culture.</description>

  <description>Twelve six-year-olds and their three adult chaperones head into the woods on a camping trip. None of them make it out alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Laws of the Skies&lt;/i&gt; follows the terrified children as they scatter into the night to escape danger, dressed only in their pajamas. They face their darkest childhood fears and new imaginary threats, like trolls masquerading as boulders and child-eating tree trunks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A harrowing story of those days in the woods, of illness, poisoning, and accidents; of a love triangle among tots; a pint-sized hero; and a child on a murderous rampage that comes to a grisly end. Part fairy tale, part horror story, this macabre fable takes us through the minds of all the members of this doomed part, murderers and murdered alike.</description>

  <description>A group of desperate student filmmakers break into Crawford Manor for an unauthorised night shoot. They have no choice. Their lead actress has quit. They’re out of time. They’re out of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Crawford Manor has a past that won’t stay dead, and the crew are about to come face-to-face with the hideous secret that stalks the halls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will anyone survive…the NIGHT SHOOT?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A delirious homage to the slasher movies of the 1980s, Night Shoot delivers page after page of white-knuckle terror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Night Shoot is wildly entertaining. If you’re not laughing, you’re scared out of your mind. A final girl story people will be talking about for a long time.”&lt;br /&gt;Sadie Hartmann, Mother Horror</description>

  <description>Grief is a black house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How far would you go? What horrors would you endure if it meant you might see the son you thought you'd lost forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driven to a breakdown by the brutal murder of her young son, Lucy Campbell had locked herself away, fallen deep inside herself, become a ghost haunting room 23b of the William Tuke Psychiatric Hospital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There she'd remained, until the whispering pulled her back, until she found herself once more sitting in her car, calling to the son she had lost, staring into the black panes of the now abandoned house where Alex had died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight, someone is watching her back.</description>

  <description>Every year, on her birthday, Laura gets a letter from a stranger. That stranger claims to know the whereabouts of her missing friend Bobby, but there’s a catch: he’ll only tell her what he knows in exchange for something...personal.So begins Laura’s sordid relationship with her new penpal, built on a foundation of quid pro quo. Her quest for closure will push her to bizarre acts of humiliation and harm, yet no matter how hard she tries, she cannot escape her correspondent’s demands. The letters keep coming, and as time passes, they have a profound effect on Laura.From the author of Cruel Works of Nature comes a dark and twisted tale about obsession, guilt, and how far a person will go to put her ghosts to bed.</description>

  <description>What happened to Amanda Holmes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years ago, she washed up on shore in a rowboat with a gash to the head after an overnight at Camp Macaw. No one was ever charged with a crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the MacAllister children are all grown up. After their parents die suddenly, they return to Camp to read the will and decide what to do with the prime real estate it's sitting on. Ryan, the oldest, wants to sell. Margo, the family's center, hasn't made up her mind. Mary has her own horse farm to run, and believes in leaving well-enough alone. Kate and Liddie—the twins—have opposing views. And Sean Booth, the family groundskeeper, just hopes he still has a home when all is said and done. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then the will is read and they learn that it's much more complicated than a simple vote. Until they unravel the mystery of what happened to Amanda, they can't move forward. Any one of them could have done it, and all of them are hiding key pieces of the puzzle. Will they work together to solve the mystery, or will their suspicions and secrets finally tear the family apart?</description>

  <description>All those who enjoyed shuddering their way through Alvin Schwartz's first volume of Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark will find a satisfyingly spooky sequel in this new collection of the macabre, the funny, and the fantastic.Is it possible to die -- and not know it? What if a person is buried too soon? What happens to a thief foolish enough to rob a corpse, or to a murderer whose victim returns from the grave? Read about these terrifying predicaments as well as what happens when practical jokes produce gruesome consequences and initiations go awry.Stephen Gammell's splendidly creepy drawings perfectly capture the mood of more than two dozen scary stories -- and even a scary song -- all just right for reading alone or for telling aloud in the dark.If You Dare!</description>

  <description>Who was Molly Southbourne? What did she leave behind?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A burnt-out basement. A name stained in blood. Bodies that remember murder, one of them left alive. A set of rules that no longer apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly Southbourne is alive. If she wants to survive, she’ll need to run, hide, and be ready to fight. There are people who remember her, who know what she is and what she’s done. Some want her alive, some want her dead, and all hold a piece to the puzzles in her head. Can Molly escape them, or will she confront the bloody history that made her?</description>

  <description>At the outskirts of Maple City sits the Crossroads Motel, a throwback to the days when the motor lodge was king. Two years ago, the motel was the site of an act so brutal that its buildings were left to rot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessie Voss, however, sees promise in the Crossroad's bare bones and buys it up, determined to breathe new life into the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Larson family shows up on her doorstep, road-weary and desperate for a break, Jessie offers them lodging, even though her grand opening is still a week away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the arrival of guests awakens the motel, and Jessie soon finds herself host to both the living and the dead.</description>

  <description>Frank Cotton's insatiable appetite for the dark pleasures of pain led him to the puzzle of Lemarchand's box, and from there, to a death only a sick-minded soul could invent. But his brother's love-crazed wife, Julia, has discovered a way to bring Frank back — though the price will be bloody and terrible . . . and there will certainly be hell to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Once an exciting up-and-coming star of the burgeoning paranormal investigation TV genre, now Prudence Osgood finds herself as a barely functioning alcoholic living in daily pain, both physical, from a car accident nearly twenty years ago, and emotional, from the loss of Audrey Frost, her partner and best friend, over an ill-advised hoax. When a random and cryptic email shows up in her inbox, she must begin an investigation that is far more sinister than it initially seems, and far more connected to the last two decades of her own life than she could ever imagine.​&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Osgood As Gone cuts a trail from a lonely rest stop papered in missing posters, to a notebook full of symbols and sigils, to a band that could outsell The Beatles that vanished almost overnight. Can our intrepid hero Osgood follow the breadcrumbs, avoid texts from her one-night-stand Nora, make amends for the past, and still have a future? Find out in Osgood As Gone.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Wilson’s best book yet—a moving and uproarious novel about a woman who finds meaning in her life when she begins caring for two children with remarkable and disturbing abilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lillian and Madison were unlikely roommates and yet inseparable friends at their elite boarding school. But then Lillian had to leave the school unexpectedly in the wake of a scandal and they’ve barely spoken since. Until now, when Lillian gets a letter from Madison pleading for her help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madison’s twin stepkids are moving in with her family and she wants Lillian to be their caretaker. However, there’s a catch: the twins spontaneously combust when they get agitated, flames igniting from their skin in a startling but beautiful way. Lillian is convinced Madison is pulling her leg, but it’s the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking of her dead-end life at home, the life that has consistently disappointed her, Lillian figures she has nothing to lose. Over the course of one humid, demanding summer, Lillian and the twins learn to trust each other—and stay cool—while also staying out of the way of Madison’s buttoned-up politician husband. Surprised by her own ingenuity yet unused to the intense feelings of protectiveness she feels for them, Lillian ultimately begins to accept that she needs these strange children as much as they need her—urgently and fiercely. Couldn’t this be the start of the amazing life she’d always hoped for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With white-hot wit and a big, tender heart, Kevin Wilson has written his best book yet—a most unusual story of parental love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Insane innkeepers, cannibalistic cooks: the staff of the Brant Hotel would like to meet you!&lt;/b&gt;Massive nights, picturesque days: there is nothing Claire doesn't love about her summer job in Mission, Massachusetts. Claire is just trying to keep her head down and start a new life after burning out in the city, but those kids out in the woods seem like they throw awesome ragers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's only once she's in too deep that Claire discovers the real tourist trade that keeps the town afloat, it's then that her soul-searching in Mission becomes a fight for her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crazed parties, dark rituals, and unexpected betrayals abound in this modern folk horror novel from the author of &lt;i&gt;The Con Season&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Video Night&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The prologue of &lt;i&gt;The Summer Job&lt;/i&gt; is one the best and scariest openings to a horror novel I've ever read...The rest of the novel is equally great." -&lt;b&gt;LitReactor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Cesare's latest is a knockout...There's a potent retro vibe running through Cesare's work, in general--he's the closest thing literary horror has to its own Jim Mickle or Ti West." -&lt;b&gt;Complex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The textbook definition of a nail-biter. &lt;i&gt;The Summer Job&lt;/i&gt; is a kissing cousin to inbred classics from masters like Ketchum and Kilborn. Cesare's best novel yet." -&lt;b&gt;Bloody Disgusting&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>John F.D. Taff's highly-anticipated epic supernatural thriller, &lt;i&gt;The Fearing&lt;/i&gt;, begins with &lt;i&gt;Book One: Fire &amp;amp; Rain&lt;/i&gt; where humanity faces a series of catastrophes spawned by a worldwide event that unleashes all of mankind's greatest fears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the American high desert, vacationers returning from a road trip are thrust into a heart-stopping flight from death as they try to avoid a cataclysmic end. In rural Missouri, the lives of a group of high school students are destroyed after their small town is devastated and they're forced to confront the end of everything they've ever known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on the eastern seaboard, there's someone else. An enigmatic man who thrives on despair and embraces all fear. A man with his own dark and sinister goals. Someone who wants to ensure humanity goes out with the biggest bang possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proudly presented by Grey Matter Press, the multiple Bram Stoker Award-nominated independent publisher. Grey Matter Press: Where Dark Thoughts Thrive</description>

  <description>Jake Buchannan knows the woman sitting next to him on his business flight to Denver—he just can’t figure out how he knows her. Clara Stowe isn’t in Jake’s line of work and didn’t go to college with him. They have nearly nothing in common apart from a deep and shared certainty that they’ve met before. Despite their best efforts over a probing conversation, both struggle to figure out what circumstances could possibly have brought them together. Then, in a revelation that sends Jake reeling, Clara admits she’s traveling to the Colorado mountains to kill herself, and disappears into the crowded airport immediately after landing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dead Girl in 2A is the story of what happens to Jake and Clara after they get off that plane, and the manipulative figure who has brought them together decades after they first met.</description>

  <description>Tessa and Hardin have defied all the odds, but will their fairy tale ending be turned on its head? AFTER EVER HAPPY...Life will never be the same. #HESSA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s never been all rainbows and sunshine for Tessa and Hardin, but each new challenge they’ve faced has only made their passionate bond stronger and stronger. But when a revelation about the past shakes Hardin’s inpenetrable façade to the core—and then Tessa suffers a tragedy—will they stick together again, or be torn apart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the shocking truth about each of their families emerges, it’s clear the two lovers are not so different from each other. Tessa is no longer the sweet, simple, good girl she was when she met Hardin—any more than he is the cruel, moody boy she fell so hard for. Tessa understands all the troubling emotions brewing beneath Hardin’s exterior, and she knows she’s the only one who can calm him when he erupts. He needs her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the more layers of his past come to light, the darker he grows, and the harder he pushes Tessa—and everyone else in his life—away. Tessa’s not sure if she really can save him—not without sacrificing herself. She refuses to go down without a fight. But who is she fighting for—Hardin or herself?</description>

  <description>Book 3 of the After series—newly revised and expanded, Anna Todd's After fanfiction racked up 1 billion reads online and captivated readers across the globe. Experience the internet's most talked-about book for yourself from the writer Cosmopolitan called “the biggest literary phenomenon of her generation.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa and Hardin’s love was complicated before. Now it’s more confusing than ever. AFTER WE FELL...Life will never be the same. #HESSA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Tessa makes the biggest decision of her life, everything changes. Revelations about first her family, and then Hardin’s, throw everything they knew before in doubt and makes their hard-won future together more difficult to claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa’s life begins to come unglued. Nothing is what she thought it was. Not her friends. Not her family. The one person she should be able to rely on, Hardin, is furious when he discovers the massive secret she’s been keeping. And rather than being understanding, he turns to sabotage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa knows Hardin loves her and will do anything to protect her, but there’s a difference between loving someone and being able to have them in your life. This cycle of jealousy, unpredictable anger, and forgiveness is exhausting. She’s never felt so intensely for anyone, so exhilarated by someone’s kiss—but is the irrepressible heat between her and Hardin worth all the drama? Love used to be enough to hold them together. But if Tessa follows her heart now, will it be...the end?</description>

  <description>Tessa has everything to lose. Hardin has nothing to lose… except her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a tumultuous beginning to their relationship, Tessa and Hardin were on the path to making things work. Tessa knew Hardin could be cruel, but when a bombshell revelation is dropped about the origins of their relationship—and Hardin’s mysterious past—Tessa is beside herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hardin will always be… Hardin. But is he really the deep, thoughtful guy Tessa fell madly in love with despite his angry exterior—or has he been a stranger all along? She wishes she could walk away. It’s just not that easy. Not with the memory of passionate nights spent in his arms. His electric touch. His hungry kisses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, Tessa’s not sure she can endure one more broken promise. She put so much on hold for Hardin—school, friends, her mom, a relationship with a guy who really loved her, and now possibly even a promising new career. She needs to move forward with her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hardin knows he made a mistake, possibly the biggest one of his life. He’s not going down without a fight. But can he change? &lt;i&gt;Will&lt;/i&gt; he change for love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book Two of the After series—now newly revised and expanded, Anna Todd’s After fan-fiction racked up 1 billion reads online and captivated readers across the globe. Experience the Internet’s most talked-about book for yourself!</description>

  <description>Tessa is a good girl with a sweet, reliable boyfriend back home. She’s got direction, ambition, and a mother who’s intent on keeping her that way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she’s barely moved into her freshman dorm when she runs into Hardin. With his tousled brown hair, cocky British accent, tattoos, and lip ring, Hardin is cute and different from what she’s used to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he’s also rude—to the point of cruelty, even. For all his attitude, Tessa &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; hate Hardin. And she does—until she finds herself alone with him in his room. Something about his dark mood grabs her, and when they kiss it ignites within her a passion she’s never known before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’ll call her beautiful, then insist he isn't the one for her and disappear again and again. Despite the reckless way he treats her, Tessa is compelled to dig deeper and find the real Hardin beneath all his lies. He pushes her away again and again, yet every time she pushes back, he only pulls her in deeper. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa already has the perfect boyfriend. So why is she trying so hard to overcome her own hurt pride and Hardin’s prejudice about nice girls like her? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless…could this be &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now newly revised and expanded, Anna Todd’s After fanfiction racked up 1 billion reads online and captivated readers across the globe. Experience the Internet’s most talked-about book for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was the time before Tessa met Hardin, and then there’s everything &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;AFTER&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;... Life will never be the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She’s a friendly voice on the phone. But can you trust her?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who call End of the Line need hope. They need reassurance that life is worth living. But some are unlucky enough to get through to Laura. Laura doesn’t want them to hope. She wants them to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura hasn’t had it easy: she’s survived sickness and a difficult marriage only to find herself heading for forty, unsettled and angry. She doesn’t love talking to people worse off than she is. She &lt;i&gt;craves&lt;/i&gt; it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now someone’s on to her—Ryan, whose world falls apart when his pregnant wife ends her life, hand in hand with a stranger. Who was this man, and why did they choose to die together?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sinister truth is within Ryan’s grasp, but he has no idea of the desperate lengths Laura will go to…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the best thing about being a Good Samaritan is that you can get away with murder.</description>

  <description>It's been eighteen months since the Raxter School for Girls was put under quarantine. Since the Tox hit and pulled Hetty's life out from under her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started slow. First the teachers died one by one. Then it began to infect the students, turning their bodies strange and foreign. Now, cut off from the rest of the world and left to fend for themselves on their island home, the girls don't dare wander outside the school's fence, where the Tox has made the woods wild and dangerous. They wait for the cure they were promised as the Tox seeps into everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Byatt goes missing, Hetty will do anything to find her, even if it means breaking quarantine and braving the horrors that lie beyond the fence. And when she does, Hetty learns that there's more to their story, to their life at Raxter, than she could have ever thought true.</description>

  <description>THE AWARD-WINNING AND CRITICALLY-ACCLAIMED MASTER OF HORROR RETURNS WITH A PAIR OF CHILLING TALES - BOTH NEVER-BEFORE PUBLISHED IN PRINT OR AUDIO - THAT EXAMINE THE VIOLENCE AND DEPRAVITY OF THE HUMAN CONDITION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bringing together his acclaimed novella "The Sea Dream It Is the Sky" and an all-new short novel - "My Heart Struck Sorrow," John Hornor Jacobs turns his fertile imagination to the evil within the human soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A brilliant mix of the psychological and supernatural, blending the acute insight of Roberto Bolaño and the eerie imagination of H.P. Lovecraft, "The Sea Dreams It Is the Sky" examines life in a South American dictatorship. Centered on the journal of a poet-in-exile and his failed attempts at translating a maddening text, it is told by a young woman trying to come to grips with a country that nearly devoured itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In "My Heart Struck Sorrow," a librarian discovers a recording from the Deep South - which may be the musical stylings of the Devil himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breathtaking and haunting, "A Lush and Seething Hell" is a terrifying and exhilarating journey into darkness, an odyssey into the deepest reaches of ourselves that compels us to confront secrets best left hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;©2019 John Hornor Jacobs</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Four women learn their boss (a man who’s always been surrounded by rumors about how he treats women) is next in line to be CEO—what will happen when they decide enough is enough?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sloane, Ardie, Grace, and Rosalita are four women who have worked at Truviv, Inc., for years. The sudden death of Truviv's CEO means their boss, Ames, will likely take over the entire company. Ames is a complicated man, a man they’ve all known for a long time, a man who’s always been surrounded by...whispers. Whispers that have always been ignored by those in charge. But the world has changed, and the women are watching Ames’s latest promotion differently. This time, they’ve decided enough is enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sloane and her colleagues set in motion a catastrophic shift within every floor and department of the Truviv offices. All four women’s lives—as women, colleagues, mothers, wives, friends, even adversaries—will change dramatically as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"If only you had listened to us,” they tell us on page one, “none of this would have happened."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Inspired by a true story, this supernatural thriller for fans of horror and true crime follows a tale as it evolves every twenty years—with terrifying results.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella Louise has lived in the woods surrounding Pilot’s Creek, Virginia, for nearly a decade. Publicly, she and her daughter Jessica are shunned by their upper-crust family and the Pilot’s Creek residents. Privately, desperate townspeople visit her apothecary for a cure to what ails them—until Ella Louise is blamed for the death of a prominent customer. Accused of witchcraft, both mother and daughter are burned at the stake in the middle of the night. Ella Louise’s burial site is never found, but the little girl has the most famous grave in the South: a steel-reinforced coffin surrounded by a fence of interconnected white crosses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their story will take the shape of an urban legend as it’s told around a campfire by a man forever marked by his boyhood encounters with Jessica. Decades later, a boy at that campfire will cast Amber Pendleton as Jessica in a ’70s horror movie inspired by the Witch Girl of Pilot’s Creek. Amber’s experiences on that set and its meta-remake in the ’90s will ripple through pop culture, ruining her life and career after she becomes the target of a witch hunt. Amber’s best chance to break the cycle of horror comes when a true-crime investigator tracks her down to interview her for his popular podcast. But will this final act of storytelling redeem her—or will it bring the story full circle, ready to be told once again? And again. And again…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In the faux-documentary style of The Blair Witch Project comes the campfire story of a missing girl, a vengeful ghost, and the girl who is determined to find her sister--at all costs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a year, the path appears in the forest and Lucy Gallows beckons. Who is brave enough to find her--and who won't make it out of the woods?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been exactly one year since Sara's sister, Becca, disappeared, and high school life has far from settled back to normal. With her sister gone, Sara doesn't know whether her former friends no longer like her...or are scared of her, and the days of eating alone at lunch have started to blend together. When a mysterious text message invites Sara and her estranged friends to "play the game" and find local ghost legend Lucy Gallows, Sara is sure this is the only way to find Becca--before she's lost forever. And even though she's hardly spoken with them for a year, Sara finds herself deep in the darkness of the forest, her friends--and their cameras--following her down the path. Together, they will have to draw on all of their strengths to survive. The road is rarely forgiving, and no one will be the same on the other side.</description>

      <![CDATA[2.5⭐<br /><br />"He would cherish every succulent moment from henceforth, no matter the consequence." <br /><br />The Window is my second book by Glenn Rolfe, and it was a fun summer horror pick! It's part coming-of-age, and part demonic possession story. I am always creeped out by reflection-related horror,...]]>

  <description>Rebecca Daniels is a down-and-out private investigator on the hunt for her daughter’s killer. The trail leads to Bright Fork, a sleepy New Hampshire town where Rebecca discovers this is no ordinary manhunt. Her investigation becomes a tangle of brutal killings, secret rituals, and terrifying visions that force Rebecca to question reality. This is more than an opportunity to take revenge on the one who tore her family to pieces. It’s a chance to confront the darkness growing inside of her, the madness that threatens to possess her entirely.</description>

  <description>Samantha Heather Mackey couldn't be more of an outsider in her small, highly selective MFA program at New England's Warren University. A scholarship student who prefers the company of her dark imagination to that of most people, she is utterly repelled by the rest of her fiction writing cohort--a clique of unbearably twee rich girls who call each other "Bunny," and seem to move and speak as one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everything changes when Samantha receives an invitation to the Bunnies' fabled "Smut Salon," and finds herself inexplicably drawn to their front door--ditching her only friend, Ava, in the process. As Samantha plunges deeper and deeper into the Bunnies' sinister yet saccharine world, beginning to take part in the ritualistic off-campus "Workshop" where they conjure their monstrous creations, the edges of reality begin to blur. Soon, her friendships with Ava and the Bunnies will be brought into deadly collision. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spellbinding new novel from one of our most fearless chroniclers of the female experience, Bunny is a down-the-rabbit-hole tale of loneliness and belonging, friendship and desire, and the fantastic and terrible power of the imagination.</description>

  <description>Having won his emancipation after fighting on the side of the colonies during the American Revolution, Salem Hawley is a free man. Only a handful of years after the end of British rule, Hawley finds himself drawn into a new war unlike anything he has ever seen.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York City is on the cusp of a new revolution as the science of medicine advances, but procuring bodies for study is still illegal. Bands of resurrectionists are stealing corpses from New York cemeteries, and women of the night are disappearing from the streets, only to meet grisly ends elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a friend’s family is robbed from their graves, Hawley is compelled to fight back against the wave of exhumations plaguing the Black cemetery. Little does he know, the theft of bodies is key to far darker arts being performed by the resurrectionists. If successful, the work of these occultists could spell the end of the fledgling American Experiment… and the world itself.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Resurrectionists&lt;/i&gt;, the first book in the Salem Hawley series, is a novella of historical cosmic horror from the author of Broken Shells and Mass Hysteria. </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A new teacher at a New England prep school ignites a gender war--with deadly consequences--in a provocative novel from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Passenger&lt;/i&gt; and the Spellman Files series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What do you love? What do you hate? What do you want? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts with this simple writing prompt from Alex Witt, Stonebridge Academy's new creative writing teacher. When the students' answers raise disturbing questions of their own, Ms. Witt knows there's more going on the school than the faculty wants to see. She soon learns about The Ten--the students at the top of the school's social hierarchy--as well as their connection to something called The Darkroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Witt can't remain a passive observer. She finds the few girls who've started to question the school's "boys will be boys" attitude and incites a resistance that quickly becomes a movement. But just as it gains momentum, she also attracts the attention of an unknown enemy who knows a little too much about her--including what brought her to Stonebridge in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Gemma, a defiant senior, has been plotting her attack for years, waiting for the right moment. Shy loner Norman hates his role in the Darkroom, but can't find the courage to fight back until he makes an unlikely alliance. And then there's Finn Ford, an English teacher with a shady reputation who keeps one eye on his literary ambitions and one on Ms. Witt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the school's secrets begin to trickle out, a boys-versus-girls skirmish turns into an all-out war, with deeply personal--and potentially fatal--consequences for everyone involved. Lisa Lutz's blistering, timely tale shows us what can happen when silence wins out over decency for too long--and why the scariest threat of all might be the idea that sooner or later, girls will be girls.</description>

      <![CDATA[The Swallows was the first book I've read by Lisa Lutz, and I enjoyed it! I loved the boarding school setup. <br /><br />Although it was an entertaining read, this book was not perfect. There were way too many characters with their own POVs (and some felt unnecessary). I think this could have been a really g...]]>

  <description>A gripping tour de force of investigative journalism that takes us deep into the investigation behind one of the most frightening and enigmatic serial killers in modern American history, and into the ranks of a singular American police force: the Alaska PD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of us have never heard of Israel Keyes. But he is one of the most ambitious, meticulous serial killers of modern time. The FBI considered his behavior unprecedented. Described by a prosecutor as "a force of pure evil", he was a predator who struck all over the United States. He buried 'kill kits' - cash, weapons, and body-disposal tools - in remote locations across the country, and over the course of fourteen years, would fly to a city, rent a car, and drive thousands of miles in order to use his kits. He would break into a stranger's house, abduct his victims in broad daylight, and kill and dispose of them in mere hours. And then he would return home, resuming life as a quiet, reliable construction worker devoted to his only daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When journalist Maureen Callahan first heard about Israel Keyes in 2012, she was captivated by how a killer of this magnitude could go undetected by law enforcement for over a decade. And so began a project that consumed her for the next several years - uncovering the true story behind how the FBI ultimately caught Israel Keyes, and trying to understand what it means for a killer like Keyes to exist. A killer who left a path of monstrous, randomly committed crimes in his wake - many of which remain unsolved to this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;American Predator&lt;/i&gt; is the ambitious culmination of years of on-the-ground interviews with key figures in law enforcement, and in Keyes' life, and research uncovered from classified FBI files. Callahan takes us on a journey into the chilling, nightmarish mind of a relentless killer, and the limitations of traditional law enforcement, in one of America's most isolated environments - Alaska - when faced with a killer who defies all expectation and categorization.</description>

      <![CDATA[American Predator is by far one of the best true crime books I've read. It has a fascinating format - it starts with Israel Keyes' final victim and works backward.

  <description>The female voice is strong, and will not be controlled. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This book, by its very nature, is doing important work: giving women writers a platform and prioritizing their voices over the cacophony of men that have dominated the field for so long. This is not meant to start an argument over whose voice is more important or stronger or holds more weight—this book is only meant to continue the conversation of why we need &lt;br /&gt;diverse mindsets and points of view in the literary community. And as the global conversation continues to both &lt;br /&gt;widen and deepen in regards to diversity and inclusion in all aspects of our lives, I hope we can maintain that dialogue. &lt;br /&gt;This is a good place to start. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The pieces in this anthology deal with various themes: death, violence, love, rape, motherhood, childhood, family, &lt;br /&gt;failure, victory. They are all poignant, emotional, and important. They are all human. I am proud and grateful that &lt;br /&gt;these women have entrusted me with their words. I hope you read them and hear what they are saying—what they are &lt;br /&gt;screaming.</description>

  <description>In the upscale suburb where Vanessa Bolton lives, she's your average suburban housewife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She does her grocery shopping on Tuesday, Thursday mornings are reserved for Pilates, Sundays for church. At home, she's an impeccable housekeeper and a mother with a mediocre track record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in discreet hotel rooms throughout the city, she can be whatever you want her to be—provided you can afford the hourly fee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the rapidly expanding cult to which she belongs, Vanessa has been assigned the role of a "Siren"—a recruiter trained to use seduction to elicit compliance from her marks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vanessa's latest assignment—an unsuspecting chemist merely looking for something without strings—proves to be her toughest yet. Unwilling to neatly slide into the roles society has prescribed for them, the two collide in a sensual and savage affair that threatens not only their own lives but also those they seek to protect most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring "tantalizing suspense, pulse-pounding danger, sex, and double-dealing," Speak of the Devil is a timely and riveting psychological thriller that is impossible to put down.</description>

  <description>What does carrion taste like? Andi has to know. The vultures circling outside her home taunt and invite her to come understand the secrets hiding in their banquet of decay. Fascination morphs into an obsessive need to know what the vultures know. Andi turns to Dr. Fawning, but even the therapist cannot help her comprehend the secrets she’s buried beneath anger-induced blackouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her girlfriend, Luna, tries to help Andi battle her inner darkness and infatuation with the vultures. However, the desire to taste dead flesh, to stitch together wings of her own and become one with the flock sends Andi down a twisted, unforgivable path. Once she understands the secrets the vultures conceal, she must decide between abandoning the birds of prey or risk turning her loved ones into nothing more than meals to be devoured.</description>

      <![CDATA["The secrets I have locked down in the cellar of my gut have crawled away to expose their horrors into the light."<br /><br />I love Sara Tantlinger's poetry, and I'm happy to say that I love her novella writing as well! Her books are so grim and gorgeous, and you can't go wrong with any of them....]]>

  <description>For almost 20 years, Carlton Mellick III has been writing some of the strangest and most compelling novels the bizarro fiction genre has to offer. Described as one of the top 40 science-fiction writers under the age of 40 by &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; and "one of the most original novelists working today" by extreme horror legend Edward Lee, Mellick returns with a quiet, apocalyptic tale of young unrequited love in a dying world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the last school trip young Emily will ever get to go on. Not because it's the end of the school year, but because the world is coming to an end. Teachers, parents, and other students have been slowly dying off over the past several months, killed in mysterious traps that have been appearing across the countryside. Nobody knows where the traps come from or who put them there, but they seem to be designed to exterminate the entirety of the human race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily thought it was going to be an ordinary trip to the local amusement park, but what was supposed to be a normal afternoon of bumper cars and roller coasters has turned into a fight for survival after their teacher is horrifically killed in front of them, leaving the small children to fend for themselves in a life or death game of mouse and mouse trap. There appears to be a hope for salvation when eighth grader Clyde Donner, a boy Emily has had a crush on ever since she was a little girl, enters their lives and promises that all the children will be safe as long as they do exactly as he says. But when it appears that Clyde does not have everyone's best interests in mind, it's up to Emily to put her feelings aside in order to ensure the safety of those younger and more vulnerable than her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mouse Trap&lt;/em&gt; is an intense, suspense-filled thrill ride for fans of Mellick's more disturbing YA stories such as &lt;em&gt;Sweet Story&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Quicksand House&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Terrible Thing That Happens&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the acclaimed, Man Booker Prize-shortlisted author of &lt;i&gt;All That Man Is&lt;/i&gt;, a stunning, virtuosic novel about twelve people, mostly strangers, and the surprising ripple effect each one has on the life of the next as they cross paths while in transit around the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman strikes up a conversation with the man sitting next to her on a plane after some turbulence. He returns home to tragic news that has also impacted another stranger, a shaken pilot on his way to another continent who seeks comfort from a journalist he meets that night. Her life shifts subtly as well, before she heads to the airport on an assignment that will shift more lives in turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this wondrous, profoundly moving novel, Szalay's diverse protagonists circumnavigate the planet in twelve flights, from London to Madrid, from Dakar to Sao Paulo, to Toronto, to Delhi, to Doha, en route to see lovers or estranged siblings, aging parents, baby grandchildren, or nobody at all. Along the way, they experience the full range of human emotions from loneliness to love and, knowingly or otherwise, change each other in one brief, electrifying interaction after the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with magic and economy and beautifully exploring the delicate, crisscrossed nature of relationships today, &lt;i&gt;Turbulence&lt;/i&gt; is a dazzling portrait of the interconnectedness of the modern world.</description>

Each story has to do with a plane flight, and each new main character is someone who was in the previous story. <br /><br />It was a great setup, but since this book was novella-length, I felt like I didn't have enough time to get to know a...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An insightful and haunting new collection from Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Charles Simic &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irreverent and sly, observant and keenly imagined, &lt;em&gt;Come Closer and Listen&lt;/em&gt; is the latest work from one of our most beloved poets. With his trademark sense of humor, open-hearted empathy, and perceptive vision, Charles Simic roots his poetry in the ordinary world while still taking in the wide sweep of the human experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From poems pithy, wry, and cutting—“Time—that murderer/that no has caught yet”—to his layered reflections on everything from love to grief to the wonders of nature, from the story of St. Sebastian to that of a couple weeding side by side, Simic’s work continues to reveal to us an unmistakable voice in modern poetry. An innovator in form and a chronicler of both our interior lives and the people we are in the world, Simic remains one of our most important and lasting voices on the page.</description>

  <description>Myles Carver is dead. But his estate, Watermere, lives on, waiting for a new Carver to move in. Myles's wife, Annabel, is dead too, but she is also waiting, lying in her grave in the woods. For nearly half a century she was responsible for a nightmarish reign of terror, and she's not prepared to stop now. She is hungry to live again...and her unsuspecting nephew, Paul, will be the key. Julia Merrow has a secret almost as dark as Watermere's. But when she and Paul fall in love they think their problems might be over. How can they know what Fate--and Annabel--have in store for them? Who could imagine that what was once a moldering corpse in a forest grave is growing stronger every day, eager to take her rightful place amongst the horrors of Watermere? FLAME TREE PRESS is the new fiction imprint of Flame Tree Publishing. Launched in 2018 the list brings together brilliant new authors and the more established; the award winners, and exciting, original voices.</description>

  <description>In the early 80’s — at the height of the ultra-violent “Italian cannibal” grindhouse film craze — a small international cast and crew descend on an isolated Caribbean island, hoping to crassly exploit the native talent.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the angry, undead spirits of the island have a different, more original script in mind. And as horror after staggering horror unfolds, the camera keeps rolling. To the blood-spattered end...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“Something wicked this way comes.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maria Lyon and Lily Boiten are their school’s ultimate power couple—even if no one knows it but them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing stands between them and their perfect future: campus superstar Delilah Dufrey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Golden child Delilah is a legend at the exclusive Acheron Academy, and the presumptive winner of the distinguished Cawdor Kingsley Prize. She runs the school, and if she chose, she could blow up Maria and Lily’s whole world with a pointed look, or a carefully placed word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Delilah doesn’t know is that Lily and Maria are willing to do anything—absolutely anything—to make their dreams come true. And the first step is unseating Delilah for the Kingsley Prize. The full scholarship, awarded to Maria, will lock in her attendance at Stanford―and four more years in a shared dorm room with Lily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maria and Lily will stop at nothing to ensure their victory—including harnessing the dark power long rumored to be present on the former plantation that houses their school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when feuds turn to fatalities, and madness begins to blur the distinction between what’s real and what is imagined, the girls must decide where they draw the line.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Discover how to embrace your best basic self in this laugh-out-loud funny guidebook from the breakout star of Bravo’s hit reality show &lt;i&gt;Vanderpump Rules, &lt;/i&gt;perfect for fans of the relatable and entertaining books by The Betches and Andi Dorfman. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Millions of &lt;i&gt;Vanderpump Rules &lt;/i&gt;viewers and podcast listeners know Stassi Schroeder as a major defender of Basic Bitch rights. There’s nothing more boring than people who take themselves too seriously or think that you have to be pretentious to be cool. Stassi champions the things that many of us are afraid to love publicly for fear of being labeled basic: lattes, pugs, bubbly cocktails, millennial pink, #OOTD (outfit of the day, obvs), astrology, hot dogs, the perfect pair of Louboutins, romantic comedies...the list goes on and on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is for people tired of pretending they would rather see a Daniel Day-Lewis movie about sewing or read &lt;i&gt;War and Peace&lt;/i&gt; than watch a &lt;i&gt;Saw &lt;/i&gt;marathon or read...well, &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Next Level Basic, &lt;/i&gt;the reality star, podcast queen, and ranch dressing expert gives you hilarious and pointed lessons on how to have fun and celebrate yourself, with exclusive stories from her own life and on the set of &lt;i&gt;Vanderpump Rules&lt;/i&gt;. From her very public breakups to her most intimate details about her plastic surgery, Stassi shares her own personal experiences with her trademark honesty—all with the hope you can learn something from them.</description>

  <description>It’s a school completely off the grid, hidden by dense forest and surrounded by traps. There’s no electricity, no internet, and an eye-for-an-eye punishment system. Classes include everything from Knife-Throwing and Poisons to the Art of Deception and Historical Analysis. And all of the students are children of the world’s most elite strategists—training to become assassins, counselors, spies, and master impersonators. Into this world walks November Adley, who quickly discovers that friends are few in a school where personal revelations are discouraged and competition is everything. When another student is murdered, all eyes turn to November, who must figure out exactly how she fits into the school’s bizarre strategy games before she is found guilty of the crime…or becomes the killer’s next victim.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Without her alter-ego Erika Jayne, Erika Girardi says she’d just be “another rich bitch with a plane”—so get ready for the dishy, tell-all memoir from show-stopping performer, model, singer, and beloved star of &lt;i&gt;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&lt;/i&gt;, Erika Jayne.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erika Jayne didn’t make it this far by holding back. Now, in her first-ever memoir, the fan favorite star of Bravo’s &lt;i&gt;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills &lt;/i&gt;bares her heart, mind, and soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Pretty Mess&lt;/i&gt;, Erika spills on every aspect of her life: from her rise to fame as a daring and fiery pop/dance performer and singer; to her decision to accept a role on reality television; to the ups and downs of family life (including her marriage to famed lawyer Tom Girardi, thirty-three years her senior). There’s much more to Erika Jayne than fans see on&lt;i&gt; The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Pretty Mess&lt;/i&gt; is her opportunity to dig deep and tell her many-layered, unique, and inspiring life story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As fun and fearless as its author, this fascinating memoir proves once and for all why Erika Jayne is so beloved: she’s strong, confident, genuine, and here to tell all!</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;l Know Who You Are&lt;/i&gt; is the brilliant tale of two stories. One is about Aimee Sinclair—well-known actress on the verge of being full-on famous. If you saw her, you’d think you knew her. One day towards the near-end of her shoot on her latest film, Aimee comes home from filming to find her husband’s cell phone and wallet on the dining room table. He never goes anywhere without them. But he’s nowhere to be found. She’s not too concerned—they had a huge fight the night before. They both said things they didn’t mean. He might have done things he didn’t mean, things she can’t forget. Even though she has a history of supposedly forgetting. After all, she’s a very good actress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning she goes for her morning run and then goes to her favorite coffee shop. But her card is denied. When she calls the bank they say her account has been emptied of $10,000. She immediately suspects her husband. But they say no, it was Aimee herself who closed out the account. And thus begins a bizarre rabbit hole into which Aimee finds herself falling where nothing is at it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternating with Aimee’s story is that of a little girl who wandered away from home. We always tell our kids not to talk to strangers or bad things will happen. Well, bad things happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;I Know Who You Are&lt;/i&gt;, Alice Feeney proves that she is a master at brilliantly complicated plots and twists after twists.</description>

  <description>A conjuring, an invocation, a communion with Lizzie Borden herself. These poems reveal—letter by word by line—a spirit, a history, an identity. Lizzie speaks through Tedesco.</description>

  <description>Yuliya dons a prosthetic face designed to help her cope with Social Anxiety Disorder, the essential oil infused mask not only disguising her expression, but the wet city stench as it soothes. Time, it can only stop when someone takes a photo, and that’s what they did, whoever made it—took her picture and made her a mask to hide behind whenever social phobia bullied her. A dead-face: expressionless, eyes only visible through open sockets, mouth slightly parted; the way she imagined she’d look the day she died. And now, whenever someone sees her—stares at her—wearing her Yuliya mask, they are looking at her past. Yet behind her SAD face, she sometimes finds confidence, until she takes it off and attempts to uncover the woman hiding beneath.</description>

  <description>Lila Bennett’s bad choices have finally caught up with her. And one of those decisions has split her life in two. Literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one life, she’s taken hostage by someone who appears to be a stranger but knows too much. As she’s trapped in a concrete cell, her kidnapper forces her to face what she’s done or be killed. In an alternate life, she eludes her captor but is hunted by someone who is dismantling her happiness, exposing one secret at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lila’s decorated career as a criminal defense attorney, her marriage, and her life are on the line. She must make a list of those she’s wronged—both in and out of the courtroom—to determine who is out to get her before it’s too late. But even if she can pinpoint her assailant, will she survive? And if she does, which parts of her life are worth saving, and which parts must die? Because one thing’s for certain—life as Lila Bennett knew it is over.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The award-winning, bestselling French novel by Philippe Besson about an affair between two teenage boys in 1984 France, translated with subtle beauty and haunting lyricism by the iconic and internationally acclaimed actress/writer Molly Ringwald. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;We drive at high speed along back roads, through woods, vineyards, and oat fields. The bike smells like gasoline and makes a lot of noise, and sometimes I’m frightened when the wheels slip on the gravel on the dirt road, but the only thing that matters is that I’m holding on to him, that I’m holding on to him &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;outside&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just outside a hotel in Bordeaux, Philippe chances upon a young man who bears a striking resemblance to his first love. What follows is a look back at the relationship he’s never forgotten, a hidden affair with a gorgeous boy named Thomas during their last year of high school. Without ever acknowledging they know each other in the halls, they steal time to meet in secret, carrying on a passionate, world-altering affair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dazzlingly rendered in English by Ringwald in her first-ever translation, Besson’s powerfully moving coming-of-age story captures the eroticism and tenderness of first love—and the heartbreaking passage of time.</description>

  <description>From Alafair Burke—New York Times bestselling author of the runaway hit, The Wife—comes another twisty tale of domestic noir. When a prominent Manhattan lawyer is murdered, two estranged sisters—one the dead man’s widow, the other his ex—must set aside mistrust and old resentments . . . but can they escape their past?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Chloe was the younger of the two Taylor sisters, she always seemed to be in charge. She was the honor roll student with big dreams and an even bigger work ethic. Nicky was always restless . . . and more than a little reckless—the opposite of her ambitious little sister. She floated from job to job and man to man, and stayed close to home in Cleveland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a while, it seemed like both sisters had found happiness. Chloe earned a scholarship to an Ivy League school and moved to New York City, where she landed a coveted publishing job. Nicky married promising young attorney Adam Macintosh, and gave birth to a baby boy they named Ethan. The Taylor sisters became virtual strangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, more than fifteen years later, their lives are drastically different—and Chloe is married to Adam. When he’s murdered by an intruder at the couple’s East Hampton beach house, Chloe reluctantly allows her teenaged stepson’s biological mother—her estranged sister, Nicky—back into her life. But when the police begin to treat Ethan as a suspect in his father’s death, the two sisters are forced to unite . . . and to confront the truth behind family secrets they have tried to bury in the past</description>

  <description>No visitors. No nights spent away from the apartment. No disturbing the other residents, all of whom are rich or famous or both. These are the only rules for Jules Larsen's new job as an apartment sitter at the Bartholomew, one of Manhattan's most high-profile and mysterious buildings. Recently heartbroken and just plain broke, Jules is taken in by the splendor of her surroundings and accepts the terms, ready to leave her past life behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she gets to know the residents and staff of the Bartholomew, Jules finds herself drawn to fellow apartment sitter Ingrid, who comfortingly, disturbingly reminds her of the sister she lost eight years ago. When Ingrid confides that the Bartholomew is not what it seems and the dark history hidden beneath its gleaming facade is starting to frighten her, Jules brushes it off as a harmless ghost story—until the next day, when Ingrid disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searching for the truth about Ingrid's disappearance, Jules digs deeper into the Bartholomew's dark past and into the secrets kept within its walls. Her discovery that Ingrid is not the first apartment sitter to go missing at the Bartholomew pits Jules against the clock as she races to unmask a killer, expose the building's hidden past, and escape the Bartholomew before her temporary status becomes permanent.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The name of the game is revenge—no matter the cost—in this emotionally charged thriller reminiscent of &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Perfect Nanny&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kerrie O’Malley, jobless and in an unfulfilling relationship, can isolate the singular moment in her life when things veered off course—the night she was irrevocably wronged by someone she looked up to. Eighteen years later, when Kerrie sees the very woman who destroyed her life on television, a fire ignites inside her. The stakes are high. The risks are perilous. But she’ll stop at nothing to achieve the retribution she deserves.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jordana Pierson is a gilded New Yorker who appears to have it all: wealth, glamour, a successful and handsome husband, and a thriving wedding concierge business. Her record is spotless. Her business is flourishing. No one knows the truth about her and the dark shadows of her past.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No one, that is, except Kerrie.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Exploring just how far someone will go for vengeance, &lt;i&gt;Pretty Revenge&lt;/i&gt; is a riveting, compulsively readable novel bursting with twists and turns and plenty of suspense.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Bri wants to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. Or at least make it out of her neighborhood one day. As the daughter of an underground rap legend who died before he hit big, Bri’s got big shoes to fill. But now that her mom has unexpectedly lost her job, food banks and shutoff notices are as much a part of Bri’s life as beats and rhymes. With bills piling up and homelessness staring her family down, Bri no longer just wants to make it—she has to make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Come Up&lt;/i&gt; is Angie Thomas’s homage to hip-hop, the art that sparked her passion for storytelling and continues to inspire her to this day. It is the story of fighting for your dreams, even as the odds are stacked against you; of the struggle to become who you are and not who everyone expects you to be; and of the desperate realities of poor and working-class black families.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The internationally bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Last Mrs. Parrish&lt;/em&gt; follows that success with an addictive novel filled with shocking twists about the aftermath of a brutal high-society murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Kate English has it all. Not only is she the heiress to a large fortune; she has a gorgeous husband and daughter, a high-flying career, and a beautiful home anyone would envy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all that changes the night Kate’s mother, Lily, is found dead, brutally murdered in her own home. Heartbroken and distraught, Kate reaches out to her estranged best friend, Blaire Barrington, who rushes to her side for the funeral, where the years of distance between them are forgotten in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That evening, Kate’s grief turns to horror when she receives an anonymous text: &lt;em&gt;You think you’re sad now, just wait. By the time I’m finished with you, you’ll wish you had been buried today&lt;/em&gt;. More than ever, Kate needs her old friend’s help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Blaire decides to take the investigation into her own hands, it becomes clear that all is not as it seems in Baltimore high society. As infidelity, lies, and betrayals come to light, and tensions rise to a boiling point, she begins to alienate Kate’s friends and relatives with her relentless, accusatory questions, as she tries to find Lily’s killer. The murderer could be anyone—friend, neighbor, loved one. But whoever it is, it’s clear that Kate is next on their list. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Last Time I Saw You&lt;/em&gt;, Liv Constantine takes the lightning pace of &lt;em&gt;The Last Mrs. Parrish&lt;/em&gt; and raises the stakes, creating an exquisitely tension-filled and absorbing tale of psychological suspense in which innocent lives—and one woman’s sanity—hang in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>I had just turned fourteen years old the night my best friends and I decided to kill Mr. Martinsen. He was my friend. My mentor. I would even go so far as to say I loved him, as I looked up to Mr. Martinsen the same way I had looked up to my maternal grandfather, who died from a heart attack when I was ten. He was the best teacher I ever had. I will never forget him, or the knowledge he imparted to me, as long as I live. But on that summer evening just several weeks before I began my freshman year of high school, he gave my friends and me no choice. Things had gone too far. We had put it off for too long. We knew Mr. Martinsen had to die.</description>

  <description>Fresh from a stretch in prison, Joe Openshaw is living at home with his father and trying to get his life together again. He has let go of old habits, especially the ones that turned him into an addict and helped land him in prison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a hike along the Lowback Trail, Joe stumbles on one of the town's oldest secrets--buried long ago, if not forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's an unusual but safe enough treasure--a jar of old pennies. What interests Joe isn't the pennies themselves, but the pieces of paper taped to every coin--a child's handwritten wish on each one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the first few wishes come true, they are simple things. Fun. Harmless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except as time goes on, Joe realizes they aren't really wishes at all...they're exchanges, and the bill was racking up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is free in life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooner or later, you always pay.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Everyone's invited...everyone's a suspect...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fans of Ruth Ware and Tana French, a shivery, atmospheric, page-turning novel of psychological suspense in the tradition of Agatha Christie, in which a group of old college friends are snowed in at a hunting lodge . . . and murder and mayhem ensue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All of them are friends. One of them is a killer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the languid days of the Christmas break, a group of thirtysomething friends from Oxford meet to welcome in the New Year together, a tradition they began as students ten years ago. For this vacation, they’ve chosen an idyllic and isolated estate in the Scottish Highlands—the perfect place to get away and unwind by themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrive on December 30th, just before a historic blizzard seals the lodge off from the outside world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later, on New Year’s Day, one of them is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trip began innocently enough: admiring the stunning if foreboding scenery, champagne in front of a crackling fire, and reminiscences about the past. But after a decade, the weight of secret resentments has grown too heavy for the group’s tenuous nostalgia to bear. Amid the boisterous revelry of New Year’s Eve, the cord holding them together snaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now one of them is dead . . . and another of them did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep your friends close, the old adage goes. But just how close is too close?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I am not a monster.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ray Bridges, a professional electronics salesman, is looking for love in all the strange places. He spends most nights sneaking into support group meetings for the disabled in order to satisfy his deepest, darkest desires—to hook up with unfortunate, down-on-their-luck women who’ve recently lost a limb. There's a name for Ray’s preference; it’s called acrotomophilia, a paraphilia involving amputees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conflicted, Ray wishes he could change. But he can’t. His body won’t let him. Nor will his mind. He’s destined to live this life, forever. That is . . . until he meets the perfect girl. Falls in love with her. Only problem: her arms and legs are attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unable to find her attractive, Ray embarks on a dark, twisted journey of self-discovery, one that will force him to make an impossible choice: abandon his pursuit of true love or find a way to make it work, even if that means getting the girl of his dreams to shed an appendage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weird, comedic, and often raunchy, &lt;i&gt;Limbs&lt;/i&gt; is the craziest love story ever told.</description>

  <description>"LeVoit's work exists at the center of a glowing nexus where fever dream punk rock poetry collides with raw emotion and vertiginous talent." --Jeremy Robert Johnson, author of Skullcrack City&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in and around Hollywood Forever Cemetery, this tense and mind-bending noir is Violet LeVoit at her finest: an unnerving, unpredictable and comic journey through deep trauma and glitzy nostalgic insanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I Miss The World is a gut-punch, throat-punch, heart- punch of a novel. LeVoit knows how to seduce you with a lullaby when she's going for blood." --Danger Slater, author of Puppet Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It is masterful, it is beautiful and awful, it is sweepingly and breathtakingly artistic, the impact of seeing some great natural wonder or work of art for the first time." --The Horror Fiction Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Revelatory, gut-punching, brilliantly anarchic perfection." --J David Osborne, author of Black Gum</description>

  <description>Ten writers are selected for a summer-long writing retreat with the most celebrated and reclusive author in the world. Their host is the legendary Roderick Wells. Handsome, enigmatic, and fiendishly talented, Wells promises to teach his pupils about writing, about magic, about the untapped potential that each of them possesses. Most of all, he plans to teach them about the darkness in their hearts. The writers think they are signing up for a chance at riches and literary prestige. But they are really entering the twisted imagination of a deranged genius, a lethal contest pitting them against one another in a struggle for their sanity and their lives. They have entered into Roderick Wells's most brilliant and horrible creation. The Dark Game. FLAME TREE PRESS is the new fiction imprint of Flame Tree Publishing. Launched in 2018 the list brings together brilliant new authors and the more established; the award winners, and exciting, original voices.</description>

  <description>Artie is a serial killer obsessed with As Seen On T.V. products. Collecting and modifying these items is his only passion outside of killing, which he’s been doing a long time. Far longer than most of his peers, but Artie always took special care to make sure he remained free. Now a strange, small man has moved next door to him, and the smell of popcorn hangs thick in the air. After a few odd interactions with him, Artie starts to wonder if there’s something other than himself that’s kept him from being caught.</description>

  <description>When newscaster Abby Waite is diagnosed with a potentially terminal illness, she decides to do the logical thing… break her twin sister Martha out of prison and hit the road. Their destination is the Waite family cabin in Minnesota where Abby plans a family reunion of sorts. But when you come from a family where your grandfather frequently took control of your body during your youth, where your mother tried to inhabit your mind and suck your youthful energies out of you, and where so many dark secrets–and bodies, even–are buried, such a family meeting promises to be nothing short of complicated…</description>

  <description>The devastating debut short story collection from British Fantasy Award-winning author Georgina Bruce. Haunting and visceral tales for the lost and the lonely. An emotional and riveting debut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advance praise for Georgina Bruce's 'This House of Wounds.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"An astonishing, totally absorbing debut collection. Edgy, disturbing and delicious in equal parts. Georgina Bruce plays with myth and horror beautifully."-Kerry Hadley-Pryce, Author of Gamble, and The Black Country&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The stories in This House of Wounds strike me as both an emotional and intellectual examination of pain, from how it spreads and is passed on to others to how it can easily turn us into different, crueller creatures. Each act formed in pain leads to another, then another, and this makes for twisted, beautiful reading. Georgina Bruce is a courageous and compelling writer."-Aliya Whiteley, Author of The Loosening Skin, and The Beauty</description>

  <description>John Langan’s new book is certain to solidify his place among the strongest voices in modern literary horror. Placed together within the same cover for the first time, a theme emerges from the tales that binds and unites them–and it is signaled in the title of the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“These are stories of betrayal,” author John Langan confirms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from this thread, the stories are otherwise quite distinct from each other in terms of their characters, plots, settings, themes and even varieties of horror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s “In Paris in the Mount of Kronos,” a snappy, neo-noirish, action packed Laird Barron-esque encounter with ancient malevolent forces; the dark, character-driven relationship dramas of “The Third Always Beside You” and “Renfrew’s Course”; the vaguely Lovecraftian horrors of “Bloom”; the atmospheric steampunk weirdness in the form of “The Unbearable Proximity of Mr. Dunn’s Balloons”; and apocalyptic surrealism in “Bos Uros”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the title novella, Sefira, is about a woman who is chasing a succubus across the United States, while the novelette At Home in the Devil’s House offers a new, nightmarish concept of Hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sefira and Other Betrayals contains stories previously published in such prestigious anthologies as Supernatural Noir, Blood and Other Cravings, Ghosts by Gaslight, Black Wings 2, Shadows Edge and others, and includes one original novella, Sefira, and an original novelette, At Home in the Devil’s House.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(from Rue Morgue Magazine review)</description>

  <description>Mackenzie, Ava, Caitlin, Julie, and Parker have done some not-so-perfect things. But even though they all talked about killing rich bully Nolan Hotchkiss, they didn’t actually go through with it. It’s just a coincidence that Nolan died in exactly the way they planned . . . right? Except Nolan wasn’t the only one they fantasized about killing. When someone &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; they named dies, the girls wonder if they’re being framed. Or are &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; about to become the killer’s next targets?</description>

      <![CDATA["He deserves to be punished." <br /><br />I read this immediately after The Perfectionists, and I ended up preferring the first one. This one was so over-the-top, and I couldn't really take it seriously by the end. Same issues as the first one - too many characters and it was a pretty flat story.]]>

  <description>“Rios de la Luz’s writing blows minds and breaks hearts. A sort of new and bizarre Tomás Rivera, Rios is able to blend the familiar of the domestic with the all the wilderness of the universe. Her stories will grab you in places you didn’t know you had, take you by those places to where you’ve always wanted to go—though you never knew how to get there. Buy this book and enjoy that journey.” —Brian Allen Carr “In The Pulse between Dimensions and the Desert, Rios de la Luz’s writing is electric and alive. It grabs you and pulls you into her universe, one that is both familiar and foreign, a place where Martians find love, bad guys get their ears cut off, and time travel agents save lost children. In this innovative, heartfelt debut, de la Luz takes her place as a young author that demands to be read and watched.” —Juliet Escoria</description>

  <description>Master short story author Lucy A. Snyder is back with a dozen chilling, thought-provoking tales of Lovecraftian horror, dark science fiction, and weird fantasy. Her previous two collections received Bram Stoker Awards and this one offers the same high-caliber, trope-twisting prose. Snyder effortlessly creates memorable monsters, richly imagined worlds and diverse, unforgettable characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Open this book and you'll find a garden of stories as dark and heady as black roses that will delight fans of complex, intelligent speculative fiction.</description>

  <description>Where there is darkness, there isn't always light... Dayna Harris thought her problems began in her bedroom. More specifically in her bed, the bed she'd shared with her husband, Richard, for twenty-six years. The bed where she witnessed Richard cheating on her with a woman half his age. But maybe they really began in the motel room that day. What conjured the dark figure Dayna first glimpsed in the motel mirror? The dark figure that continues to haunt her as her marriage to Richard crumbles. Consumed by Richard's infidelity, Dayna begins unravelling his lies revealing a husband she never knew. Now, psychologically imprisoned by a manipulative and dangerous husband, can Dayna find the courage to leave, and can she discover if the very real shadow that torments her is a figment of her imagination or something more sinister? In this edgy paranormal psychological thriller, author J.M. White takes us into the realms of the unknown, lives that are built on lies, forces we can't always explain and the emotional torture of domestic abuse. It shows one woman's search for light in the darkness.</description>

  <description>Dead is Dead, but Not Always is the first solo collection from Canadian author Eddie Generous. The mountain winds Howl and blood flows to appease, tradition runs deep and transforms the skin for the sake of togetherness, buried beneath the soil is a book to bridge the eternal dark with the light of life, God's way is with a hiss but Satan's way is with a kiss, in the Arctic only the bears can hear your screams, when it's your time go the lake will tell you, and being a kid ain't easy when the natural and supernatural collide to peel the layers from your back. From dread to thriller to cosmic, the seven novelettes collected here meld into one bone-jarringly bleak outing, bound to rattle cores and test readers' nerves.</description>

  <description>Strang isn’t the small, quaint town it appears to be. It’s haunted every night by a creature the townsfolk refer to as Halloween. Once the sun sets each day, Halloween emerges to collect its treats: a small, live offering from each household. The residents comply because no one wants to be the target of Halloween’s tricks. But the nightmare of residing in Strang is nothing compared to the yearly ritual Halloween demands of the citizens on All Hallows’ Eve.</description>

  <description>For most of her fourteen years, Tasha Davis has languished in the rural-suburban town of Skillute, Washington. Her parents offer plenty of comfortable—if stifling—emotional support, but what she needs is a best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her final year at Clark Middle School, Tasha meets a strange, new classmate. Briar Kenny is the self-styled rebel Tasha wants to be, and the Davises are the kind of close-knit family Briar covets. A moment of unexpected violence spawns a secret between the two girls and awakens a mystery from the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unknown to Tasha and Briar, their secret also attracts something monstrous from a forgotten corner of Skillute. The town is haunted by its history, scarred with the lingering spirit of broken and scattered families, abandoned real estate ventures, and old scores never settled between neighbors. But there’s more to the place than memory and legend. Beneath the landscape something malignant rages, and it will stop at nothing to find a route into the physical world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover art and design by Mikio Murakami.</description>

  <description>The poems of “Candle and Pins” are inspired by familiar—and some unfamiliar—superstitions, ranging from love charms to burial practices, parsley seeds to the evil eye. Like superstitions themselves, these poems explore the terrain where magic and everyday life intertwine, and where beauty, horror, fear, and belief combine in ways both new and ageless.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Alex &amp;amp; Eliza comes a return to adult fiction, centered around a mysterious woman's birthday celebration—and what it reveals about her past.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ellie de Florent-Stinson is celebrating her fortieth birthday with a grand celebration in her fabulous house in Palm Springs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At forty, it appears Ellie has everything she ever wanted: a handsome husband; an accomplished, college-age stepdaughter; a beautiful ten-year-old girl; two adorable and rambunctious six-year-old twin boys; lush, well-appointed homes in Los Angeles, Park City, and Palm Springs; a thriving career as a well-known fashion designer of casual women's wear; and a glamorous circle of friends.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except everything is not quite as perfect as it looks on the outside—Ellie is keeping many secrets. This isn’t the first of her birthday parties that hasn't gone as planned. Something happened on the night of her sweet sixteenth. Something she’s tried hard to forget.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But hiding the skeletons of her past comes at a cost, and all of Ellie’s secrets come to light on the night of her fabulous birthday party in the desert—where everyone who matters in her life shows up, invited or not. Old and new, friends and frenemies, stepdaughters and business partners, ex-wives and ex-husbands congregate, and the glittering facade of her life crumbles in one eventful night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beautifully paced and full of surprises, &lt;i&gt;The Birthday Girl&lt;/i&gt; is an enthralling tale of a life lived in shadow, and its unavoidable consequences.</description>

  <description>Natalie, a young art student in New York City, is struggling to pay her bills when a friend makes a suggestion: Why not go online and find a sugar daddy—a wealthy, older man who will pay her for dates, and even give her a monthly allowance? Lots of girls do it, Nat learns. All that’s required is to look pretty and hang on his every word. Sexual favours are optional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though more than thirty years her senior, Gabe, a handsome corporate finance attorney, seems like the perfect candidate, and within a month, they are madly in love. At least, Nat is…Gabe already has a family, whom he has no intention of leaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when he abruptly ends things, Nat can’t let go. She begins drinking heavily and stalking him: watching him at work, spying on his wife, even befriending his daughter, who is not much younger than she is. But Gabe’s not about to let his sugar baby destroy his perfect life. What was supposed to be a mutually beneficial arrangement devolves into a nightmare of deception, obsession, and, when a body is found near Gabe’s posh Upper East Side apartment, murder.</description>

  <description>Deja and Josiah are seasonal best friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every autumn, all through high school, they’ve worked together at the best pumpkin patch in the whole wide world. (Not many people know that the best pumpkin patch in the whole wide world is in Omaha, Nebraska, but it definitely is.) They say good-bye every Halloween, and they’re reunited every September 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this Halloween is different—Josiah and Deja are finally seniors, and this is their last season at the pumpkin patch. Their last shift together. Their last good-bye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josiah’s ready to spend the whole night feeling melancholy about it. Deja isn’t ready to let him. She’s got a&lt;i&gt; plan&lt;/i&gt;: What if—instead of moping and the usual slinging lima beans down at the Succotash Hut—they went out with a bang? They could see all the sights! Taste all the snacks! And Josiah could finally talk to that cute girl he’s been mooning over for three years . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if their last shift was an adventure?</description>

      <![CDATA["Friends don't let friends live small lives." <br /><br />Pumpkinheads was a cute and fun graphic novel. It's a super quick read, and I liked Deja a lot. I really really want to go to a pumpkin patch exactly like the one in this book now - it sounds like so much fun!]]>

  <description>Trouble is haunting Cassidy Blake . . . even more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She (plus her ghost best friend, Jacob, of course) are in Paris, where Cass's parents are filming their TV show about the world's most haunted cities. Sure, it's fun eating croissants and seeing the Eiffel Tower, but there's true ghostly danger lurking beneath Paris, in the creepy underground Catacombs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Cass accidentally awakens a frighteningly strong spirit, she must rely on her still-growing skills as a ghosthunter -- and turn to friends both old and new to help her unravel a mystery. But time is running out, and the spirit is only growing stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if Cass fails, the force she's unleashed could haunt the city forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The Marriage Lie&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Three Days Missing&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; comes a riveting new novel of suspense about a woman who, in a fight for survival, must decide just how far she'll go to escape the person she once loved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beth Murphy is on the run...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nearly a year, Beth has been planning for this day. A day some people might call any other Wednesday, but Beth prefers to see it as her new beginning--one with a new look, new name and new city. Beth has given her plan significant thought, because one small slip and her violent husband will find her.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sabine Hardison is missing...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple hundred miles away, Jeffrey returns home from a work trip to find his wife, Sabine, is missing. Wherever she is, she's taken almost nothing with her. Her abandoned car is the only evidence the police have, and all signs point to foul play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the police search for leads, the case becomes more and more convoluted. Sabine's carefully laid plans for her future indicate trouble at home, and a husband who would be better off with her gone. The detective on the case will stop at nothing to find out what happened and bring this missing woman home. Where is Sabine? And who is Beth? The only thing that's certain is that someone is lying and the truth won't stay buried for long.</description>

  <description>Steven Archer and Donna Lynch collaborate once again for a collection of illustrated poems and short stories about witches—some familiar and some secret; some based in history and lore, and some manifested directly from the minds of their creators. This 7″ by 10″, full-color art book includes more than 30 poems and paintings and is the sequel to Daughters of Lilith, their collaborative work released in 2010.</description>

  <description>Corinne LaMer defeated the wicked jumbie Severine months ago, but things haven’t exactly gone back to normal in her Caribbean island home. Everyone knows Corinne is half-jumbie, and many of her neighbors treat her with mistrust. When local children begin to go missing, snatched from the beach and vanishing into wells, suspicious eyes turn to Corinne.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; To rescue the missing children and clear her own name, Corinne goes deep into the ocean to find Mama D’Leau, the dangerous jumbie who rules the sea. But Mama D’Leau’s help comes with a price. Corinne and her friends Dru, Bouki, and Malik must travel with mermaids across the ocean to the shores of Ghana to fetch a powerful object for Mama D’Leau. The only thing more perilous than Corinne’s adventures across the sea is the foe that waits for her back home.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; With its action-packed storytelling, diverse characters, and inventive twists on Caribbean and West African mythology and fairy tales, &lt;i&gt;Rise of the Jumbies &lt;/i&gt;will appeal to readers of &lt;i&gt;A Snicker of Magic, Breadcrumbs, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Where the Mountain Meets the Moon&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tell Me Lies &lt;/i&gt;is a sexy, thrilling novel about that one person who still haunts you—the &lt;i&gt;other &lt;/i&gt;one. The wrong one. The one you couldn’t let go of. The one you’ll never forget. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Albright is far from her Long Island upbringing when she arrives on the campus of her small California college and happy to be hundreds of miles from her mother—whom she’s never forgiven for an act of betrayal in her early teen years. Quickly grasping at her fresh start, Lucy embraces college life and all it has to offer. And then she meets Stephen DeMarco. Charming. Attractive. Complicated. Devastating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Confident and cocksure, Stephen sees something in Lucy that no one else has, and she’s quickly seduced by this vision of herself, and the sense of possibility that his attention brings her. Meanwhile, Stephen is determined to forget an incident buried in his past that, if exposed, could ruin him, and his single-minded drive for success extends to winning, and keeping, Lucy’s heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Lucy knows there’s something about Stephen that isn’t to be trusted. Stephen knows Lucy can’t tear herself away. And their addicting entanglement will have consequences they never could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Alternating between Lucy’s and Stephen’s voices, &lt;i&gt;Tell Me Lies&lt;/i&gt; follows their connection through college and post-college life in New York City.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six: The band's album &lt;i&gt;Aurora&lt;/i&gt; came to define the rock 'n' roll era of the late seventies, and an entire generation of girls wanted to grow up to be Daisy. But no one knows the reason behind the group's split on the night of their final concert at Chicago Stadium on July 12, 1979 . . . until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it’s the rock 'n' roll she loves most. By the time she’s twenty, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also getting noticed is The Six, a band led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she’s pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes that the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The making of that legend is chronicled in this riveting and unforgettable novel, written as an oral history of one of the biggest bands of the seventies. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a talented writer who takes her work to a new level with &lt;i&gt;Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six&lt;/i&gt;, brilliantly capturing a place and time in an utterly distinctive voice.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The residents of a sleepy mountain town are rocked by troubling visions of an alternate reality in this dazzling debut that combines the family-driven suspense of Celeste Ng’s &lt;em&gt;Little Fires Everywhere&lt;/em&gt; with the inventive storytelling of &lt;em&gt;The Immortalists&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the quiet haven of Clearing, Oregon, four neighbors find their lives upended when they begin to see themselves in parallel realities. Ginny, a devoted surgeon whose work often takes precedence over her family, has a baffling vision of a beautiful co-worker in Ginny’s own bed and begins to doubt the solidity of her marriage. Ginny’s husband, Mark, a wildlife scientist, sees a vision that suggests impending devastation and grows increasingly paranoid, threatening the safety of his wife and son. Samara, a young woman desperately mourning the recent death of her mother and questioning why her father seems to be coping with such ease, witnesses an apparition of her mother healthy and vibrant and wonders about the secrets her parents may have kept from her. Cass, a brilliant scholar struggling with the demands of new motherhood, catches a glimpse of herself pregnant again, just as she’s on the brink of returning to the project that could define her career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first the visions are relatively benign, but they grow increasingly disturbing—and, in some cases, frightening. When a natural disaster threatens Clearing, it becomes obvious that the visions were not what they first seemed and that the town will never be the same.</description>

  <description>PPoetry. Translated from the Swedish by Johannes Goranson. REMAINLAND showcases poetry from four volumes by Aase Berg, one ofSweden's most celebrated and subversive young writers. From the wrecked fairy-tale-scape of With Deer to the pregnancy allegory Transfer Fat, from the sci-fi naturalism of Dark Matter to the catastrophic oasis of Uppland, Berg works language into miniature grotesques which invert the truisms of contemporary society. Her compulsive inventiveness provides an excoriating challenge to all cultures of complacency. "Let yourself be troubled by this terrific poetry#151;this is a place of weird music and visceral delight"#151;Lisa Jarnot.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Adventures in Babysitting&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; meets &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; in this funny, action-packed novel about a coven of witchy babysitters who realize their calling to protect the innocent and save the world from an onslaught of evil. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Esme Pearl has a babysitters club. She knows it's kinda lame, but what else is she supposed to do? Get a job? Gross. Besides, Esme likes babysitting, and she's good at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And lately Esme needs all the cash she can get, because it seems like destruction follows her wherever she goes. Let's just say she owes some people a new tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Cassandra Heaven. She's Instagram-model hot, dresses like she found her clothes in a dumpster, and has a rebellious streak as gnarly as the cafeteria food. So why is Cassandra willing to do anything, even take on a potty-training two-year-old, to join Esme's babysitters club?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer lies in a mysterious note Cassandra's mother left her: "Find the babysitters. Love, Mom."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, Esme and Cassandra have more in common than they think, and they're about to discover what being a babysitter really means: a heroic lineage of superpowers, magic rituals, and saving the innocent from seriously terrifying evil. And all before the parents get home.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Five friends cursed. Five deadly fates. Five nights of retribución.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Lupe Dávila and Javier Utierre can survive each other’s company, together they can solve a series of grisly murders sweeping though Puerto Rico. But the clues lead them out of the real world and into the realm of myths and legends. And if they want to catch the killer, they'll have to step into the shadows to see what's lurking there—murderer, or monster?</description>

  <description>From Akutagawa Award-winning author Yoko Ogawa comes a haunting trio of novellas about love, fertility, obsession, and how even the most innocent gestures may contain a hairline crack of cruel intent. A lonely teenage girl falls in love with her foster brother as she watches him leap from a high diving board into a pool—a peculiar infatuation that sends unexpected ripples through her life. A young woman records the daily moods of her pregnant sister in a diary, taking meticulous note of a pregnancy that may or may not be a hallucination—but whose hallucination is it, hers or her sister's? A woman nostalgically visits her old college dormitory on the outskirts of Tokyo, a boarding house run by a mysterious triple amputee with one leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hauntingly spare, beautiful, and twisted, &lt;i&gt;The Diving Pool &lt;/i&gt;is a disquieting and at times darkly humorous collection of novellas about normal people who suddenly discover their own dark possibilities.</description>

  <description>John Persons is a private investigator with a distasteful job from an unlikely client. He’s been hired by a ten-year-old to kill the kid’s stepdad, McKinsey. The man in question is abusive, abrasive, and abominable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s also a monster, which makes Persons the perfect thing to hunt him. Over the course of his ancient, arcane existence, he’s hunted gods and demons, and broken them in his teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Persons investigates the horrible McKinsey, he realizes that he carries something far darker than the expected social evils. He’s infected with an alien presence, and he’s spreading that monstrosity far and wide. Luckily Persons is no stranger to the occult, being an ancient and magical intelligence himself. The question is whether the private dick can take down the abusive stepdad without releasing the holds on his own horrifying potential.</description>

  <description>Elizabeth Lavenza hasn't had a proper meal in weeks. Her thin arms are covered with bruises from her "caregiver," and she is on the verge of being thrown into the streets . . . until she is brought to the home of Victor Frankenstein, an unsmiling, solitary boy who has everything--except a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victor is her escape from misery. Elizabeth does everything she can to make herself indispensable--and it works. She is taken in by the Frankenstein family and rewarded with a warm bed, delicious food, and dresses of the finest silk. Soon she and Victor are inseparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her new life comes at a price. As the years pass, Elizabeth's survival depends on managing Victor's dangerous temper and entertaining his every whim, no matter how depraved. Behind her blue eyes and sweet smile lies the calculating heart of a girl determined to stay alive no matter the cost . . . as the world she knows is consumed by darkness.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Memory makes reality.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s what New York City cop Barry Sutton is learning as he investigates the devastating phenomenon the media has dubbed False Memory Syndrome—a mysterious affliction that drives its victims mad with memories of a life they never lived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's what neuroscientist Helena Smith believes. It’s why she’s dedicated her life to creating a technology that will let us preserve our most precious memories. If she succeeds, anyone will be able to re-experience a first kiss, the birth of a child, the final moment with a dying parent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Barry searches for the truth, he comes face-to-face with an opponent more terrifying than any disease—a force that attacks not just our minds but the very fabric of the past. And as its effects begin to unmake the world as we know it, only he and Helena, working together, will stand a chance at defeating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how can they make a stand when reality itself is shifting and crumbling all around them?</description>

  <description>This debut novel by an Arab-American voice,takes us inside the lives of conservative Arab women living in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Brooklyn, eighteen-year-old Deya is starting to meet with suitors. Though she doesn’t want to get married, her grandparents give her no choice. History is repeating itself: Deya’s mother, Isra, also had no choice when she left Palestine as a teenager to marry Adam. Though Deya was raised to believe her parents died in a car accident, a secret note from a mysterious, yet familiar-looking woman makes Deya question everything she was told about her past. As the narrative alternates between the lives of Deya and Isra, she begins to understand the dark, complex secrets behind her community.</description>

  <description>In her second collection of poetry, Passage, Gwen Benaway examines what it means to experience violence and speaks to the burden of survival. Traveling to Northern Ontario and across the Great Lakes, Passage is a poetic voyage through divorce, family violence, legacy of colonization, and the affirmation of a new sexuality and gender. Previously published as a man, Passage is the poet's first collection written as a transwoman. Striking and raw in sparse lines, the collection showcases a vital Two Spirited identity that transects borders of race, gender, and experience. In Passage, the poet seeks to reconcile herself to the land, the history of her ancestors, and her separation from her partner and family by invoking the beauty and power of her ancestral waterways. Building on the legacy of other ground-breaking Indigenous poets like Gregory Scofield and Queer poets like Tim Dlugos, Benaway's work is deeply personal and devastating in sharp, clear lines. Passage is a book burning with a beautiful intensity and reveals Benaway as one of the most powerful emerging poets writing in Indigenous poetics today.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An award-winning and hard-hitting new voice in contemporary American poetry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The first time I ever came the light was weak and carnivorous.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I covered my eyes and the night cleared its dumb throat.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I heard my mother wringing her hands the next morning.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Of course I put my underwear on backwards, of course the elastic didn't work.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What I wanted most at that moment was a sandwich.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But I just nursed on this leather whip.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I just splattered my sheets with my sadness.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;—from “Poem of My Humiliations”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What is life but a cross / over rotten water?” Poet, novelist, and essayist Erika L. Sánchez’s powerful debut poetry collection explores what it means to live on both sides of the border—the border between countries, languages, despair and possibility, and the living and the dead. Sánchez tells her own story as the daughter of undocumented Mexican immigrants and as part of a family steeped in faith, work, grief, and expectations. The poems confront sex, shame, race, and an America roiling with xenophobia, violence, and laws of suspicion and suppression. With candor and urgency, and with the unblinking eyes of a journalist, Sánchez roves from the individual life into the lives of sex workers, narco-traffickers, factory laborers, artists, and lovers. What emerges is a powerful, multifaceted portrait of survival. &lt;i&gt;Lessons on Expulsion&lt;/i&gt; is the first book by a vibrant, essential new writer now breaking into the national literary landscape.</description>

  <description>A thrilling, atmospheric debut with the intensive drive of &lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gravity&lt;/em&gt; and the creeping dread of &lt;em&gt;Annihilation,&lt;/em&gt; in which a caver on a foreign planet finds herself on a terrifying psychological and emotional journey for survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Gyre Price lied her way into this expedition, she thought she’d be mapping mineral deposits, and that her biggest problems would be cave collapses and gear malfunctions. She also thought that the fat paycheck—enough to get her off-planet and on the trail of her mother—meant she’d get a skilled surface team, monitoring her suit and environment, keeping her safe. Keeping her sane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, she got Em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Em sees nothing wrong with controlling Gyre’s body with drugs or withholding critical information to “ensure the smooth operation” of her expedition. Em knows all about Gyre’s falsified credentials, and has no qualms using them as a leash—and a lash. And Em has secrets, too . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Gyre descends, little inconsistencies—missing supplies, unexpected changes in the route, and, worst of all, shifts in Em’s motivations—drive her out of her depths. Lost and disoriented, Gyre finds her sense of control giving way to paranoia and anger. On her own in this mysterious, deadly place, surrounded by darkness and the unknown, Gyre must overcome more than just the dangerous terrain and the Tunneler which calls underground its home if she wants to make it out alive—she must confront the ghosts in her own head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how come she can't shake the feeling she’s being followed?</description>

  <description>IT WAS JUST A CAMPING TRIP &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down by the old Coheelee Creek Covered Bridge, four high school friends only wanted to kick back, smoke some weed and forget about their problems for a day or two. Sure, there were stories that the area was haunted, but there was no way they were true. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT WAS JUST A LOCAL LEGEND &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decades earlier, an old goat farmer had been murdered by the Klan, hung from a tree near the bridge solely because of the color of his skin. His body was never found. Since then, numerous sightings of a strange creature—half-man and half-goat—had been reported in the surrounding woods. He was called the Goatman. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT WAS JUST THE WORST NIGHT OF THEIR LIVES &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment they arrived, strange noises echoed around them… a sense that they were being watched pervaded the campsite… and that was just the beginning. When one of them vanishes and a horned monstrosity pursues the others, it becomes clear that the legends are real. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…and the truth is so much more horrific than they could ever have imagined. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Justin M. Woodward isn't playing around--this is a terrifying descent into depravity." -Jeff Strand (Author of Sick House) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Dark, twisted, and full of surprises.” -Duncan Ralston (Author of WOOM and Salvage) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Woodward is the kind of dick who invites himself into your nightmares, and Tamer Animals is the key he uses to open the door.” -J. Z. Foster (Author of The Wicked Ones and Witch Hunter)</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Wanted: Assistant to provide maternity cover for high-powered TV producer. Must be bright, creative, with killer instincts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma would do anything to work for the woman who has the job she wants. Carrie is at the top of her game, with a dream career, a baby on the way, and a handsome screenwriter husband. For Emma, with parents who don't understand her ambition and a serious misstep behind her, this temp position might be her last chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carrie has given up more than anyone knows to get to the top of a ruthless business. She won't give up this baby too. But with Emma filling in for her at the office, her perfect life starts to unravel. Her bank account is inexplicably overdrawn, her husband seems strangely distant and colleagues are all too happy to take Emma's creative direction. Carrie finds herself dying to get back to work . . . until a letter left at her door changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trust and fear trade places in a love triangle that defies readers' expectations at every turn. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>An electrifying, dazzlingly written reckoning and an essential addition to the national conversation about race and class, Survival Math takes its name from the calculations award-winning author Mitchell S. Jackson made to survive the Portland, Oregon, of his youth. This dynamic book explores gangs and guns, near-death experiences, sex work, masculinity, composite fathers, the concept of “hustle,” and the destructive power of addiction—all framed within the experience of Jackson, his family, and his community. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lauded for its breathtaking pace, its tender portrayals, its stark candor, and its luminous style, Survival Math reveals on every page the searching intellect and originality of its author. The primary narrative, focused on understanding the antecedents of Jackson’s family’s experiences, is complemented by poems composed from historical American documents as well as survivor files, which feature photographs and riveting short narratives of several of Jackson’s male relatives. The sum of Survival Math’s parts is a highly original whole, one that reflects on the exigencies--over generations--that have shaped the lives of so many disenfranchised Americans. As essential as it is beautiful, as real as it is artful, Mitchell S. Jackson’s nonfiction debut is a singular achievement, not to be missed.</description>

      <![CDATA[3.5⭐ rounded up<br /><br />This is a tough review to write. While I loved Jackson's storytelling and honesty, I really struggled with the format of this book. I enjoyed the memoir aspects, and I think I expected this to be a full memoir. However, a lot of this book had an academic tone (which is...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For fans of the high-stakes tension of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestsellers &lt;i&gt;Luckiest Girl Alive &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Lying Game&lt;/i&gt;, a razor-sharp page-turner about female ambition and what happens when fake violence draws real blood… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of struggling in the Chicago theater scene, ambitious actress Kira Rascher finally lands the role of a lifetime. The catch? Starring in &lt;i&gt;Temper&lt;/i&gt; means working with Malcolm Mercer, a mercurial director who’s known for pushing his performers past their limits—onstage and off.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kira’s convinced she can handle Malcolm, but the theater’s cofounder Joanna Cuyler is another story. Joanna sees Kira as a threat—to her own thwarted artistic aspirations, her twisted relationship with Malcolm, and the shocking secret she’s keeping about the upcoming production. But as opening night draws near, Kira and Joanna both start to realize that Malcolm’s dangerous extremes are nothing compared to what they're capable of themselves&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An edgy, addictive, and fiendishly clever tale of ambition, deceit, and power, &lt;i&gt;Temper &lt;/i&gt;is a timely, heart-in-your-throat psychological thriller that will leave you breathless.</description>

  <description>I'll be seeing you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's the note left behind for Ivy Longwood when infamous killer Tucker Ashton murders her boyfriend. Several years later, after Tucker vanishes from his jail cell, Ivy travels to Ashton's hometown of Marlowe, Massachusetts. Not for closure or therapy. She's being called there. Steered by forces beyond her control. What she'll find is not the quiet suburban town Marlowe once was. It's something new. Something dark. Something that answers the question: Where did Tucker Ashton go?</description>

  <description>A debut psychological thriller about a woman who moves with her family to the gothic seaside house where her husband grew up--and where 15 years ago another family was brutally slaughtered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah and Patrick are happy. But after her mother's death, Sarah spirals into depression and overdoses on sleeping pills. While Sarah claims it was an accident, her teenage children aren't so sure. Patrick decides they all need a fresh start and he knows just the place, since the idyllic family home where he was raised has recently come up for sale. There's only one catch: for the past fifteen years, it has become infamous as the "Murder House", standing empty after a family was stabbed to death within its walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patrick believes they can bring the house back to its former glory, so Sarah, uprooted from everything she knows, pours her energy into painting, gardening, and giving the rotting old structure the warmth of home. But with locals hinting that the house is haunted, the news that the murderer has been paroled, strange writing on the walls, and creepy "gifts" arriving on the doorstep at odd hours, Sarah can't shake the feeling that something just isn't right. Not with the house, not with the town, or even with her own, loving husband--whose stories about his perfect childhood suddenly aren't adding up. Can Sarah uncover the secrets of the Murder House before another family is destroyed?</description>

  <description>Lisa Marie Basile's first full-length collection of poetry is an almost-memoir-in-verse, detailing vice, sexuality and grief through luscious poetics. Set in a dreamy, retro seaside town, APOCRYPHAL is a holy, girly, neurotic text obsessed with its own secret world. APOCRYPHAL attempts at truth but is littered with false memories and untenable hopes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRAISE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa Marie Basile is a romantic only in a world where romance encompasses the lilac roar of loss and a lush, ornate divination of grief. The roiling search for fathers and life beyond the grinding ether of some female reality sidles up to fluid contemplations on the body, desire and belief. In Apocryphal, a camera captures everything, and that camera aches and bleeds and beats the drums of time's non-linear passing. --Gina Abelkop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was born with a registry for sadness. I am born to be a spectacle, proclaims the fiercely candid speaker of Apocryphal. In this collection, a woman desperately searches through a landscape littered with ambivalence; she peers at us through wreckage left by a god-like, demon-like father who towers over her past with his smell like pine, chest you could wrap around a boulder. This brave collection proudly wears its vulnerabilities in a transformative gesture towards strength, self-exploration, and desire. Basile resists easy labels of victim/abuser, masculine/ feminine, power/weakness, want/repulsion, in order to expose the intricate hidden passageways of sex and power that exist within us all. Her lines and visions carry a shaman like quality, echoing and haunting the reader's psyche long after the book is put down. I still have the speaker's cries trailing me through my days: pluck me. pluck me. pluck me. pluck me. --Anne Champion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the way we talk / about fathers, says the speaker in Lisa Marie Basile's Apocryphal, recreating a dark new mythology of family history and trauma, womanhood, and sexuality. As the title of Basile's book indicates, mystery and (self)doubt are at the heart of the narrative from memories painted as unreliable to the stories we tell ourselves in the face of trauma to the ways we rebuild ourselves out of those shadowy spaces. Basile relies on vintage snapshot images and a smoky dreamlike setting to recreate and at times deny an identity grounded in a brutal past, a speaker who was born of the kind of love / that sneaks up on you, and who claims, I want to haunt your history / like you've haunted mine. --Mary Stone Dockery&lt;br /&gt;About the Author&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa Marie Basile in a NYC-based poet. She is also the author of the chapbooks Andalucia (The Poetry Society of NY) and triste (Dancing Girl Press). She is the founding editor of Luna Luna, a diary of art, sex and culture, and helps curate a musicopoetics performance show, Diorama. She is the NY editor and a writing instructor for The Doctor T. J. Eckleburg Review, an online and print literary and arts journal housed at The Johns Hopkins University M. A. in Writing Program. A graduate of The New School s MFA program, she has been named a top contemporary NYC poet to read by several publications.</description>

  <description>Cara Vineyard lives a quiet life in rural North Carolina. She works for an emerging brewery, drives her truck late at night, and lives with her mother on a former pumpkin farm. Her mother is proud of her and keeps a wall displaying all of Cara’s accomplishments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cara isn’t so much proud as she is bored. She’s revitalized when she meets Jackson Price, a pharmacist in Raleigh. Every day they spend together, she falls for him a little more — which in turn makes her life more complicated. When Cara goes on her late-night drives, she often picks up men. Those men tend to die. And when Cara comes back to the farm, she brings a memento for her mother to add to her wall of accomplishments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cara’s mother loves her no matter what. But she doesn’t know if Jackson will feel the same — and she doesn’t want to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“If King’s Carrie had turned into a serial killer, and your setting was the backwoods country life, you’d have Without Condition. It’s a murderous mayhem of revenge and fix culminating in horrifying shows of unconditional love. I’ll never look at a beat-up old truck without apprehension again.” – Erin Al-Mehairi, author of Breathe. Breathe.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>A murdered child predator surfaces in a New Jersey bog. Authorities in Pennsylvania and Ohio find more dead deviants days later as a vigilante weaves a trail of orchestrated slaughter through states along Route 80 to California. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;FBI Special Agents Patti Moreland and Nick Redmond track Internet predators in Chicago. After a failed attempt on Redmond's life, the FBI thinks one of his past collars pulled the trigger, but Moreland, a child-abuse survivor, believes otherwise. The young agent hacks his laptop and decrypts a sexually charged chat transcript between Redmond and a teenage girl logged hours before his shooting. Moreland learns of the murders in other states and sees a connection to her partner. She can’t fathom Redmond being like one of the men who scarred her life, and knows of only one way to disprove it: find the killer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt;"The Highwayman by Matt Manochio is a quick-paced trek through the dark underbelly of every parent's worst nightmare. Readers will quake, but they won't be able to put it down. Before it's over, they'll find themselves questioning their notions of retribution and justice. Manochio is a writer to watch." -- Jim DeFelice, author of Leopards Kill &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“This debut thriller is literate and chilling, a can’t-put-it-down combo of elegant prose and believable characters.” -- Jane K. Cleland, Author of SILENT AUCTION &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"A fascinating and spellbinding thriller complete with a gripping ending. Manochio gives his readers an exciting and highly readable foray into the sleazy world of on-line predators, their innocent victims, and the interplay of FBI agents and vigilantes seeking their own brand of retribution, He combiner a reporter's eye for detail with a crime sleuth's inquiry into the underworld of perversion. A must read for any true crime buff." -- James M. O'Kane, Ph.D, Author of: THE CROOKED LADDER: GANGSTERS, ETHNICITY AND THE AMERICAN DREAM</description>

  <description>Autumn Christian's third novel is a dark journey of self-discovery. An existential labyrinth of love, sex, and self-actualization where the only way out is through. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When high schooler Beverly Sykes finally has sex, her whole life changes. She feels an explosion inside of her that feels like her DNA is being rearranged, and she discovers a strange power within. After chasing that transcendent feeling and fucking her way through the good, the bad, and the dangerous boys and girls that cross her path, Beverly notices that all of her ex-lovers are undergoing drastic changes. She witnesses them transcending their former flawed selves, becoming self-actualized and strong. Beverly gives herself over and over to others, but can she become who she is supposed to be, with the gift and curse that nature gave to her? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Girl Like a Bomb is a journey through the gratifying, delicious, and sometimes-vicious horror show of having a body — particularly a femme body. This is a book of blood and guts, of humanity and brokenness, woven by passages of beauty and smart storytelling. Salacious &amp;amp; sea-deep, this is a book for readers who are hungry for both a party and meaning.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lisa Marie Basile, author of Light Magic for Dark Times and Nympholepsy &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Girl Like a Bomb is a book like a bomb -- explosive, heavy and dangerous. A must read by an exciting new voice." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Brian Keene, author of The Rising and Pressure &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Fun, fast, and fascinating. GIRL LIKE A BOMB hooked me and held me.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;New York Times Bestseller, Peter Clines, author of Paradox Bound &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Into every generation a Slayer is born…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina and her twin sister, Artemis, are far from normal. It’s hard to be when you grow up at the Watcher’s Academy, which is a bit different from your average boarding school. Here teens are trained as guides for Slayers—girls gifted with supernatural strength to fight the forces of darkness. But while Nina’s mother is a prominent member of the Watcher’s Council, Nina has never embraced the violent Watcher lifestyle. Instead she follows her instincts to heal, carving out a place for herself as the school medic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the day Nina’s life changes forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Buffy, the famous (and infamous) Slayer that Nina’s father died protecting, Nina is not only the newest Chosen One—she’s the last Slayer, ever. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Nina hones her skills with her Watcher-in-training, Leo, there’s plenty to keep her occupied: a monster fighting ring, a demon who eats happiness, a shadowy figure that keeps popping up in Nina’s dreams…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it’s not until bodies start turning up that Nina’s new powers will truly be tested—because someone she loves might be next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is clear: Being Chosen is easy. Making choices is hard.</description>

      <![CDATA["But monsters never respected endings in real life." <br /><br />Slayer was my first book by Kiersten White, and I enjoyed it! I wasn't entirely sure how I was going to feel about this book being set in the Buffy universe, but I feel like it worked well for a spin-off. It's set at a school in Ireland for Wat...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A dazzling, razor-sharp debut novel about a woman whose obsession with the beautiful actress on her block drives her to the edge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’ve never crossed their little fenced-in garden, of course. I stand on the sidewalk in front of the fern-and-ivy-filled planter that hangs from the fence—placed there as a sort of screen, I’m sure—and have a direct line of view into the kitchen at night. I’m grateful they’ve never thought to install blinds. That’s how confident they are. No one would dare stand in front of our house and watch us, they think. And they’re probably right: except for me. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this taut and thrilling debut, an unraveling woman, unhappily childless and recently separated, becomes fixated on her neighbor—the &lt;i&gt;actress. &lt;/i&gt;The unnamed narrator can’t help noticing with wry irony that, though she and the actress live just a few doors apart, a chasm of professional success and personal fulfillment lies between them. The actress, a celebrity with her face on the side of every bus, shares a gleaming brownstone with her handsome husband and their three adorable children, while the narrator, working in a dead-end job, lives in a run-down, three-story walk-up with her ex-husband’s cat.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When an interaction with the actress at the annual block party takes a disastrous turn, what began as an innocent preoccupation spirals quickly, and lethally, into a frightening and irretrievable madness. Searing and darkly witty, &lt;i&gt;Looker &lt;/i&gt;is enormously entertaining—at once a propulsive Hitchcockian thriller and a fearlessly original portrait of the perils of envy.</description>

  <description>You don't read the book. It reads you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumors of a deadly book have been floating around the dark corners of the deep web. A disturbing tale about a mysterious figure who preys on those who read the book and subjects them to a world of personalized terror. Jesse Wheeler--former guitarist of the heavy metal group The Rising Dead--was quick to discount the ominous folklore associated with the book. It takes more than some urban legend to frighten him. Hell, reality is scary enough. Seven years ago his greatest responsibility was the nightly guitar solo. Then one night when Jesse was blackout drunk, he accidentally injured his son, leaving him permanently disabled. Dreams of being a rock star died when he destroyed his son's future. Now he cuts radio jingles and fights to stay clean. But Jesse is wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The legend is real--and tonight he will become the protagonist in an elaborate scheme specifically tailored to prey on his fears and resurrect the ghosts from his past. Jesse is not the only one in danger, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By reading the book, you have volunteered to participate in the author's deadly game, with every page drawing you closer to your own personalized nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real horror doesn't begin until you reach the end. That's when the evil comes for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flame Tree Press is the new fiction imprint of Flame Tree Publishing. Launched in 2018 the list brings together brilliant new authors and the more established; the award winners, and exciting, original voices.</description>

  <description>J is a student at a school deep in a forest far away from the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; J is one of only twenty-six students, all of whom think of the school’s enigmatic founder as their father. J’s peers are the only family he has ever had. The students are being trained to be prodigies of art, science, and athletics, and their life at the school is all they know—and all they are allowed to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But J suspects that there is something out there, beyond the pines, that the founder does not want him to see, and he’s beginning to ask questions. What is the real purpose of this place? Why can the students never leave? And what secrets is their father hiding from them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Meanwhile, on the other side of the forest, in a school very much like J’s, a girl named K is asking the same questions. J has never seen a girl, and K has never seen a boy. As K and J work to investigate the secrets of their two strange schools, they come to discover something even more mysterious: each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An impossible-to-put-down domestic thriller about secrets and revenge, told from the perspectives of a husband and wife who are the most perfect, and the most dangerous, match for each other&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Rebecca didn’t know love was possible until she met Paul, a successful, charismatic, married man with a past as dark as her own. Their pain drew them together with an irresistible magnetism; they sensed that they were each other’s ideal (and perhaps only) match.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But twenty years later, Paul and Rebecca are drowning as the damage and secrets that ignited their love begin to consume their marriage. Paul is cheating on Rebecca, and his affair gets messy fast. His mistress is stalking them with growing audacity when Rebecca discovers Paul’s elaborate plan to build a new life without her. And though Rebecca is spiraling into an opiate addiction, it doesn’t stop her from coming up with a devious plot of her own, and this one could end absolutely everything.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; What follows is an unpredictable and stylish game of cat and mouse—a shocking tale of unfaithfulness and unreliability that will keep you racing until the final twist and make you wonder how well you really know your spouse.</description>

  <description>Since 1985, over 500 overweight teenagers have come to Camp Wašíču, looking to lose weight, gain self-confidence, and turn their lives around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillip McCracken arrives, weighing in at almost 400 pounds, but the baggage he carries from the past affects him much more deeply than the numbers of the scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a homicidal maniac hell-bent on revenge attacks, Phillip will be forced to either find the courage to save the people around him or fall victim to his own self-doubt… &lt;br /&gt;… and possibly a machete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with allusions to the Slasher films of yesteryear, Fat Camp delivers horror, humor, and a little slice of nostalgia for anyone who grew up even slightly afraid of the dark.</description>

  <description>In an isolated college town in the hills of Southern California, a freshman girl stumbles into her dorm room, falls asleep—and doesn’t wake up. She sleeps through the morning, into the evening. Her roommate, Mei, cannot rouse her. Neither can the paramedics who carry her away, nor the perplexed doctors at the hospital. Then a second girl falls asleep, and then another, and panic takes hold of the college and spreads to the town. As the number of cases multiplies, classes are canceled, and stores begin to run out of supplies. A quarantine is established. The National Guard is summoned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mei, an outsider in the cliquish hierarchy of dorm life, finds herself thrust together with an eccentric, idealistic classmate. Two visiting professors try to protect their newborn baby as the once-quiet streets descend into chaos. A father succumbs to the illness, leaving his daughters to fend for themselves. And at the hospital, a new life grows within a college girl, unbeknownst to her—even as she sleeps. A psychiatrist, summoned from Los Angeles, attempts to make sense of the illness as it spreads through the town. Those infected are displaying unusual levels of brain activity, more than has ever been recorded. They are dreaming heightened dreams—but of what?</description>

  <description>Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A standalone romantic thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover.</description>

  <description>All myths have a kernel of truth. The truth is: vampires are real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’ve always been here, but only came out of hiding in the last century. They are not what Hollywood would have you believe. They are not what is written in lore or whispered by the superstitious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look and act like humans. They live and love and die like humans. Puberty is just a bit more stressful for those with the recessive gene. And while some teenagers worry about high school, others dread their next set of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vampires are real, but in a social climate still struggling to accept that truth, do teeth alone make them monsters?</description>

  <description>On her way to Utah to see her dying mother, college student Darby Thorne gets caught in a fierce blizzard in the mountains of Colorado. With the roads impassable, she’s forced to wait out the storm at a remote highway rest stop. Inside, are some vending machines, a coffee maker, and four complete strangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to find a signal to call home, Darby goes back out into the storm . . . and makes a horrifying discovery. In the back of the van parked next to her car, a little girl is locked in an animal crate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is the child? Why has she been taken? And how can Darby save her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no cell phone reception, no telephone, and no way out. One of her fellow travelers is a kidnapper. But which one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped in an increasingly dangerous situation, with a child’s life and her own on the line, Darby must find a way to break the girl out of the van and escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But who can she trust?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In a manor by the sea, twelve sisters are cursed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annaleigh lives a sheltered life at Highmoor, a manor by the sea, with her sisters, their father, and stepmother. Once they were twelve, but loneliness fills the grand halls now that four of the girls' lives have been cut short. Each death was more tragic than the last—the plague, a plummeting fall, a drowning, a slippery plunge—and there are whispers throughout the surrounding villages that the family is cursed by the gods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disturbed by a series of ghostly visions, Annaleigh becomes increasingly suspicious that the deaths were no accidents. Her sisters have been sneaking out every night to attend glittering balls, dancing until dawn in silk gowns and shimmering slippers, and Annaleigh isn't sure whether to try to stop them or to join their forbidden trysts. Because who—or what—are they really dancing with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Annaleigh's involvement with a mysterious stranger who has secrets of his own intensifies, it's a race to unravel the darkness that has fallen over her family—before it claims her next.</description>

  <description>"A castle, a killer, and prey all bound and blurred by lust and blood."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many before her that have never come back, she's made it to the Countess' castle determined to snuff out the horror, but she could never be prepared for what hides within its turrets; what unfurls under its fluttering flags. Emily Carroll has fashioned a rich gothic horror charged with eroticism that doesn't just make your skin crawl, it crawls into it.</description>

      <![CDATA[3.5⭐ rounded up to 4⭐ because it was enjoyable<br /><br />This is a tough review to write. I loved most of The Haunting of Henderson Close. This book is set in Scotland at a haunted tourist attraction - Henderson Close is a street that was closed, and then built over. The street is underground, a...]]>

  <description>He’s run away from home. That’s what they say every time one of Charley Winslow’s friends vanishes from The Old Cross School for Boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s just a tall tale. That’s what they tell Charley when he sees the ragged grey figure stalking the abbey halls at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Charley follows his pet insects to a pool of blood behind a false wall, he could run and let those stones bury their secrets. He could assimilate, focus on his studies, and wait for his father to send for him. Or he could walk the dark tunnels of the school’s heart, scour its abandoned passages, and pick at the scab of a family’s legacy of madness and murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of Sam Forster, the school’s gardener, and Matron Grace, the staff nurse, Charley unravels Old Cross’ history and exposes a scandal stretching back to when the school was a home with a noble family and a dark secret—a secret that still haunts its halls with scraping steps, twisting its bones into a new generation of nightmares.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Fifteen more chilling tales of Yuletide terror, collected from rare Victorian periodicals&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the popularity of Charles Dickens’s &lt;i&gt;A Christmas Carol&lt;/i&gt; (1843), Victorian newspapers and magazines frequently featured ghost stories at Christmas time, and reading them by candlelight or the fireside became an annual tradition. This second volume of Victorian Christmas ghost stories contains fifteen tales, most of which have never been reprinted. They represent a mix of the diverse styles and themes common to Victorian ghost fiction and include works by once-popular authors like Grant Allen and Eliza Lynn Linton as well as contributions from anonymous or wholly forgotten writers. This volume also features a new introduction by Prof. Allen Grove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“At first I was aware only of a bluish, misty, phosphorescent light, and then a ghastly terror, that froze the very blood in my veins, seized me, for suddenly I saw rise up out of the inky darkness the form of a man—the eyes of a hideous red, fixed on mine with a look of hate ...” - Coulson Kernahan, “Haunted!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“As I stood in breathless horror, unable to stir a limb, the figure raised its arm, a skeleton hand emerged from the heavy folds of the cloak, and touched my elbow. A scorching pain shot through me, I uttered a shriek——” - Emily Arnold, “The Ghost of the Treasure-Chamber”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Again that shudder passed through his body, and again he unwillingly met the glance of those diabolical eyes upon the scroll. Horror of horrors! was the face alive, or was he going mad?” - Anonymous, “The Weird Violin”</description>
