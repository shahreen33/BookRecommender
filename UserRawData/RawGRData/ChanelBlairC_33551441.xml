  <description>A night of seduction and pleasure in exchange for vital information.&lt;br /&gt;Caro never should have consented to such a foolish agreement.&lt;br /&gt;Now she’s on the run for her life with the very being who put her at risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sethios saw Caro as a challenge to be conquered.&lt;br /&gt;Something new to play with, to pass the time.&lt;br /&gt;But their mutual arrangement created a consequence neither of them anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the seer knows all.&lt;br /&gt;She predicts the future.&lt;br /&gt;And her newest prophecy changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How far will Caro and Sethios go to protect their destiny and the fate of their unborn child?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author Note: Blood Bonds is a prequel to the Immortal Curse series. There are significant series related spoilers in this novel, therefore it is listed as book 5. However, it still provides a unique introduction to the world and could technically be read first. It would just provide early answers to some of the burning questions raised in books 1-4.</description>

  <description>New York Times Bestselling author Samantha Young writing as S. Young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thea Quinn has no idea what she is. All she knows is that her abilities have been a plague upon her life since she was a child. After years of suffering at the hands of a megalomaniac, Thea escaped and has been on the run ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leadership and protection of his pack are of the utmost importance to Conall MacLennan, Alpha and Chief of Clan MacLennan, the last werewolf pack in Scotland. Which is why watching his sister slowly die of a lycanthropic disease is emotional torture. When Conall is approached by a businessman who offers a cure for his sister in exchange for the use of Conall’s rare tracking ability, Conall forges an unbreakable contract with him. He has to find and retrieve the key to the cure: dangerous murderer, Thea Quinn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thea’s attempts to evade the ruthless werewolf are not only thwarted by the Alpha, but by outside dangers. With no choice but to rely on one another for survival, truths are revealed, intensifying a passionate connection they both fight to resist. At war with themselves and each other, Conall and Thea’s journey to Scotland forces them to face a heartrending choice between love and betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;War of Hearts&lt;/i&gt; is a standalone paranormal romance.</description>

  <description>They've had multiple lives together, but this may be their last. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a neurologist, Nick Reilly believes everything can be explained by science. &lt;br /&gt;But he can’t explain her—Quinn Stewart, an irresistible patient who knows things about him she shouldn’t. And insists that at some point, she was his wife. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Something else he can’t explain: he remembers her too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Quinn wakes each morning remembering new details of the life they shared. She’s desperate for the dreams to stop. With each one, she finds herself craving what she had with Nick more than the life—and the fiancé—she already has. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nick and Quinn share an attraction neither can deny, but one that might destroy everything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just like it did before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Everything from how the Elders met, to Balthazar’s version of an engagement party…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alik: No. I’m not participating in this nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Balthazar: It’s about damn time. And ignore Alik. He’ll be tagging along for the ride. Pun intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eli: Ah, memories. How I miss being among the living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jayson: Oh f*ck. I hope Lizzie never reads this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucian: Will there be waffles in Brazil?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Balthazar: Yes. And sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucian: Obviously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issac: I’m not an Elder. Therefore, I’m not a necessary voice for this insanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Balthazar: That’s cute, Wakefield. We all know you wish you were one of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucian: Shall we begin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Balthazar: Absolutely.</description>

  <description>Where family expectations extend beyond the grave... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Doug Nelson has been working hard to get everything ready for his first Samhain—the most important holiday on the necromancer calendar. Doug has renovated his family home and banished an unsavory ancestor who possessed his brother. Unfortunately, Doug hasn’t been able to banish Declan’s in-laws who hold Declan responsible for his wife’s murder. Now they’re threatening to send their most feared family member, Mona Dunstan, to investigate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As an Element, Era Brant has never been one to take an active role in the magical community, but when Mona arrives, looking to frame Declan for murder, Era decides it’s time to change that. Though she broke off her budding relationship with Doug, Era can’t abandon him or his brother. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Doug welcomes Era’s help, hoping that by working together, they can move past their differences. It would be a sound plan if not for one small detail: Doug is expected to display his necromantic power on Samhain and make a man a lich. Though the man is willing, Doug knows that if he goes through with it, he will lose Era forever. But a display of power might be just what he needs to silence the Dunstans and save his family.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Wings of silver. Wings of blue. Mortal heart. Broken dreams. Shatter. Shatter. Shatter. A sundering. A grave. I see the end. I see. . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world is in chaos as the power surge of the Cascade rises to a devastating crescendo. In furiously resisting its attempts to turn Elena into a vessel for Raphael’s power, Elena and her archangel are irrevocably changed. . .far beyond the prophecy of a cursed Ancient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, violent and eerie events around the world threaten to wipe out entire populations. And in the Archangel Lijuan’s former territory, an unnatural fog weaves through the land, leaving only a bone-chilling silence in its wake. Soon it becomes clear that even the archangels are not immune to this deadly evil. This time, even the combined power of the Cadre may not be enough. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This war could end them all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Once you sip the Nectar of the gods, there’s no going back.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Leda Pierce is working as a paranormal bounty hunter on the Frontier, the dividing line between human civilization and the plains of monsters. Life is simple and the pay modest, but at least she has her family. That is, until a vampire hunt goes wrong and her brother goes missing, captured by the dark angels of hell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With no magical powers of her own and no way to find him, Leda’s only option is to go to New York and join the Legion of Angels, an elite unit of supernatural soldiers with powers gifted to them by the gods themselves. If she can survive long enough to make it up the ranks, she will gain the magic she needs to find her brother. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Leda soon finds herself on the wrong side of a conspiracy that will shake up the supernatural world—and at the mercy of a fiercely powerful and tempting angel.</description>

  <description>Exile never felt so good. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom’s a trained sniper, not a babysitter. He kills rogue immortals for a living, but after releasing classified information to a friend, he’s banished to a remote location with the CRF’s most prized asset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can two tortured souls find solace and love in one another?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secrets unfold as Tom forms a forbidden relationship with his new charge. The immortal woman evokes memories and feelings long forgotten, and forces him to question everything he’s ever known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sacrifices must be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A rash decision sends them both running for their lives as immortal enemies vie for their heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some bonds are meant to be broken. . .</description>

  <description>Astasiya Davenport's best friend is dead. No, not just dead--murdered. Burned alive. Decapitated. And the only one who can help her figure out what happened is a demon masquerading as a billionaire playboy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because that happens in real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet Astasiya has always known the supernatural exists. Not the kind in fairy tales or happily-ever-afters, but the kind that kills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issac Wakefield knows the rules--when you find a fledgling immortal in the city, you kill her. Except Astasiya intrigues him with her uncanny abilities, marking her as too useful for death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With revenge on his mind, he strikes up an agreement with her instead, one that'll benefit them both. But as complications arise, secrets unravel, initiating a lethal game that threatens both of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loyalties will be tested.&lt;br /&gt;Bonds will be made.&lt;br /&gt;And a forbidden love will rise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the Immortal Curse world, where angels and vampires are redefined and Seraphim reign.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A marriage of convenience and three nights a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s all the sultry, self-made billionaire wants from the impoverished prince. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And at the end of the year, she’ll grant him his divorce…with a settlement large enough to save his beloved kingdom.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Latinx woman, Roxanne Medina has conquered small-town bullies, Ivy League snobs and boardrooms full of men. She’s earned the right to mother a princess and feel a little less lonely at the top. The offer she’s made is more than generous, and when the contract’s fulfilled, they’ll both walk away with everything they’ve ever wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Príncipe&lt;/em&gt; Mateo Ferdinand Juan Carlos de Esperanza y Santos is one of the top winegrowers in the world, and he’s not marrying and having a baby with a stranger. Even if the millions she’s offering could save his once-legendary wine-producing principality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the successful, single-minded beauty uses a weapon prince Mateo hadn’t counted on: his own desire.</description>

      <![CDATA[Being a huge reader of romantic fantasy and its subgenres, it's rare for me to grab a contemporary romance based off of early reader reviews I came across on social media. None of my libraries had it when it came out so I requested it and got lucky when one of them bought the book. The story is a...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From #1 New York Times bestselling author Ilona Andrews comes an enthralling new trilogy set in the Hidden Legacy world, where magic means power, and family bloodlines are the new currency of society…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world where magic is the key to power and wealth, Catalina Baylor is a Prime, the highest rank of magic user, and the Head of her House. Catalina has always been afraid to use her unique powers, but when her friend’s mother and sister are murdered, Catalina risks her reputation and safety to unravel the mystery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But behind the scenes powerful forces are at work, and one of them is Alessandro Sagredo, the Italian Prime who was once Catalina’s teenage crush. Dangerous and unpredictable, Alessandro’s true motives are unclear, but he’s drawn to Catalina like a moth to a flame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help her friend, Catalina must test the limits of her extraordinary powers, but doing so may cost her both her House–and her heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The first novel in a sparkling and sexy new contemporary romance series about four best friends looking for love in all the right places—and the one woman who discovers that it takes more than an impeccable bedside manner to make dreams come true…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren Hastings is finally ready to enter the real world. At twenty-six, she’s about to get her master’s in psychology, and she’s well on her way to beginning the career of her dreams—until she suffers public humiliation and has to endure something she thought she’d never have to deal with again: a part-time job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gig at Trinity Hospital isn’t exactly Lauren’s definition of a good time, but Dr. Scott Jacobs quickly changes her mind. He’s straight-up gorgeous, and he always gets what he wants. And that includes Lauren. It’s an ideal arrangement for both of them. No strings. Just fun—at least at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But feelings quickly begin to run deeper than either Lauren or Scott is willing to admit, causing issues neither of them want to confront. After all, who wants to risk the perfect relationship on something as terrifying, as messy, and as unpredictable as love?</description>

  <description>Bianca von Hasenberg did her duty for High House von Hasenberg and ended up trapped in a terrible marriage. When her husband dies unexpectedly and leaves her a happy widow, she vows never to marry again. Instead, she uses her connections to save other young women. Information is power and Bianca has a network that would be the envy of the ’verse—if anyone knew about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an attack, Bianca’s oldest brother, the House von Hasenberg heir, disappears from Earth without a trace. Determined to find him, Bianca leaves against orders. When she refuses to return, her father sends Ian Bishop, the director of House von Hasenberg security, to haul her home like a recalcitrant child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bianca leads Ian on a merry chase across the universe, but when their paths finally collide, she persuades him that they would be far more successful at finding her brother if they worked together. She will do anything to save her sibling, even if it means spending time alone on a small ship with the handsome, infuriating man who once broke her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As clues lead them deep into rival House Rockhurst territory, Bianca must decide if she can trust Ian with the one piece of information that could destroy her completely. . .</description>

  <description>Alternative Cover Edition of ASIN B072YXCNK1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you live in a place where “turbo speed” internet is a slight step above dial-up, men carry on nine-year beard-growing challenges out of stubborn pride, and your brothers do things like nail all your panties to the outside of your cabin just for funsies, you tend to be a little crazy. You can call it a "locational" hazard, if you will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s Tomahawk for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We rank people based on just how crazy they are. And the four craziest families in town are called the Wild Ones. &lt;br /&gt;I’m on the bottom tier of those, so technically I’m not as crazy as the other Wild Ones. In fact, if it wasn’t for my brothers and their endless antics, I wouldn’t be considered a Wild One at all. Ahem. Sure. We’ll go with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have a best friend who endures it all with me. Benson Nolans is my one, constant favorite person.&lt;br /&gt;Without him, I’d probably go really crazy, and not the fun kind. It’d be ridiculous, after three years of a flawless friendship, to mess that all up by falling for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, even if we did get a little too close one night, it’d be reckless endangerment. Even if we did suddenly feel the chemistry that’s always been there and stop toeing the line, it’d be a foolish risk to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’d be stupid to start hoping a really fun, but completely irrational, night with zero inhibitions might accidentally happen.&lt;br /&gt;Really stupid… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*NO cliffhanger&lt;br /&gt;*Stand-alone book &lt;br /&gt;*Sexual Content&lt;br /&gt;*Adult language&lt;br /&gt;*Completely, 100% crazy</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It's against the law for elves and humans to fall in love. But laws can be broken.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Venick is caught wandering the elflands, he knows the penalty is death. Desperate, he lies about his identity in hopes the elves will spare his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ellina doesn't trust the human, and not merely because he speaks the language of men. Men lie. In elvish, however, lying is impossible. In a moment of intuition, Ellina decides to give Venick a chance: learn elvish, reveal his truths, and she will set him free. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That is not, of course, what happens. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Ellina and Venick grow to know one another, their feelings start to shift. Then Venick uncovers a dark secret, and suddenly the fate of the elflands seems to rest in his hands. But every choice comes with consequences, and Venick must decide if it's worth risking his life to protect a race that hates him, all to save an elf he's not allowed to love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Magic, love and fate collide in this fantasy adventure from S.G. Prince. For readers who love fast-paced action with a side of romance, Elvish is the first novel in the Elvish Trilogy.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The war everyone thought was over is just beginning.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kira Forrest is a survivor. She’s risen above the pain of her beginnings to become a war hero only to leave it all behind in the pursuit of a simple life. Now a salvager, she makes a living sifting through the wreckage of dead alien ships from a war that nearly brought humanity to its knees. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After her ship takes damage, she’s forced to re-route to a space station where her past and present collide with dangerous consequences. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kira’s existence holds the key to a faltering peace treaty with the Tuann—a technologically advanced alien race who dislikes and distrusts all humans. Winning her freedom should be easy, but a powerful and relentless Tuann warrior stands in her way. Deceiving him seems impossible, especially when he strays dangerously close to secrets she struggles to hide. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Kira reconcile the pain of her past with the possibilities of her future? The fate of two races depends on her success.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Charlie, a highly-strung, openly gay over-thinker, and Nick, a cheerful, soft-hearted rugby player, meet at a British all-boys grammar school. Friendship blooms quickly, but could there be something more...?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie Spring is in Year 10 at Truham Grammar School for Boys. The past year hasn't been too great, but at least he's not being bullied anymore, and he's sort of got a boyfriend, even if he's kind of mean and only wants to meet up in secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Nelson is in Year 11 and on the school rugby team. He's heard a little about Charlie - the kid who was outed last year and bullied for a few months - but he's never had the opportunity to talk to him. That is, until the start of January, in which Nick and Charlie are placed in the same form group and made to sit together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They quickly become friends, and soon Charlie is falling hard for Nick, even though he doesn't think he has a chance. But love works in surprising ways, and sometimes good things are waiting just around the corner...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Solitaire&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Radio Silence&lt;/i&gt; comes a bind up of the first two chapters of Heartstopper, an &lt;a href="http://heartstoppercomic.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;ongoing webcomic&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

  <description>Fighting for love, honor, and freedom on the galaxy’s lawless outer rim… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Earth space marine Harper Adams finds herself abducted by alien slavers off a space station, her life turns into a battle for survival. Dumped into an arena on a desert planet on the outer rim, she finds herself face to face with a big, tattooed alien gladiator…the champion of the Kor Magna Arena. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A former prince abandoned to the arena as a teen, Raiden Tiago has long ago earned his freedom. Now he rules the arena, but he doesn’t fight for the glory, but instead for his own dark purpose—revenge against the Thraxian aliens who destroyed his planet. Then his existence is rocked by one small, fierce female fighter from an unknown planet called Earth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Harper is determined to find a way home, but when she spots her best friend in the arena—a slave of the evil Thraxian aliens—she’ll do anything to save her friend…even join forces with the tough, alpha male who sets her body on fire. But as Harper and Raiden step foot onto the blood-soaked sands of the arena, Harper worries that Raiden has his own dangerous agenda… &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A space princess on the run and a notorious outlaw soldier become unlikely allies in this imaginative, sexy space opera adventure—the first in an exciting science fiction trilogy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the far distant future, the universe is officially ruled by the Royal Consortium, but the High Councillors, the heads of the three High Houses, wield the true power. As the fifth of six children, Ada von Hasenberg has no authority; her only value to her High House is as a pawn in a political marriage. When her father arranges for her to wed a noble from House Rockhurst, a man she neither wants nor loves, Ada seizes control of her own destiny. The spirited princess flees before the betrothal ceremony and disappears among the stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ada eluded her father’s forces for two years, but now her luck has run out. To ensure she cannot escape again, the fiery princess is thrown into a prison cell with Marcus Loch. Known as the Devil of Fornax Zero, Loch is rumored to have killed his entire chain of command during the Fornax Rebellion, and the Consortium wants his head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the ship returning them to Earth is attacked by a battle cruiser from rival House Rockhurst, Ada realizes that if her jilted fiancé captures her, she’ll become a political prisoner and a liability to her House. Her only hope is to strike a deal with the dangerous fugitive: a fortune if he helps her escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when you make a deal with an irresistibly attractive Devil, you may lose more than you bargained for . . .</description>

  <description>Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A standalone romantic thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover.</description>

  <description>When a savage creature known only as the Adversary conquered the fabled lands of legends and fairy tales, all of the infamous inhabitants of folklore were forced into exile. Disguised among the normal citizens of modern-day New York, these magical characters have created their own peaceful and secret society within an exclusive luxury apartment building called Fabletown. But when Snow White's party-girl sister, Rose Red, is apparently murdered, it is up to Fabletown's sheriff, a reformed and pardoned Big Bad Wolf (Bigby Wolf), to determine if the killer is Bluebeard, Rose's ex-lover and notorious wife killer, or Jack, her current live-in boyfriend and former beanstalk-climber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collecting&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Fables&lt;/i&gt; 1-5</description>

  <description>This edition is out of print. For the current Kindle edition see &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48263366.Wolfsong" title="Wolfsong" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wolfsong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ox was twelve when his daddy taught him a very valuable lesson. He said that Ox wasn’t worth anything and people would never understand him. Then he left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ox was sixteen when he met the boy on the road, the boy who talked and talked and talked. Ox found out later the boy hadn’t spoken in almost two years before that day, and that the boy belonged to a family who had moved into the house at the end of the lane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ox was seventeen when he found out the boy’s secret, and it painted the world around him in colors of red and orange and violet, of Alpha and Beta and Omega.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ox was twenty-three when murder came to town and tore a hole in his head and heart. The boy chased after the monster with revenge in his bloodred eyes, leaving Ox behind to pick up the pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been three years since that fateful day—and the boy is back. Except now he’s a man, and Ox can no longer ignore the song that howls between them.</description>

      <![CDATA[So I came across this book browsing my Goodreads feed one day and I was drawn to the cover. My libraries did not have this book but if you have a Hoopla account, all of TJ Klune's books are there. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this is rated not only fantasy but an LGBT romance.

  <description>Callypso Lillis is a siren with a very big problem, one that stretches up her arm and far into her past. For the last seven years she’s been collecting a bracelet of black beads up her wrist, magical IOUs for favors she’s received. Only death or repayment will fulfill the obligations. Only then will the beads disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows that if you need a favor, you go to the Bargainer to make it happen. He’s a man who can get you anything you want... at a price. And everyone knows that sooner or later he always collects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for one of his clients, he’s never asked for repayment. Not until now. When Callie finds the fae king of the night in her room, a grin on his lips and a twinkle in his eye, she knows things are about to change. At first it’s just a chaste kiss—a single bead’s worth—and a promise for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Bargainer, it’s more than just a matter of rekindling an old romance. Something is happening in the Otherworld. Fae warriors are going missing one by one. Only the women are returned, each in a glass casket, a child clutched to their breast. And then there are the whispers among the slaves, whispers of an evil that’s been awoken. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the Bargainer has any hope to save his people, he’ll need the help of the siren he spurned long ago. Only, his foe has a taste for exotic creatures, and Callie just happens to be one.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In the first in Tessa Dare's captivating Castles Ever After series, a mysterious fortress is the setting for an unlikely love . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the daughter of a famed author, Isolde Ophelia Goodnight grew up on tales of brave knights and fair maidens. She never doubted romance would be in her future, too. The storybooks offered endless possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as she grew older, Izzy crossed them off. One by one by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;del&gt;Ugly duckling turned swan?&lt;br /&gt; Abducted by handsome highwayman?&lt;br /&gt; Rescued from drudgery by charming prince?&lt;/del&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, no, and… Heh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Izzy’s given up yearning for romance. She’ll settle for a roof over her head. What fairy tales are left over for an impoverished twenty-six year-old woman who’s never even been kissed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one.</description>

  <description>Captain Briar Rose is on a deadline. She has one week to deliver Grayson to Solon, the ferromancer behind so many of her problems. If she doesn’t arrive in time, Solon has promised to destroy her hometown. She’ll have to push hard to meet his arbitrary deadline, but it should be possible—if her cousin Andrew doesn’t get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew has been Briar’s nemesis since they were children, but now that he’s working for Solon, Andrew has become an even bigger problem. His insistence on meeting at every toll office is a hinderance, especially when her boat becomes a target for sabotage. Briar doesn’t have time for a pretentious cousin or a damaged boat, but her troubles don’t stop there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clock is ticking for Grayson as well. His devolvement is accelerating at an alarming rate and nothing they try seems to slow it. As Grayson struggles to remain the man he is, Briar begins to believe that time is her true enemy. Perhaps Solon’s deadline wasn’t so arbitrary after all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She's about to make a deal with the college bad boy...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah Wells has finally found someone who turns her on. But while she might be confident in every other area of her life, she's carting around a full set of baggage when it comes to sex and seduction. If she wants to get her crush's attention, she'll have to step out of her comfort zone and &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; him take notice... even if it means tutoring the annoying, childish, &lt;i&gt;cocky&lt;/i&gt; captain of the hockey team in exchange for a pretend date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;...and it's going to be oh so good.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Garrett Graham has ever wanted is to play professional hockey after graduation, but his plummeting GPA is threatening everything he's worked so hard for. If helping a sarcastic brunette make another guy jealous will help him secure his position on the team, he's all for it. But when one unexpected kiss leads to the wildest sex of both their lives, it doesn't take long for Garrett to realize that pretend isn't going to cut it. Now he just has to convince Hannah that the man she wants looks a lot like &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Cole Masten.&lt;/i&gt; Abandoned by his superstar wife, Hollywood’s Perfect Husband is now Hollywood’s Sexiest Bachelor: partying hard and screwing even harder. Watch out Los Angeles, there's a new bad boy in town. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Summer Jenkins.&lt;/i&gt; That’s me, a small town girl stuck in Quincy, Georgia. I cook some mean chicken and dumplins, can bluff a grown man out of his savings in poker, and was voted Most Friendly my senior year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were from different worlds. Our lives shouldn’t have collided. But then Cole Masten read a book about my small town. And six months later, his jet landed on our dusty airstrip, and he brought Hollywood with him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the start, I knew he was trouble. For our town. And for me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sometimes, opposites just aren’t meant to attract.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heartwarming and refreshing debut novel that proves one thing: there's not enough data in the world to predict what will make your heart tick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Lane thinks math is the only thing that unites the universe. She comes up with algorithms to predict customer purchases — a job that has given her more money than she knows what to do with, and way less experience in the dating department than the average thirty-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't help that Stella has Asperger's and French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth cleaned by pilot fish. Her conclusion: she needs lots of practice — with a professional. Which is why she hires escort Michael Phan. The Vietnamese and Swedish stunner can't afford to turn down Stella's offer, and agrees to help her check off all the boxes on her lesson plan — from foreplay to more-than-missionary position...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Stella not only learns to appreciate his kisses, but to crave all the other things he's making her feel. Soon, their no-nonsense partnership starts making a strange kind of sense. And the pattern that emerges will convince Stella that love is the best kind of logic...</description>

  <description>Blessed–or cursed–with a connection to the souls of others, Sloan Jordan can see the best in people… and the worst. For twenty-seven years, she's kept her ability a secret, but eleven young women have been murdered in the mountains of North Carolina, and Sloan may be the only hope of finding their killer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has just agreed to help Detective Nathan McNamara with the case, when a stranger—who is as alluring as he is terrifying—shows up at her doorstep with a dark past and another puzzling mystery: she can't see his soul at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Sloan is on the hunt for a deadly psychopath with two irresistible men. One of them would die for her, and the other would kill to keep her safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is an alternate cover edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27304591-the-soul-summoner" rel="nofollow"&gt;B015ZS7DSS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>No last names. No life stories. Those were the rules. Now a USA Today bestseller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time a cocky, copper-haired tourist sauntered into Zara’s bar. And even though she knew better, Zara indulged in a cure for the small-town blues. It was supposed to be an uncomplicated fling—a few sizzling weeks before he went back to his life, and she moved on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until an accidental pregnancy changed her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years later, she’s made peace with the notion that Dave From Brooklyn will never be found. Until one summer day when he walks into her coffee shop, leveling her with the same hot smile that always renders her defenseless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hockey star Dave Beringer has never forgotten the intense month he spent with prickly Zara. Their nights together were the first true intimacy he’d ever experienced. But the discovery of his child is the shock of a lifetime, and his ugly past puts relationships and family out of reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or does it? Vermont’s countryside has a way of nurturing even tortured souls. The fields and the orchards—and hard won love—are Bountiful.</description>

      <![CDATA[For some reason this just didn't have the feel of a True North book for me. It was a decent read but not as good as the rest in the series. It's the highly anticipated story of Zara because, if you read the other books in the series, she ends up pregnant and no one knows who the father is and she...]]>

  <description>There's a first time for everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lark Wainwright used to be fearless. Her life was a series of adventures, each one more exhilarating than the last. But her recent overseas adventure was one too many. Now she’s home and in one piece. Mostly. But her nights are filled with terror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her best friend offers her a stay at the orchard in exchange for help at the farmers’ markets, Lark jumps at the chance to spend fall in Vermont. But her nightmares don’t stop. Desperate to keep her fragile state a secret, she relies on the most soft-spoken resident of the Shipley Farm to soothe her when her dreams prove too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zachariah is a survivor, too. It’s been four years since he was tossed aside by the polygamist cult where he grew up. He’s found a peaceful existence on the Shipley’s farm, picking apples and fixing machinery. But getting thrown away by your own people at nineteen leaves a mark on a guy. He doesn’t always know what to make of a world where movie quotes are the primary means of communication. Before hitchhiking to Vermont, he’d never watched TV or spoken on the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, there are a lot of things he’s never done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zach and Lark slowly grow to trust one another. One night they become even closer than they’d planned. But Lark may still be too broken to trust anyone. When she pushes Zach away, he will have to prove to himself that he's good for much more than farm labor.</description>

  <description>She’s the only one who ever loved him—and the only one he can never have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jude lost everything one spring day when he crashed his car into an apple tree on the side of the road. A man is dead, and there's no way he can ever right that wrong. He’d steer clear of Colebury, Vermont forever if he could. But an ex-con in recovery for his drug addiction can’t find a job just anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Sophie Haines, coming face to face with the man who broke her heart is gut-wrenching. Suddenly, he’s everywhere she turns. It’s hard not to stare at how much he’s changed. The bad boy who used to love her didn’t have big biceps and sun-kissed hair. And he’d never turn up volunteer in the church kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She knows it’s foolish to yearn for the man who returned all the heartsick letters she wrote him in prison. But the looks he sends her now speak volumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one wants to see Sophie and Jude back together, least of all Sophie's police chief father. But it's a small town. And forbidden love is a law unto itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New cover edition found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46139013-bittersweet" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The new series is set in Vermont. True North is populated by the tough, outdoorsy mountain men that populate the Green Mountain State. They raise cows and they grow apples. They chop a lot of wood, especially when they need to blow off steam. (Beards are optional but encouraged.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the orchard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last person Griffin Shipley expects to find stuck in a ditch on his Vermont country road is his ex-hookup. Five years ago they’d shared a couple of steamy nights together. But that was a lifetime ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At twenty-seven, Griff is now the accidental patriarch of his family farm. Even his enormous shoulders feel the strain of supporting his mother, three siblings and a dotty grandfather. He doesn’t have time for the sorority girl who’s shown up expecting to buy his harvest at half price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vermont was never in Audrey Kidder’s travel plans. Neither was Griff Shipley. But she needs a second chance with the restaurant conglomerate employing her. Okay—a fifth chance. And no self-righteous lumbersexual farmer will stand in her way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re adversaries. They want entirely different things from life. Too bad their sexual chemistry is as hot as Audrey’s top secret enchilada sauce, and then some.</description>

  <description>Killers are after her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Computer security specialist for Red Stone Security, Elizabeth Martinez has never been able to turn her back on her brother Benny. When his risky lifestyle finally lands him in harm’s way, Elizabeth finds herself dragged into the dangerous underworld with him and into the path of one of Miami’s most dangerous drug lords. To stay alive, she now has to depend on the one man she has tried so desperately to forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’ll do anything to keep her safe…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former Marine Porter Caldwell never should have let Elizabeth walk away from him all those months ago. She means more to him than anything and now that she’s in danger and turned to him for help, he won’t make that mistake again. When a local gang targets her and she’s nearly killed in a drive by shooting, Porter vows to do whatever it takes to keep her alive. Even if it means turning his back on all that he’s sworn to uphold.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Return to New York Times bestselling author Nalini Singh’s darkly passionate Guild Hunter world, where human-turned-angel Elena Deveraux, consort to Archangel Raphael, is thrust center stage into an eons-old prophecy….&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Midnight and dawn, Elena’s wings are unique among angelkind…and now they’re failing. The first mortal to be turned into an immortal in angelic memory, she’s regressing. Becoming more and more human. Easier to hurt. Easier to kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elena and Raphael must unearth the reason for the regression before it’s too late and Elena falls out of the sky. Yet even as they fight a furious battle for Elena’s very survival, violent forces are gathering in New York and across the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In China, the Archangel Favashi is showing the first signs of madness. In New York, a mysterious sinkhole filled with lava swallows a man whole. In Africa, torrential monsoon rains flood rolling deserts. And in Elena’s mind whispers a haunting voice that isn’t her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, survival may not be possible…not even for the consort of an archangel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The only sure way to destroy a man is to take what he cannot live without.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years ago, I had everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A beautiful wife.&lt;br /&gt;A son.&lt;br /&gt;A reason for living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until a ruthless task force, assembled under Mayor Michael Culling, with a brutal strategy to make the streets of Detroit ‘safe’, ripped away everything I loved in a deadly hunt called &lt;i&gt;The Culling.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They tried to kill me, too. I wish they had. Now I'm cursed by the memories of that night, and the words I whispered to my dying wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A promise—to avenge the wrong and set it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m no longer Nick Ryder. I’m a masked vigilante. Faceless. Loveless. Fearless. A man with nothing left to lose—one who's seen the dark and violent truth behind the city’s flawless veneer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Culling doesn’t know who I am. Or what I want. All he knows is that I’ve kidnapped &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; beautiful wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An eye for an eye—isn’t that how the saying goes? And Aubree Culling is the perfect pawn to destroy him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If she doesn’t destroy me first.</description>

  <description>Having seen Grayson’s future, Briar is ready to meet his past…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captain Briar Rose has eluded the law, outwitted the soulless, and defeated a fully devolved ferromancer. Now she faces her biggest challenge yet. She must convince Esme, one of the females of the ferromancer race, to teach her how to use her own ferra magic. But nothing in the ferromancer world ever goes as Briar plans, and dealing with Esme is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Briar anticipated the woman’s arrogance and condescension, but she didn’t expect a lab full of macabre samples. It seems Grayson had left out a few details about Esme’s past, and the more Briar learns, the more she wants to punch the woman. But fisticuffs—warranted or not—aren’t an option. Not when Esme is her lone hope for finding some answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won’t be easy, but Briar must find a way to make this partnership work. Otherwise, she will never master her unique talent, or use it to save Grayson from his fate.</description>

  <description>Defeat the enemy. Win the boy. Live happily ever after. But life "ever after" isn't as easy as it used to be. Harper's gone from being a member of a small demon lair to co-Prime of one of the most powerful lairs in the US with a mate who, though hot as hell, is just a mite overprotective - I mean, you get kidnapped by dark practitioners just once ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one of Knox's demons goes rogue, and in his madness decides Knox Thorne must die. Harper's worried. Knox isn't - at least until he discovers his mate's willingness to get between him and danger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Knox has a new priority: Keep Harper safe ...no matter what it takes. But Harper begins to suspect there's more danger than one rogue demon. It seems the combined strength of Harper and Knox has upset the balance of power in the demon world and there are those who are determined to right that wrong. Because when you move up the food chain, sometimes the other predators just want to take a bigger bite.</description>

  <description>Part of a small demon lair in North Las Vegas, tattooist Harper Wallis lives a pretty simple life. That changes overnight when she discovers that her psychic mate, or ‘anchor’, is a guy who’s rumored to be the most powerful demon in existence. Compelling, full of secrets and armed with raw sexuality, Knox Thorne is determined to claim her as his anchor, creating a psychic bond that will prevent their inner demons from ever turning rogue. The billionaire also wants Harper in his bed. She’s not so sure she wants either of those things. No one seems to know what breed of demon Knox is, only that he’s more dangerous than anything she’s ever before encountered. But he refuses to walk away. And when an unknown danger starts closing in on Harper, it seems that Knox is the only one who can keep her safe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Prime of his Las Vegas lair and a successful businessman, Knox Thorne is used to being in control. He’s also used to people fearing and obeying him. Harper does neither, which unexpectedly amuses him. Unpredictable, elusive, and complex, she draws Knox and his inner demon like nothing ever has. Knox is used to getting what he wants, and he wants Harper. He’ll have her, and he’ll keep her safe from the threat that looms over her. Because Knox protects what’s his. He won’t allow anyone to take her from him. Even if it will mean letting the demon inside him rise and wreak the havoc it was created to make.</description>

  <description>Captain Bridget “Briar” Rose only wanted to stop the railroad’s expansion and save the canal life she loves. She didn’t intend to make herself and her crew outlaws, or stumble into a magical world she knew nothing about. And she certainly didn’t mean to damn a man, but that’s exactly what she did to Grayson, a brilliant railroad engineer who turned out to be much more than he seemed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To set matters straight, Briar is on her way to Cleveland to meet with a woman who may be able to help Grayson. But getting there won’t be easy. Wanted posters are everywhere, an old…friend is stalking Grayson, and he’s attracted the attention of the Scourge—the executioners of the ferromancer world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If she’s to keep Grayson safe, Briar must pretend to be his keeper. Which won’t be easy. Not when she knows so little about his world and her own newly discovered magic. Can she fool those who know that world so well? Or will Grayson pay the price for her failure?</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Cry Wolf&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Patricia Briggs started a new urban fantasy series set in the world of Mercy Thompson — but with rules of its own. Now, read "Alpha and Omega," the novella that inspired the new series, and see how it all began...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Latham never knew werewolves existed, until the night she survived a violent attack... and became one herself. After three years at the bottom of the Chicago pack, she's learned to keep her head down and never, ever trust dominant males. But when she discovers wrongdoing in her pack, she has to go above her Alpha's head to ask for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Cornick is the son — and enforcer — of the leader of the North American werewolves. Now his father has sent him to Chicago to clean up a problem there. Charles never expected to find Anna, a rare Omega wolf — and he certainly never expected to recognize her as his mate...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This novella was originally published in the anthology, &lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;On the Prowl.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>The heart-stopping final installment in New York Times bestselling author Molly McAdams’s Redemption series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My life has never been my own.

The minute I strayed, I lost everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I met Jessica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She swept into my life like a storm of heartache, seduction, and intrigue.

  <description>From New York Times bestselling author Molly McAdams comes a powerhouse romantic suspense that will have you questioning your morals and second guessing your view on love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a world few know exist. I’ve trained for this. I know what to say, what to do, and how to act. I’ve perfected the lethal calm required for this life. &lt;br /&gt;Now it’s time to buy my first girl. But all it takes is one look at the brave girl who starts singing mid-auction for that calm to slip.&lt;br /&gt;Briar Chapman is going to be the death of me, and I don’t care. I’ll take every day with her until that death comes, and I’ll welcome it when it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the outside, Lucas Holt is what nightmares are made of. A man cloaked in darkness, with sin-filled eyes and an enticing grin. A devil so devastatingly beautiful and cruel that his very presence instills fear.&lt;br /&gt;But beneath his terrifying, ever-calm exterior is an affectionate man haunted by a past that refuses to stay buried. And Lucas looks at me as though he’s finally found the only person who can make it all go away.&lt;br /&gt;We’re a battle of the brightest day and the darkest night—and I want to lie in the wake of our war.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The next captivating installment in New York Times bestselling author Molly McAdams’s Redemption series.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the Princess of the Irish-American Mob, there’s no shortage of men ready to help guard and protect me. To slowly suffocate me to the point of seeking freedom—a place where I can breathe.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kieran Hayes has been saving me for as long as I can remember. It’s in his blood, and one of the many reasons I fell in love with him. Until my favorite trait became his biggest flaw, making me resent the man I love. An unwavering warrior, his love for me has been shrouded by those instincts.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Save Lily. Protect Lily. Hide Lily. Cage Lily.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I wasn’t prepared for was Dare—the man who would set my world on fire with just one touch. He saw straight through to my soul, as though he knew I was desperate for freedom, and silently demanded my heart from the beginning.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And I didn’t expect Dare to be Demitri Borello—the reason for so many deaths in my family. A man who will take my life the moment he finds out who I am.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite it all, I’ll love him until that moment comes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A fire will die if there is no oxygen for it to consume. Ours is rapidly stealing every last breath we can sacrifice to it.</description>

  <description>Zoe is used to taking care of herself and has long ago accepted that if anything bad was going to happen, it was going to happen to her. So when she loses her job over something most bosses would probably be happy with and her life starts going down hill from there she doesn't expect it to get any better. She certainly didn't expect any help from the loud jerk next door, but then again she has nothing to lose so puts her trust in him and hopes for the best. What she didn't expect was the once in a lifetime opportunity that he offers her through an arrangement where they both benefit and no one is supposed to get hurt, but she should have known better because her luck has never been that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most Bradfords, Trevor has a soft spot for food, but that's about all. He leads a pretty straightforward life and likes to keep things simple and that includes his relationships. He wants the perfect woman and knows exactly what she'll be like. So when he discovers much to his horror that he's thinking about his frumpy little neighbor he decides the best way to get his head straight is by working her out of his system. He'll keep her around, but only until he finds perfection.</description>

  <description>Obsession, defined as the domination of one's thoughts or feelings by a persistent idea, image or desire....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chantel Rosenberg's passion for music and life had never shone brighter than the time she spent in Bordeaux France. It's a time when feelings arose and desires ran deep, a time that fundamentally changed her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man living in seclusion, Phillipe Tibideau is haunted and plagued by memories he cannot disregard. Choosing to live a quiet life in his Chateau surrounded by the vineyards of France, he's left his passion for art behind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the time has arrived to tell his side of a tale. A tale that has depicted him as a 'beautiful monster' and he's finally allowing someone close.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Close enough to ask questions. Questions he's not sure he wants to answer. Questions about her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For up and coming journalist Gemma Harris, the pursuit of truth is what drives her and when a job of a lifetime presents itself there is nothing in the world that will stop her from taking it. Even if it does mean leaving her home for several months to stay at Chateau Tibideau, with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a story of what happens when three passionate lovers collide and the desire for truth, art and music merge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chateau Tibideau is a place full of unanswered questions, dark sinful desire and a beauty so hauntingly sad it will have you wondering how you will ever leave the same....</description>

  <description>Indy Savage, cop's daughter, rock chick and used bookstore owner, has been in love with Lee Nightingale, once bad boy, now the man behind Nightingale Investigations, since she was five years old. No matter what ingenious schemes Indy used to capture his attention, Lee never showed an interest and Indy finally gave up. Now Indy's employee, Rosie, has lost a bag of diamonds and bad guys are shooting at him. When Indy gets involved, Lee is forced to help. Complicating matters, Lee has decided he's interested, Indy's decided she's not. But she can't seem to keep Lee out of her life when she's repeatedly stun gunned, kidnapped and there are car bombs exploding (not to mention she's finding dead bodies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indy's best bet is to solve the mystery of the diamonds before Lee. Lee's challenge is to keep Indy alive and, at the same time, win back her heart.</description>

Coldly interested only in the power his Bride will bring, he can hardly believe when Myst the Coveted awakens him body—and soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Seductress&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Famed throughout the world as the most beautiful Valkyrie, Myst has devoted her life to protecting a magical jewel and to fighting the vampires.Wroth provides her with the perfect opportunity to torment her sworn enemy—for with his new heartbeat comes a consuming sexual desire that can only be slaked by her. Denying him, she flees, struggling to forget his searing, possessive kiss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Hunt is on...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She eludes him for five years, but he has finally chased her to ground and stolen her enchanted jewel, giving him absolute power over her. Now that she’s his for the taking, he intends to make her experience first-hand the agonizing, unending lust she subjected him to for half a decade. Yet when Nikolai realizes he wants far more than vengeance from Myst and frees her, will she come back to him?</description>

I had high hopes going in but it turned out to be the complete opposite.<br /><br />The story begins with Wroth and his vampire ilk invading the castle of the demon Ivo when he comes across Myst in a jail cell...]]>

  <description>Solutions aren’t always black and white—sometimes they come in shades of iron gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captain Bridget “Briar” Rose wants for nothing. Each day is a new adventure, living the life she loves, running cargo on the Ohio &amp;amp; Erie Canal. That is, until her cousin decides to sell the family boat to finance a new business venture. He wants to build locomotives for the railroad—the very industry that could put the entire canal system out of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not one to give up without a fight, Briar does a little snooping into her cousin’s new business partner. When she gets a sneak peek at the locomotive plans, she suspects that the man is either a genius, or a ferromancer—one of the dreaded metal mages of Europe’s industrial revolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to reveal her suspicions, Briar takes the plans and heads for the newspaper office in Columbus, stealing the family boat in the process. Kidnapping her cousin’s handsome business partner wasn’t part of the plan, but when he shows up, demanding the return of his property, she can’t let him go. After all, if Briar can prove that the railroad is using ferromancy, she could save more than her boat. She could save her way of life.</description>

  <description>As a database programmer from Arizona and a fan of sedate, indoor activities, Indi Smith doesn’t belong in outer space. Certainly not in a star system with a broken wormhole gate and no way home. But through no fault of her own, that’s where she’s landed, and nobody on the ship, not even the genius chief engineer Hierax, knows how to repair the gate. The only clue that could help is an untranslatable transmission coming from an uninhabitable planet with no atmosphere. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Though she’s a fish out of water, Indi is determined to use her knack for analysis and recognizing patterns to decode the transmission and help Hierax fix the gate, whether he wants the assistance of some civilian woman or not. She refuses to die in the middle of nowhere, even if it means she has to prove her worth to an arrogant, know-it-all engineer. She’s had experience dealing with geeks, albeit not ones with such big, sexy muscles, but that doesn’t mean working with him will be easy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Chief Hierax is used to being in charge of all things mechanical, and he’s used to being the smartest person on the ship. Few of his burly Star Guardian colleagues were recruited for their brains. So when Indi shows up with a clever way of looking at the alien transmission, one he hadn’t thought of, he’s not sure what to make of it—or her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His focus should be on fixing the gate, but he finds himself speculating about romantic endeavors. Would she be interested in seeing his hobby projects or maybe his favorite tools? It’s hard to tell. He has a hard time understanding women—and people in general, for that matter—so charming her may be tougher than finding a way home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Star Guardians Series &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Orion &lt;br /&gt;Book 2: Treyjon &lt;br /&gt;Book 3: Sagitta &lt;br /&gt;Book 4: Hierax &lt;br /&gt;Book 5: Zakota (September) &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Enter New York Times bestselling author Nalini Singh’s breathtakingly passionate Guild Hunter world with the story of a woman who isn’t a vampire or an angel…or human…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once a broken girl known as Sorrow, Holly Chang now prowls the shadowy gray underground of the city for the angels. But it’s not her winged allies who make her a wanted woman—it’s the unknown power coursing through her veins. Brutalized by an insane archangel, she was left with the bloodlust of a vampire, the ability to mesmerize her prey, and a poisonous bite. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, someone has put a bounty on her head… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Venom is one of the Seven, Archangel Raphael’s private guard, and he’s as infuriating as he is seductive. A centuries-old vampire, his fangs dispense a poison deadlier than Holly’s. But even if Venom can protect Holly from those hunting her, he might not be able to save himself—because the strange, violent power inside Holly is awakening… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is safe.</description>

  <description>A highly infectious, deadly virus from the central African rain forest suddenly appears in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. There is no cure. In a few days 90 percent of its victims are dead. A secret military SWAT team of soldiers and scientists is mobilized to stop the outbreak of this exotic "hot" virus. &lt;i&gt;The Hot Zone&lt;/i&gt; tells this dramatic story, giving a hair-raising account of the appearance of rare and lethal viruses and their "crashes" into the human race. Shocking, frightening, and impossible to ignore, &lt;i&gt;The Hot Zone&lt;/i&gt; proves that truth really is scarier than fiction.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Librarian’s note: This is a previously-published edition of &lt;br /&gt;Kindle &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32829137-fatal-affair" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN: B003NX7C1G&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the morning of the most important vote of Senator John O’Connor’s career he is late—again. His best friend and chief of staff, Nick Cappuano sets off to O'Connor’s apartment expecting to roust him from bed and hoping he is alone. But what Nick finds is that O’Connor, the handsome, amiable Senator from Virginia, has been brutally murdered, and Nick’s world comes crashing down around him. Complicating the disaster, the detective assigned to the case is none other than Sam Holland, Nick’s one-night stand from six years earlier, the woman who broke his heart and haunts his dreams. With six years worth of unfinished business hanging between them and more than a few scores to settle personally and professionally, Nick and Sam set out to find the senator's killer while trying—and failing—to resist the overwhelming attraction between them that seems to have only grown over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soon becomes clear that the Senator’s past holds secrets that not only led to his death but now endanger Nick and Sam as well. Working together to find a killer and to rediscover the love they thought they lost long ago, they must put the past behind them and build a future that offers a world of new opportunities for both of them—including an offer from the Virginia Democrats for Nick to finish the last year of John’s term.</description>

  <description>The wealthy Glass family lost its patriarch, Benjamin Glass, sooner than expected. Benjamin’s widow, Olivia, and her 5 sons each react to his death in their own way while preparing for the reading of his will. Olivia receives a very unexpected confession from her late husband about one of their sons that could shatter the whole family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to revealing the secret to her children, Olivia must figure out which boy Ben refers to in the confession he left her in his will. While the family attorney searches for the mysterious Rowena Hector whom Ben says holds the answers, Olivia asks her sons to each spend a week with her as she isn’t ready to let go of the past. When Olivia visits her sons, she quickly learns that each one has been keeping his own secret from her. Olivia never expected her remaining years would be so complex and life-altering, but she will not rest until her family is reunited after Ben’s untimely death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all need family. We all want to fit in. We’re all a mix of quirky personalities. Will Olivia be able to fix them or will the whole family implode? What will she do when she discovers the son behind Ben’s secret? Check out this ensemble cast where each family member’s perspective is center stage, discovering along the way who might feel the biggest impact from all the secrets. Through various scenes and memories across a six-month period, you'll get to know everyone, learning how and why they made certain decisions. Welcome to being an honorary member of the Glass family where the flair for over-the-top drama pushes everyone to their limits.</description>

  <description>It was a desperate plan. But Mary Grace Winters knew the only way to save herself and her child from her abusive cop husband was to stage their own death. Now all that remains of their former life is at the bottom of a lake. Armed with a new identity in a new town, she and her son have found refuge hundreds of miles away. As Caroline Stewart, she has almost forgotten the nightmare she left behind nine years ago. She is even taking a chance on love with Max Hunter, a man with wounds of his own. But her past is about to collide with the present when her husband uncovers her trail and threatens her hard-won peace. Step by step, he's closing in on her—and everything and everyone she loves.</description>

  <description>Virginia Burch, a psychic archeologist, can't believe her luck when she meets Sam Gage, a ghost hunter and owner of prime real estate in the Old Quarters of Cadence, above the Dead City. He offers her his space to live and start up her business. What follows is an even more intriguing proposal-to become his wife. Strictly for professional reasons, of course. Their marriage of convenience would lead to a very lucrative business partnership, Gage &amp;amp; Burch Consulting. Until something throws a wrench into the plan: the undeniable sensual energy that naturally exists between them-and a love so strong that it could wake the ghosts below.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Mercenary Kate Daniels must risk all to protect everything she holds dear in this epic, can't-miss entry in the thrilling #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling urban-fantasy series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate has come a long way from her origins as a loner taking care of paranormal problems in post-Shift Atlanta. She's made friends and enemies. She's found love and started a family with Curran Lennart, the former Beast Lord. But her magic is too strong for the power players of the world to let her be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate and her father, Roland, currently have an uneasy truce, but when he starts testing her defenses again, she knows that sooner or later a confrontation is inevitable. The Witch Oracle has begun seeing visions of blood, fire, and human bones. And when a mysterious box is delivered to Kate's doorstep, a threat of war from the ancient enemy who nearly destroyed her family, she knows her time is up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Daniels sees no other choice but to combine forces with the unlikeliest of allies. She knows betrayal is inevitable. She knows she may not survive the coming battle. But she has to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For her child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Atlanta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the world.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Grim Reaper Charley Davidson is back in the final installment of Darynda Jones’ New York Times bestselling paranormal series!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley Davidson, Grim Reaper extraordinaire, is pissed. She’s been kicked off the earthly plain for eternity – which is the appropriate amount of time to make a person starkraving mad. But someone’s looking out for her, and she’s allowed to return after a mere hundred years in exile. Is it too much to hope for that not much has changed? Apparently it is. Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s missed Reyes and her daughter, Beep, but now that she’s back on earth, it’s time to put to rest burning questions that need answers. What happened to her mother? How did she really die? Who killed her? And are cupcakes or coffee the best medicine? It all comes to a head in an epic showdown between good and evil in this final smart and hilarious novel.</description>

  <description>Grim Reaper Charley Davidson is back in the twelfth installment of Darynda Jones’ New York Times bestselling paranormal series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since Reyes escaped from a hell dimension in which Charley accidently trapped him, the son of Satan has been brimstone-bent on destroying the world his heavenly Brother created. His volatile tendencies have put Charley in a bit of a pickle. But that’s not the only briny vegetable on her plate. While trying to domesticate the feral being that used to be her husband, she also has to deal with her everyday life of annoying all manner of beings—some corporeal, some not so much—as she struggles to right the wrongs of society. Only this time she’s not uncovering a murder. This time she’s covering one up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add to that her new occupation of keeping a startup PI venture—the indomitable mystery-solving team of Amber Kowalski and Quentin Rutherford—out of trouble and dealing with the Vatican’s inquiries into her beloved daughter, and Charley is on the brink of throwing in the towel and becoming a professional shopper. Or possibly a live mannequin. But when someone starts attacking humans who are sensitive to the supernatural world, Charley knows it’s time to let loose her razor sharp claws. Then again, her number one suspect is the dark entity she’s loved for centuries. So the question becomes, can she tame the unruly beast before it destroys everything she’s worked so hard to protect?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Can there be any greater challenge to London’s Ambitious Mamas than an unmarried duke?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;—Lady Whistledown’s Society Papers, April 1813&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By all accounts, &lt;b&gt;Simon Basset&lt;/b&gt; is on the verge of proposing to his best friend’s sister, the lovely—and almost-on-the-shelf—&lt;b&gt;Daphne Bridgerton&lt;/b&gt;. But the two of them know the truth—it’s all an elaborate plan to keep Simon free from marriage-minded society mothers. And as for Daphne, surely she will attract some worthy suitors now that it seems a duke has declared her desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Daphne waltzes across ballroom after ballroom with Simon, it’s hard to remember that their courtship is a complete sham. Maybe it’s his devilish smile, certainly it’s the way his eyes seem to burn every time he looks at her… but somehow Daphne is falling for the dashing duke… for real! And now she must do the impossible and convince the handsome rogue that their clever little scheme deserves a slight alteration, and that nothing makes quite as much sense as falling in love…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;New York Times bestselling author Nalini Singh returns to her world of dark passion and immortal power—and to one of the most seductive and impenetrable heroes ever to stalk the Guild Hunter landscape…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;i&gt;Oh, Naasir. So weird, so bloodthirsty, so unique and wonderful…I have fallen for him…&lt;/i&gt;”—Fiction Vixen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naasir is the most feral of the powerful group of vampires and angels known as the Seven, his loyalty pledged to the Archangel Raphael. When rumors surface of a plot to murder the former Archangel of Persia, now lost in the Sleep of the Ancients, Naasir is dispatched to find him. For only he possesses the tracking skills required—those more common to predatory animals than to man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enlisted to accompany Naasir, Andromeda, a young angelic scholar with dangerous secrets, is fascinated by his nature—at once playful and brilliant, sensual and brutal. As they race to find the Sleeping archangel before it’s too late, Naasir will force her to question all she knows…and tempt her to walk into the magnificent, feral darkness of his world. But first they must survive an enemy vicious enough to shatter the greatest taboo of the angelic race and plunge the world into a screaming nightmare…</description>

  <description>A Final Formula Spin Off Series... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Era Brant couldn’t have asked for a more perfect project to launch her interior design business. The Nelson mansion has many hidden wonders: cherry support posts, natural stone floors, and an abundance of paranormal activity. As an avid ghost hunter, Era is drawn to the house for more than just its nineteenth-century charm—especially when she gets a little ghostly help with the proposed architectural plans. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the new Deacon, the leader of the Old Magic community, Doug Nelson is catching a lot of heat about letting Era and her New Magic contractor renovate the home of their Community’s founder. But Doug’s troubles don’t stop there. His brother Declan has returned home after a messy divorce and befriends Era. Doug was hoping the renovation project would be a chance to get to know Era better. He doesn’t need his brother butting in. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Era doesn’t know what to make of Declan, but when he admits that he’s been communicating with the mansion’s ghost since childhood, she finds a new ally. With his help, she might be able to figure out what this ghost wants. But giving a ghost what it desires can be a risky venture, and as Era knows, dealing with the Nelson dead takes that risk to a whole new level.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author J. R. Ward delivers the second novel in her Bourbon Kings series—a sweeping saga of a Southern dynasty struggling to maintain a façade of privilege and prosperity, while secrets and indiscretions threaten its very foundation…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In Charlemont, Kentucky, the Bradford family is the crème de la crème of high society—just like their exclusive brand of bourbon. And their complicated lives and vast estate are run by a discrete staff who inevitably become embroiled in their affairs. This is especially true now, when the apparent suicide of the family patriarch is starting to look more and more like murder…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No one is above suspicion—especially the eldest Bradford son, Edward. The bad blood between him and his father is known far and wide, and he is aware that he could be named a suspect. As the investigation into the death intensifies, he keeps himself busy at the bottom of a bottle—as well as with his former horse trainer’s daughter. Meanwhile, the family’s financial future lies in the perfectly manicured hands of a business rival, a woman who wants Edward all to herself.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everything has consequences; everybody has secrets. And few can be trusted. Then, at the very brink of the family’s demise, someone thought lost to them forever returns to the fold. Maxwell Bradford has come home. But is he a savior...or the worst of all the sinners?</description>

  <description>For generations, the Bradford family has worn the mantle of kings of the bourbon capital of the world. Their sustained wealth has afforded them prestige and privilege—as well as a hard-won division of class on their sprawling estate, Easterly. Upstairs, a dynasty that by all appearances plays by the rules of good fortune and good taste. Downstairs, the staff who work tirelessly to maintain the impeccable Bradford facade. And never the twain shall meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Lizzie King, Easterly’s head gardener, crossing that divide nearly ruined her life. Falling in love with Tulane, the prodigal son of the bourbon dynasty, was nothing that she intended or wanted—and their bitter breakup only served to prove her instincts were right. Now, after two years of staying away, Tulane is finally coming home again, and he is bringing the past with him. No one will be left unmarked: not Tulane’s beautiful and ruthless wife; not his older brother, whose bitterness and bad blood know no bounds; and especially not the ironfisted Bradford patriarch, a man with few morals, fewer scruples, and many, many terrible secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As family tensions—professional and intimately private—ignite, Easterly and all its inhabitants are thrown into the grips of an irrevocable transformation, and only the cunning will survive.</description>

  <description>Dr. Tala Matapang thought the most challenging part about getting kidnapped by slavers from another planet would be escaping, not butting heads with the obstinate Star Guardian captain who rescued her. She’s been working in his sickbay, and it's refreshing not having to deal with the politics and bureaucracy she faced as a surgeon back home, but Captain Sagitta is as infuriating as he is handsome. He's got this crazy plan to take her and the other women home against his government's wishes, and he didn't even consult them about it first. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Captain Sagitta "Sage" of Dethocoles believes in doing the right thing. That's why he's defying his government to take Tala and the other Earth women home. Unfortunately, he has a couple of problems. First, his government is sending a surprisingly aggressive pursuit after them. Second, he’s having a hard time imagining dropping Tala off and never seeing her again. She’s a capable doctor and is doing an excellent job heading up his sickbay. More than that, he’s attracted to her and is starting to care about her. Too bad he’s better at barking orders than sharing feelings, and he seems to argue with her every time they speak. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With trouble stalking the ship from behind and obstacles blocking the route ahead, Sage and Tala will have to form a bond and learn to work together, or neither of them will see their home worlds again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Star Guardians Series &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Orion &lt;br /&gt;Book 2: Treyjon &lt;br /&gt;Book 3: Sagitta &lt;br /&gt;Book 4: Hierax (August) &lt;br /&gt;Book 5: Zakota (fall)</description>

  <description>Angela left her parents’ lavender farm with dreams of becoming a professional dog trainer. Getting kidnapped by slavers from outer space was not part of the plan. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, Angela and a few dozen other women were rescued by Star Guardians. She isn’t quite sure how she's going to get back to Earth, but these Star Guardians aren’t looking too shabby, especially a hunky one named Treyjon. He trains svenkars, four-hundred-pound predators that make pit bulls look like squeak toys. Angela is curious about the animals--&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; about him. The problem? He doesn’t seem to know she exists. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Treyjon, the women staying as guests aboard the Star Guardian ship are off limits. The captain has made that clear, so he hasn’t allowed himself to admire their feminine assets. But when one of them shows an interest in the powerful predators he trains, animals that scare most women out of the room, he’s intrigued. When she proves a knack for working with one of the creatures, he’s &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than intrigued. He starts wondering how he’s ever going to let her go home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Star Guardians Series&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Orion &lt;br /&gt;Book 2: Treyjon &lt;br /&gt;Book 3: Sagitta (July) &lt;br /&gt;Book 4: Hierax (August) &lt;br /&gt;Book 5: Zakota (fall)</description>

  <description>Dina DeMille may run the nicest Bed and Breakfast in Red Deer, Texas, but she caters to a very particular kind of guest… the kind that no one on Earth is supposed to know about. Guests like a former intergalactic tyrant with an impressive bounty on her head, the Lord Marshal of a powerful vampire clan, and a displaced-and-superhot werewolf; so don’t stand too close, or you may be collateral damage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what passes for Dina’s normal life is about to be thrown into chaos. First, she must rescue her long-distant older sister, Maud, who’s been exiled with her family to a planet that functions as the most lawless penal colony since Botany Bay. Then she agrees to help a guest whose last chance at saving his civilization could bring death and disaster to all Dina holds dear. Now Gertrude Hunt is under siege by a clan of assassins. To keep her guests safe and to find her missing parents, Dina will risk everything, even if she has to pay the ultimate price. Though Sean may have something to say about that!</description>

  <description>On the outside, Dina Demille is the epitome of normal. She runs a quaint Victorian Bed and Breakfast in a small Texas town, owns a Shih Tzu named Beast, and is a perfect neighbor, whose biggest problem should be what to serve her guests for breakfast. But Dina is...different: Her broom is a deadly weapon; her Inn is magic and thinks for itself. Meant to be a lodging for otherworldly visitors, the only permanent guest is a retired Galactic aristocrat who can’t leave the grounds because she’s responsible for the deaths of millions and someone might shoot her on sight. Under the circumstances, "normal" is a bit of a stretch for Dina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, something with wicked claws and deepwater teeth has begun to hunt at night....Feeling responsible for her neighbors, Dina decides to get involved. Before long, she has to juggle dealing with the annoyingly attractive, ex-military, new neighbor, Sean Evans—an alpha-strain werewolf—and the equally arresting cosmic vampire soldier, Arland, while trying to keep her inn and its guests safe. But the enemy she’s facing is unlike anything she’s ever encountered. It’s smart, vicious, and lethal, and putting herself between this creature and her neighbors might just cost her everything.</description>

  <description>Dina DeMille isn't your typical Bed and Breakfast owner. Her inn defies laws of physics, her dog is secretly a monster, and the only permanent guest of the inn is a former Galactic tyrant with a price on her head. The inn needs guests to thrive and guests have been scarce, so when an Arbitrator shows up at Dina's door and asks her to host a peace summit between three warring species, she jumps on the chance. Unfortunately, for Dina, bridging the gap between space vampires, the Hope-Crushing Horde, and the merchants of Baha-char is much easier said than done. To make the summit a success, she must find a chef, remodel the inn, keep her guests from murdering each other, and risk everything, even her life, to save the man she might fall in love with. But then it's all in the day's work for an Innkeeper.…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Andrews is an auto-buy no matter what the genre!” —&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“If there is one author that defines Urban Fantasy, it is Ilona Andrews.” —Annie Tegelan, &lt;i&gt;Fresh Fiction&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"One of the brightest voices in urban fantasy and one of my favorite authors. Ilona Andrews delivers only the best." —&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jeaniene Frost</description>

  <description>Tattooed, muscled, and fierce, they look like felons, but these highly trained agents are humanity’s protectors, the only ones standing between Earth and the threats of the galaxy. They are the Star Guardians. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A born geek, Juanita has dreamed of exploring the stars for as long as she can remember. Getting kidnapped by slavers from another planet? Not so much. If she’s lucky, she might be able to convince the hot guy protecting her from the others to help her escape. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A bounty hunter allied with the Star Guardians, Orion is undercover on the slavers' ship, plotting to end their kidnapping trips to Earth. He didn’t expect to meet someone as funny, sexy, and determined as Juanita among the victims. He wants to protect her from the thugs molesting her, but that could blow his cover and jeopardize his mission. He must choose between keeping her safe and dooming Earth to be a target for slavers forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Anne Bishop returns to her world of the Others, as humans struggle to survive in the shadow of shapeshifters and vampires far more powerful than themselves…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After a human uprising was brutally put down by the Elders—a primitive and lethal form of the Others—the few cities left under human control are far-flung. And the people within them now know to fear the no-man’s-land beyond their borders—and the darkness…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some communities struggle to rebuild, Lakeside Courtyard has emerged relatively unscathed, though Simon Wolfgard, its wolf shifter leader, and blood prophet Meg Corbyn must work with the human pack to maintain the fragile peace. But all their efforts are threatened when Lieutenant Montgomery’s shady brother arrives, looking for a free ride and easy pickings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the humans on guard against one of their own, tensions rise, drawing the attention of the Elders, who are curious about the effect such an insignificant predator can have on a pack. But Meg knows the dangers, for she has seen in the cards how it will all end—with her standing beside a grave</description>

  <description>Even though Captain Jelena Marchenko has Starseer talents, such as telepathy and telekinesis, she has grown up feeling ostracized by the Starseer community. She longs for an opportunity to prove that she deserves a place among them.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When an old friend of the family shows up, seeking transportation to the site of an ancient Starseer relic, Jelena believes this may be her chance to prove herself. If she helps Abelardus recover an artifact that's important to the Starseer community, perhaps she’ll finally be invited to join. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But once they are on their way to the site, she starts to question what Abelardus plans to do with the artifact—and if he even has the right to dig it up. Further, she wonders why it’s been left alone for centuries. Is there a reason nobody tried to recover it before? And is it worth risking the lives of herself and her crew to win the good regard of strangers?  &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Surviving on the treacherous Iron Seas requires a heart of steel…but how can Yasmeen hope to survive when her heart has already been stolen by Archimedes Fox…?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tethered along the south dock of Port Fallow, Captain Yasmeen Corsair’s magnificent new airship, Lady Nergüi, awaits its departure with adventurer and treasure-hunter Archimedes Fox. But this time, Yasmeen, a fearless mercenary who has always prided herself on a heart of steel, has reasons to worry when Miles Bilson, an acquaintance from Archimedes’ earlier smuggling days, sends an urgent message requesting help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a past marked by betrayal, Archimedes wonders what his former partner could want—other than revenge. Yasmeen fears that Bilson could threaten everything Archimedes holds dear. Though both Archimedes and Yasmeen love the exhilaration of veering wildly off course, neither is prepared for where their newest risk will take them…or what it might cost them.</description>

  <description>Addie Daulton has never backed down from a challenge. After all, doing the impossible is what makes her a master alchemist. So when she learns that her best friend, James Huntsman, has been banished from the mortal world, she believes she can get him back. But finding James isn’t her only problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An infectious breed of zombies has appeared in the city, and they’re like nothing any necromancer has seen. Addie suspects that alchemy is involved, or more specifically, an alchemist. She strongly suspects her former colleague Neil Dunstan is behind it, using the ingredient she inadvertently gave him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And if all of this isn’t enough, New Magic suddenly vanishes as mysteriously as it appeared two decades ago. With the naming of a new Deacon only days away and infectious zombies targeting former New Magic users, it’s not the best time for Rowan to lose his power—magically or politically. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Impossible problems require improbable solutions, and circumstances keep pushing Addie to the same conclusion: the answer is buried in her family history. A history she doesn’t remember. Now to save those she cares about, and perhaps the entire city, Addie will have to face her greatest fear. Her past.</description>

  <description>When Jelena Marchenko learns that her parents have incurred a huge debt due to her previous actions, she’s determined to find a way to pay it off. But running cargo doesn’t pay anything off quickly. She comes up with a scheme to turn herself and her eclectic crewmates into mercenaries, at least for long enough to make some money. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Jelena has no interest in maiming, killing, or otherwise tormenting people, the typical things mercenaries are hired to do. She’s relieved when, with Prince Thorian’s help, she finds a mission that seems perfectly suited to her team: rescuing prisoners of war. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what was supposed to be a quick way to earn money soon turns into something devastating and deadly. Caught between two sides in a war fueled by centuries of resentment, Jelena must choose between her needs and the needs of a planet. No matter which choice she makes, she risks her ship and the lives of her team. Does she truly have what it takes to be a mercenary?</description>

  <description>Rancher Jack West knows what it means to love a woman with all his heart and to lose her far too soon. A widower for seven long years, he thinks love and romance are a part of his past. He devotes himself to his grown son and his family, the horses they raise, and the land that has been theirs for three generations. He doesn’t know that life has a surprise in store for him in the form of Janet Killeen, the lovely FBI agent he threw off his land last winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bullet that left Janet Killeen seriously wounded also tore a hole through her life. All she wants is a little peace and quiet in the mountains, a chance to feel like herself again. That chance comes to an abrupt end when she goes off the road in a snowstorm and winds up stranded alone in a ditch. The last person on earth she wants to see is that arrogant jerk Jack West, no matter how handsome he is. But from the moment Jack finds her and offers her his hand, she realizes there’s far more to this gruff cowboy than she had imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But trouble is brewing at Cimarron Ranch. A deranged man with an inscrutable motive is moving in for the kill, threatening to end Jack and Janet’s romance before they can claim a love that is … Soul Deep.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;Striking Distance&lt;/i&gt; returns with more danger, intrigue, and I-Team action...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CIA officer Nick Andris wants revenge. His last mission failed after a Georgian arms smuggler killed his lover. He’s been tailing a woman for three weeks hoping she will lead him to his target. But there’s a problem with the intel. Holly Elise Bradshaw is nothing more than an entertainment writer with a love for sex and designer clothes. Clearly someone at Langley made a mistake . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Holly finds herself in trouble, the only weapons at her disposal are her brains and her body. But they won’t be enough to handle the man who’s following her. He’s going to turn her world upside-down.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Her past is a secret—even to her.&lt;br /&gt;Discovering it will be the most dangerous move of her life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TV reporter Laura Nilsson, known as the "Baghdad Babe," spent eighteen months in an Al Qaeda compound after being kidnapped live on the air. Two years later, she's still wondering why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No rescue mission in Javier Corbray's fourteen years as a Navy SEAL affected him the way Laura's rescue did. No woman has stirred his protective instincts the way she has. And he wants her more than he's ever wanted anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Laura and Javier's passion ignites, so does Laura's need to discover the mystery of her past. Especially when she learns that her abduction was not random—and that she's still a target for a killer with an impenetrable motive. Now Javier will have to rely on his skills to keep the woman he loves from being struck down before she dares uncover the truth.</description>

  <description>Warning: This story ends with a cliffhanger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a weekend…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura Nilsson knows what she wants: a successful career as a broadcast journalist—and a little fun between the sheets now and again. What she doesn’t want is marriage or kids. When a ripped and sexy stranger intervenes to stop a couple of drunks from harassing her in a hotel bar in Dubai City, all she can think about is spending the rest of the weekend with him—in her bed. There’s just one little problem. Unmarried sex is illegal in Dubai.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;… of no-strings sex …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Navy SEAL Javier “Cobra” Corbray is on his way home from a rough deployment in Afghanistan when he finds himself having dinner with “the Baghdad Babe.” What she wants from him—sex with no strings—could land them both in prison. Still, he’s more than happy to oblige her. She’s confident and sexually assertive, and he’s secure enough to lie back and let her make the first strike. But, as she’s about to find out, he’s more than her match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;… or the beginning of something more?&lt;br /&gt;Yet, neither Laura nor Javier has any idea what lies ahead—or how this weekend of mind-blowing sex will impact their emotions. Will they act on their new-found feelings in time, or will they let something special slip away… perhaps forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This story ends with a cliffhanger.</description>

  <description>Broken on the inside  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Megan Hunter has worked hard to get back on her feet, leaving the nightmare of her teenage years behind. The last thing she wants or needs in her life is a man. But when she is attacked by someone from her past, a scarred stranger intervenes, saving her life and that of her little girl. Looks can be deceiving, for despite the man’s rough appearance, she feels safe with him. And for the first time in her life, she knows the stirrings of desire.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broken on the outside  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nathaniel West paid a high price serving with the Marines in Afghanistan. He returned to his family’s ranch in the Colorado mountains to heal—and be alone. Disfigured as he is, he has put all thoughts of sex and romance aside. But something about Megan brings him back to life, heats his blood, makes him feel like a man again. As danger pursues her, and the truth about her past is revealed, he vows to protect her—and to heal her wounded spirit.  But confronting the past is never easy—especially when it’s carrying a gun. Megan will have to learn to trust Nate to survive and to claim a passion that is much more than … Skin Deep.</description>

  <description>Starseer, pilot, and animal lover Jelena Marchenko wants to prove to her parents that she’s ready to captain her own freighter and help run the family business. When she finally talks them into getting a second ship and letting her fly it, it doesn’t faze her that the craft is decades old and looks like a turtle. This is the chance she’s craved for years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it’s not long before the opportunity to rescue mistreated lab animals lures her from her parentally approved cargo run and embroils her in a battle between warring corporations. To further complicate matters, her childhood friend Thorian, prince of the now defunct Sarellian Empire, is in trouble with Alliance law and needs her help. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torn between her duty to her family and doing what she believes is honorable, Jelena is about to learn that right and wrong are never as simple as they appear and that following your heart can get you killed.</description>

  <description>While investigating border violence in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, Denver journalist Natalie Benoit is caught in a bloody ambush and taken captive. Alone in the hands of ruthless killers, she will need every ounce of courage she possesses to survive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betrayed by another operative, Deputy U.S. Marshal Zach McBride has endured a week of torture and interrogation at the hands of a bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartel. Ready to give his life if he must, he remains unbroken—until he hears the cries of an American woman. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Natalie is only a voice in the darkness of their shared prison, her plight brings renewed strength to Zach's battered body. With her help, he overpowers their captors, and they flee through the desert toward the border, the attraction between them flaring hotter than the Sonoran sun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But past loss and tragedy leave both of them reluctant to follow their hearts, even when the passion between them reaches its breaking point. Faced with feelings neither expected, they fight to stay ahead of the danger that hunts them as forces more powerful than they can imagine conspire to destroy them both…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What do you do when desire drives you to the very brink?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day Navajo journalist Katherine James met Gabriel Rossiter, the earth literally moved beneath her feet. Nearly killed in a rockslide while hiking, she found her life in the tall park ranger's hands. Although she can't forget him she thinks she'll never see him again. She is crushed when she recognizes her rescuer among the law enforcement officers raiding a sweat lodge ceremony one night, throwing her and her friends off Mesa Butte, land they consider sacred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabe long ago swore he would never again lose himself to a woman not even one with long dark hair and big eyes that seem to see right through him. But from the moment he first sees Kat, the attraction he feels is undeniable. Appalled by what he has been ordered to do, he's determined to get to the bottom of recent events at Mesa Butte and to keep Kat safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But asking questions can be dangerous almost as dangerous as risking one's heart. And soon Kat and Gabe's passion for the truth and each other makes them targets for those who would do anything, even kill, to keep Native Americans off their sacred land.</description>

  <description>Some secrets carry the weight of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose McKenzie may be far from Earth with no way back, but she's made a powerful ally--a fellow prisoner with whom she's formed a strong bond. Sazo's an artificial intelligence. He's saved her from captivity and torture, but he's also put her in the middle of a conflict, leaving Rose with her loyalties divided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captain Dav Jallan doesn't know why he and his crew have stumbled across an almost legendary Class 5 battleship, but he's not going to complain. The only problem is, all its crew are dead, all except for one strange, new alien being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She calls herself Rose. She seems small and harmless, but less and less about her story is adding up, and Dav has a bad feeling his crew, and maybe even the four planets, are in jeopardy. The Class 5's owners, the Tecran, look set to start a war to get it back and Dav suspects Rose isn't the only alien being who survived what happened on the Class 5. And whatever else is out there is playing its own games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this race for the truth, he's going to have to go against his leaders and trust the dark horse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winner of a SFR Galaxy Award 2016 and the Prism Award 2016 for Best Futuristic.</description>

  <description>Just when Nevada Baylor has finally come to accept the depths of her magical powers, she also realizes she’s fallen in love. Connor “Mad” Rogan is in many ways her equal when it comes to magic, but she’s completely out of her elements when it comes to her feelings for him. To make matters more complicated, an old flame comes back into Rogan’s life…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogan knows there’s nothing between him and his ex-fiance, Rynda Sherwood. But as Nevada begins to learn more about her past, her power, and her potential future, he knows she will be faced with choices she never dreamed of and the promise of a life spent without him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Nevada and Rogan race to discover the whereabouts of Rynda’s kidnapped husband and are forced to confront Nevada’s grandmother, who may or may not have evil motives, these two people must decide if they can trust in each other or allow everything to go up in smoke.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Ilona Andrews launches a brand new Hidden Legacy series, in which one woman must place her trust in a seductive, dangerous man who sets off an even more dangerous desire…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevada Baylor is faced with the most challenging case of her detective career—a suicide mission to bring in a suspect in a volatile case. Nevada isn't sure she has the chops. Her quarry is a Prime, the highest rank of magic user, who can set anyone and anything on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she's kidnapped by Connor "Mad" Rogan—a darkly tempting billionaire with equally devastating powers. Torn between wanting to run or surrender to their overwhelming attraction, Nevada must join forces with Rogan to stay alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogan's after the same target, so he needs Nevada. But she's getting under his skin, making him care about someone other than himself for a change. And, as Rogan has learned, love can be as perilous as death, especially in the magic world.</description>

  <description>Nevada Baylor has a unique and secret skill—she &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; when people are lying—and she's used that magic (along with plain, hard work) to keep her colorful and close-knit family's detective agency afloat. But her new case pits her against the shadowy forces that almost destroyed the city of Houston once before, bringing Nevada back into contact with Connor "Mad" Rogan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogan is a billionaire Prime—the highest rank of magic user—and as unreadable as ever, despite Nevada’s “talent.” But there’s no hiding the sparks between them. Now that the stakes are even higher, both professionally and personally, and their foes are unimaginably powerful, Rogan and Nevada will find that nothing burns like ice …</description>

Sophie knows she should fear Marc. But the heat and hunger of his touch still lingers in her mind--and on her body--after all this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together they will follow a dangerous trail, as people on both sides of the law do everything they can to keep Sophie and Mark from finding Megan--and a shocking truth about the past...</description>

  <description>After the murder of a teenage girl, a mysterious man in a black leather jacket was seen lurking near the crime scene. Investigative reporter Tessa Novak has him in her sights as the culprit… That man was Julian Darcangelo, an undercover FBI agent working with the Denver police. He’s closing in on the trail of a human trafficker and killer. Tessa’s accusations could blow his cover, and he wants her off the investigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just as Tessa has made Julian a target of interest, she is now a target of the killer. And as they are forced to trust each other, their physical attraction escalates as intensely as the threat from a ruthless murderer who wants to see both of them dead…&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Novels such as&lt;/i&gt; Carnal Gift &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; Sweet Release &lt;i&gt;made Pamela Clare's rising star shine. Now, she turns her "impressive" talents to a novel of modern romance - and breathless intrigue...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been years since her child's father dumped her, and since then Kara McMillan has kept men at bay - although every day she aches more for a lover's touch. But to get that, the hard-boiled journalist must become vulnerable - a feeling she vowed never to have again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his dangerous good looks, charm, and power, Senator Reece Sheridan could have just about any woman he sets his piercing eyes on. But he's intrigued by only one. This Kara, this gutsy investigative reporter, has a sensuality that arouses him to no end. If she's a firebrand in print, he guesses, she must be just as fiery in bed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is no fling. A sudden political scandal - and attempts on Kara's life - could very well drive them apart. Or maybe, just maybe, adversity could draw them into a bond even more intense than their steamy sexual embraces.</description>

  <description>Delve into a world steeped in tradition and superstition&lt;br /&gt;After her parents become infected with the Red Death, Lucy Yeoh flees to Malaysia seeking answers. Everything in this closed-off section of the world is paradise--from the lush tropical climate to her sexy new neighbor, Sheng...who just might be delusional. He claims the Plague God unleashed the Red Death and only a circle of Chinese Zodiac spirit animals can cleanse the Earth. Even more, he insists she's one of them: the Rabbit. Long furry ears and fluffy bunny tail included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He'll show her how to fight to save the world&lt;br /&gt;As the Chosen of the Tiger, the burden of restoring balance to the world has fallen onto Li Sheng's shoulders. When he discovers that the ally he's long awaited, the Dragon, is actually just the Rabbit, Sheng is quick to dismiss Lucy. If only she'd stay dismissed. Lucy's Rabbit refuses to cooperate, undermining the authority of his Tiger at every turn...and seducing him to the limits of his darkest desires. He's not supposed to want her. Not when he needs the spirit circle complete and she's their weakest link.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She'll show him a love worth fighting the world to save&lt;br /&gt;Sheng's enemies draw closer, and not everyone wants Lucy alive. Together, they'll have to navigate a treacherous world where a line between duty and their hearts has been drawn between them. They must either sacrifice one, or find a way to surrender to both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chinese Zodiac Romance Series Reading Order:&lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Trancing the Tiger&lt;br /&gt;Book 2: Rematch (Standalone novella)&lt;br /&gt;Book 3: By the Horns&lt;br /&gt;Book 4: Match Me Later (Standalone novella)&lt;br /&gt;Book 5: Reining Him In&lt;br /&gt;Book 6: Matching Dragons (Standalone novella)&lt;br /&gt;Book 7: Never Match a Dragon (Standalone novella)&lt;br /&gt;Book 8: In Wolf's Clothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other books by Rachael Slate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halcyon Romance Series Reading Order:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halcyon Romance:&lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Moon Borne&lt;br /&gt;Book 2: Earth Borne&lt;br /&gt;Book 3: Water Borne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lords of Thessaly: (series now complete!)&lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Wicked Lord of Thessaly&lt;br /&gt;Book 2: Brutish Lord of Thessaly&lt;br /&gt;Book 3: Masterful Lord of Thessaly&lt;br /&gt;Book 4: Untamed Lord of Thessaly&lt;br /&gt;Book 5: Lost Lady of Thessaly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cursed Immortals:&lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Shadow Borne</description>

Now a pact to save the man she loves changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this final installment in the Darkness Series, when the truth comes to light, Ember will learn some things are better left in the dark as her world is ripped even further apart. It is no longer a rabbit hole, but a never-ending black void full of endless lies, betrayals, and secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fight for Earth has begun, and Ember will have to make the ultimate sacrifice to save millions of innocent lives and those she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this price may be too high—even for her.</description>

  <description>Some days feel like years, but in Ember Brycin’s case just the opposite is true. Em would be 22 now—if she were human. She’s not. She is a Dae—part Demon and part Fay—with a little Dark Dweller thrown in to make her more of a freak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life has become further complicated for Ember since returning from the Otherworld. Besides being continuously hunted by the Seelie Queen, Ember is at the top of the Unseelie King’s list, after breaking her oath with him. No one breaks a vow with the Unseelie King without extreme consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding to Ember’s problems is a certain Dark Dweller whose mood has become violent and cruel. As much as she’d like to deny it, there is an undeniable connection between them. Eli is sexy, gorgeous, and frustrating as hell. She also knows he is holding something back, something that could change their relationship forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her problems go way past him. As the tension for war mounts between the Seelie and Unseelie (Light and Dark), the tension at the Dark Dweller’s compound escalates even more as they prepare to obtain the Sword of Light—the only weapon able to kill the Queen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is Ember the answer to the location of the sword? Is she the one to fulfill the prophecy? As usual nothing is ever what it seems.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;ACE for ASIN B00EF5DCII&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***This is NOT a YA Series but a New Adult (17+). Sexual Content and Language.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been four weeks since Ember Brycin witnessed what her powers are capable of. The Electrical Current Storm has turned Seattle, Washington into a natural disaster zone. The death toll is in the thousands with countless others homeless and hungry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Ember is the one who caused it. Something she will have to live with every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those people who were unable to escape either turned quickly into gangs or live in shelters. Ember, on the other hand, can’t do either. With a price on her head and a Dark Dweller on her ass, she is constantly on the move. Both Light and Dark are hunting her for their own purpose to use her as a weapon or a pawn in the war between the Unseelie King of the Dark and the Seelie Queen of the Light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Em needs help but doesn’t know who to trust: Lars, the mystery man Torin told her to find? Torin, the Seelie Queen’s personal knight, who has sworn to keep Em safe? Or Eli, who wants to turn her over to the Unseelie King, but whom she has an undeniable, intense connection with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what she chooses she will probably lose—her life or everything and everyone she loves.</description>

  <description>Vampyres don’t exist. They absolutely do not exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least I didn’t think they did ‘til I tried to quit smoking and ended up Undead. Who in the hell did I screw over in a former life that my getting healthy equates with dead?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I’m a Vampyre. Yes, we exist whether we want to or not. However, I have to admit, the perks aren’t bad. My girls no longer jiggle, my ass is higher than a kite and the latest Prada keeps finding its way to my wardrobe. On the downside, I’m stuck with an obscenely profane Guardian Angel who looks like Oprah and a Fairy Fighting Coach who’s teaching me to annihilate like the Terminator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To complicate matters, my libido has increased to Vampyric proportions and my attraction to a hotter than Satan’s underpants killer rogue Vampyre is not only dangerous . . . it’s possibly deadly. For real dead. Permanent death isn’t on my agenda. Avoiding him is my only option. Of course, since he thinks I’m his, it’s easier said than done. Like THAT’S not enough to deal with, all the other Vampyres think I’m some sort of Chosen One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy Hell, if I’m in charge of saving an entire race of blood suckers, the Undead are in for one hell of a ride.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;ACE for ASIN B00BFKOEY2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freak. Witch. Crazy. Schizo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ember Brycin has been called them all. She’s always known she’s different. No one has ever called her normal, even under the best circumstances. Bizarre and inexplicable things continually happen to her, and having two different colored eyes, strange hair, and an unusual tattoo only contributes to the gossip about her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the latest school explosion lands her in a facility for troubled teens, she meets Eli Dragen, who’s hot as hell and darkly mysterious. Their connection is full of passion, danger, and secrets. Secrets that will not only change her life, but what and who she is—leading her down a path she never imagined possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between Light and Dark, Ember finds a world where truth and knowledge are power and no one can be trusted. But her survival depends on finding out the truth about herself. In her pursuit, she is forced between love and destiny and good and evil, even when the differences between them aren’t always clear. At worst, she will incite a war that could destroy both worlds. At best, she will not only lose her heart but her life and everyone she loves. Once the truth is out, however, there will be no going back. And she’ll definitely wish she could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DARKNESS OF LIGHT is a Mature YA(16+)/New Adult Paranormal Romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Warning: The Darkness Series is not YA, but a NA Series.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In the Ichidian Universe, The League and their ruthless assassins rule all. Expertly trained and highly valued, the League Assassins are the backbone of the government. But not even the League is immune to corruption . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Command Assassin Nykyrian Quikiades once turned his back on the League—and has been hunted by them ever since. Though many have tried, none can kill him or stop him from completing his current mission: to protect Kiara Zamir, a woman whose father’s political alliance has made her a target. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her world becomes even deadlier, Kiara must entrust her life to the same kind of beast who once killed her mother and left her for dead. Old enemies and new threaten them both and the only way they can survive is to overcome their suspicions and learn to trust in the very ones who threaten them the most: each other.</description>

  <description>This war is not being played on a battlefield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killed by the man she loves, not even death is kind to Zoey. &lt;br /&gt;Neither life nor her fae powers will let her go in peace. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this final installment, Zoey’s strength, determination, and trust are put to the ultimate test. In the fight to protect the people she loves and stop DMG from experimenting on fae, humans, and animals to create soldiers, she learns the reality of how far Dr. Rapava will go to achieve his ultimate mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, Rapava is not the only one willing to go to extremes. Vadik is hunting Ryker, and there is nothing he won’t do to get back the property he feels is his: both Ryker and the Stone of Destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To end one evil, Zoey might have to make a deal with another. One she won't be able to get out of. And it could be the worst decision she ever made.</description>

  <description>The hunter is now the hunted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zoey Daniels is becoming the very thing she once despised. Fae. After Zoey and Ryker finally found their way to each other they are torn apart by an ex-girlfriend, a stone, and mortality. Ryker’s powers have fully adapted to Zoey, slowly killing him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now the mysterious feared demon, Vadik, has discovered their location in Peru and has taken Ryker and sold Zoey back to DMG. The very place which gave her life now might take it away. Or someone she loves… Dr. Rapava is so obsessed with building an army against the fae he will do anything to control Zoey and her new found powers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zoey’s has to become an unfeeling brainwashed soldier to survive. But when her survival depends on torturing one to keep another alive, she is forced to make the ultimate sacrifice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And neither choice is one she can live with. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Zoey’s life has taken a dramatic turn. Only a few months ago she was a Collector working for the a secret part of the government called the Department of Molecular Genetics (DMG), tracking and collecting fae. Her life had been changing and improving with a partner she loved and a sister she adored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now all that is gone—Daniel murdered by a fae, and Lexi killed when the Seattle area is devastated by a powerful, magical electrical storm. Zoey herself is altered by her association with the Wanderer, Ryker, in life-changing way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoey discovered she was an experiment from the very company she worked for. She could die at any moment of a threatening defect—taking Ryker’s magic with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a race against time, Ryker and Zoey set out to find a way to transfer his powers back before it’s too late. Their journey takes them to the rainforests of South America, dealing with those who are after something Ryker possesses and who will stop at nothing to obtain it for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Zoey and Ryker discover can destroy them or tear them a part for good.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"I am his muse. But not for long..."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Mammon, the Prince of Greed, 'acquires' a half-blood slave known as 'Muse' for three nights, and bespells her with tales of a world where people live like kings and queens among towers of steel and glass, the seed of hope takes root in Muse's soul. But hope, for a half-human half-demon creature like her, is a dangerous thing. Especially when that tentative hope springs from the honeyed words of a Prince of Hell. What is Mammon's price for freedom?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Da'mean, her ruthless owner, would rather see her dead, than free. She belongs to him. She is his muse. And no beast will take her from him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world of the elemental demons is harsh and violent. Muse's kin are merciless, blood-hungry beasts, but little do they know, Muse has something far more dangerous coiled inside her, desperate for a taste of freedom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her humanity.</description>

  <description>After a grueling battle that cost him dearly, mercenary captain Viktor Mandrake wants nothing more than to get his ship repaired, let his men have leave, and spend time relaxing with Ankari. Entrepreneur, schemer, and leaser of his company’s one and only pink shuttlecraft, she has become the woman he loves and wants to keep at his side. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But as soon as Viktor sets foot on the space station Midway 5, it becomes clear that the Galactic Conglomeration Fleet wants him arrested for past grievances. As a mercenary, confronting the Fleet isn’t wise (it’s not wise for anyone else, either). Normally, Viktor would collect his people and depart, but a mysterious disease has resulted in a quarantine, leaving him stuck on the station with no access to his ship or his crew. Fortunately, he has Ankari with him, but unfortunately, Ankari’s family has been pointing out all of the reasons why she shouldn’t be flying around on a mercenary vessel. And he’s not certain they’re wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If Viktor and Ankari can’t find a way off the station before the Fleet ships arrive, Viktor may never escape. Worse, no matter what happens, he risks losing Ankari forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mercenary Courage is the fifth novel in the Mandrake Company science fiction romance series and is a sequel to Mercenary Instinct. If you haven’t read Mercenary Instinct yet, it’s available for free on Amazon: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Mercenary-Instinct-Mandrake-Company-Lionsdrake-ebook/dp/B00ODECZN4" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Mercenary-Insti...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Kalish has been a successful treasure hunter for years, relying on only herself to deal with deadly predators, impenetrable jungles, and diabolical booby traps. But with her father kidnapped, and a notorious pirate demanding an ancient alien artifact that may or may not exist, Kalish needs help. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She hires a mercenary company because she needs their combat experience and their piloting skills—the intelligence officer with the background in translating alien hieroglyphics could come in useful too. Sedgwick Thomlin is charming and handsome, when he isn’t busy sneezing at something from his long list of allergies. But she’s not sure if she can trust him or the mercenaries, not when the most valuable and coveted relic in the galaxy might turn out to be real. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Ruins of Karzelek is a 95,000-word novel of space-based adventure and romance that can be read as a stand-alone. It is also part of the Mandrake Company series and brings back characters from the other books, such as Val, Gregor, Tick, and Striker.</description>

  <description>When Jamie Flipkens signed on as a pilot and engineer for a small medical research company, she never expected to end up on a mercenary ship full of hulking soldiers who want to make her their latest conquest. The captain has been good to her--it doesn't hurt that he's her boss's new beau--but she's on the verge of quitting when a strange man shows up at her shuttle door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sergei Zharkov claims to be an old friend of the captain's. He neglects to mention that he's also an assassin, a dangerous man who even the hardened mercenaries avoid. Jamie should avoid him, too, but she's drawn to the charm that sometimes escapes from beneath his grim facade. She finds herself wanting to give him a reason to smile--and maybe a little more than that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem? There's a fresh bounty on the captain's head, and it's possible Sergei is there to collect it.</description>

  <description>Alisa Marchenko has reunited with her daughter, and even though she hasn’t figured out how to get Jelena to accept Leonidas yet, she dreams of the three of them starting a new life together. They can return the Star Nomad to its original purpose of running freight and staying out of trouble (mostly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before that can happen, Alisa must fulfill the promise she made to Jelena: that she and her crew will retrieve young Prince Thorian, the boy who has become Jelena’s best friend. But Thorian was kidnapped by the rogue Starseer Tymoteusz, the man who wants to use the Staff of Lore to take over the entire system—and the man who may have the power to do it. Alisa doesn’t know why he kidnapped Thorian, but Tymoteusz once promised to kill the prince, so she fears they don’t have much time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Tymoteusz hasn’t left a trail of breadcrumbs. Finding him will be difficult, and even if they’re successful, facing him could be suicidal. To have a chance of surviving, Alisa will have to come up with her greatest scheme yet.</description>

  <description>After ten years of flying freighter ships from planet to planet, Val Calendula never thought she would apply for a job as a combat pilot in a mercenary outfit. But her brother has gotten himself into financial trouble, and he’s heading to a mining prison if Val can’t pay off his debts. Mercenaries don’t always live long... but they make good money while they’re alive. A few combat bonuses, and Val could earn what she needs. The problem? She might have graduated from the military flight academy, but she hasn’t fought anything more dangerous than dust bunnies on the bridge lately. To make matters worse, the man in charge of hiring pilots was her instructor back at the academy. Commander Thatcher was almost as brilliant as he was arrogant and condescending, and he never seemed to think Val was smart enough to be there. She has no idea if she’ll be able to convince him otherwise now... or if she’ll be able to stand working with him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Gregor Thatcher left the military, he never expected to run into any of his former acquaintances, much less the one he admired and mooned over during his two years teaching at the academy. Back then, he never told Val Calendula he cared for her, partially because officers weren’t supposed to have relations with cadets, but mostly because he didn’t know how to speak of his feelings. He might not have any trouble grasping navigational mathematics and astrodynamics, but people are more problematic. Gregor is elated that Val has entered his life again, but he’s fairly certain she hates him. Worse, he’s responsible for deciding whether she’s qualified to be a combat pilot. How can he judge fairly when his tongue tangles and idiotic words come out of his mouth whenever she’s around? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the captain sends Val and Gregor on a mission to pick up a military advisor and deliver him to a planet at war, Val hopes she’ll have an opportunity to prove herself capable of the piloting position. Gregor hopes he’ll have the opportunity to improve Val’s opinion of him. But when the military advisor goes missing, and they’re forced to divert to a dangerous moon base, the mission turns into a fight for survival. Val may learn too late that there’s more to Gregor than that aloof exterior… and that inside is a man she could love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trial and Temptation is a full-length science fiction romance novel of 73,000 words. It is part of the “Mandrake Company” series and is recommended for readers who enjoy space-based adventure (such as Firefly) and steamy love stories (in the style of Linnea Sinclair).</description>

  <description>Skulking around in the ruins on a planet swarming with treasure hunters, slavers, and bounty hunters isn’t good for one’s health. But Ankari Markovich needs a few archaeological samples for her latest business venture, a venture that might prove lucrative enough to move her family off the impoverished planet where she grew up. Unfortunately, she has no sooner collected her samples than she’s captured by a band of brawny mercenaries. The captain might be handsome, but he’s intent on turning her over to some finance lord who has, for reasons unknown, put a bounty on her head, a ridiculously large one at that. If she can’t figure out a way to escape before she’s delivered to the lord’s home world, she could be forced into a life of indentured servitude—or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captain Viktor Mandrake doesn’t usually take on piddling bounty hunting gigs, but when his intelligence officer informs him of a criminal on a nearby planet, he decides it wouldn’t hurt to take a shuttle down to collect the woman. But Ankari Markovich is trouble from the start, nearly eluding his elite forces, then fighting and tricking his people left and right. He finds himself admiring her spirit, but according to her warrant, she’s a criminal. The safest thing is to keep her in the brig and ignore her until she can be handed off to the man who wants her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the situation grows more complicated when other bounty hunters show up, wanting to claim Ankari for themselves. Thanks to this woman, Viktor’s ship is in danger, his crew members are going missing, and he’s fighting enemies he never asked for in a jungle in the middle of a hurricane. He’s either going to strangle Ankari… or fall in love. Either scenario could get him killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mercenary Instinct is a full-length, stand-alone novel of 90,000 words. It is part of the “Mandrake Company” series of science fiction romance stories and is recommended for readers who enjoy space-based adventure (such as Firefly) and steamy love stories (in the style of Linnea Sinclair).</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When Nowhere Is Safe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people avoid the dreaded Whitechapel district. For Honoria Todd, it's the last safe haven. But at what price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade is known as the master of the rookeries—no one dares cross him. It's been said he faced down the Echelon's army single-handedly, that ever since being infected by the blood-craving he's been quicker, stronger, and almost immortal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Honoria shows up at his door, his tenuous control comes close to snapping. She's so...innocent. He doesn't see her backbone of steel—or that she could be the very salvation he's been seeking.</description>

  <description>Lieutenant Tamryn Pavlenko wants to make a name for herself in the GalCon Fleet, so naturally she requests an assignment on the infamous Frost Station Alpha, where pirate attacks are a way of life. The remote research outpost holds secrets that many are willing to kill for, and Tamryn is prepared to protect it from brigands, mobsters, and mercenaries—or whatever the galaxy throws at her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The brochure, however, failed to mention the genetically engineered super humans who were supposed to have all been killed in a war that ended more than a century ago. It seems they’re not only alive, but they want the station. Oh, and one of them decides he wants Tamryn too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This powerful warrior might be sexy and intriguing, but he was bred to kill, and she can’t let herself forget that he’s the enemy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This ebook contains the complete Frost Station Alpha serial, previously published in six installments.</description>

  <description>Now that she’s retrieved the Staff of Lore, Captain Alisa Marchenko can finally dedicate herself and her ship to finding her kidnapped daughter. Her scant clues lead her to Cleon Moon. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, since the fall of the empire, mafia clans have taken over the domed cities on the harsh moon, and exploring there isn’t easy. Even with the cyborg Leonidas at her side, Alisa struggles to survive vengeful mafia clans, rogue Starseers, and genetically engineered predators. To further complicate matters, she must worry about the ancient relic hidden on her ship, a beacon to anyone in the system who craves its power. If Alisa can’t navigate the moon’s chaos, she may lose her only chance to catch up with her daughter.</description>

  <description>Captain Alisa Marchenko finally has a lead on finding her daughter, but her passengers want her to take them on their quest instead. Even though the &lt;i&gt;Star Nomad&lt;/i&gt; is her ship, they have power she cannot fight, and she finds herself with no choice but to accept another detour. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the ancient relic they seek has the ability to destroy worlds and is coveted by many. The path leading to it is riddled with competitors and littered with the dead, and even a cyborg and a Starseer may not be strong enough to fight the obstacles in the way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Swept up in a fate she never chose, Alisa must find a way to survive against impossible odds, knowing that if her passengers succeed, they will change the course of history—maybe not for the better.</description>

  <description>The mysterious and powerful Starseers have Captain Alisa Marchenko's daughter, and she will do whatever she must to get her back, even if it means traveling to their stronghold and confronting them personally. Unfortunately, her strongest ally, the cyborg Leonidas, may become a liability since the cyborgs and the Starseers have a long history of hating each other. It doesn’t help that Leonidas and Dr. Dominguez have a mission of their own, one that could jeopardize all that Alisa is fighting for.</description>

  <description>After spending four years fighting for the Alliance, fighter pilot Alisa Marchenko only wants one thing: to reunite with her young daughter. But this involves a journey to her former home world, which has become the last imperial stronghold. Since the imperials have a lot of reasons to loathe members of the Alliance right now, just getting down to the planet will be a challenge, and it doesn’t help that her passengers are stirring up trouble of their own… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even if Alisa is able to land, she may find that more questions await her than answers, and that her late husband kept a startling secret from her, one that could change her life forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;To catch a killer, Riley Jenson will use every seductive trick in the book. But this killer has found a new way to play…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Melbourne’s urban underworld, there’s a nightclub for every fantasy and desire. But for Riley Jenson, one such club has become an obsession. Riley, a rare hybrid of vampire and werewolf, hasn’t come in pursuit of pleasure but of an unknown killer who’s been using the steamy nightspot as his hunting grounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave it to Riley to find the only ticket into the heavily guarded club: Jin, a deliciously hot-bodied bartender who might just provide the key to unmasking a killer unlike any other in the Directorate’s experience. Taunted by a former colleague turned rogue, distracted by an ex-lover’s attentions, Riley follows Jin into a realm of pleasure she could never have imagined. And as danger and passion ignite, a shocking mystery begins to unravel—one where Riley herself becomes the ultimate object of desire…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;She’s a woman, a werewolf, and a vampire, and she’s having the time of her life!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world of sorcery and seduction, the nights bring out the beautiful, the damned, and the desired. Here, Riley Jenson is on her own—half werewolf, half vampire, working for an organization created to police the supernatural races. Trusting her superiors and lovers barely more than she trusts her worst enemies, Riley plays by her own set of rules. Her latest mission: to enter the heavily guarded pleasure palace of a criminal named Deshon Starr—a madman-scientist who’s been messing around in the gene pool for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With two sexy men—a cool, seductive vampire and an irresistibly hot wolf—vying for her attention, Riley must keep focused. Because saving the world from Deshon Starr will mean saving herself—from the trap that’s closing in around her…</description>

Danger has never been so seductive!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Melbourne’s gleaming skyscrapers to its throbbing nightclubs, Riley Jenson’s world is raging with danger and desire. A drop-dead-gorgeous werewolf—with a touch of vamp coursing in her blood—Riley works for an organization created to police the supernatural races. But when she wakes up naked and bruised in a barren alley, she knows only that she must run for her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within moments Riley collides with the sexiest man she’s ever seen: steely, seductive Kade, who is fighting a life-and-death battle of his own. With old lovers and enemies gathering around her, Riley knows she is being pursued by a new kind of criminal.

  <description>A rare hybrid of vampire and werewolf, Riley Jenson and her twin brother, Rhoan, work for Melbourne’s Directorate of Other Races, an organization created to police the supernatural races–and protect humans from their depredations. While Rhoan is an exalted guardian, a.k.a. assassin, Riley is merely an office worker–until her brother goes missing on one of his missions. The timing couldn’t be worse. More werewolf than vampire, Riley is vulnerable to the moon heat, the weeklong period before the full moon, when her need to mate becomes all-consuming...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily Riley has two willing partners to satisfy her every need. But she will have to control her urges if she’s going to find her brother….Easier said than done as the city pulses with frenzied desire, and Riley is confronted with a very powerful–and delectably naked–vamp who raises her temperature like never before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In matters carnal, Riley has met her match. But in matters criminal, she must follow her instincts not only to find her brother but to stop an unholy harvest. For someone is doing some shifty cloning in an attempt to produce the ultimate warrior–by tapping into the genome of nonhumans like Rhoan. Now Riley knows just how dangerous the world is for her kind–and just how much it needs her.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From award-winning author, Ilona Andrews, an original novella, set in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; #1 bestselling &lt;i&gt;Kate Daniels World&lt;/i&gt; and featuring fan-favorites, Derek, and Curran and Kate’s &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; independent ward, Julie.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Scarred, solitary Derek Gaunt has separated from his Pack, and is &lt;i&gt;truly&lt;/i&gt; a lone wolf. With no family he answers to no one; but is fiercely loyal to a chosen few. So, when several of those close to him are murdered, he’ll stop at nothing to hunt their killer through the magic-drenched streets of Atlanta. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Never one to be left on the sidelines, equally determined—some might say stubborn—Julie Lennart-Olsen soon joins in his pursuit; and what began as revenge turns into a race to save the city. Their search pits them against powers they never imagined and magic so old, it predates history. It may cost Derek his life, but there are things for which even he would risk everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;You can run from the grave, but you can’t hide…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half-vampire Cat Crawfield is now Special Agent Cat Crawfield, working for the government to rid the world of the rogue undead. She’s still using everything Bones, her sexy and dangerous ex, taught her, but when Cat is targeted for assassination, the only man who can help her is the vampire she left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being around Bones awakens all her emotions, from the adrenaline rush of slaying vamps side by side to the reckless passion that consumed them. But a price on her head – wanted: dead or half-alive – means her survival depends on teaming up with Bones. And no matter how hard Cat tries to keep things professional between them, she’ll find that desire lasts forever … and Bones won’t let her get away again.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Flirting With The Grave…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half-vampire Catherine Crawfield is going after the undead with a vengeance, hoping that one of these deadbeats is her father – the one responsible for ruining her mother’s life. Then she’s captured by Bones, a vampire bounty hunter, and is forced into an unlikely partnership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In exchange for help finding her father, Cat agrees to train with the sexy night stalker until her battle reflexes are as sharp as his fangs. She’s amazed she doesn’t end up as his dinner – are there actually good vampires? Pretty soon Bones will have her convinced that being half-dead doesn’t have to be all bad. But before she can enjoy her status as kick-ass demon hunter, Cat and Bones are pursued by a group of killers. Now Cat will have to choose a side … and Bones is turning out to be as tempting as any man with a heartbeat.</description>

  <description>An alternate cover of this ASIN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15704001-seduction-and-snacks" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claire is a twenty-something, single mom that grudgingly helps her best friend sell sex toys while she attempts to make enough money to start her own business to give her foul-mouthed, but extremely loveable (when he's asleep) toddler a better life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Carter, the one-night-stand from her past that changed her life forever, shows up in her hometown bar without any recollection of her besides her unique chocolate scent, Claire will make it a point that he remembers her this time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Carter's undisguised shock at suddenly finding out he has a four-year-old son and Claire's panic that her stretch marks and slim to none bedroom experience will send the man of her dreams heading for the hills, the pair will do whatever they can to get their happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: contains explicit sex, profanity and enough sarcasm to choke a horse.</description>

  <description>The author of &lt;i&gt;The Corset Diaries&lt;/i&gt; returns to the realm of the paranormal in this sexy, funny romance that pits Seattle-based Aisling Grey against Drake Vireo, a seriously handsome Parisian dragon in human form. In her job as courier, Aisling is to deliver a precious demonic artifact to a Mme. Deauxville in Paris, but she finds Madame freshly dead, surrounded by a circle of ash. The artifact is then stolen by the fast-talking Drake, who claims that Aisling is no mere courier but in fact a demon lord and his destined mate. Determined to play detective, Aisling summons up a demon only to find herself saddled with one, in the form of a slobbering Newfoundland who wants to go walkies. Drake wants to show her the way dragons mate, and then bodies seem to pile up all over Paris, making Aisling a corpse magnet and top suspect. It's going to take every screwy new ally she's got to solve this murder and adjust to her new life in a strange new world.</description>

But when Jade, an enchanting vision of rippling red hair and eyes of jewel-green, appears at his door to beg desperately for his protection, the Marquess agrees to keep her safe from the villains who want her dead. Jade is infuriating, exasperating, and gorgeous; Caine is noble, strong-willed, and powerful. No woman has ever befuddled him so, nor so deeply aroused his desire. But as Jade answers his knowing caresses with an innocent, wild abandon, they are drawn into a web of treachery that will test the very heart of their love!</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Julie Garwood, whose novels have enchanted millions of readers worldwide, comes a breathtakingly romantic novel about a mismatched young wife and husband who, despite their differences in background and temperament, fall inexorably in love. &lt;i&gt;The Bride&lt;/i&gt; sweeps readers back to the savage beauty of medieval Scotland.... &lt;p&gt; By the king's edict, Alec Kincaid, mightiest of the Scottish lairds, must take an English bride. And Jaime the youngest daughter of Baron Jamison, is his choice. From his first glimpse of the proud and beautiful English lady, Alec felt a burning hunger stir within him. This was a woman worthy of his fearless warrior's spirit. And he aches to touch her, tame her, possess her...forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with the wedding vows, Jamie pledges her own secret oath: She will never surrender her love to this Highland barbarian. He was everything her heart warned her against -- an arrogant, brooding scoundrel whose rough good looks and seductive embrace fire her blood. But when strange accidents begin to threaten Jamie's life and an old rumor that Alec killed his first wife spreads anew, something far more dangerous than desire threatens to conquer her senses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With all the storytelling power and insight into the human heart that have made her one of the bestselling authors of our time, Julie Garwood takes readers on an unforgettable romantic journey rich in humor, suspense, and historical detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A typical day in the life of Charley Davidson involves cheating husbands, missing people, errant wives, philandering business owners, and oh yeah...demons, hell hounds, evil gods, and dead people. Lots and lots of dead people. As a part time Private Investigator and full-time Grim Reaper, Charley has to balance the good, the bad, the undead, and those who want her dead. In this eleventh installment, Charley is learning to make peace with the fact that she is a goddess with all kinds of power and that her own daughter has been born to save the world from total destruction. But the forces of hell are determined to see Charley banished forever to the darkest corners of another dimension. With the son of Satan himself as her husband and world-rocking lover, maybe Charley can find a way to have her happily ever after after all.</description>

  <description>A former smuggler and thief, Ariq—better known as the Kraken King—doesn’t know what to make of the clever, mysterious woman he rescues from an airship besieged by marauders. Unsure if she’s a spy or a pawn in someone else’s game, Ariq isn’t about to let her out of his sight until he finds out…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After escaping her fourth kidnapping attempt in a year, Zenobia Fox has learned to vigilantly guard her identity. While her brother Archimedes is notorious for his exploits, Zenobia has had no adventures to call her own—besides the stories she writes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she jumps at the chance to escape to the wilds of Australia and acquire research for her next story, Zenobia quickly discovers that the voyage will be far more adventurous than any fiction she could put to paper…</description>

  <description>Addie Daulton wants nothing to do with her dark past as an Alchemica alchemist. Content with her new life surrounded by the people she cares about, she has chosen to live with amnesia rather than face the person she was. She focuses on alchemy’s healing properties, helping others and hoping to find a way to save Rowan before his magic consumes him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Addie isn’t the only one with a dark history. Her lab partner, Ian Mallory has just had his past resurrected in the form of his brother. Alexander is a powerful necromancer who has been secretly leading the necromancer community for centuries. He’s not the type to share his power, and certainly not with the Flame Lord. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addie must watch helplessly as Rowan struggles to maintain control of both his volatile magic and his influence in magical politics. Meanwhile, flashbacks tease her, suggesting that the solution to all their problems lies in her past. Unwilling to reclaim her memories, Addie must find another way to learn what she was studying at the Alchemica. Unfortunately, the only person who knows is her former colleague, Neil Dunstan. The question now becomes: how far is she willing to go to save the man she loves?</description>

  <description>The Alliance has toppled the tyrannical empire. It should be a time for celebration, but not for fighter pilot Captain Alisa Marchenko. After barely surviving a crash in the final battle for freedom, she's stranded on a dustball of a planet, billions of miles from her young daughter. She has no money or resources, and there are no transports heading to Perun, her former home and the last imperial stronghold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she has a plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steal a dilapidated and malfunctioning freighter from a junkyard full of lawless savages. Slightly suicidal, but she believes she can do it. Her plan, however, does not account for the elite cyborg soldier squatting in the freighter, intending to use it for his own purposes. As an imperial soldier, he has no love for Alliance pilots. In fact, he's quite fond of killing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alisa has more problems than she can count, but she can't let cyborgs, savages, or ancient malfunctioning ships stand in her way. If she does, she’ll never see her daughter again.</description>

  <description>Listening length: 11 hours, 3 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoey Daniels has been tossed from foster home to foster home, where she grows up fast and tough. When she is placed in her “last-chance” home, she finds a reason to stay and turn her life around: her foster sister, Lexie, who is paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair. Zoey will do anything to keep her safe. After high school, Zoey is hired by a special government agency, the Department of Molecular Genetics (DMG), where she meets the other reason to remain: Daniel, her co-worker. The man she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is something unique about Zoey. She can see fae. Because of this, the DMG hires her to work as a Collector: catching, researching, testing, and using the fae to save human lives. The work never registers on her sympathy radar. She was raised to think of fae as beasts that feed on humans and want to destroy them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When devastation hits Seattle, Zoey's whole world is turned upside down. The electric storm connects her to a ruthless fae, a Wanderer named Ryker, whose dealings expose them to even more trouble and danger. They embark on a journey, running and hiding from both the government and fae, both of which threaten their lives and those they love.</description>

  <description>Anyan may be trapped in an evil dragon and Blondie may be gone, but Jane knows one thing: she's not about to give up. She's ready to tear down heaven and earth to save her lover, despite those who believe he's lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily for Jane, those who've given up on Anyan do not include those closest to her. Defying The Powers That Be, Jane and Company form their own crack squad of misfits, in whose hands the fate of the world may well rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a little help from her friends, the Universe, and lots of snacks, Jane embarks on her greatest adventure yet, confident that with great sacrifice comes great reward. The question is, who will be that sacrifice?</description>

  <description>Nothing says "home" like being attacked by humans with very large guns, as Jane and Anyan discover when they arrive in Rockabill. These are professionals, brought into kill, and they bring Anyan down before either Jane or the barghest can react. Seeing Anyan fall awakens a terrible power within Jane, and she nearly destroys herself taking out their attackers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane wakes, weeks later, to discover that she's not the only thing that's been stirring. Something underneath Rockabill is coming to life: something ancient, something powerful, and something that just might destroy the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane and her friends must act, striking out on a quest that only Jane can finish. For whatever lurks beneath the Old Sow must be stopped...and Jane's just the halfling for the job.</description>

  <description>After a peaceful hiatus at home in Rockabill, Jane True thinks that her worst problem is that she still throws like a girl - at least while throwing fireballs. Her peace of mind ends, however, when Anyan arrives one night with terrible news . . . news that will rock Jane's world to its very core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After demanding to help investigate a series of gruesome attacks on females -- supernatural, halfling, and human -- Jane quickly finds herself forced to confront her darkest nightmares as well as her deepest desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And she's not sure which she finds more frightening.</description>

  <description>Tracking the Tempest begins four months–and one eyebrow sacrificed to magical training–after the close of Tempest Rising. During that time, Jane’s been busy honing her supernatural powers and enjoying her newfound sense of confidence. Rockabill may not yet be heaven, but she’s realized it’s home. Valentine's Day is fast approaching, and Ryu - Jane's bloodsucking boyfriend - can't let a major holiday go by without getting all gratuitous. An overwhelming dose of boyfriend interference and a last-minute ticket to Boston later, and Jane's life is thrown off course.&lt;p&gt;But Ryu’s best laid plans inevitably create more upheaval than even he can anticipate, and Jane winds up embroiled in an investigation involving a spree of gruesome killings committed by a being of tremendous power . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. . . who, much to Jane’s surprise, happens to be another halfling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Living in small town Rockabill, Maine, Jane True always knew she didn't quite fit in with so-called normal society. During her nightly, clandestine swim in the freezing winter ocean, a grisly find leads Jane to startling revelations about her heritage: she is only half-human. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Jane must enter a world filled with supernatural creatures alternatively terrifying, beautiful, and deadly- all of which perfectly describe her new "&lt;i&gt;friend,&lt;/i&gt;" Ryu, a gorgeous and powerful vampire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a world where nothing can be taken for granted: a dog can heal with a lick; spirits bag your groceries; and whatever you do, never-ever rub the genie's lamp. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love Sookie Stackhouse, then you'll want to dive into Nicole Peeler's enchanting debut novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;KINGDOMS WILL RISE AND FALL FOR HER…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Cat” Catalia Fisa lives disguised as a soothsayer in a traveling circus. She is perfectly content avoiding the danger and destiny the Gods—and her homicidal mother—have saddled her with. That is, until Griffin, an ambitious warlord from the magic-deprived south, fixes her with his steely gaze and upsets her illusion of safety forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BUT NOT IF SHE CAN HELP IT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Griffin knows Cat is the Kingmaker, the woman who divines the truth through lies. He wants her as a powerful weapon for his newly conquered realm—until he realizes he wants her for much more than her magic. Cat fights him at every turn, but Griffin’s fairness, loyalty, and smoldering advances make him increasingly hard to resist and leave her wondering if life really does have to be short, and lived alone.</description>

  <description>A post-&lt;i&gt;Ensnared&lt;/i&gt; collection of three stories—available in both print and e-versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alyssa Gardner went down the rabbit hole and took control of her destiny. She survived the battle for Wonderland and the battle for her heart. In this collection of three novellas, join Alyssa and her family as they look back at their memories of Wonderland. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Six Impossible Things&lt;/i&gt;, Alyssa recalls the most precious moments of her life after &lt;i&gt;Ensnared&lt;/i&gt;, and the role magic plays in preserving the happiness of those she loves. Alyssa’s mother reminisces about her own time in Wonderland and rescuing the man who would become her husband in &lt;i&gt;The Boy in the Web&lt;/i&gt;. And Morpheus delves into Jeb’s memories of the events of Splintered in &lt;i&gt;The Moth in the Mirror&lt;/i&gt;, available in print for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This collection expands upon &lt;i&gt;Ensnared&lt;/i&gt;'s epilogue, and includes some deleted scenes to provide a “director’s cut” glimpse into the past and futures of our favorite &lt;i&gt;Splintered&lt;/i&gt; characters.</description>

  <description>After surviving a disastrous battle at prom, Alyssa has embraced her madness and gained perspective. She's determined to rescue her two worlds and the people and netherlings she loves. Even if it means challenging Queen Red to a final battle of wills and wiles . . . and even if the only way to Wonderland, now that the rabbit hole is closed, is through the looking-glass world--a parallel dimension filled with mutated and violent netherling outcasts. In the final installment of the wildly popular Splintered trilogy, Alyssa and her dad journey into the heart of magic and mayhem in search of her mom and to set right all that's gone wrong. Together with Jeb and Morpheus, they must salvage Wonderland from the decay and destruction that has ensnared it. But if they succeed and come out alive, can everyone truly have their happily ever after?</description>

  <description>Alyssa Gardner hears the whispers of bugs and flowers—precisely the affliction that landed her mother in a mental hospital years before. This family curse stretches back to her ancestor Alice Liddell, the real-life inspiration for Lewis Carroll’s &lt;i&gt;Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland&lt;/i&gt;. Alyssa might be crazy, but she manages to keep it together. For now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her mother’s mental health takes a turn for the worse, Alyssa learns that what she thought was fiction is based in terrifying reality. The real Wonderland is a place far darker and more twisted than Lewis Carroll ever let on. There, Alyssa must pass a series of tests, including draining an ocean of Alice’s tears, waking the slumbering tea party, and subduing a vicious bandersnatch, to fix Alice’s mistakes and save her family. She must also decide whom to trust: Jeb, her gorgeous best friend and secret crush, or the sexy but suspicious Morpheus, her guide through Wonderland, who may have dark motives of his own.</description>

  <description>Morpheus wants to know more about his rival for Alyssa's affections, so he digs into Jeb's memories of his time in Wonderland. But he may be surprised by what he finds. This brand-new story and perspective from A.G. Howard's dark, magical world stands alone, but also provides a tantalizing glimpse of what's to come in &lt;i&gt;Unhinged&lt;/i&gt;, the sequel to &lt;i&gt;Splintered&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Alyssa Gardner has been down the rabbit hole and faced the bandersnatch. She saved the life of Jeb, the guy she loves, and escaped the machinations of the disturbingly seductive Morpheus and the vindictive Queen Red. Now all she has to do is graduate high school and make it through prom so she can attend the prestigious art school in London she's always dreamed of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; That would be easier without her mother, freshly released from an asylum, acting overly protective and suspicious. And it would be much simpler if the mysterious Morpheus didn’t show up for school one day to tempt her with another dangerous quest in the dark, challenging Wonderland—where she (partly) belongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As prom and graduation creep closer, Alyssa juggles Morpheus’s unsettling presence in her real world with trying to tell Jeb the truth about a past he’s forgotten. Glimpses of Wonderland start to bleed through her art and into her world in very disturbing ways, and Morpheus warns that Queen Red won’t be far behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If Alyssa stays in the human realm, she could endanger Jeb, her parents, and everyone she loves. But if she steps through the rabbit hole again, she'll face a deadly battle that could cost more than just her head.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Before the curse, there was a promise.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; A prequel to the bestselling Tiger’s Curse series, this much anticipated novella recalls the beginning of Ren and Kishan’s story. Before Kelsey there was a girl, raised by a villain, whose love for a hero changed the course of history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped under the thumb of her abusive and powerful father Lokesh, Yesubai struggles to keep her own magical abilities secret while evading his dark powers. When Lokesh promises Yesubai to the prince of a neighboring kingdom, she becomes the central pawn in his plot to destroy the ruling family and take power for himself. Yesubai is trapped by her father’s threats and desperate to protect the man she comes to love, but she knows that any decision she makes will have dire consequences. As dark forces gather around her, Yesubai must decide if she’s willing to reveal that somewhere deep within her she has the power to change everything.</description>

Ren's life hangs in the balance--so does the truth within Kelsey's heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiger's Quest, the thrilling second volume in the Tiger's Curse series, brings the trio one step closer to breaking the ancient prophecy that binds them.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For centuries, the Others and humans have lived side by side in uneasy peace. But when humankind oversteps its bounds, the Others will have to decide how much humanity they’re willing to tolerate—both within themselves and within their community...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since the Others allied themselves with the &lt;i&gt;cassandra sangue&lt;/i&gt;, the fragile yet powerful human blood prophets who were being exploited by their own kind, the delicate dynamic between humans and Others changed. Some, like Simon Wolfgard, wolf shifter and leader of the Lakeside Courtyard, and blood prophet Meg Corbyn, see the new, closer companionship as beneficial—both personally and practically.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But not everyone is convinced. A group of radical humans is seeking to usurp land through a series of violent attacks on the Others. What they don’t realize is that there are older and more dangerous forces than shifters and vampires protecting the land that belongs to the Others—and those forces are willing to do whatever is necessary to protect what is theirs…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;New York Times bestselling author Nalini Singh takes us into a dangerous and exhilarating world where a deadly, beautiful archangel and his once-mortal consort are caught in a fury of twisted darkness…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most vicious archangels in the world has disappeared. No one knows if Lijuan is dead or has chosen to Sleep the long sleep of an immortal. But with her lands falling into chaos under a rising tide of vampiric bloodlust, a mysterious and ancient order of angels known as the Luminata calls the entire Cadre together to discuss the fate of her territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accompanying her archangelic lover Raphael to the Luminata compound, guild hunter-turned-angel Elena senses that all is not as it seems. Secrets echo from within the stone walls of the compound, and the deeper Elena goes, the uglier the darkness. But neither Raphael nor Elena is ready for the brutal truths hidden within—truths that will change everything Elena thinks she knows about who she is…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing will ever be the same again.</description>

But nothing she’s faced could have prepared her for this…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kate and the former Beast Lord Curran Lennart are finally making their relationship official.

  <description>With three of the goddess Durga's quests behind them, only one prophecy now stands in the way of Kelsey, Ren, and Kishan breaking the tiger's curse. But the trio's greatest challenge awaits them: A life-endangering pursuit in search of Durga's final gift, the Rope of Fire, on the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a race against time, and the evil sorcerer Lokesh, in this eagerly anticipated fourth volume in the bestselling &lt;i&gt;Tiger's Curse&lt;/i&gt; series, which pits good against evil, tests the bonds of love and loyalty, and finally reveals the tigers' true destinies once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A smart phone tag code on the back cover links readers to the series website.</description>

  <description>Feyre survived Amarantha's clutches to return to the Spring Court—but at a steep cost. Though she now has the powers of the High Fae, her heart remains human, and it can't forget the terrible deeds she performed to save Tamlin's people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nor has Feyre forgotten her bargain with Rhysand, High Lord of the feared Night Court. As Feyre navigates its dark web of politics, passion, and dazzling power, a greater evil looms—and she might be key to stopping it. But only if she can harness her harrowing gifts, heal her fractured soul, and decide how she wishes to shape her future—and the future of a world cleaved in two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With more than a million copies sold of her beloved Throne of Glass series, Sarah J. Maas's masterful storytelling brings this second book in her seductive and action-packed series to new heights.</description>

  <description>Librarian's Note: This is an alternate cover edition of ASIN #B00N5XZM7U.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s infamous.&lt;br /&gt;He’s legendary.&lt;br /&gt;Together, they’ll be epic…or a complete train wreck. It could go either way, really…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Psychic and paranormal PI Harper Hall isn't that surprised when her business partner skips town. She never really trusted the jerk anyway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if Harper wants to consult for the police on a high-profile case, she'll need a new partner-- preferably one with some supernatural talents of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noah Riddick, a slayer left jobless when vampires went public and earned human rights, is perfect for the gig. Too bad he’s grumpy, anti-social, and completely resistant to the idea of working with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riddick's dark secrets and shady past forced him into exile from human society--an exile he was comfortable with until gorgeous and exasperating Harper waltzed into his life. Now, all too aware of how unlifelike his life has been, he realizes partnering with her might be the best thing that could ever happen to him…even though it might be the worst for her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fighting vampires, making immortal enemies, staging daring rescues...it's all in a day's work. But falling in love? Well...that's a little trickier. Even for the Semi-Charmed Harper Hall.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"If you love Charley Davidson, True Blood or Buffy the Vampire Slayer, then you will definitely want to read this quirky vampire/paranormal series." --Literati Literature Lovers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Harper Hall Investigations series is perfect for fans of strong, smart, kickass heroines, grumpy, brooding alpha heroes, paranormal mystery and hijinks, and snarky humor.

  <description>As a part-time PI and full-time grim reaper, Charley Davidson has asked a lot of questions throughout her life: &lt;br /&gt;Why can I see dead people? &lt;br /&gt;Who is the hot supernatural entity following me? &lt;br /&gt;How do I get gum out of my sister’s hair before she wakes up? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, “How do I trap not one malevolent god, but three?” was never among them. Until now. And since those gods are on earth to kill her daughter, she has little choice but to track them down, trap them, and cast them from this dimension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s just one problem. One of the three stole her heart a very long time ago. Can the Razer, a god of absolute death and destruction, change his omniscient spots, or will his allegiances lie with his brothers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are just a few of the questions Charley must answer, and quick. Add to that a homeless girl running for her life, an innocent man who’s been charged with murder, and a pendant made from god glass that has the entire supernatural world in an uproar, and Charley has her hands full. If she can manage to take care of the whole world-destroying-gods thing, we’re saved. If not, well…</description>

  <description>In a small village in New York lives Jane Doe, a girl with no memory of who she is or where she came from. So when she is working at a diner and slowly begins to realize she can see dead people, she's more than a little taken aback. Stranger still are the people entering her life. They seem to know things about her. Things they hide with lies and half-truths. Soon, she senses something far darker. A force that wants to cause her harm, she is sure of it. Her saving grace comes in the form of a new friend she feels she can confide in and the fry cook, a devastatingly handsome man whose smile is breathtaking and touch is scalding. He stays close, and she almost feels safe with him around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no one can outrun their past, and the more lies that swirl around her—even from her new and trusted friends—the more disoriented she becomes, until she is confronted by a man who claims to have been sent to kill her. Sent by the darkest force in the universe. A force that absolutely will not stop until she is dead. Thankfully, she has a Rottweiler. But that doesn't help in her quest to find her identity and recover what she's lost. That will take all her courage and a touch of the power she feels flowing like electricity through her veins. She almost feels sorry for him. The devil in blue jeans. The disarming fry cook who lies with every breath he takes. She will get to the bottom of what he knows if it kills her. Or him. Either way.</description>

  <description>With twelve hellhounds after her, pregnant Charley Davidson takes refuge at the only place she thinks they can’t get to her: the grounds of an abandoned convent. But after months of being cooped up there, Charley is ready to pop. Both metaphorically and literally since she is now roughly the size of a beached whale. Fortunately, a new case has captured her attention, one that involves a murder on the very grounds the team has taken shelter upon. A decades-old murder of the newly-vowed nun she keeps seeing in the shadows is almost enough to pull her out of her doldrums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley’s been forbidden to step foot off the sacred grounds. While the angry hellhounds can’t traverse the consecrated soil, they can lurk just beyond its borders. They have the entire team on edge, especially Reyes. And if Charley didn’t know better, she would swear Reyes is getting sick. He grows hotter with every moment that passes, his heat scorching across her skin every time he’s near, but naturally he swears he’s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the team searches for clues on the Twelve, Charley just wants answers and is powerless to get them. But the mass of friends they’ve accrued helps. They convince her even more that everyone in her recent life has somehow been drawn to her, as though they were a part of a bigger picture all along. But the good feelings don’t last for long because Charley is about to get the surprise of her crazy, mixed-up, supernatural life….</description>

  <description>Twelve. Twelve of the deadliest beasts ever forged in the fires of hell have escaped onto our plane, and they want nothing more than to rip out the jugular of Charley Davidson and serve her lifeless, mangled body to Satan for dinner. So there’s that. But Charley has more on her plate than a mob of testy hellhounds. For one thing, her father has disappeared, and the more she retraces his last steps, the more she learns he was conducting an investigation of his own, one that has Charley questioning everything she’s ever known about him. Add to that an ex-BFF who is haunting her night and day, a rash of suicides that has authorities baffled, and a drop-dead sexy fiancé who has attracted the attentions of a local celebrity, and Charley is not having the best week of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tad north of hell, a hop, skip, and a jump past the realm of eternity, is a little place called Earth, and Charley Davidson, grim reaper extraordinaire, is determined to do everything in her power to protect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’re doomed.</description>

  <description>Few things in life can come between a grim reaper and her coffee, but the sexy, sultry son of Satan is one of them. Now that Reyes Farrow has asked for her hand, Charley Davidson feels it's time to learn more about his past, but Reyes is reluctant to open up. When the official FBI file of his childhood abduction lands in her lap, Charley decides to go behind her mysterious beau’s back and conduct her own investigation. Because what could go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, another case has fallen into her lap—one with dangerous implications. Some very insistent men want Charley to hunt down a witness who is scheduled to testify against their boss, a major player in the local crime syndicate. If Charley doesn't come up with an address in 48 hours, the people closest to her will start to disappear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add to that a desperate man in search of the soul he lost in a card game, a dogged mother determined to find the ghost of her son, and a beautiful, young Deaf boy haunted by his new ability to see the departed as clearly as he sees the living, and Charley has her hands full. The fact that Reyes has caught on to her latest venture only adds fuel to the inferno that he is. Good thing for Charley she's used to multi-tasking and always up for a challenge…especially when that challenge comes in the form of Reyes Farrow.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Never underestimate the power of a woman on a double espresso with a mocha latte chaser high.&lt;br /&gt;- T-shirt&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charley Davidson isn't your everyday, run-of-the-mill grim reaper. She's more of a paranormal private eye/grim reaper extraordinaire. However, she gets sidetracked when the sexy, sultry son of Satan, Reyes Farrow, moves in next door. To further complicate matters, Reyes is her main suspect in an arson case. Charley has vowed to stay away from him until she can find out the truth...but then dead women start appearing in her apartment, one after another, each lost, confused, and terrified beyond reason. When it becomes apparent that her own sister, Gemma is the serial killer's next target, Charley has no choice but to ask for Reyes's help. Arsonist or not, he's the one man alive who could protect Gemma no matter who or what came at her. But he wants something in return. Charley. All of her, body and soul. And to keep her sister safe, it is a price she is willing to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charley Davidson is at it again in the sexy, suspenseful, and laugh-out-loud funny fifth installment of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best selling series.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
