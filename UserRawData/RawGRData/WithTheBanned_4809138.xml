  <description>Cinnamon was a princess, a long time ago, in a small hot country, where everything was very old. Cinnamon did not talk. Mango trees, a parrot, and a beautiful room in the palace do nothing to help the teachers who try to make her to speak. Can a man-eating tiger do so, and exactly who will end up in the belly of the beast?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This audio is also part of THE NEIL GAIMAN AUDIO COLLECTION.</description>

  <description>Born into a polygamous community in the foothills of New Mexico, Gentry Forrester feels lucky to live among God’s chosen. Here, she lives apart from the outside world and its “evils.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On her thirteenth birthday, Gentry receives a new violin from her father and, more than anything, she wants to play at the Santa Fe Music Festival with her brother, Tanner. But then the Prophet calls from prison and announces he has outlawed music in their community and now forbids women to leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to play, Gentry and Tanner sneak out. But once they return, the Prophet exercises control from prison, and it has devastating consequences for Gentry and her family. Soon, everything Gentry has known is turned upside down. She begins to question the Prophet’s teachings and his revelations, especially when his latest orders put Gentry’s family in danger. Can Gentry find a way to protect herself and her family from the Prophet and escape the only life she’s ever known?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This realistic, powerful story of family, bravery, and following your dreams is a can't-miss debut novel from Melanie Sumrow.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When a young woman clears out her deceased grandmother’s home in rural North Carolina, she finds long-hidden secrets about a strange colony of beings in the woods.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Mouse’s dad asks her to clean out her dead grandmother's house, she says yes. After all, how bad could it be?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Answer: pretty bad. Grandma was a hoarder, and her house is stuffed with useless rubbish. That would be horrific enough, but there’s more—Mouse stumbles across her step-grandfather’s journal, which at first seems to be filled with nonsensical rants…until Mouse encounters some of the terrifying things he described for herself.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alone in the woods with her dog, Mouse finds herself face to face with a series of impossible terrors—because sometimes the things that go bump in the night are real, and they’re looking for you. And if she doesn’t face them head on, she might not survive to tell the tale.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From Hugo Award–winning author Ursula Vernon, writing as T. Kingfisher.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;The Star-Touched Queen &lt;/i&gt;comes a beautiful lush fantasy, Roshani Chokshi's &lt;i&gt;A Crown of Wishes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gauri, the princess of Bharata, has been taken as a prisoner of war by her kingdom's enemies. Faced with a future of exile and scorn, Gauri has nothing left to lose. Hope unexpectedly comes in the form of Vikram, the cunning prince of a neighboring land and her sworn enemy kingdom. Unsatisfied with becoming a mere puppet king, Vikram offers Gauri a chance to win back her kingdom in exchange for her battle prowess. Together, they'll have to set aside their differences and team up to win the Tournament of Wishes - a competition held in a mythical city where the Lord of Wealth promises a wish to the victor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reaching the tournament is just the beginning. Once they arrive, danger takes on new shapes: poisonous courtesans and mischievous story birds, a feast of fears and twisted fairy revels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every which way they turn new trials will test their wit and strength. But what Gauri and Vikram will soon discover is that there's nothing more dangerous than what they most desire.</description>

  <description>Elise carries a notebook full of tallies, each page marking a day spent at her new public school, each stroke of her pencil marking a word spoken. A word that can't be taken back. Five tally marks isn't so bad. Two is pretty good. But zero? Zero is perfect. Zero means no wrong answers called out in class, no secrets accidentally spilled, no conversations to agonize over at night when sleep is far away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now months have passed, and Elise isn't sure she could speak even if she wanted to―not to keep her only friend, Mel, from drifting further away―or to ask if anyone else has seen her English teacher's stuffed raven come to life. Then, the discovery of a shocking family secret helps Elise realize that her silence might just be the key to unlocking everything she's ever hoped for...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;When best friends Tai and Mila are reunited after a summer apart, their friendship threatens to combust from the pressure of secrets, middle school, and the looming dance auditions for a new talented-and-gifted program.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of Renée Watson’s &lt;em&gt;Piecing Me Together&lt;/em&gt; will love this memorable story about a complex friendship between two very different African American girls—and the importance of speaking up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamila Phillips and Tai Johnson have been inseparable since they were toddlers, having grown up across the street from each other in Pirates Cove, a low-income housing project. As summer comes to an end, Tai can’t wait for Mila to return from spending a month with her aunt in the suburbs. But both girls are grappling with secrets, and when Mila returns she’s more focused on her upcoming dance auditions than hanging out with Tai.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paula Chase explores complex issues that affect many young teens, and &lt;em&gt;So Done&lt;/em&gt; offers a powerful message about speaking up. Full of ballet, basketball, family, and daily life in Pirates Cove, this memorable novel is for fans of Ali Benjamin’s &lt;em&gt;The Thing About Jellyfish &lt;/em&gt;and Jason Reynolds’s &lt;em&gt;Ghost. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Mason Buttle is the biggest, sweatiest kid in his grade, and everyone knows he can barely read or write. Mason’s learning disabilities are compounded by grief. Fifteen months ago, Mason’s best friend, Benny Kilmartin, turned up dead in the Buttle family’s orchard. An investigation drags on, and Mason, honest as the day is long, can’t understand why Lieutenant Baird won’t believe the story Mason has told about that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Mason and his new friend, tiny Calvin Chumsky, are relentlessly bullied by the other boys in their neighborhood, so they create an underground club space for themselves. When Calvin goes missing, Mason finds himself in trouble again. He’s desperate to figure out what happened to Calvin, and eventually, Benny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But will anyone believe him?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A novel-in-verse about loss… and what happens afterwards&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twelve-year-old Birdie Briggs loves birds. They bring her comfort when she thinks about her dad, a firefighter who was killed in the line of duty. Life without her dad isn’t easy, but at least Birdie still has Mom and Maymee, and her friends Nina and Martin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Maymee gets a boyfriend, Nina and Martin start dating, and Birdie’s mom starts seeing a police officer. And suddenly not even her beloved birds can lift Birdie’s spirits. Her world is changing, and Birdie wishes things would go back to how they were before. But maybe change, painful as it is, can be beautiful too.</description>

  <description>Seventh grader Jordan Banks loves nothing more than drawing cartoons about his life. But instead of sending him to the art school of his dreams, his parents enroll him in a prestigious private school known for its academics, where Jordan is one of the few kids of color in his entire grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he makes the daily trip from his Washington Heights apartment to the upscale Riverdale Academy Day School, Jordan soon finds himself torn between two worlds—and not really fitting into either one. Can Jordan learn to navigate his new school culture while keeping his neighborhood friends and staying true to himself?</description>

  <description>A music-loving teen with OCD does everything she can to find her way back to her mother during the historic race riots in 1969 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in this heart-pounding literary debut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melati Ahmad looks like your typical moviegoing, Beatles-obsessed sixteen-year-old. Unlike most other sixteen-year-olds though, Mel also believes that she harbors a djinn inside her, one who threatens her with horrific images of her mother’s death unless she adheres to an elaborate ritual of counting and tapping to keep him satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are things that Melati can't protect her mother from. On the evening of May 13th, 1969, racial tensions in her home city of Kuala Lumpur boil over. The Chinese and Malays are at war, and Mel and her mother become separated by a city in flames. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a 24-hour curfew in place and all lines of communication down, it will take the help of a Chinese boy named Vincent and all of the courage and grit in Melati’s arsenal to overcome the violence on the streets, her own prejudices, and her djinn’s surging power to make it back to the one person she can’t risk losing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Content warnings: Racism, graphic violence, on-page death, OCD and anxiety triggers.**</description>

Melati is strong and it was not easy reading what goes on in her mind while she is dealing with OCD. Recommended.]]>

  <description>Jasmine and Chelsea are sick of the way women are treated even at their progressive NYC high school, so they decide to start a Women's Rights Club. They post everything online—poems, essays, videos of Chelsea performing her poetry, and Jasmine's response to the racial macroaggressions she experiences—and soon they go viral. But with such positive support, the club is also targeted by online trolls. When things escalate, the principal shuts the club down. Jasmine and Chelsea will risk everything for their voices—and those of other young women—to be heard.</description>

  <description>Twelve-year-old Güero is Mexican American, at home with Spanish or English and on both sides of the river. He’s starting 7th grade with a woke English teacher who knows how to make poetry cool. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Spanish, “Güero” is a nickname for guys with pale skin, Latino or Anglo. But make no mistake: our red-headed, freckled hero is puro mexicano, like Canelo Álvarez, the Mexican boxer. Güero is also a nerd—reader, gamer, musician—who runs with a squad of misfits like him, Los Bobbys. Sure, they get in trouble like anybody else, and like other middle-school boys, they discover girls. Watch out for Joanna! She’s tough as nails. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But trusting in his family’s traditions, his trusty accordion and his bookworm squad, he faces seventh grade with book smarts and a big heart. Life is tough for a border kid, but Güero has figured out how to cope. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He writes poetry</description>

  &lt;b&gt;An emotionally-charged new classic about the science of hope, love, and miracles! Natalie's uplifting story of using the scientific method to "save" her mother from depression is sure to take root in readers' hearts!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How do you grow a miracle? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, this is not the question Mr. Neely is looking for when he says everyone in class must answer an important question using the scientific method. But Natalie's botanist mother is suffering from depression, so this is The Question that's important to Natalie. When Mr. Neely suggests that she enter an egg drop competition, Natalie has hope. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eggs are breakable. Hope is not.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie has a secret plan for the prize money. She's going to fly her mother to see the Cobalt Blue Orchids--flowers that survive against impossible odds. The magical flowers are sure to inspire her mother to love life again. Because when parents are breakable, it's up to kids to save them, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An extraordinary story about the coming-of-age moment when kids realize that parents are people, too, and that talking about problems is like taking a plant out of a dark cupboard and giving it light. Think&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;THE FOURTEENTH GOLDFISH meets THE THING ABOUT JELLYFISH.</description>

  <description>Alex has loved scary stories his whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He never imagined he be trapped in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Alex sneaks out in the middle of the night, he becomes imprisoned by the witch Natacha in her magical apartment. Another child in the apartment, Yasmin, assures Alex that she’s already tried every means of escape. Only Natacha holds the bonekeys that lead back to their world, and she’ll never part from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Natacha likes stories. And Alex’s only chance for survival is to keep Natacha satisfied by reading her one of his own hair-raising tales each night. But Alex is running out of time—and original stories—and he’s desperate for a way out of this twisted place.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Breakfast Club meets middle school mystery in this story of six very different seventh graders forced together in the aftermath of a vandalism incident.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Theo’s photographs are vandalized and trashed beyond all recognition, there are five kids at the scene: The Nerd, the Princess, the Jock, the Weirdo, and the Screw-Up.&lt;br /&gt;All anyone will say is “It wasn’t me.”&lt;br /&gt;Theo doesn’t care who it was, he just wants to stop being the victim. The sooner the school forgets the whole humiliating thing, the better. But his favorite teacher is asking the six of them to spend vacation week together “learning to trust” and getting to the truth. She calls it a Justice Circle. He calls it his worst nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;Theo knows everything he needs to know about his classmates, and he’s sure this Justice Circle is going to be an epic and totally mortifying waste of time. But after a few days of sock puppets gone wrong, artificial flesh wounds, and dangerous candy reconnaissance missions, he’s not so certain. As they share their secrets, Theo realizes that he doesn’t know anyone as well as he thought, not even himself. And the truths they share might change their lives forever.&lt;br /&gt;Hilarious, awkward, surprising, and ultimately heartwarming, IT WASN’T ME is a guessing game that keeps readers wondering: what lies behind the labels we wear?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This novel tells the story of a thirteen-year-old who is filled with self-loathing and must overcome internalized racism and a verbally abusive family to finally learn to love herself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are ninety-six things Genesis hates about herself. She knows the exact number because she keeps a list. Like #95: Because her skin is so dark, people call her charcoal and eggplant—even her own family. And #61: Because her family is always being put out of their house, belongings laid out on the sidewalk for the world to see. When your dad is a gambling addict and loses the rent money every month, eviction is a regular occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s not so regular is that this time they all don’t have a place to crash, so Genesis and her mom have to stay with her grandma. It’s not that Genesis doesn’t like her grandma, but she and Mom always fight—Grandma haranguing Mom to leave Dad, that she should have gone back to school, that if she’d married a lighter skinned man none of this would be happening, and on and on and on. But things aren’t all bad. Genesis actually likes her new school; she’s made a couple friends, her choir teacher says she has real talent, and she even encourages Genesis to join the talent show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how can Genesis believe anything her teacher says when her dad tells her the exact opposite? How can she stand up in front of all those people with her dark, dark skin knowing even her own family thinks lesser of her because of it? Why, why, why won’t the lemon or yogurt or fancy creams lighten her skin like they’re supposed to? And when Genesis reaches #100 on the list of things she hates about herself, will she continue on, or can she find the strength to begin again?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An upper-middle grade thriller by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling &lt;i&gt;Nightfall&lt;/i&gt; authors perfect for fans of James Dashner's &lt;i&gt;Maze Runner&lt;/i&gt; books.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thousands of miles south of the island of Bliss, day and night last for 72 hours. Here is one of the natural wonders of this world: a whirlpool thirty miles wide and a hundred miles around. This is the Drain. Anything sucked into its frothing, turbulent waters is never seen again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wren has spent most of her life on Edgeland, a nearby island where people bring their dead to be blessed and prepared for the afterlife. There the dead are loaded into boats with treasure and sent over the cliff, and into the Drain. Orphaned and alone, Wren dreams of escaping Edgeland, and her chance finally comes when furriers from the Polar north arrive with their dead, and &lt;i&gt;treasure&lt;/i&gt; for their dead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of her friend Alec, Wren plans to loot one of the boats before it enters the Drain. But the boat--with Alec and Wren onboard--is sucked into the whirlpool. What they discover beyond the abyss is beyond what anyone could have imagined.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Danny Tozer has a problem: she just inherited the powers of Dreadnought, the world’s greatest superhero.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Dreadnought fell out of the sky and died right in front of her, Danny was trying to keep people from finding out she’s transgender. But before he expired, Dreadnought passed his mantle to her, and those secondhand superpowers transformed Danny’s body into what she’s always thought it should be. Now there’s no hiding that she’s a girl. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be the happiest time of her life, but Danny’s first weeks finally living in a body that fits her are more difficult and complicated than she could have imagined. Between her father’s dangerous obsession with “curing” her girlhood, her best friend suddenly acting like he’s entitled to date her, and her fellow superheroes arguing over her place in their ranks, Danny feels like she’s in over her head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t have much time to adjust. Dreadnought’s murderer—a cyborg named Utopia—still haunts the streets of New Port City, threatening destruction. If Danny can’t sort through the confusion of coming out, master her powers, and stop Utopia in time, humanity faces extinction.</description>

  <description>Hockey is Conor’s life. His whole life. He’ll say it himself, he’s a hockey beast. It’s his dad’s whole life too—and Conor is sure that’s why his stepmom, Jenny, left. There are very few things Conor and his dad love more than the game, and one of those things is their Doberman, Sinbad. When Sinbad is diagnosed with cancer, Conor chooses to put his hockey lessons and practices on hold so they can pay for Sinbad’s chemotherapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But without hockey to distract him, Conor begins to notice more. Like his dad’s crying bouts, and his friend’s difficult family life. And then Conor notices one more thing: without hockey, the one thing that makes him feel special, is he really special at all?</description>

  <description>Nora Tucker is looking forward to summer vacation in Wolf Creek--two months of swimming, popsicles, and brushing up on her journalism skills for the school paper. But when two inmates break out of the town's maximum security prison, everything changes. Doors are locked, helicopters fly over the woods, and police patrol the school grounds. Worst of all, everyone is on edge, and fear brings out the worst in some people Nora has known her whole life. Even if the inmates are caught, she worries that home might never feel the same. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in letters, poems, text messages, news stories, and comics--a series of documents Nora collects for the Wolf Creek Community Time Capsule Project.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A powerful middle-grade novel about the childhood activism of Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X’s wife, written by their daughter.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Detroit, 1945, eleven-year-old Betty’s house doesn’t quite feel like home. She believes her mother loves her, but she can’t shake the feeling that her mother doesn’t want her. Church helps those worries fade, if only for a little while. The singing, the preaching, the speeches from guest activists like Paul Robeson and Thurgood Marshall stir African Americans in her community to stand up for their rights. Betty quickly finds confidence and purpose in volunteering for the Housewives League, an organization that supports black-owned businesses. Soon, the American civil rights icon we now know as Dr. Betty Shabazz is born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collaborating with novelist Renée Watson, Ilyasah Shabazz illuminates four poignant years in her mother’s childhood, painting a beautiful and inspiring portrait of a girl overcoming the challenges of self-acceptance and belonging that will resonate with young readers today.</description>

  <description>A coming-of-age middle-grade graphic novel about summer and friendships, written and illustrated by the Eisner Award–winning and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;–bestselling Hope Larson.&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen-year-old Bina has a long summer ahead of her. She and her best friend, Austin, usually do everything together, but he's off to soccer camp for a month, and he's been acting kind of weird lately anyway. So it's up to Bina to see how much fun she can have on her own. At first it's a lot of guitar playing, boredom, and bad TV, but things look up when she finds an unlikely companion in Austin's older sister, who enjoys music just as much as Bina. But then Austin comes home from camp, and he's acting even weirder than when he left. How Bina and Austin rise above their growing pains and reestablish their friendship and respect for their differences makes for a touching and funny coming-of-age story.</description>

      <![CDATA[A cute and sweet graphic novel about growing up. It definitely showed us some true feelings that teens feel. I suppose the only downside was that it felt a little too short!]]>

  <description>Life is quiet and ordinary in Amal's Pakistani village, but she had no complaints, and besides, she's busy pursuing her dream of becoming a teacher one day. Her dreams are temporarily dashed when—as the eldest daughter—she must stay home from school to take care of her siblings. Amal is upset, but she doesn't lose hope and finds ways to continue learning. Then the unimaginable happens—after an accidental run-in with the son of her village's corrupt landlord, Amal must work as his family's servant to pay off her own family's debt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life at the opulent Khan estate is full of heartbreak and struggle for Amal—especially when she inadvertently makes an enemy of a girl named Nabila. Most troubling, though, is Amal's growing awareness of the Khans' nefarious dealings. When it becomes clear just how far they will go to protect their interests, Amal realizes she will have to find a way to work with others if they are ever to exact change in a cruel status quo, and if Amal is ever to achieve her dreams.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From two extraordinary authors comes a moving, exuberant, laugh-out-loud novel about friendship and family, told entirely in emails and letters.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avery Bloom, who's bookish, intense, and afraid of many things, particularly deep water, lives in New York City. Bett Devlin, who's fearless, outgoing, and loves all animals as well as the ocean, lives in California. What they have in common is that they are both twelve years old, and are both being raised by single, gay dads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When their dads fall in love, Bett and Avery are sent, against their will, to the same sleepaway camp. Their dads hope that they will find common ground and become friends--and possibly, one day, even sisters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things soon go off the rails for the girls (and for their dads too), and they find themselves on a summer adventure that neither of them could have predicted. Now that they can't imagine life without each other, will the two girls (who sometimes call themselves Night Owl and Dogfish) figure out a way to be a family?</description>

  <description>Things usually do not go as planned for seventeen-year-old Noah. He and his best friend Walt (aka Swing) have been cut from the high school baseball team for the third year in a row, and it looks like Noah’s love interest since third grade, Sam, will never take it past the “best friend” zone. Noah would love to retire his bat and accept the status quo, but Walt has big plans for them both, which include making the best baseball comeback ever, getting the girl, and finally finding cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To go from lovelorn to ladies’ men, Walt introduces Noah to a relationship guru—his Dairy Queen-employed cousin, Floyd—and the always informative Woohoo Woman Podcast. Noah is reluctant, but decides fate may be intervening when he discovers more than just his mom’s birthday gift at the thrift shop. Inside the vintage Keepall is a gold mine of love letters from the 1960s. Walt is sure these letters and the podcasts are just what Noah needs to communicate his true feelings to Sam. To Noah, the letters are more: an initiation to the curious rhythms of love and jazz, as well as a way for him and Walt to embrace their own kind of cool. While Walt is hitting balls out of the park and catching the eye of the baseball coach, Noah composes anonymous love letters to Sam in an attempt to write his way into her heart. But as things are looking up for Noah and Walt, a chain of events alters everything Noah knows to be true about love, friendship, sacrifice, and fate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Swing, &lt;/em&gt;bestselling authors Kwame Alexander and Mary Rand Hess (&lt;em&gt;Solo&lt;/em&gt;) present a free-verse poetic story that will speak to anyone who’s struggled to find their voice and take a swing at life.</description>

  <description>In thirteen-year-old Aster's family, all the girls are raised to be witches, while boys grow up to be shapeshifters. Anyone who dares cross those lines is exiled. Unfortunately for Aster, he still hasn't shifted . . . and he's still fascinated by witchery, no matter how forbidden it might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a mysterious danger threatens the other boys, Aster knows he can help -- as a witch. It will take the encouragement of a new friend, the non-magical and non-conforming Charlie, to convince Aster to try practicing his skills. And it will require even more courage to save his family . . . and be truly himself.</description>

  <description>Jonathan Grisby is the newest arrival at the Slabhenge Reformatory School for Troubled Boys -- an ancient, crumbling fortress of gray stone rising up from the ocean. It is dark, damp, and dismal. And it is just the place Jonathan figures he deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Jonathan has done something terrible. And he's willing to accept whatever punishment he has coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as he's getting used to his new situation, however, a freak accident leaves the troubled boys of Slabhenge without any adult supervision. Suddenly the kids are free, with an entire island to themselves. But freedom brings unexpected danger. And if Jonathan can't come to terms with the sins of his past and lead his new friends to safety . . . then every boy on the island is doomed.</description>

  <description>At the start of 1991, eleven-year-old Ali Fadhil was consumed by his love for soccer, video games, and American television shows. Then, on January 17, Iraq’s dictator Saddam Hussein went to war with thirty-four nations led by the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Over the next forty-three days, Ali and his family survived bombings, food shortages, and constant fear. Ali and his brothers played soccer on the abandoned streets of their Basra neighborhood, wondering when or if their medic father would return from the war front. Cinematic, accessible, and timely, this is the story of one ordinary kid’s view of life during war. </description>

  <description>Priyanka Das has so many unanswered questions: Why did her mother abandon her home in India years ago? What was it like there? And most importantly, who is her father, and why did her mom leave him behind? But Pri's mom avoids these questions--the topic of India is permanently closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Pri, her mother's homeland can only exist in her imagination. That is, until she find a mysterious pashmina tucked away in a forgotten suitcase. When she wraps herself in it, she is transported to a place more vivid and colorful than any guidebook or Bollywood film. But is this the real India? And what is that shadow lurking in the background? To learn the truth, Pri must travel farther than she's ever dared and find the family she never knew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this heartwarming graphic novel debut, Nidhi Chanani weaves a tale about the hardship and self-discovery that is born from juggling two cultures and two worlds.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What &lt;i&gt;happened&lt;/i&gt; in the woods that day? Pete Hautman's riveting middle-grade novel touches on secrets and mysteries -- and the power of connections with family and friends.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hatred combined with lies and secrets can break the world." &lt;/i&gt;Grandpa Zach used to say that before he died, but Stuey never really knew what he meant. It was kind of like how he used to talk about quantum physics or how he used to say ghosts haunted their overgrown golf course. But then one day, after Stuey and his best friend, Elly Rose, spend countless afternoons in the deadfall in the middle of the woods, something totally unbelievable happens. As Stuey and Elly Rose struggle to come to grips with their lives after that reality-splitting moment, all the things Grandpa Zach used to say start to make a lot more sense. This is a book about memory and loss and the destructive nature of secrets, but also about the way friendship, truth, and perseverance have the ability to knit a torn-apart world back together.</description>

  <description>In a futuristic world ravaged by global warming, people have lost the ability to dream, and the dreamlessness has led to widespread madness. The only people still able to dream are North America's Indigenous people, and it is their marrow that holds the cure for the rest of the world. But getting the marrow, and dreams, means death for the unwilling donors. Driven to flight, a fifteen-year-old and his companions struggle for survival, attempt to reunite with loved ones and take refuge from the "recruiters" who seek them out to bring them to the marrow-stealing "factories."</description>

  <description>Grisha is a dragon in a world that's forgotten how to see him. Maggie is a unusual child who thinks she's perfectly ordinary. They're an unlikely duo—but magic, like friendship, is funny. Sometimes it chooses those who might not look so likely. And magic has chosen Grisha and Maggie to solve the darkest mystery in Vienna. Decades ago, when World War II broke out, someone decided that there were too many dragons for all of them to be free. As they investigate, Grisha and Maggie ask the question everyone's forgotten: Where have the missing dragons gone? And is there a way to save them? At once richly magical and tragically historical, &lt;em&gt;The Language of Spells&lt;/em&gt; is a novel full of adventure about remembering old stories, forging new ones, and the transformative power of friendship.</description>

  <description>When a tornado rips through town, twelve-year-old Ivy Aberdeen's house is destroyed and her family of five is displaced. Ivy feels invisible and ignored in the aftermath of the storm--and what's worse, her notebook filled with secret drawings of girls holding hands has gone missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mysteriously, Ivy's drawings begin to reappear in her locker with notes from someone telling her to open up about her identity. Ivy thinks--and hopes--that this someone might be her classmate, another girl for whom Ivy has begun to develop a crush. Will Ivy find the strength and courage to follow her true feelings?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From Geoff Herbach, the critically acclaimed author of the Stupid Fast series, comes a compelling new YA novel about basketball, prejudice, privilege, and family, perfect for fans of Jordan Sonnenblick, Andrew Smith, and Matt de la Peña.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Adam Reed, basketball is a passport. Adam’s basketball skills have taken him from an orphanage in Poland to a loving adoptive mother in Minnesota. When he’s tapped to play on a select AAU team along with some of the best players in the state, it just confirms that basketball is his ticket to the good life: to new friendships, to the girl of his dreams, to a better future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But life is more complicated off the court. When an incident with the police threatens to break apart the bonds Adam’s finally formed after a lifetime of struggle, he must make an impossible choice between his new family and the sport that’s given him everything.</description>

  <description>An historical art mystery set in the Roaring Twenties!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s 1929, and twelve-year-old Martha has no choice but to work as a maid in the New York City mansion of the wealthy Sewell family. But, despite the Gatsby-like parties and trimmings of success, she suspects something might be deeply wrong in the household—specifically with Rose Sewell, the formerly vivacious lady of the house who now refuses to leave her room. The other servants say Rose is crazy, but scrappy, strong-willed Martha thinks there’s more to the story—and that the paintings in the Sewell’s gallery contain a hidden message detailing the truth. But in a house filled with secrets, nothing is quite what it seems, and no one is who they say. Can Martha follow the clues, decipher the code, and solve the mystery of what’s &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; going on with Rose Sewell . . . ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by true events described in the author’s note.</description>

  <description>Save the restaurant. Save the town. Get the girl. Make Abuela proud. Can thirteen-year-old Arturo Zamora do it all or is he in for a BIG, EPIC FAIL? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Arturo, summetime in Miami means playing basketball until dark, sipping mango smoothies, and keeping cool under banyan trees. And maybe a few shifts as junior lunchtime dishwasher at Abuela's restaurant. Maybe. But this summer also includes Carmen, a cute poetry enthusiast who moves into Arturo's apartment complex and turns his stomach into a deep fryer. He almost doesn't notice the smarmy land developer who rolls into town and threatens to change it. Arturo refuses to let his family and community go down without a fight, and as he schemes with Carmen, Arturo discovers the power of poetry and protest through untold family stories and the work of Jose Marti.</description>

  <description>Brynn Haper's life has one steadying force--Rachel Maddow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She watches her daily, and after writing to Rachel for a school project--and actually getting a response--Brynn starts drafting e-mails to Rachel but never sending them. Brynn tells Rachel about breaking up with her first serious girlfriend, about her brother Nick's death, about her passive mother and even worse stepfather, about how she's stuck in remedial courses at school and is considering dropping out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Brynn is confronted with a moral dilemma. One student representative will be allowed to have a voice among the administration in the selection of a new school superintendent. Brynn's archnemesis, Adam, and ex-girlfriend, Sarah, believe only Honors students are worthy of the selection committee seat. Brynn feels all students deserve a voice. When she runs for the position, the knives are out. So she begins to ask herself: What Would Rachel Maddow Do?</description>

      <![CDATA[This is such an important book for high school AND middle school students. I think a lot of readers may be turned off by the language and think it too "old" for younger readers but I think the issues are relatable to students of many ages. Dear Rachel Maddow made me cry.

  <description>Twelve-year-old Aru Shah has a tendency to stretch the truth in order to fit in at school. While her classmates are jetting off to family vacations in exotic locales, she'll be spending her autumn break at home, in the Museum of Ancient Indian Art and Culture, waiting for her mom to return from her latest archeological trip. Is it any wonder that Aru makes up stories about being royalty, traveling to Paris, and having a chauffeur?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, three schoolmates show up at Aru's doorstep to catch her in a lie. They don't believe her claim that the museum's Lamp of Bharata is cursed, and they dare Aru to prove it. &lt;i&gt;Just a quick light,&lt;/i&gt; Aru thinks. Then she can get herself out of this mess and &lt;i&gt;never ever&lt;/i&gt; fib again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But lighting the lamp has dire consequences. She unwittingly frees the Sleeper, an ancient demon whose duty it is to awaken the God of Destruction. Her classmates and beloved mother are frozen in time, and it's up to Aru to save them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way to stop the demon is to find the reincarnations of the five legendary Pandava brothers, protagonists of the Hindu epic poem, the &lt;i&gt;Mahabharata&lt;/i&gt;, and journey through the Kingdom of Death. But how is one girl in Spider-Man pajamas supposed to do all &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;?</description>

  <description>A town gripped by fear. A woman accused of witchcraft. Who can save Pale Harbor from itself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maine, 1846. Gabriel Stone is desperate to escape the ghosts that haunt him in Massachusetts after his wife’s death, so he moves to Maine, taking a position as a minister in the remote village of Pale Harbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not all is as it seems in the sleepy town. Strange, unsettling things have been happening, and the townspeople claim that only one person can be responsible: Sophronia Carver, a reclusive widow who lives with a spinster maid in the eerie Castle Carver. Sophronia must be a witch, and she almost certainly killed her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the incidents escalate, one thing becomes clear: they are the work of a twisted person inspired by the wildly popular stories of Mr. Edgar Allan Poe. And Gabriel must find answers, or Pale Harbor will suffer a fate worthy of Poe’s darkest tales.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Darius doesn't think he'll ever be enough, in America or in Iran.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darius Kellner speaks better Klingon than Farsi, and he knows more about Hobbit social cues than Persian ones. He's about to take his first-ever trip to Iran, and it's pretty overwhelming--especially when he's also dealing with clinical depression, a disapproving dad, and a chronically anemic social life. In Iran, he gets to know his ailing but still formidable grandfather, his loving grandmother, and the rest of his mom's family for the first time. And he meets Sohrab, the boy next door who changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sohrab makes sure people speak English so Darius can understand what's going on. He gets Darius an Iranian National Football Team jersey that makes him feel like a True Persian for the first time. And he understands that sometimes, best friends don't have to talk. Darius has never had a true friend before, but now he's spending his days with Sohrab playing soccer, eating rosewater ice cream, and sitting together for hours in their special place, a rooftop overlooking the Yazdi skyline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sohrab calls him Darioush--the original Persian version of his name--and Darius has never felt more like himself than he does now that he's Darioush to Sohrab. When it's time to go home to America, he'll have to find a way to be Darioush on his own.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"Everyone gets mad at hustlers, especially if you're on the victim side of the hustle. And Miles knew hustling was in his veins."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Miles Morales is just your average teenager. Dinner every Sunday with his parents, chilling out playing old-school video games with his best friend, Ganke, crushing on brainy, beautiful poet Alicia. He's even got a scholarship spot at the prestigious Brooklyn Visions Academy. Oh yeah, and he's Spider Man.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But lately, Miles's spidey-sense has been on the fritz. When a misunderstanding leads to his suspension from school, Miles begins to question his abilities. After all, his dad and uncle were Brooklyn jack-boys with criminal records. Maybe kids like Miles aren't meant to be superheroes. Maybe Miles should take his dad's advice and focus on saving himself.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Miles tries to get his school life back on track, he can't shake the vivid nightmares that continue to haunt him. Nor can he avoid the relentless buzz of his spidey-sense every day in history class, amidst his teacher's lectures on the historical "benefits" of slavery and the modern-day prison system. But after his scholarship is threatened, Miles uncovers a chilling plot, one that puts his friends, his neighborhood, and himself at risk.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's time for Miles to suit up.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;9 hours&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When your fairy godmother threatens to enslave you with a curse - when a malevolent piper solves your rat problem but steals your children - when you seek revenge on the prince who turned you into a frog - who can you turn to in your hour of need? The band of scoundrels known far and wide as the Bastard Champions - the swashbuckling trio who travel a world of legend, seeking adventure and righting wrongs - as long as there's enough gold to be earned. They are Jack, the seemingly unkillable leader whose ever-present grin belies a dark past; Marie, who fights with fury but battles more fiercely to control the beast within; and Frank, the master of logistics, whose cloak hides horrific scars that are far more than skin-deep. As they slash and scheme through kingdom and village alike, the Bastard Champions uncover tantalizing clues to their ultimate quarry: the powerful Blue Fairy, who has made each of their lives a living hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Hand Curses adds a dash of sly wit and a heaping portion of action to the fairy tales you thought you knew.</description>

  <description>Deep within the enchanted woods in the town of Watch Hollow stands the once-grand Blackford House, whose halls hold a magical secret: a giant cuckoo clock that does much more than tell time. But when the clock’s gears cease to turn, an evil presence lurking among the trees begins to come out of the shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lucy and Oliver Tinker arrive in Watch Hollow, they have no idea that anything is wrong. A mysterious stranger has made their father an offer that’s too good for him to refuse. All Mr. Tinker needs to do is fix the clock at Blackford House and fistfuls of gold coins are his to keep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn’t take long, however, for the children to realize that there is more to Blackford House than meets the eye. And before they can entirely understand the strange world they’ve stumbled into, Lucy and Oliver must join forces with a host of magical clock animals to defeat the Garr—a vicious monster that not only wants Blackford House for itself, but also seeks to destroy everything the Tinkers hold dear.</description>

  <description>Lucy Callahan was struck by lightning. She doesn't remember it, but it changed her life forever. The zap gave her genius-level math skills, and ever since, Lucy has been homeschooled. Now, at 12 years old, she's technically ready for college. She just has to pass 1 more test — middle school!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy's grandma insists: Go to middle school for 1 year. Make 1 friend. Join 1 activity. And read 1 book (that's not a math textbook!). Lucy's not sure what a girl who does calculus homework for fun can possibly learn in 7th grade. She has everything she needs at home, where nobody can make fun of her rigid routines or her superpowered brain. The equation of Lucy's life has already been solved. Unless there's been a miscalculation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A celebration of friendship, Stacy McAnulty's smart and thoughtful middle-grade debut reminds us all to get out of our comfort zones and embrace what makes us different.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; The City has many names... and no name.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Built on an ancient mountain pass, the City is forever being invaded by one nation or another, and every new master gives it a new name. But for the natives, their home is the Nameless City, and those who try to name it are forever outsiders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dreamy, sheltered Kaidu is one such outsider. He's a Dao born and bred — a son of the latest nation to occupy the Nameless City. Cynical, street-smart Rat is a native, and at first she hates Kai for everything he stands for. But Kai's love of his new home may be the one thing that can unite these two unlikely friends. And they will need to stand together at all costs...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;...because the fate of the Nameless City rests in their hands.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>It's been three years since the Virgil County High School Massacre. Three years since my best friend, Sarah, was killed in a bathroom stall during the mass shooting. Everyone knows Sarah's story--that she died proclaiming her faith. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it's not true. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know because I was with her when she died. I didn't say anything then, and people got hurt because of it. Now Sarah's parents are publishing a book about her, so this might be my last chance to set the record straight . . . but I'm not the only survivor with a story to tell about what did--and didn't--happen that day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except Sarah's martyrdom is important to a lot of people, people who don't take kindly to what I'm trying to do. And the more I learn, the less certain I am about what's right. I don't know what will be worse: the guilt of staying silent or the consequences of speaking up . . .</description>

      <![CDATA[That's Not What Happened was a fantastic novel. It was compelling and fast-paced. There was so much to unpack between the characters and their experiences in the aftermath of a school shooting. Definitely recommended.]]>

  <description>Whoever wrote the uniform policy decided (whyyy?) that girls had to wear skirts, while boys were allowed to wear pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sexist. Dumb. Unfair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Girls must wear a black, pleated, knee-length skirt.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bet I read those words a hundred times during summer vacation. The problem wasn’t the last word in that sentence. Skirt wasn’t really the issue, not for me. &lt;br /&gt;The issue was the first word. Girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s the thing:&lt;br /&gt;I may seem like a girl, but on the inside, I’m a boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I loved this book! Liv is the perfect hero—smart, likeable, and brave.”&lt;br /&gt;—M. G. Hennessey, author of The Other Boy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The Pants Project gently and humorously reminds readers that being just like everyone else isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.”&lt;br /&gt;—Ami Polonsky, author of Gracefully Grayson</description>

Quinn and Nick meet and find the confidence to believe in themselves again, and maybe even love.</description>

  <description>Maddie thought she and Logan would be friends forever. But when your dad is a Secret Service agent and your best friend is the president's son, sometimes life has other plans. Before she knows it, Maddie's dad is dragging her to a cabin in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No phone.&lt;br /&gt;No Internet.&lt;br /&gt;And not a single word from Logan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddie tells herself it's okay. After all, she's the most popular girl for twenty miles in any direction. (She’s also the only girl for twenty miles in any direction.) She has wood to cut and weapons to bedazzle. Her life is full.&lt;br /&gt;Until Logan shows up six years later . . .&lt;br /&gt;And Maddie wants to kill him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before that can happen, an assailant appears out of nowhere, knocking Maddie off a cliff and dragging Logan to some unknown fate. Maddie knows she could turn back- and get help. But the weather is turning and the terrain will only get more treacherous, the animals more deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddie still really wants to kill Logan.&lt;br /&gt;But she has to save him first.</description>

  <description>When the California drought escalates to catastrophic proportions, one teen is forced to make life and death decisions for her family in this harrowing story of survival,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drought—or the Tap-Out, as everyone calls it—has been going on for a while now. Everyone’s lives have become an endless list of don’ts: don’t water the lawn, don’t fill up your pool, don’t take long showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the taps run dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, Alyssa’s quiet suburban street spirals into a warzone of desperation; neighbors and families turned against each other on the hunt for water. And when her parents don’t return and her life—and the life of her brother—is threatened, Alyssa has to make impossible choices if she’s going to survive.</description>

      <![CDATA[Dry was an interesting and unique read. It was unlike anything I have ever read before and it was very compelling. For all of those reasons, I wish I loved it more. I found all of the characters unlikable and that really made it hard for me to enjoy the book. I have no idea what I would do in the...]]>

  <description>Camellia Beauregard is a Belle. In the opulent world of Orléans, Belles are revered, for they control Beauty, and Beauty is a commodity coveted above all else. In Orléans, the people are born gray, they are born damned, and only with the help of a Belle and her talents can they transform and be made beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it’s not enough for Camellia to be just a Belle. She wants to be the favorite—the Belle chosen by the Queen of Orléans to live in the royal palace, to tend to the royal family and their court, to be recognized as the most talented Belle in the land. But once Camellia and her Belle sisters arrive at court, it becomes clear that being the favorite is not everything she always dreamed it would be. Behind the gilded palace walls live dark secrets, and Camellia soon learns that the very essence of her existence is a lie—that her powers are far greater, and could be more dangerous, than she ever imagined. And when the queen asks Camellia to risk her own life and help the ailing princess by using Belle powers in unintended ways, Camellia now faces an impossible decision. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the future of Orléans and its people at stake, Camellia must decide—save herself and her sisters and the way of the Belles—or resuscitate the princess, risk her own life, and change the ways of her world forever.</description>

  <description>Chaya Lindner is a teenager living in Nazi-occupied Poland. Simply being Jewish places her in danger of being killed or sent to the camps. After her little sister is taken away, her younger brother disappears, and her parents all but give up hope, Chaya is determined to make a difference. Using forged papers and her fair features, Chaya becomes a courier and travels between the Jewish ghettos of Poland, smuggling food, papers, and even people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Chaya joins a resistance cell that runs raids on the Nazis' supplies. But after a mission goes terribly wrong, Chaya's network shatters. She is alone and unsure of where to go, until Esther, a member of her cell, finds her and delivers a message that chills Chaya to her core, and sends her on a journey toward an even larger uprising in the works -- in the Warsaw Ghetto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the Jewish resistance never had much of a chance against the Nazis, they were determined to save as many lives as possible, and to live -- or die -- with honor.</description>

  <description>A cancer survivor must readjust to “normal” middle school life in this hopeful novel from the author of &lt;i&gt;Star-Crossed &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Truth or Dare&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norah Levy has just completed two years of treatment for leukemia and is ready to go back to the “real world” of middle school. The hospital social worker warns her the transition back may be tricky, but Norah isn’t worried. Compared with battling cancer, how tricky can seventh grade be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very. Everyone is either treating Norah like she will break at any second, or acting weird about all the attention she’s getting. Her best friend, Harper, does her best to be there for Norah, but she doesn’t &lt;i&gt;get it&lt;/i&gt;, really—and is hanging out with a new group of girls, leaving Norah feeling a little unsteady. Norah’s other good friend, Silas, is avoiding her. What’s that about, anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Norah is placed with the eighth graders for math and science she meets Griffin, a cute boy who encourages her love of drawing and Greek mythology. And Norah decides not to tell him her secret—that she was “that girl” who had cancer. But when something happens to make secret-keeping impossible, Norah must figure out a way to share her cancer story. But how do you explain something to others that you can’t explain to yourself? And then, once you find the words, how do you move forward with a whole new ‘normal’?</description>

  <description>Marjorie Glatt feels like a ghost. A practical thirteen year old in charge of the family laundry business, her daily routine features unforgiving customers, unbearable P.E. classes, and the fastidious Mr. Saubertuck who is committed to destroying everything she’s worked for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wendell is a ghost. A boy who lost his life much too young, his daily routine features ineffective death therapy, a sheet-dependent identity, and a dangerous need to seek purpose in the forbidden human world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When their worlds collide, Marjorie is confronted by unexplainable disasters as Wendell transforms Glatt’s Laundry into his midnight playground, appearing as a mere sheet during the day. While Wendell attempts to create a new afterlife for himself, he unknowingly sabotages the life that Marjorie is struggling to maintain.</description>

  <description>A gripping and hilarious middle-grade summer camp memoir from the author of &lt;i&gt;Anya's Ghost&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Vera wants to do is fit in—but that’s not easy for a Russian girl in the suburbs. Her friends live in fancy houses and their parents can afford to send them to the best summer camps. Vera’s single mother can’t afford that sort of luxury, but there's one summer camp in her price range—Russian summer camp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vera is sure she's found the one place she can fit in, but camp is far from what she imagined. And nothing could prepare her for all the "cool girl" drama, endless Russian history lessons, and outhouses straight out of nightmares!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of Raina Telgemeier, Cece Bell, and Victoria Jamieson, Vera Brosgol's &lt;i&gt;Be Prepared&lt;/i&gt; is a funny and relatable middle-grade graphic novel about navigating your own culture, struggling to belong, and the value of true friendship.</description>

  <description>The first month of school, thirteen-year-old Anna Collette finds herself…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dumped&lt;/i&gt; by her best friend, Dani, who suddenly wants to spend eighth grade “hanging out with different people.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deserted&lt;/i&gt; by her mom, who’s in the hospital recovering from a suicide attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trapped&lt;/i&gt; in a house with her dad, a new baby sister, and a stepmother young enough to wear her Delta Delta Delta sweatshirt with pride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stuck&lt;/i&gt; at a lunch table with Shawna the Eyebrow Plucker and Sarabeth the Irish Stepper because she has no one else to sit with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if all isn’t lost? What if Anna’s mom didn’t exactly mean to leave her? What if Anna’s stepmother is cooler than she thought? What if the misfit lunch table isn’t such a bad fit after all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With help from some unlikely sources, including a crazy girl-band talent show act, Anna just may find herself on the road to okay.</description>

  <description>Jane McKeene was born two days before the dead began to walk the battlefields of Gettysburg and Chancellorsville—derailing the War Between the States and changing America forever. In this new nation, safety for all depends on the work of a few, and laws like the Native and Negro Reeducation Act require certain children attend combat schools to learn to put down the dead. But there are also opportunities—and Jane is studying to become an Attendant, trained in both weaponry and etiquette to protect the well-to-do. It’s a chance for a better life for Negro girls like Jane. After all, not even being the daughter of a wealthy white Southern woman could save her from society’s expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that’s not a life Jane wants. Almost finished with her education at Miss Preston’s School of Combat in Baltimore, Jane is set on returning to her Kentucky home and doesn’t pay much mind to the politics of the eastern cities, with their talk of returning America to the glory of its days before the dead rose. But when families around Baltimore County begin to go missing, Jane is caught in the middle of a conspiracy, one that finds her in a desperate fight for her life against some powerful enemies. And the restless dead, it would seem, are the least of her problems.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1945, and the world is in the grip of war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hideki lives on the island of Okinawa, near Japan. When WWII crashes onto his shores, Hideki is drafted into the Blood and Iron Student Corps to fight for the Japanese army. He is handed a grenade and a set of instructions: Don't come back until you've killed an American soldier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ray, a young American Marine, has just landed on Okinawa. He doesn't know what to expect -- or if he'll make it out alive. He just knows that the enemy is everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hideki and Ray each fight their way across the island, surviving heart-pounding ambushes and dangerous traps. But when the two of them collide in the middle of the battle, the choices they make in that instant will change everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;Refugee&lt;/i&gt; comes this high-octane story of how fear can tear us apart, and how hope can tie us back together.</description>

  <description>Ok Lee knows it’s his responsibility to help pay the bills. With his father gone and his mother working three jobs and still barely making ends meet, there’s really no other choice. If only he could win the cash prize at the school talent contest! But he can’t sing or dance, and has no magic up his sleeves, so he tries the next best thing: a hair braiding business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s too bad the girls at school can’t pay him much, and he’s being befriended against his will by Mickey McDonald, the unusual girl with a larger-than-life personality. Who needs friends? They’d only distract from his mission, and Ok believes life is better on his own. Then there’s Asa Banks, the most popular boy in their grade, who’s got it out for Ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the pushy deacon at their Korean church starts wooing Ok’s mom, it’s the last straw. Ok has to come up with an exit strategy—fast.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Spensa's world has been under attack for decades.&lt;/b&gt; Now pilots are the heroes of what's left of the human race, and becoming one has always been Spensa's dream. Since she was a little girl, she has imagined soaring skyward and proving her bravery. But her fate is intertwined with that of her father's—a pilot himself who was killed years ago when he abruptly deserted his team, leaving Spensa the daughter of a coward, her chances of attending Flight School slim to none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one will let Spensa forget what her father did, yet fate works in mysterious ways. Flight school might be a long shot, but she is determined to fly. And an accidental discovery in a long-forgotten cavern might just provide her with a way to claim the stars.</description>

  <description>Seventeen year-old Britta Flannery is at ease only in the woods with her dagger and bow. She spends her days tracking criminals alongside her father, the legendary bounty hunter for the King of Malam—that is, until her father is murdered. Now outcast and alone and having no rights to her father’s land or inheritance, she seeks refuge where she feels most safe: the Ever Woods. When Britta is caught poaching by the royal guard, instead of facing the noose she is offered a deal: her freedom in exchange for her father’s killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it’s not so simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alleged killer is none other than Cohen McKay, her father’s former apprentice. The only friend she’s ever known. The boy she once loved who broke her heart. She must go on a dangerous quest in a world of warring kingdoms, mad kings, and dark magic to find the real killer. But Britta wields more power than she knows. And soon she will learn what has always made her different will make her a daunting and dangerous force.</description>

  <description>In a bid for more power, the Shadow Queen of Haradis has unleashed a malignant force into the world. Her son Brishen, younger prince of the Kai royal house, suddenly finds himself ruler of a kingdom blighted by a diseased darkness and on the brink of war. His human wife Ildiko must decide if she will give up the man she loves in order to secure his throne. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three enemy kingdoms must unite to save each other, and a one-eyed, reluctant king must raise an army of the dead to defeat an army of the damned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tale of alliance and sacrifice.</description>

  <description>Odessa is one of Karthia's master necromancers, catering to the kingdom's ruling Dead. Whenever a noble dies, it's Odessa's job to raise them by retrieving their souls from a dreamy and dangerous shadow world called the Deadlands. But there is a cost to being raised--the Dead must remain shrouded, or risk transforming into zombie-like monsters known as Shades. If even a hint of flesh is exposed, the grotesque transformation will begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dramatic uptick in Shade attacks raises suspicions and fears among Odessa's necromancer community. Soon a crushing loss of one of their own reveals a disturbing conspiracy: someone is intentionally creating Shades by tearing shrouds from the Dead--and training them to attack. Odessa is faced with a terrifying question: What if her necromancer's magic is the weapon that brings Karthia to its knees?</description>

      <![CDATA[What a disappointment. Total lack of world and character building. I found the secondary characters more interesting than our main character, and they had very little in the way of backstory. The villain was incredibly obvious and the romances were random and forced. [spoilers removed] I will say...]]>

  <description>Three different kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One mission in common: ESCAPE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josef is a Jewish boy in 1930s Nazi Germany. With the threat of concentration camps looming, he and his family board a ship bound for the other side of the world…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isabel is a Cuban girl in 1994. With riots and unrest plaguing her country, she and her family set out on a raft, hoping to find safety and freedom in America…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mahmoud is a Syrian boy in 2015. With his homeland torn apart by violence and destruction, he and his family begin a long trek toward Europe…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three young people will go on harrowing journeys in search of refuge. All will face unimaginable dangers–from drownings to bombings to betrayals. But for each of them, there is always the hope of tomorrow. And although Josef, Isabel, and Mahmoud are separated by continents and decades, surprising connections will tie their stories together in the end.</description>

  <description>MEET KIRANMALA: INTERDIMENSIONAL DEMON SLAYER&lt;br /&gt;(Only she doesn't know it yet.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the morning of her twelfth birthday, Kiranmala is just a regular sixth grader living in Parsippany, New Jersey... until her parents mysteriously vanish and a drooling rakkhosh demon slams through her kitchen, determined to eat her alive. Turns out there might be some truth to her parents' fantastical stories-like how Kiranmala is a real Indian princess and how she comes from a secret place not of this world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To complicate matters, two crush-worthy princes ring her doorbell, insisting they've come to rescue her. Suddenly, Kiran is swept into another dimension full of magic, winged horses, moving maps, and annoying, talking birds. There she must solve riddles and battle demons all while avoiding the Serpent King of the underworld and the Rakkhoshi Queen in order to find her parents and basically save New Jersey, her entire world, and everything beyond it...</description>

The writing flowed well and even though it was a brand new “world” to me, it all made sense. I thought the humor was adorable and the relationship be...]]>

  <description>It's 1947, and India, newly independent of British rule, has been separated into two countries: Pakistan and India. The divide has created much tension between Hindus and Muslims, and hundreds of thousands are killed crossing borders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half-Muslim, half-Hindu twelve-year-old Nisha doesn't know where she belongs, or what her country is anymore. When Papa decides it's too dangerous to stay in what is now Pakistan, Nisha and her family become refugees and embark first by train but later on foot to reach her new home. The journey is long, difficult, and dangerous, and after losing her mother as a baby, Nisha can't imagine losing her homeland, too. But even if her country has been ripped apart, Nisha still believes in the possibility of putting herself back together.</description>

  <description>Alfonso Jones can’t wait to play the role of Hamlet in his school’s hip-hop rendition of the classic Shakespearean play. He also wants to let his best friend, Danetta, know how he really feels about her. But as he is buying his first suit, an off-duty police officer mistakes a clothes hanger for a gun, and he shoots Alfonso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Alfonso wakes up in the afterlife, he’s on a ghost train guided by well-known victims of police shootings, who teach him what he needs to know about this subterranean spiritual world. Meanwhile, Alfonso’s family and friends struggle with their grief and seek justice for Alfonso in the streets. As they confront their new realities, both Alfonso and those he loves realize the work that lies ahead in the fight for justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first graphic novel for young readers to focus on police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement, as in Hamlet, the dead shall speak—and the living yield even more surprises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foreword by Bryan Stevenson, Executive Director of the Equal Justice Initiative and author of Just Mercy</description>

  <description>Paris, at the dawn of the modern age:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince Sebastian is looking for a bride―or rather, his parents are looking for one for him. Sebastian is too busy hiding his secret life from everyone. At night he puts on daring dresses and takes Paris by storm as the fabulous Lady Crystallia―the hottest fashion icon in the world capital of fashion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian’s secret weapon (and best friend) is the brilliant dressmaker Frances―one of only two people who know the truth: sometimes this boy wears dresses. But Frances dreams of greatness, and being someone’s secret weapon means being a secret. Forever. How long can Frances defer her dreams to protect a friend? Jen Wang weaves an exuberantly romantic tale of identity, young love, art, and family. A fairy tale for any age, &lt;i&gt;The Prince and the Dressmaker&lt;/i&gt; will steal your heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A boy tries to steer a safe path through the projects in Harlem in the wake of his brother’s death in this outstanding debut novel that celebrates community and creativity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s Christmas Eve in Harlem, but twelve-year-old Lolly Rachpaul and his mom aren’t celebrating. They’re still reeling from his older brother’s death in a gang-related shooting just a few months earlier. Then Lolly’s mother’s girlfriend brings him a gift that will change everything: two enormous bags filled with Legos. Lolly’s always loved Legos, and he prides himself on following the kit instructions exactly. Now, faced with a pile of building blocks and no instructions, Lolly must find his own way forward.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His path isn’t clear—and the pressure to join a “crew,” as his brother did, is always there. When Lolly and his friend are beaten up and robbed, joining a crew almost seems like the safe choice. But building a fantastical Lego city at the community center provides Lolly with an escape—and an unexpected bridge back to the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;David Barclay Moore paints a powerful portrait of a boy teetering on the edge—of adolescence, of grief, of violence—and shows how Lolly’s inventive spirit helps him build a life with firm foundations and open doors.</description>

      <![CDATA[The Stars Beneath Our Feet was a really fantastic novel. Perfectly suited for a middle grade audience, it included some tough but realistic plot points that were well developed. The relationships throughout the novel were realistic and believable. Definitely recommended. ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;All the world's a stage . . . but what happens behind the curtain is pure magic literally! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jory transfers to an all-boys private high school, he's taken in by the only ones who don't treat him like a new kid, the lowly stage crew known as the Backstagers. Not only does he gain great, lifetime friends, Jory is also introduced to an entire magical world that lives beyond the curtain. With the unpredictable twists and turns of the underground world, the Backstagers venture into the unknown, determined to put together the best play their high school has ever seen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Tynion IV (&lt;i&gt;Detective Comics, The Woods&lt;/i&gt;) teams up with artist Rian Sygh (&lt;i&gt;Munchkin, Stolen Forest&lt;/i&gt;) for an incredibly earnest story that explores what it means to find a place to fit in when you're kinda an outcast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collects the first four issues.</description>

  <description>Rydr is on a train heading east, leaving California, where her gramma can’t take care of her anymore, and traveling to Chicago to live with an unknown relative. She brings with her a suitcase, memories both happy and sad, and a box containing something very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Rydr meets her fellow passengers and learns their stories, her own past begins to emerge. And as much as Rydr may want to forget about her life in California, on the train she finds that maybe her past can help her deal with her present. And maybe hope and forgiveness are all around her and, most important, within her, if she’s willing to look for it.</description>

      <![CDATA[Train I Ride was sweet. It was very short and therefore hard to really feel deeply for any of the relationships made. Despite this, I still felt emotional during certain moments. I didn’t love the end, and I worry for our main character, but her strength absolutely shone through. ]]>

  <description>A girl with Tourette syndrome starts a new school and tries to hide her quirks in this debut middle-grade novel in verse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astronomy-loving Calliope June has Tourette syndrome, so she sometimes makes faces or noises that she doesn't mean to make. When she and her mother move yet again, she tries to hide her TS. But it isn't long before the kids at her new school realize she's different. Only Calli's neighbor, who is also the popular student body president, sees her as she truly is—an interesting person and a good friend. But is he brave enough to take their friendship public? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Calli navigates school, she must also face her mother's new relationship and the fact that she might be moving, again, just as she starts to make friends and finally accept her differences.</description>

      <![CDATA[Forget Me Not was a beautiful and sweet novel. Being written in verse portrayed the voice of our main character very well and I really felt for her while reading.

  <description>Charlie wishes his life could be as predictable and simple as chicken nuggets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it usually is. He has his clean room, his carefully organized bird books and art supplies, his favorite foods, and comfortable routines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But life has been unraveling since his war journalist father was injured in Afghanistan. And when Dad gets sent across country for medical treatment, Charlie must reluctantly travel to meet him. With his boy-crazy sister, unruly twin brothers, and a mysterious new family friend at the wheel, the journey looks anything but smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Charlie decides to try and spot all the birds that he and his dad had been hoping to see together in the wild. If he can complete the Someday Birds list for Dad, then maybe, just maybe, things will turn out okay...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Equal parts madcap road trip, coming-of-age story for an unusual boy, and portrait of a family overcoming a crisis.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What happens when the keeper of your most embarrassing secrets starts dating your dad?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sofia wonders if 14 might be the worst possible age to lose your mom. Talking with her dad about puberty and s-e-x is super-awkward (even though he is a gynecologist). And when she wants to talk about her mom, her friends don't know what to say and her dad gets sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sofia discovers Dear Kate, an advice columnist from Fifteen magazine, she’s grateful to have someone to confide in about everything from crushes to mourning—someone who is completely, wonderfully anonymous. It feels ideal—until Sofia’s dad introduces her to his new girlfriend, Katherine Baird, a.k.a., Dear Kate…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;The Speed of Life&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;em&gt;The Speed of Life&lt;/em&gt; is the kind of book that you want to read speedily, all at once, because the characters are so engaging, the voice of the narrator pitch perfect, the situations convincingly real and raw, the humor and liveliness of the prose such fun to follow, and the feelings of that time in a teenager's life when everything can go from awful to awesome in a heartbeat are so vividly captured. You won't want to put it down. But my advice is slow down and savor this delightful book, full of carino, funny and heartfelt, and (spoiler alert) not just for teens." -Julia Alvarez, award-winning, bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;In the Time of the Butterflies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Carol Weston's Sofia moves beyond sorrow to all the possibilities of teen life in this wonderful book that takes us from loss to laughter."--Richard Peck, Newbery Gold Medalist for A Year Down Yonder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"</description>

  <description>Emmy's dad disappeared years ago, and with her mother too busy to parent, she's shipped off to Wellsworth, a prestigious boarding school in England. But right before she leaves, a mysterious box arrives full of medallions and a note reading: These belonged to your father. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as she's settling into life at Wellsworth, Emmy begins to find the strange symbols from the medallions etched into the walls and stumbles upon the school's super-secret society, The Order of Black Hollow Lane. As Emmy and her friends delve deeper into the mysteries of The Order, she can't help but wonder—did this secret society have something to do with her dad's disappearance?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling adult author of &lt;em&gt;The Bear and the Nightingale&lt;/em&gt; makes her middle grade debut with a creepy, spellbinding ghost story destined to become a classic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After suffering a tragic loss, eleven-year-old Ollie only finds solace in books. So when she happens upon a crazed woman at the river threatening to throw a book into the water, Ollie doesn't think--she just acts, stealing the book and running away. As she begins to read the slender volume, Ollie discovers a chilling story about a girl named Beth, the two brothers who both loved her, and a peculiar deal made with "the smiling man," a sinister specter who grants your most tightly held wish, but only for the ultimate price. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ollie is captivated by the tale until her school trip the next day to Smoke Hollow, a local farm with a haunting history all its own. There she stumbles upon the graves of the very people she's been reading about. Could it be the story about the smiling man is true? Ollie doesn't have too long to think about the answer to that. On the way home, the school bus breaks down, sending their teacher back to the farm for help. But the strange bus driver has some advice for the kids left behind in his care: "Best get moving. At nightfall they'll come for the rest of you." Nightfall is, indeed, fast descending when Ollie's previously broken digital wristwatch, a keepsake reminder of better times, begins a startling countdown and delivers a terrifying message: RUN. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Ollie and two of her classmates heed the bus driver's warning. As the trio head out into the woods--bordered by a field of scarecrows that seem to be watching them--the bus driver has just one final piece of advice for Ollie and her friends: "Avoid large places. Keep to small." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with that, a deliciously creepy and hair-raising adventure begins.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I loved Small Spaces! It was the perfect amount of creepy for a middle grade novel. When I first saw the novel I was wondering how it could be "enough" when being such a short book. I am so happy to say that it was just the right length to be compelling and not drag on. The friendships were sweet...]]>

  <description>Lewis Dearborn is a lonely, anxious, "terminally shy" boy of eleven when his great-grandfather passes away and leaves Lewis's family with his decaying seaside mansion. Lewis is initially delighted with his new bedroom, a secluded tower in a remote part of the house. Then he discovers that it's already occupied -- by the ghosts of seven dead pirates. Worse, the ghosts expect him to help them re-take their ship, now restored and on display in a local museum, so they can make their way to Libertalia, a legendary pirate utopia. The only problem is that this motley crew hasn't left the house in almost two hundred years and is terrified of going outside. As Lewis warily sets out to assist his new roommates -- a raucous, unruly bunch who exhibit a strange delight in thrift-store fashions and a thirst for storybooks -- he begins to open himself to the possibilities of friendship, passion and joie de vivre and finds the courage to speak up.</description>

  <description>Denise Farber has just moved back to New Orleans with her mom and step-dad. They left in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and have finally returned, wagering the last of their family's money on fixing up an old, rundown house and converting it to a bed and breakfast.Nothing seems to work around the place, which doesn't seem too weird to Denise. The unexplained noises are a little more out of the ordinary, but again, nothing too unusual. But when floors collapse, deadly objects rain down, and she hears creepy voices, it's clear to Denise that something more sinister lurks hidden here.Answers may lie in an old comic book Denise finds concealed in the attic: the lost, final project of a famous artist who disappeared in the 1950s. Denise isn't budging from her new home, so she must unravel the mystery-on the pages and off-if she and her family are to survive...</description>

      <![CDATA[The Agony House was so great. I loved how there was a story within a story, it added to the entire depth of the novel. I liked Denise, and loved how her parents were not "absent parents," their relationship, especially with her stepdad, was very endearing. It is no surprise that my favorite parts...]]>

  <description>A missing girl on a journey of revenge. A &lt;i&gt;Serial&lt;/i&gt;―like podcast following the clues she's left behind. And an ending you won't be able to stop talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadie hasn't had an easy life. Growing up on her own, she's been raising her sister Mattie in an isolated small town, trying her best to provide a normal life and keep their heads above water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Mattie is found dead, Sadie's entire world crumbles. After a somewhat botched police investigation, Sadie is determined to bring her sister's killer to justice and hits the road following a few meager clues to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When West McCray―a radio personality working on a segment about small, forgotten towns in America―overhears Sadie's story at a local gas station, he becomes obsessed with finding the missing girl. He starts his own podcast as he tracks Sadie's journey, trying to figure out what happened, hoping to find her before it's too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtney Summers has written the breakout book of her career. Sadie is propulsive and harrowing and will keep you riveted until the last page.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A YA murder mystery in which a young reporter must use her supernatural visions to help track down a killer targeting the young women of Paris.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paris, 1887.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Nathalie Baudin writes the daily morgue column for Le Petit Journal. Her job is to summarize each day's new arrivals, a task she finds both fascinating and routine. That is, until the day she has a vision of the newest body, a young woman, being murdered--from the perspective of the murderer himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the body of another woman is retrieved from the Seine days later, Paris begins to buzz with rumors that this victim may not be the last. Nathalie's search for answers sends her down a long, twisty road involving her mentally ill aunt, a brilliant but deluded scientist, and eventually into the Parisian Catacombs. As the killer continues to haunt the streets of Paris, it becomes clear that Nathalie's strange new ability may make her the only one who can discover the killer's identity--and she'll have to do it before she becomes a target herself.</description>

  <description>"The 21-Day Sugar Detox" is a clear-cut, effective, whole-foods-based nutrition action plan that will reset your body and your habits! Tens of thousands of people have already used this groundbreaking guide to shatter the vicious sugar stronghold. Now it's your turn! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Use the easy-to-follow meal plans and more than 90 simple recipes in this book to bust a lifetime of sugar and carb cravings in just three weeks. Three levels of the program make it approachable for anyone, whether you're starting from scratch or from a gluten-free, grain-free, and/or Paleo/primal lifestyle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"The 21-Day Sugar Detox" even includes special modifications for athletes (endurance, CrossFit, HIIT-style, and beyond), pregnant/nursing moms, pescetarians, and people with autoimmune conditions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What you'll experience on this program will be different from a lot of other "diet" programs out there that promote extremely restricted eating; encourage you to consume only shakes, juices, or smoothies; or rely heavily on supplements and very-low-calorie or very-low-fat diets to ensure success. The goal of any detox program should be to support your body in naturally cleansing itself of substances that create negative health effects--and that's exactly what The 21-Day Sugar Detox does. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By focusing on quality protein, healthy fats, and good carbs, this program will help you change not only the foods you eat, but also your habits around food, and even the way your palate reacts to sweet foods. You'll likely complete the program and continue eating this way much of the time thereafter because you'll feel so amazing. After changing your everyday eating habits, you will begin to gain a new understanding of how food works in your body--and just how much nutrition affects your entire life. There's no reason to wait! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sugar is taking over our lives. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But why? And is it only those sweet, refined white crystals that are causing us problems, or could there be more to the story? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Let's be honest: The problem isn't just sugar itself. It's the refined, nutrient-poor carbohydrates that carry tons of calories, but no real nutrition. In our world, these are the easiest foods to grab on the go, but they leave us fat, sick, tired, and downright unhappy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The effect that sugar, "hidden" carbs, and refined, processed foods have on our bodies goes far beyond our waistlines. We can't focus, we can't sleep, we have irrational mid-afternoon cravings, and we can't even make it through the day without wanting--or needing--to prop up our energy levels with caffeine or even more sugar! What can we do to break free from this cycle? "The 21-Day Sugar Detox" is here to help.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A New York Times bestseller, &lt;i&gt;I Quit Sugar&lt;/i&gt; is week-by-week guide to quitting sugar to lose weight; boost energy; and improve your looks, mood, and overall health, with 108 sugarfree recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Wilson thought of herself as a relatively healthy eater. She didn't realize how much sugar was hidden in her diet, or how much it was affecting her well-being. When she learned that her sugar consumption could be the source of a lifetime of mood swings, fluctuating weight, sleep problems, and thyroid disease, she knew she had to make a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What started as an experiment to eliminate sugar--both the obvious and the hidden kinds--soon became a way of life, and now Sarah shows you how you can quit sugar too:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* follow a flexible and very doable 8-week plan&lt;br /&gt;* overcome cravings&lt;br /&gt;* make food you're excited to eat with these 108 recipes for detox meals, savory snacks, and sweet treats from Sarah Wilson and contributors including Gwyneth Paltrow, Curtis Stone, Dr. Robert Lustig (&lt;i&gt;The Fat Chance Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;), Sarma Melngailis (&lt;i&gt;Raw Food/ Real World&lt;/i&gt;), Joe "the Juicer" Cross, and Angela Liddon (&lt;i&gt;Oh She Glows&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Quit Sugar &lt;/i&gt;makes it easy to kick the habit for good, lose weight, and feel better than ever before. When you are nourished with delicious meals and treats, you won't miss the sugar for an instant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"When I quit sugar I found wellness and the kind of energy and sparkle I had as a kid. I don't believe in diets or in making eating miserable. This plan and the recipes are designed for lasting wellness." -- Sarah Wilson</description>

  <description>It's 1946 and author Juliet Ashton can't think what to write next. Out of the blue, she receives a letter from Dawsey Adams of Guernsey - by chance, he's acquired a book that once belonged to her - and, spurred on by their mutual love of reading, they begin a correspondence. When Dawsey reveals that he is a member of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, her curiosity is piqued and it's not long before she begins to hear from other members. As letters fly back and forth with stories of life in Guernsey under the German Occupation, Juliet soon realizes that the society is every bit as extraordinary as its name.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;True Detective&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Exorcist&lt;/i&gt; in this gripping YA mystery debut about one girl’s exorcism—and her desperate quest to reunite with her demon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clare has been miserable since her exorcism. The preacher that rid her of evil didn’t understand that her demon—simply known as Her—was like a sister to Clare. Now, Clare will do almost anything to get Her back. After a chance encounter with the son of the preacher who exorcised her, Clare goes on an adventure through the dark underbelly of her small Southern town, discovering its deep-seated occult roots. As she searches for Her, she must question the fine lines between good and evil, love and hate, and religion and free will. Vivid and sharp, &lt;i&gt;The Good Demon&lt;/i&gt; tells the unusual story of friendship amid dark Gothic horror.</description>

But before they could even leave town, Bina had a new stepfather and two new stepsisters, and a humming sense of betrayal pulling apart the bond with her mother—a bond Bina thought was unbreakable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight years later, after too many lies and with trouble on her heels, Bina finds herself on the side of the road again, the city of her dreams calling for her. She has an old suitcase, a fresh black eye, and a room waiting for her at Catherine House, a young women’s residence in Greenwich Village with a tragic history, a vow of confidentiality, and dark, magical secrets. There, Bina is drawn to her enigmatic downstairs neighbor Monet, a girl who is equal parts intriguing and dangerous. As Bina’s lease begins to run out, and nightmare and memory get tangled, she will be forced to face the terrible truth of why she’s come to Catherine House and what it will take for her to leave...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An epic tale about one grandmother, a giant sack of yarn, and her ultimate quest to finish her knitting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, a grandmother shouts, "LEAVE ME ALONE!" and leaves her tiny home and her very big family to journey to the moon and beyond to find peace and quiet to finish her knitting. Along the way, she encounters ravenous bears, obnoxious goats, and even hordes of aliens! But nothing stops grandma from accomplishing her goal--knitting sweaters for her many grandchildren to keep them warm and toasty for the coming winter.</description>

Hidden hieroglyphs deepen the tale and are explained in an informative author’s note.&lt;br /&gt;         Marcus Ewert and Lisa Brown’s smart, beautiful book is a marvel of sophisticated simplicity, infinitely engaging to examine in detail, and complete with a sweetly surprising plot twist sure to delight young cat-lovers and budding Egyptologists alike.</description>

  <description>What a promise! Actually, promises. First, here’s a book that teaches kids all about the fascinating world of bees. Second, fun exercises, activities, and illustrations engage the imagination and offer a deeper understanding of bee life and bee behavior. Third, by following a few simple steps including removing the book’s cover and taping it together, readers can transform the book into an actual living home for backyard bees. Fourth, added all together, Turn This Book Into a Beehive! lets kids make a difference in the world—building a home where bees can thrive is one small but critical step in reversing the alarming trend of dwindling bee populations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written by Lynn Brunelle, author of Pop Bottle Science, whose gift for making science fun earned her four Emmy Awards as a writer for Bill Nye the Science Guy, Turn This Book Into a Beehive! introduces kids to the amazing mason bee, a non-aggressive, non-stinging super-pollinator that does the work of over 100 honeybees. Mason bees usually live in hollow reeds or holes in wood, but here’s how to make a home just for them: Tear out the perforated paper—each illustrated as a different room in a house—roll the sheets into tubes, enclose the tubes using the book’s cover, and hang the structure outside. The bees will arrive, pack mud into the tubes, and begin pollinating all the plants in your backyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty experiments and activities reveal even more about bees—how to smell like a bee, understand the role of flowers and pollen, learn how bees communicate with each other through “dance,” and more. It’s the real buzz on bees, delivered in the most ingenious and interactive way.</description>

  <description>She’s your best friend.&lt;br /&gt;She knows all your secrets.&lt;br /&gt;That’s why she’s so dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;A single mother's life is turned upside down when her best friend vanishes in this chilling debut thriller in the vein of &lt;i&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Girl on the Train&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts with a simple favor—an ordinary kindness mothers do for one another. When her best friend, Emily, asks Stephanie to pick up her son Nicky after school, she happily says yes. Nicky and her son, Miles, are classmates and best friends, and the five-year-olds love being together—just like she and Emily. A widow and stay-at-home mommy blogger living in woodsy suburban Connecticut, Stephanie was lonely until she met Emily, a sophisticated PR executive whose job in Manhattan demands so much of her time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Emily doesn’t come back. She doesn’t answer calls or return texts. Stephanie knows something is terribly wrong—Emily would never leave Nicky, no matter what the police say. Terrified, she reaches out to her blog readers for help. She also reaches out to Emily’s husband, the handsome, reticent Sean, offering emotional support. It’s the least she can do for her best friend. Then, she and Sean receive shocking news. Emily is dead. The nightmare of her disappearance is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or is it? Because soon, Stephanie will begin to see that nothing—not friendship, love, or even an ordinary favor—is as simple as it seems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Simple Favor&lt;/i&gt; is a remarkable tale of psychological suspense—a clever and twisting free-fall of a ride filled with betrayals and reversals, twists and turns, secrets and revelations, love and loyalty, murder and revenge. Darcey Bell masterfully ratchets up the tension in a taut, unsettling, and completely absorbing story that holds you in its grip until the final page.</description>

  <description>Kady, Ezra, Hanna, and Nik narrowly escaped with their lives from the attacks on Heimdall station and now find themselves crammed with 2,000 refugees on the container ship, Mao. With the jump station destroyed and their resources scarce, the only option is to return to Kerenza—but who knows what they'll find seven months after the invasion? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Kady's cousin, Asha, survived the initial BeiTech assault and has joined Kerenza's ragtag underground resistance. When Rhys—an old flame from Asha's past—reappears on Kerenza, the two find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With time running out, a final battle will be waged on land and in space, heroes will fall, and hearts will be broken.</description>

  <description>Miss Maggie McCullen has been the keeper for the Port Carrick lighthouse for many years. She has never missed a night, keeping the big light going. And while the people in Port Carrick are grateful to her, they worry about her lonely life at the lighthouse. But they don't know that she has her cat, Sailor Boy, for company. Because Sailor Boy is no ordinary cat. He's a ghost cat. He can make himself visible or invisible, especially when visitors come to call and he wants to be mischievous. But when a fierce storm comes and Miss Maggie needs special assistance, Sailor Boy proves his worth.</description>

  <description>From journalist and author Sue Halpern comes a wry, observant look at contemporary life and its refugees. Halpern’s novel is an unforgettable tale of family...the kind you come from and the kind you create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People are drawn to libraries for all kinds of reasons. Most come for the books themselves, of course; some come to borrow companionship. For head librarian Kit, the public library in Riverton, New Hampshire, offers what she craves most: peace. Here, no one expects Kit to talk about the calamitous events that catapulted her out of what she thought was a settled, suburban life. She can simply submerge herself in her beloved books and try to forget her problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that changes when fifteen-year-old, home-schooled Sunny gets arrested for shoplifting a dictionary. The judge throws the book at Sunny—literally—assigning her to do community service at the library for the summer. Bright, curious, and eager to connect with someone other than her off-the-grid hippie parents, Sunny coaxes Kit out of her self-imposed isolation. They’re joined by Rusty, a Wall Street high-flyer suddenly crashed to earth.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this little library that has become the heart of this small town, Kit, Sunny, and Rusty are drawn to each other, and to a cast of other offbeat regulars. As they come to terms with how their lives have unraveled, they also discover how they might knit them together again and finally reclaim their stories.</description>

  <description>After her family is killed by corrupt warlord Aric Athair and his bloodthirsty army of Bullets, Caledonia Styx is left to chart her own course on the dangerous and deadly seas. She captains her ship, the &lt;i&gt;Mors Navis&lt;/i&gt;, with a crew of girls and women just like her, who have lost their families and homes because of Aric and his men. The crew has one mission: stay alive, and take down Aric's armed and armored fleet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Caledonia's best friend and second-in-command barely survives an attack thanks to help from a Bullet looking to defect, Caledonia finds herself questioning whether to let him join their crew. Is this boy the key to taking down Aric Athair once and for all . . . or will he threaten everything the women of the &lt;i&gt;Mors Navis&lt;/i&gt; have worked for?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this contemporary fantasy, the grieving biographer of a Victorian fantasist finds himself slipping inexorably into the supernatural world that consumed his subject.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American Charles Hayden came to England to forget the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Failed father, failed husband, and failed scholar, Charles hopes to put his life back together with a biography of Caedmon Hollow, the long-dead author of a legendary Victorian children's book, &lt;i&gt;In the Night Wood&lt;/i&gt;. But soon after settling into Hollow's remote Yorkshire home, Charles learns that the past isn't dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the neighboring village, Charles meets a woman he might have loved, a child who could have been his own lost daughter, and the ghost of a self he thought he'd put behind him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And in the primeval forest surrounding Caedmon Hollow's ancestral home, an ancient power is stirring. The horned figure of a long-forgotten king haunts Charles Hayden's dreams. And every morning the fringe of darkling trees presses closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Soon enough, Charles will venture into the night wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Soon enough he'll learn that the darkness under the trees is but a shadow of the darkness that waits inside us all.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[2.5 stars for this one but I'm going to go up because I may be rating it lower due to the book not being what I wanted it to be. In the Night Wood was bleak. It was not a vibrant or uplifting book in any way and where that may have been okay had it fallen on the horror spectrum, I expected more....]]>

  <description>John Connolly thrilled readers with his bestselling novels, "Every Dead Thing, Dark Hollow," and "The Killing Kind." Now he delivers spellbinding suspense as Charlie Parker races to unravel a brutal crime committed in the Deep South. After years of suffering unfathomable pain and guilt over the murders of his wife and daughter, private detective Charlie Parker has finally found some measure of peace. As he and his lover, Rachel, are awaiting the birth of their first child and settling into an old farmhouse in rural Maine, Parker has found the kind of solace often lost to those who have been touched by true evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But darkness soon descends when Parker gets a call from Elliot Norton, an old friend from his days as a detective with the NYPD. Now practicing law in Charleston, South Carolina, Elliot is defending a young black man accused of raping and killing his white girlfriend, the daughter of a powerful Southern millionaire. Reluctantly, Parker agrees to help Elliot and by doing so ventures into a living nightmare, a bloody dreamscape haunted by the specter of a hooded woman and a black car waiting for a passenger who never arrives. Beginning as an investigation into a young woman's death, it is a fast-moving descent into an abyss where forces conspire to destroy all that Parker holds dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hailed as a "master storyteller" "(The London Express)" by critics stateside and abroad, Connolly has once again delivered a riveting and suspenseful story that draws readers toward the horrifying crossroads of the past and present, of the living and the dead. "We are trapped not only by our own history but by the histories of all those with whom we choose to share our lives," hewrites. As chillingly as it is beautifully rendered, "The White Road" is sure to tread a frightening path for even the most world-weary crime fiction fan.</description>

  <description>Miryem is the daughter and granddaughter of moneylenders... but her father isn't a very good one. Free to lend and reluctant to collect, he has loaned out most of his wife's dowry and left the family on the edge of poverty--until Miryem steps in. Hardening her heart against her fellow villagers' pleas, she sets out to collect what is owed--and finds herself more than up to the task. When her grandfather loans her a pouch of silver pennies, she brings it back full of gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But having the reputation of being able to change silver to gold can be more trouble than it's worth--especially when her fate becomes tangled with the cold creatures that haunt the wood, and whose king has learned of her reputation and wants to exploit it for reasons Miryem cannot understand.</description>

  <description>I wrote this story as a tool to help me with writing &lt;i&gt;Hidden Huntress&lt;/i&gt;, and it turned out well enough that I decided it would be fun to share it with fans of &lt;i&gt;Stolen Songbird&lt;/i&gt; rather than leaving it to languish on my computer's hard drive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes place four years prior to the events of &lt;i&gt;Stolen Songbird&lt;/i&gt;, and it will give a taste of what Cécile's life was like before the trolls.</description>

  <description>Anita Blake is about to face the challenge of her life. Into her world-a world already overflowing with power-have come creatures so feared that powerful, centuries-old vampires refuse to mention their names. It is forbidden to speak of The Harlequin unless you've been contacted. And to be contacted by The Harlequin is to be under sentence of death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long-time rivals for Anita's affections, Jean-Claude, Master Vampire of the City, and Richard, alpha-werewolf, will need to become allies. Shapeshifters Nathaniel and Micah will have to step up their support. And then there's Edward. In this situation, Anita knows that she needs to call the one man who has always been there for her...</description>

      <![CDATA[This was only okay. The artwork is beautiful, as always, but the story was lacking. The most exciting thing was to find that there will be more to come. Perhaps once the anthology of sorts is together things will be more intense and interesting. ]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Welcome to the cursed town of Sparrow…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where, two centuries ago, three sisters were sentenced to death for witchery. Stones were tied to their ankles and they were drowned in the deep waters surrounding the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for a brief time each summer, the sisters return, stealing the bodies of three weak-hearted girls so that they may seek their revenge, luring boys into the harbor and pulling them under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many locals, seventeen-year-old Penny Talbot has accepted the fate of the town. But this year, on the eve of the sisters’ return, a boy named Bo Carter arrives; unaware of the danger he has just stumbled into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistrust and lies spread quickly through the salty, rain-soaked streets. The townspeople turn against one another. Penny and Bo suspect each other of hiding secrets. And death comes swiftly to those who cannot resist the call of the sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But only Penny sees what others cannot. And she will be forced to choose: save Bo, or save herself.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was quite possibly one of the best “witchy” books that I’ve ever read. Practical Magic meets Hocus Pocus is a pretty good description. Surprising, heartfelt and atmospheric. I devoured it. Definitely recommended. ]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Never Let Me Go&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Giver&lt;/i&gt; in this haunting debut about a cult on an isolated island, where nothing is as it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, just before the country was incinerated to wasteland, ten men and their families colonized an island off the coast. They built a radical society of ancestor worship, controlled breeding, and the strict rationing of knowledge and history. Only the Wanderers--chosen male descendants of the original ten--are allowed to cross to the wastelands, where they scavenge for detritus among the still-smoldering fires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The daughters of these men are wives-in-training. At the first sign of puberty, they face their Summer of Fruition, a ritualistic season that drags them from adolescence to matrimony. They have children, who have children, and when they are no longer useful, they take their final draught and die. But in the summer, the younger children reign supreme. With the adults indoors and the pubescent in Fruition, the children live wildly--they fight over food and shelter, free of their fathers' hands and their mothers' despair. And it is at the end of one summer that little Caitlin Jacob sees something so horrifying, so contradictory to the laws of the island, that she must share it with the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born leader Janey Solomon steps up to seek the truth. At seventeen years old, Janey is so unwilling to become a woman, she is slowly starving herself to death. Trying urgently now to unravel the mysteries of the island and what lies beyond, before her own demise, she attempts to lead an uprising of the girls that may be their undoing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gather The Daughters&lt;/i&gt; is a smoldering debut; dark and energetic, compulsively readable, Melamed's novel announces her as an unforgettable new voice in fiction.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was interesting and comical in a way. I was told it was unlike all of King's other stories as it was more on the funny side than horror. Unfortunately, I still find King's writing style hard to enjoy as the unnecessary vulgarities take me right out of the story. Perhaps some day I will find...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller answers: What if &lt;i&gt;one simple change &lt;/i&gt;could save you from heart disease, diabetes, and cancer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For decades, that question has fascinated a small circle of impassioned doctors and researchers—and now, their life-changing research is making headlines in the hit documentary &lt;i&gt;Forks Over Knives&lt;/i&gt;. Their answer? &lt;i&gt;Eat a whole-foods, plant-based diet&lt;/i&gt;—it could save your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It may overturn most of the diet advice you’ve heard—but the experts behind &lt;i&gt;Forks Over Knives&lt;/i&gt; aren’t afraid to make waves. In his book &lt;i&gt;Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn explained that eating meat, dairy, and oils injures the lining of our blood vessels, causing heart disease, heart attack, or stroke. In &lt;i&gt;The China Study&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Colin Campbell revealed how cancer and other diseases skyrocket when eating meat and dairy is the norm—and plummet when a traditional plant-based diet persists. And more and more experts are adding their voices to the cause: &lt;i&gt;There is nothing else you can do for your health that can match the benefits of a plant-based diet&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now, as &lt;i&gt;Forks Over Knives&lt;/i&gt; is introducing more people than ever before to the plant-based way to health, this accessible guide provides the information you need to adopt and maintain a plant-based diet. Features include:&lt;br /&gt;Insights from the &lt;b&gt;luminaries behind the film&lt;/b&gt;—Dr. Neal Barnard, Dr. John McDougall, &lt;i&gt;The Engine 2 Diet &lt;/i&gt;author Rip Esselstyn, and many others&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Success stories &lt;/b&gt;from converts to plant-based eating—like San’Dera Prude, who no longer needs to medicate her diabetes, has lost weight, and feels great!&lt;br /&gt;The many &lt;b&gt;benefits of a whole-foods, plant-based diet&lt;/b&gt;—for you, for animals and the environment, and for our future&lt;br /&gt;A helpful primer on crafting a healthy diet rich in unprocessed fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, including &lt;b&gt;tips on transitioning &lt;/b&gt;and essential kitchen tools&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;125 recipes&lt;/b&gt; from 25 champions of plant-based dining—from Blueberry Oat Breakfast Muffins and Sunny Orange Yam Bisque to Garlic Rosemary Polenta and Raspberry-Pear Crisp—delicious, healthy, and for every meal, every day.</description>

  <description>This collection of photographs, history, and firsthand accounts gives readers a glimpse at the roots of mental health. These vignettes are born of the personal stories of those who worked at these facilities, those who were institutionalized, and their families. The authors took the time to listen to their stories and endeavored to understand their past and recognize how these events continue to influence the mental health industry today. Pictured throughout are the physical relics of the places the now largely abandoned asylums of Connecticut where these stories unfurled."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author-illustrator brings readers into the woods to meet two young sisters and a strange bit of magic in this reimagining of the classic but little-known fairy tale "Snow White and Rose Red."&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Snow and Rose didn't know they were in a fairy tale. People never do....&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once, they lived in a big house with spectacular gardens and an army of servants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once, they had a father and mother who loved them more than the sun and moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that was before their father disappeared into the woods and their mother disappeared into sorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of two sisters and the enchanted woods that have been waiting for them to break a set of terrible spells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling author-illustrator Emily Winfield Martin has created a world that sits on the border of enchantment, with characters who are grounded in real emotions that readers will recognize in themselves.</description>

  <description>First published in 2001, &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt; became an instant classic—an intellectual and artistic benchmark from the multiple-award-winning master of innovative fiction, Neil Gaiman. Now discover the mystery and magic of &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt; in this tenth anniversary edition. Newly updated and expanded with the author’s preferred text, this commemorative volume is a true celebration of a modern masterpiece by the one, the only, Neil Gaiman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;A storm is coming . . . &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Locked behind bars for three years, Shadow did his time, quietly waiting for the magic day when he could return to Eagle Point, Indiana. A man no longer scared of what tomorrow might bring, all he wanted was to be with Laura, the wife he deeply loved, and start a new life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just days before his release, Laura and Shadow’s best friend are killed in an accident. With his life in pieces and nothing to keep him tethered, Shadow accepts a job from a beguiling stranger he meets on the way home, an enigmatic man who calls himself Mr. Wednesday. A trickster and rogue, Wednesday seems to know more about Shadow than Shadow does himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life as Wednesday’s bodyguard, driver, and errand boy is far more interesting and dangerous than Shadow ever imagined—it is a job that takes him on a dark and strange road trip and introduces him to a host of eccentric characters whose fates are mysteriously intertwined with his own. Along the way Shadow will learn that the past never dies; that everyone, including his beloved Laura, harbors secrets; and that dreams, totems, legends, and myths are more real than we know. Ultimately, he will discover that beneath the placid surface of everyday life a storm is brewing—an epic war for the very soul of America—and that he is standing squarely in its path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relevant and prescient, &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt; has been lauded for its brilliant synthesis of “mystery, satire, sex, horror, and poetic prose” (Michael Dirda, &lt;em&gt;Washington Post Book World&lt;/em&gt;) and as a modern phantasmagoria that “distills the essence of America” (&lt;em&gt;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&lt;/em&gt;). It is, quite simply, an outstanding work of literary imagination that will endure for generations.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The landmark publishing event of 2015 -- a full-colour illustrated edition of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone with breathtaking illustrations by Jim Kay, winner of the Kate Greenaway medal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, J.K. Rowling's beloved Harry Potter books will be presented in lavishly illustrated full-color editions. Prepare to be spellbound by Jim Kay's dazzling depiction of the wizarding world and much loved characters in this full-colour illustrated hardback edition of the nation's favourite children's book -- Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Jim Kay has created over 100 stunning illustrations, making this deluxe format a perfect gift as much for a child being introduced to the series, as for the dedicated fan. Brimming with rich detail and humour that perfectly complements J.K. Rowling's timeless classic, Jim Kay's glorious illustrations will captivate fans and new readers alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a letter arrives for unhappy but ordinary Harry Potter, a decade-old secret is revealed to him that apparently he's the last to know. His parents were wizards, killed by a Dark Lord's curse when Harry was just a baby, and which he somehow survived. Leaving his unsympathetic aunt and uncle for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry stumbles upon a sinister mystery when he finds a three-headed dog guarding a room on the third floor. Then he hears of a missing stone with astonishing powers, which could be valuable, dangerous -- or both. An incredible adventure is about to begin!</description>

  <description>Six months after the end of &lt;i&gt;Wintersong&lt;/i&gt;, Liesl is working toward furthering both her brother’s and her own musical careers. Although she is determined to look forward and not behind, life in the world above is not as easy as Liesl had hoped. Her younger brother Josef is cold, distant, and withdrawn, while Liesl can’t forget the austere young man she left beneath the earth, and the music he inspired in her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When troubling signs arise that the barrier between worlds is crumbling, Liesl must return to the Underground to unravel the mystery of life, death, and the Goblin King—who he was, who he is, and who he will be. What will it take to break the old laws once and for all? What is the true meaning of sacrifice when the fate of the world—or the ones Liesl loves—is in her hands?</description>

It felt like a lot of random threads trying to come together to create something big and I just don’t think it worked.

  <description>&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Kate Kerrigan brings Dublin’s past vividly alive in her heart-wrenching short story about the forbidden passion between a soldier and a rebel, and the woman years later who discovers their secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When British soldier Clive Postlethwaite wandered into Dublin’s National Gallery, falling in love with a fiery Irish girl was the last thing on his mind. As soon as he meets Eileen O’Hara, he’s instantly enthralled with her humor and beauty. But the Irish Republicans are rebelling against Home Rule every day, and Clive and Eileen may be forced to choose sides, forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally published in the moving collection &lt;em&gt;Fall of Poppies: Stories of Love and the Great War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; this e-book also includes an excerpt from Kerrigan’s novel &lt;em&gt;Ellis Island, &lt;/em&gt;available now.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY &lt;i&gt;PUBLISHERS WEEKLY&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sweeping story told in letters, spanning two continents and two world wars, Jessica Brockmole’s atmospheric debut novel captures the indelible ways that people fall in love, and celebrates the power of the written word to stir the heart.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; March 1912: Twenty-four-year-old Elspeth Dunn, a published poet, has never seen the world beyond her home on Scotland’s remote Isle of Skye. So she is astonished when her first fan letter arrives, from a college student, David Graham, in far-away America. As the two strike up a correspondence—sharing their favorite books, wildest hopes, and deepest secrets—their exchanges blossom into friendship, and eventually into love. But as World War I engulfs Europe and David volunteers as an ambulance driver on the Western front, Elspeth can only wait for him on Skye, hoping he’ll survive.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; June 1940: At the start of World War II, Elspeth’s daughter, Margaret, has fallen for a pilot in the Royal Air Force. Her mother warns her against seeking love in wartime, an admonition Margaret doesn’t understand. Then, after a bomb rocks Elspeth’s house, and letters that were hidden in a wall come raining down, Elspeth disappears. Only a single letter remains as a clue to Elspeth’s whereabouts. As Margaret sets out to discover where her mother has gone, she must also face the truth of what happened to her family long ago.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Sparkling with charm and full of captivating period detail, &lt;i&gt;Letters from Skye&lt;/i&gt; is a testament to the power of love to overcome great adversity, and marks Jessica Brockmole as a stunning new literary voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Look for special features inside. Join the Random House Reader’s Circle for author chats and more.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Letters from Skye&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;i&gt;Letters from Skye&lt;/i&gt; is a captivating love story that celebrates the power of hope to triumph over time and circumstance.”—&lt;b&gt;Vanessa Diffenbaugh, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;The Language of Flowers&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;“[A] remarkable story of two women, their loves, their secrets, and two world wars . . . [in which] the beauty of Scotland, the tragedy of war, the longings of the heart, and the struggles of a family torn apart by disloyalty are brilliantly drawn, leaving just enough blanks to be filled by the reader’s imagination.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly &lt;/i&gt;(starred review)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Tantalizing . . . sure to please readers who enjoyed other epistolary novels like &lt;i&gt;The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society&lt;/i&gt;.”&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;—Stratford Gazette&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “An absorbing and rewarding saga of loss and discovery.”&lt;b&gt;—Kate Alcott, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Dressmaker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “A sweeping and sweet (but not saccharine) love story.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “[A] dazzling little jewel.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;Richmond Times-Dispatch&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Evangeline Holland, author of the Bledington Park series, enchants readers with this poignant short story about a woman seemingly alone in terrible aftermath of the Great War and the man who proves she has more than she ever realized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;War stole everything from Morven Williams—her husband, her friends, her livelihood, and her home. As Paris erupts in Armistice celebrations, she stands on the precipice of her past and her future, and the arrival of a handsome, charming Harlem Hellfighter stirs her spirit. But they share an unexpected link to her past—one that may tear their burgeoning romance apart forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally published in the moving collection &lt;em&gt;Fall of Poppies: Stories of Love and the Great War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; this e-book also includes an excerpt from Holland’s novel &lt;em&gt;An Ideal Duchess, &lt;/em&gt;available now.</description>

      <![CDATA[After You've Gone was decent enough, but I had a hard time connecting with the characters. It could be that this was due to its length, but I just didn't find any of them likable. I will probably look into other novels by this author, however.]]>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Alice and her mother have spent most of Alice’s life on the road, always a step ahead of the uncanny bad luck biting at their heels. But when Alice’s grandmother, the reclusive author of a cult-classic book of pitch-dark fairy tales, dies alone on her estate, the Hazel Wood, Alice learns how bad her luck can really get: her mother is stolen away―by a figure who claims to come from the Hinterland, the cruel supernatural world where her grandmother's stories are set. Alice's only lead is the message her mother left behind: “Stay away from the Hazel Wood.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice has long steered clear of her grandmother’s cultish fans. But now she has no choice but to ally with classmate Ellery Finch, a Hinterland superfan who may have his own reasons for wanting to help her. To retrieve her mother, Alice must venture first to the Hazel Wood, then into the world where her grandmother's tales began―and where she might find out how her own story went so wrong.</description>

  <description>An extraordinary short story from Marci Jefferson, author of &lt;em&gt;Girl on the Golden Coin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; about the fierce determination of one young mother to save her child, and her herself, as World War I comes to a perilous end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only patient left at the Institut Cavell. After having her life ripped apart in every imaginable way by the Germans who have occupied Brussels, having to care for this enemy soldier is Amélie’s worst nightmare. But the note of recognition in the shell-shocked man’s eyes when she speaks makes her wonder. As whispers of rebellious soldiers overthrowing the Kaiser grow louder and louder every day, Amélie will have to trust in the man she believes to be her enemy and risk everything she has to fight for the promise of a new life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally published in the moving collection &lt;em&gt;Fall of Poppies: Stories of Love and the Great War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; this e-book also includes an excerpt from Jefferson’s novel &lt;em&gt;Enchantress of Paris, &lt;/em&gt;available now.</description>

  <description>A brooding and atmospheric Scottish tale from a RITA and RT Reviewers Choice Award-winning and New York Times and USA Today bestselling author. The invincible ninth Roman Legion marches from York to fight the Northern tribes, and then vanishes from the pages of history. When Verity Grey goes looking for them, she may find more than she bargained for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Archaeologist Verity Grey has been drawn to the dark legends of the Scottish Borderlands in search of the truth buried in a rocky field by the sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her eccentric boss has spent his whole life searching for the resting place of the lost Ninth Roman Legion and is convinced he's finally found it-not because of any scientific evidence, but because a local boy has "seen" a Roman soldier walking in the fields, a ghostly sentinel who guards the bodies of his long-dead comrades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here on the windswept shores, Verity may find the answer to one of the great unsolved mysteries of our time.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;From the winner of the Catherine Cookson Fiction Prize, this mesmerizing, suspenseful, and richly atmospheric tale of time travel draws us into the heart of a heroine we won't soon forget...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time Julia Beckett saw Greywethers she was only five, but she knew that it was her house. And now that she’s at last become its owner, she suspects that she was drawn there for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if Greywethers were a portal between worlds, she finds herself transported into seventeenth-century England, becoming Mariana, a young woman struggling against danger and treachery, and battling a forbidden love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each time Julia travels back, she becomes more enthralled with the past...until she realizes Mariana’s life is threatening to eclipse her own, and she must find a way to lay the past to rest or lose the chance for happiness in her own time.</description>

  <description>Neil Gaiman has long been inspired by ancient mythology in creating the fantastical realms of his fiction. Now he turns his attention back to the source, presenting a bravura rendition of the great northern tales. In &lt;em&gt;Norse Mythology&lt;/em&gt;, Gaiman fashions primeval stories into a novelistic arc that begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds; delves into the exploits of the deities, dwarves, and giants; and culminates in Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods and the rebirth of a new time and people. Gaiman stays true to the myths while vividly reincarnating Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin’s son, incredibly strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki, the son of giants, a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator. From Gaiman’s deft and witty prose emerges the gods with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to dupe others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.</description>

  <description>Cerulean Sins, the eleventh entry in the hugely-popular Anita Blake series, finds everyone’s favorite vampire hunter keeping house and kicking butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anita Blake is trying to get her life back to “normal” after a break-up with her werewolf lover. She has settled into a pattern of domesticity, which means that the new man in her life, the leopard shapeshifter Micah, has no problem sharing her with Jean-Claude, Master Vampire of the City. Things are as peaceful as they ever get for someone who raises the dead, when Jean-Claude receives an unexpected and unwelcome visitor: Musette, the very beautiful, very twisted representative of the European Council of Vampires. Anita soon finds herself caught up in a dangerous game of vampire power politics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add to her troubles, she is asked to consult on a series of brutal killings, which seem to be the work of something un-human. The investigation leads her to Cerulean Sins, a vampire-run establishment that deals in erotic videos, videos that cater to very specific tastes. Anita knows one creature of the night who has such interests — Jean-Claude’s visitor. But if Anita brings Musette down, the repercussions could cost her everything she holds dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a sworn enemy of all monsters, Anita is now the human consort of both Master Vampire Jean Claude and leopard shapeshifter Micah. When a centuries-old vampire hits St. Louis, Anita finds herself needing all the dark forces her passion can muster to save the ones she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anita Blake returns to find hell hath no fury like a vampire scorned.</description>

  <description>Nicola Marter was born with a gift. When she touches an object, she sometimes glimpses those who have owned it before. When a woman arrives with a small wooden carving at the gallery Nicola works at, she can see the object’s history and knows that it was named after the Firebird—the mythical creature from an old Russian fable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compelled to know more, Nicola follows a young girl named Anna into the past who leads her on a quest through the glittering backdrops of the Jacobites and Russian courts, unearthing a tale of love, courage, and redemption.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;‘The Ministry of Magic felt strongly, however, that to construct an additional wizarding station in the middle of London would stretch even the Muggles’ notorious determination not to notice magic when it was exploding in front of their faces.’&lt;/i&gt; – J.K. Rowling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pottermore Presents is a collection of J.K. Rowling’s writing: short reads originally featured on pottermore.com. These eBooks, with writing curated by Pottermore, will take you beyond the Harry Potter stories as J.K. Rowling reveals her inspiration, intricate details of characters’ lives and surprises from the wizarding world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hogwarts An Incomplete and Unreliable Guide takes you on a journey to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. You’ll venture into the Hogwarts grounds, become better acquainted with its more permanent residents, learn more about lessons and discover secrets of the castle . . . all at the turn of a page.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;'No Muggle Prime Minister has ever set foot in the Ministry of Magic, for reasons most succinctly summed up by ex-Minister Dugald McPhail (term of office 1858-1865): “their puir wee braines couldnae cope wi’ it.”’&lt;/i&gt; – J.K.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;‘Minerva was the Roman goddess of warriors and wisdom. William McGonagall is celebrated as the worst poet in British history. There was something irresistible to me about his name, and the idea that such a brilliant woman might be a distant relative of the buffoonish McGonagall.’ &lt;/i&gt;– J.K. Rowling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pottermore Presents is a collection of J.K. Rowling’s writing from the Pottermore archives: short reads originally featured on pottermore.com with some exclusive new additions. These eBooks, with writing curated by Pottermore, will take you beyond the Harry Potter stories as J.K. Rowling reveals her inspiration, intricate details of characters’ lives and surprises from the wizarding world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These stories of heroism, hardship and dangerous hobbies profile two of the Harry Potter stories’ most courageous and iconic characters: Minerva McGonagall and Remus Lupin. J.K. Rowling also gives us a peek behind the closed curtains of Sybill Trelawney’s life, and you’ll encounter the reckless, magical-beast-loving Silvanus Kettleburn along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover art by MinaLima</description>

  <description>A duo of Christmas romances from two top names in paranormal and fantasy romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36519773.SUNDAY_S_CHILD" title="SUNDAY'S CHILD" rel="nofollow"&gt;SUNDAY'S CHILD&lt;/a&gt;, Grace Draven heats up a cold and lonely Christmas when museum archivist, Claire Summerlad, meets a mysterious new co-worker. Andor’s past may be a mystery, but is a future with Claire possible with a centuries-old punishment hanging over his head? Father Christmas meets Norse mythology in this brand new Christmas novella from the author of Master of Crows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In LOST LETTERS AND CHRISTMAS LIGHTS, readers return to the Elemental Mysteries in an all new novella by Elizabeth Hunter. Giovanni Vecchio and Beatrice De Novo travel to Rome when an new mystery interrupts their Christmas. Fina Rossi may have been the director of the Vecchio library, but she wasn’t expecting vampires for the holidays! Christmas takes an unexpected turn when she meets her employers’s old friend, Zeno Ferrara. He has the key to solving a mystery plaguing Beatrice’s client, but he's taken a far more personal interest in Fina.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Path to Your Inner Warrior Goddess&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's no secret that women today are juggling a lot. We now make up more than half the workforce in the United States and are busier than ever with partners, children, family and friends, often putting the needs of others ahead of our own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if we feel overwhelmed by it all or fall short of perfection, many of us have learned to be our own worst critic rather than our own best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Warrior Goddess Training&lt;/i&gt;, bestselling author HeatherAsh Amara provides the antidote to the flawed idea that you are not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Direct, honest, and unapologetic, Amara will show you how to release the layers of expectations to finally see yourself for the authentic, perceptive, perfect woman you really are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't love and honor yourself with every fiber of your being, if you struggle with owning your power and passion, if you could use more joyful play and simple presence in your life, then it is time for an inner revolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is time to claim your Warrior Goddess energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on the wisdom from Buddhism, Toltec wisdom, and ancient Earth-based goddess spirituality, the Warrior Goddess path includes personal stories, rituals, and exercises that will encourage and inspire you to become the true warrior goddess you are meant to be.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The first-ever collection of Victorian Christmas ghost stories, culled from rare 19th-century periodicals&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the Victorian era, it became traditional for publishers of newspapers and magazines to print ghost stories during the Christmas season for chilling winter reading by the fireside or candlelight. Now for the first time thirteen of these tales are collected here, including a wide range of stories from a diverse group of authors, some well-known, others anonymous or forgotten. Readers whose only previous experience with Victorian Christmas ghost stories has been Charles Dickens’s “A Christmas Carol” will be surprised and delighted at the astonishing variety of ghostly tales in this volume. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“In the sickly light I saw it lying on the bed, with its grim head on the pillow. A man? Or a corpse arisen from its unhallowed grave, and awaiting the demon that animated it?” - John Berwick Harwood, “Horror: A True Tale”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Suddenly I aroused with a start and as ghostly a thrill of horror as ever I remember to have felt in my life. Something—what, I knew not—seemed near, something nameless, but unutterably awful.” - Ada Buisson, “The Ghost’s Summons”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“There was no longer any question what she was, or any thought of her being a living being. Upon a face which wore the fixed features of a corpse were imprinted the traces of the vilest and most hideous passions which had animated her while she lived.” - Walter Scott, “The Tapestried Chamber”</description>

  <description>The fate of the world is in the hands of detective of the supernatural R. F. Jackaby and his intrepid assistant, Abigail Rook. An evil king is turning ancient tensions into modern strife, using a blend of magic and technology to push Earth and the Otherworld into a mortal competition. Jackaby and Abigail are caught in the middle as they continue to solve the daily mysteries of New Fiddleham, New England — like who’s created the rend between the worlds, how to close it, and why zombies are appearing around. At the same time, the romance between Abigail and the shape-shifting police detective Charlie Cane deepens, and Jackaby’s resistance to his feelings for 926 Augur Lane’s ghostly lady, Jenny, begins to give way. Before the four can think about their own futures, they will have to defeat an evil that wants to destroy the future altogether.</description>

      <![CDATA[Another great adaptation of Gaiman's work. I do enjoy the narration from the author the most, but this full cast audio was very enjoyable. The Graveyard Book is quite possibly my favorite novel by Gaiman, I highly recommend you giving it a read!]]>

  <description>For bad children, a lump of coal from Santa is positively light punishment when Krampus is ready and waiting to beat them with a stick, wrap them in chains, and drag them down to hell--all with St. Nick's encouragement and approval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Krampusnacht&lt;/i&gt; holds within its pages twelve tales of Krampus triumphant, usurped, befriended, and much more. From evil children (and adults) who get their due, to those who pull one over on the ancient "Christmas Devil." From historic Europe, to the North Pole, to present day American suburbia, these all new stories embark on a revitalization of the Krampus tradition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you choose to read &lt;i&gt;Krampusnacht&lt;/i&gt; over twelve dark and scary nights or devour it in one &lt;i&gt;nacht&lt;/i&gt; of joy and terror, these stories are sure to add chills and magic to any winter's reading.</description>

  <description>wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers.&lt;br /&gt;January 1946: London is emerging from the shadow of the Second World War, and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she's never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends - and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society - born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island - boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature-lovers all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society's members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with warmth and humor as a series of letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises, and of finding connection in the most surprising ways.</description>

      <![CDATA[Review for Crow Awakened only: 3.5 stars! Short and sweet, this novel answered one of the questions plaguing me after I finished the sequel. I only hope that there will be more in this world, as I enjoy the characters so much. ]]>

  <description>~The novella-length sequel to Master of Crows~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a foray into the woods of Neith, Martise stumbles upon a ruined temple and reawakens not only a power she thought lost, but also something far more malevolent. An ancient darkness, imprisoned in an eternal cage, sees a chance at freedom in a woman once held in bondage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to save her, the Master of Crows will break the barriers of time and worlds to challenge an entity born of forgotten magic and the remnants of souls—a demon king who once led hordes of the damned across the face of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The destroyer of gods will battle the destroyer of men to reclaim her and discover a truth the keepers of history once conspired to conceal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tale of revelation and redemption.</description>

      <![CDATA[I loved this as much as the first novel in the series. I had assumed that because this is a novella, it would be the end of the series, but it was left with a few things unanswered. I will read anything set in this world. The characters are fantastic, and the writing is superb. More, please!]]>

  <description>It hasn't rained for a quarter of a century, and a dying world gasps for water. Outcast and exiled, the rain priestess Revida rescues a man and his children as they flee from the wrath of a creator god known as the Bitter Dark. But Atagartis is more than a man, and Revida soon discovers the lover she's known only in dreams has a purpose for her and the tearless grief she's born for more than two decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tale of the Glimmer Lands in the world of MASTER OF CROWS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a short story of approx. 7,300 words.</description>

      <![CDATA[The Light Within was very short but very sweet. Be warned it reads more like a chapter of a novel, and not a full story. However, there is a lot of emotion in those few pages. If you wanted more from Silhara in terms of his love for Martise, then give this one a try. Very sweet. ]]>

  <description>THE PRINCE OF NO VALUE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brishen Khaskem, prince of the Kai, has lived content as the nonessential spare heir to a throne secured many times over. A trade and political alliance between the human kingdom of Gaur and the Kai kingdom of Bast-Haradis requires that he marry a Gauri woman to seal the treaty. Always a dutiful son, Brishen agrees to the marriage and discovers his bride is as ugly as he expected and more beautiful than he could have imagined. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE NOBLEWOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ildiko, niece of the Gauri king, has always known her only worth to the royal family lay in a strategic marriage. Resigned to her fate, she is horrified to learn that her intended groom isn’t just a foreign aristocrat but the younger prince of a people neither familiar nor human. Bound to her new husband, Ildiko will leave behind all she’s known to embrace a man shrouded in darkness but with a soul forged by light. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two people brought together by the trappings of duty and politics will discover they are destined for each other, even as the powers of a hostile kingdom scheme to tear them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unabridged Audio, 8 hrs and 53 min.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;Letters from Skye&lt;/i&gt; returns with an extraordinary story of a friendship born of proximity but boundless in the face of separation and war.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luc Crépet is accustomed to his mother’s bringing wounded creatures to their idyllic château in the French countryside, where healing comes naturally amid the lush wildflowers and crumbling stone walls. Yet his &lt;i&gt;maman&lt;/i&gt;’s newest project is the most surprising: a fifteen-year-old Scottish girl grieving over her parents’ fate. A curious child with an artistic soul, Clare Ross finds solace in her connection to Luc, and she in turn inspires him in ways he never thought possible. Then, just as suddenly as Clare arrives, she is gone, whisked away by her grandfather to the farthest reaches of the globe. Devastated by her departure, Luc begins to write letters to Clare—and, even as she moves from Portugal to Africa and beyond, the memory of the summer they shared keeps her grounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, in the wake of World War I, Clare, now an artist, returns to France to help create facial prostheses for wounded soldiers. One of the wary veterans who comes to the studio seems familiar, and as his mask takes shape beneath her fingers, she recognizes Luc. But is this soldier, made bitter by battle and betrayal, the same boy who once wrote her wistful letters from Paris? After war and so many years apart, can Clare and Luc recapture how they felt at the edge of that long-ago summer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bringing to life two unforgettable characters and the rich historical period they inhabit, Jessica Brockmole shows how love and forgiveness can redeem us.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A funny, fantastically entertaining debut novel, in the spirit of Wodehouse and Monty Python, about a famous poet who inadvertently sells his wife to the devil--then recruits a band of adventurers to rescue her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lionel Savage, a popular poet in Victorian London, learns from his butler that they're broke, he marries the beautiful Vivien Lancaster for her money, only to find that his muse has abandoned him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distraught and contemplating suicide, Savage accidentally conjures the Devil -- the polite "Gentleman" of the title -- who appears at one of the society parties Savage abhors. The two hit it off: the Devil talks about his home, where he employs Dante as a gardener; Savage lends him a volume of Tennyson. But when the party's over and Vivien has disappeared, the poet concludes in horror that he must have inadvertently sold his wife to the dark lord. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newly in love with Vivian,  Savage plans a rescue mission to Hell that includes Simmons, the butler; Tompkins, the bookseller; Ashley Lancaster, swashbuckling Buddhist; Will Kensington, inventor of a flying machine; and Savage's spirited kid sister, Lizzie, freshly booted from boarding school for a "dalliance." Throughout, his cousin's quibbling footnotes to the text push the story into comedy nirvana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lionel and his friends encounter trapdoors, duels, anarchist-fearing bobbies, the social pressure of not knowing enough about art history, and the poisonous wit of his poetical archenemy. Fresh, action-packed and very, very funny, &lt;i&gt;The Gentleman&lt;/i&gt; is a giddy farce that recalls the masterful confections of P.G. Wodehouse and Hergé's beautifully detailed Tintin adventures.</description>

I was expecting a novel about a romp through Hell, and this was more about shenanigans getting the characters to Hell instead. I thought I would feel disappointment over this but I lov...]]>

  <description>The witcher returns in this sequel to Blood of Elves, in the series that inspired The Witcher video games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geralt is a witcher—guardian of the innocent, protector of those in need, and in dark times a defender against some of the most frightening creatures of myth and legend. His task now is to protect Ciri. A child of prophecy, she will have the power to change the world for good or for ill—but only if she lives to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A coup threatens the wizard's guild, war breaks out across the lands, a serious injury leaves Geralt fighting for his life ... and Ciri, in whose hands the world's fate rests, has vanished.</description>

  <description>Watch for the signs! What signs these shall be, I say unto you: first the earth will flow with the blood of Aen Seidhe, the Blood of Elves....&lt;br /&gt;For over a century, humans, dwarves, gnomes, and elves have lived together in relative peace. But times have changed, the uneasy peace is over, and now the races are fighting once again. The only good elf, it seems, is a dead elf.&lt;br /&gt;Geralt of Rivia, the cunning assassin known as The Witcher, has been waiting for the birth of a prophesied child. This child has the power to change the world - for good, or for evil.&lt;br /&gt;As the threat of war hangs over the land and the child is hunted for her extraordinary powers, it will become Geralt's responsibility to protect them all - and the Witcher never accepts defeat.&lt;br /&gt;Following The Last Wish, Blood of Elves is the new novel starring Geralt of Rivia, the inspiration for the critically acclaimed videogame The Witcher.</description>

  <description>You may think you know the story. After a miserable childhood, penniless orphan Jane Eyre embarks on a new life as a governess at Thornfield Hall. There, she meets one dark, brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite their significant age gap (!) and his uneven temper (!!), they fall in love—and, Reader, she marries him. (!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or does she?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prepare for an adventure of Gothic proportions, in which all is not as it seems, a certain gentleman is hiding more than skeletons in his closets, and one orphan Jane Eyre, aspiring author Charlotte Brontë, and supernatural investigator Alexander Blackwood are about to be drawn together on the most epic ghost hunt this side of Wuthering Heights.</description>

  <description>Six Scary Stories &lt;br /&gt;selected and introduced by Stephen King &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Number 1 bestselling horror author Stephen King introduces and presents six gripping and chilling stories in this captivating anthology! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Stephen King discovered these stories when he judged a competition run by Hodder &amp;amp; Stoughton and the Guardian to celebrate publication of his own collection The Bazaar of Bad Dreams. He was so impressed with the entries that he recommended they be published together in one book, which Cemetery Dance Publications and Hodder &amp;amp; Stoughton are pleased to report has become a reality. The six stories are: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WILD SWIMMING by Elodie Harper &lt;br /&gt;EAU-DE-ERIC by Manuela Saragosa &lt;br /&gt;THE SPOTS by Paul Bassett Davies &lt;br /&gt;THE UNPICKING by Michael Button &lt;br /&gt;LA MORT DE L'AMANT by Stuart Johnstone &lt;br /&gt;THE BEAR TRAP by Neil Hudson &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reader beware: the stories will make you think twice before cuddling up to your old soft toy, dipping your toe into the water or counting the spots on a leopard…</description>

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a village at the edge of the wilderness of northern Russia, where the winds blow cold and the snow falls many months of the year, an elderly servant tells stories of sorcery, folklore and the Winter King to the children of the family, tales of old magic frowned upon by the church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the young, wild Vasya these are far more than just stories. She alone can see the house spirits that guard her home, and sense the growing forces of dark magic in the woods...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Fear the living more than the dead.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s London 1888, and Jack the Ripper is terrorizing the people of the city. Evelyn, a young woman disfigured by her dangerous work in a matchstick factory, who has nowhere to go, does not know what to make of her new position as a maid to the Elephant Man in the London Hospital. Evelyn wants to be locked away from the world, like he is, shut in from the filth and dangers of the streets. But in Joseph Merrick, the Elephant Man, she finds a gentle kindred who does not recoil from her and who understands her pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the murders begin, however, Joseph and Evelyn are haunted nightly by the ghosts of the Ripper’s dead, setting Evelyn on a path to facing her fears and uncovering humanity’s worst nightmares.</description>

  <description>Music City Salvage is a family operation, owned and operated by Chuck Dutton: master stripper of doomed historic properties, and expert seller of all things old and crusty. But business is lean and times are tight, so he’s thrilled when the aged and esteemed Augusta Withrow appears in his office, bearing an offer he really ought to refuse. She has a massive family estate to unload - lock, stock, and barrel. For a check and a handshake, it’s all his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a big check. It’s a firm handshake. And it’s enough of a gold mine that he assigns his daughter Dahlia to personally oversee the project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dahlia preps a couple of trucks, takes a small crew, and they caravan down to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where the ancient Withrow house is waiting - and so is a barn, a carriage house, and a small, overgrown cemetery that Augusta Withrow left out of the paperwork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Augusta Withrow left out a lot of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The property is in unusually great shape for a condemned building. It’s empty, but it isn't abandoned. Something in the Withrow mansion is angry and lost. This is its last chance to raise hell before the house is gone forever, and there's still plenty of room in the strange little family plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New from Cherie Priest, a modern master of supernatural fiction, &lt;i&gt;The Family Plot&lt;/i&gt; is a haunted house story for the ages - atmospheric, scary, and strange, with a modern gothic sensibility that every bit as fresh as it is frightening.</description>

This volume contains PREACHER #8-17.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this continuing saga of the bizarre life of a faithless Texas preacher, Jesse Custer heads to the south to confront the extremely dysfunctional family that abused him as a child and planted the original seeds of his disillusionment with the world. Now merged with a half angelic, half demonic being, the former preacher looks to exact revenge against those who simultaneously raised and destroyed him. Then after exorcising his personal demons, Jesse, his girlfriend Tulip, and their friend Cassidy, the Irish vampire, head west to a party of Babylonian proportions.</description>

Drawn to the strange, captivating world she finds--and the mysterious man who rules it--she soon faces an impossible decision. With time and the old laws working against her, Liesl must discover who she truly is before her fate is sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark, romantic, and powerful, &lt;i&gt;Wintersong&lt;/i&gt; will sweep you away into a world you won't soon forget.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Eleanor West’s Home for Wayward Children&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Solicitations&lt;br /&gt;No Visitors&lt;br /&gt;No Quests&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children have always disappeared under the right conditions; slipping through the shadows under a bed or at the back of a wardrobe, tumbling down rabbit holes and into old wells, and emerging somewhere... else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But magical lands have little need for used-up miracle children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy tumbled once, but now she’s back. The things she’s experienced... they change a person. The children under Miss West’s care understand all too well. And each of them is seeking a way back to their own fantasy world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Nancy’s arrival marks a change at the Home. There’s a darkness just around each corner, and when tragedy strikes, it’s up to Nancy and her new-found schoolmates to get to the heart of the matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter the cost.</description>

  <description>Multiple award winning, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Neil Gaiman returns to dazzle, captivate, haunt, and entertain with this third collection of short fiction following &lt;i&gt;Smoke and Mirrors&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fragile Things&lt;/i&gt;--which includes a never-before published &lt;i&gt;American Gods&lt;/i&gt; story, "Black Dog," written exclusively for this volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this new anthology, Neil Gaiman pierces the veil of reality to reveal the enigmatic, shadowy world that lies beneath. &lt;i&gt;Trigger Warning&lt;/i&gt; includes previously published pieces of short fiction--stories, verse, and a very special &lt;i&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/i&gt; story that was written for the fiftieth anniversary of the beloved series in 2013--as well "Black Dog," a new tale that revisits the world of &lt;i&gt;American Gods&lt;/i&gt;, exclusive to this collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trigger Warning&lt;/i&gt; explores the masks we all wear and the people we are beneath them to reveal our vulnerabilities and our truest selves. Here is a rich cornucopia of horror and ghosts stories, science fiction and fairy tales, fabulism and poetry that explore the realm of experience and emotion. In "Adventure Story"--a thematic companion to &lt;i&gt;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&lt;/i&gt;--Gaiman ponders death and the way people take their stories with them when they die. His social media experience "A Calendar of Tales" are short takes inspired by replies to fan tweets about the months of the year--stories of pirates and the March winds, an igloo made of books, and a Mother's Day card that portends disturbances in the universe. Gaiman offers his own ingenious spin on &lt;i&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/i&gt; in his award-nominated mystery tale "The Case of Death and Honey". And "Click-Clack the Rattlebag" explains the creaks and clatter we hear when we're all alone in the darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sophisticated writer whose creative genius is unparalleled, Gaiman entrances with his literary alchemy, transporting us deep into the realm of imagination, where the fantastical becomes real and the everyday incandescent. Full of wonder and terror, surprises and amusements, &lt;i&gt;Trigger Warning&lt;/i&gt; is a treasury of delights that engage the mind, stir the heart, and shake the soul from one of the most unique and popular literary artists of our day.</description>

  <description>Moving to a space station at the edge of the galaxy was always going to be the death of Hanna’s social life. Nobody said it might actually get her killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sci-fi saga that began with the breakout bestseller &lt;i&gt;Illuminae&lt;/i&gt; continues on board the Jump Station &lt;i&gt;Heimdall&lt;/i&gt;, where two new characters will confront the next wave of the BeiTech assault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanna is the station captain’s pampered daughter; Nik the reluctant member of a notorious crime family. But while the pair are struggling with the realities of life aboard the galaxy’s most boring space station, little do they know that Kady Grant and the &lt;i&gt;Hypatia&lt;/i&gt; are headed right toward &lt;i&gt;Heimdall&lt;/i&gt;, carrying news of the Kerenza invasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an elite BeiTech strike team invades the station, Hanna and Nik are thrown together to defend their home. But alien predators are picking off the station residents one by one, and a malfunction in the station’s wormhole means the space-time continuum might be ripped in two before dinner. Soon Hanna and Nik aren’t just fighting for their own survival; the fate of everyone on the &lt;i&gt;Hypatia&lt;/i&gt;—and possibly the known universe—is in their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But relax. They’ve totally got this. They hope.</description>

      <![CDATA[Well that was very good. When I read illuminae, I was a tad disappointed as I didn’t love it as much as everyone else. I DID love the characters which is what kept me going. Ironically, when I started Gemina, I didn’t love the characters but the story was fast paced, surprising and so thrillling....]]>

  <description>Jenny Cavanaugh, the ghostly lady of 926 Augur Lane, has enlisted the investigative services of her fellow residents to solve a decade-old murder—her own. Abigail Rook and her eccentric employer, Detective R. F. Jackaby, dive into the cold case, starting with a search for Jenny’s fiancé, who went missing the night she died. But when a new, gruesome murder closely mirrors the events of ten years prior, Abigail and Jackaby realize that Jenny’s case isn’t so cold after all, and her killer may be far more dangerous than they suspected.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fantasy and folklore mix with mad science as Abigail’s race to unravel the mystery leads her across the cold cobblestones of nineteenth-century New England, down to the mythical underworld, and deep into her colleagues’ grim histories to battle the most deadly foe she has ever faced.</description>

      <![CDATA[Ghostly Echoes is possibly my favorite of the Jackaby series thus far. Jenny was a major player throughout, and I loved that. I think we will be learning more of Jackaby's background and family in the last installment and I can't wait. One of my favorite series for sure, it's everything I want it...]]>

  <description>“I plead the blood.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those were the last words seventeen-year-old golden boy quarterback Clay Tate heard rattling from his dad's throat when he discovered him dying on the barn floor of the Neely Cattle Ranch, clutching a crucifix to his chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now, on the first anniversary of the Midland, Oklahoma slaughter, the whole town's looking at Clay like he might be next to go over the edge. Clay wants to forget the past, but the sons and daughters of the Preservation Society—a group of prominent farmers his dad accused of devil worship—won't leave him alone. Including Ali, his longtime crush, who suddenly wants to reignite their romance after a year of silence, and hated rival Tyler Neely, who’s behaving like they’re old friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Even as Clay tries to reassure himself, creepy glances turn to sinister stares and strange coincidences build to gruesome rituals—but when he can never prove that any of it happened, Clay worries he might be following his dad down the path to insanity...or that something far more terrifying lies in wait around the corner.</description>

      <![CDATA[The Last Harvest was a fast paced and exciting read. There were parts that I can tell will really appeal to some readers. It has the potential to have you on the edge of your seat, and I can see why some would find the book scary for sure. Unfortunately for me, I wasn't even uneasy reading, and I...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Tortured and brilliant private detective Charlie Parker stars in this thriller by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author John Connolly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former NYPD detective Charlie "Bird" Parker is on the verge of madness. Tortured by the unsolved slayings of his wife and young daughter, he is a man consumed by guilt, regret, and the desire for revenge. When his former partner asks him to track down a missing girl, Parker finds himself drawn into a world beyond his imagining: a world where thirty-year-old killings remain shrouded in fear and lies, a world where the ghosts of the dead torment the living, a world haunted by the murderer responsible for the deaths in his family—a serial killer who uses the human body to create works of art and takes faces as his prize. But the search awakens buried instincts in Parker: instincts for survival, for compassion, for love, and, ultimately, for killing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aided by a beautiful young psychologist and a pair of bickering career criminals, Parker becomes the bait in a trap set in the humid bayous of Louisiana, a trap that threatens the lives of everyone in its reach. Driven by visions of the dead and the voice of an old black psychic who met a terrible end, Parker must seek a final, brutal confrontation with a murderer who has moved beyond all notions of humanity, who has set out to create a hell on earth: the serial killer known only as the Traveling Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the tradition of classic American detective fiction, &lt;i&gt;Every Dead Thing&lt;/i&gt; is a tense, richly plotted thriller, filled with memorable characters and gripping action. It is also a profoundly moving novel, concerned with the nature of loyalty, love, and forgiveness. Lyrical and terrifying, it is an ambitious debut, triumphantly realized.</description>

She’ll settle for a roof over her head. What fairy tales are left over for an impoverished twenty-six year-old woman who’s never even been kissed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one.</description>

  <description>Beauty knows the Beast’s forest in her bones—and in her blood. Though she grew up with the city’s highest aristocrats, far from her father’s old lodge, she knows that the forest holds secrets and that her father is the only hunter who’s ever come close to discovering them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when her father loses his fortune and moves Yeva and her sisters back to the outskirts of town, Yeva is secretly relieved. Out in the wilderness, there’s no pressure to make idle chatter with vapid baronessas…or to submit to marrying a wealthy gentleman. But Yeva’s father’s misfortune may have cost him his mind, and when he goes missing in the woods, Yeva sets her sights on one prey: the creature he’d been obsessively tracking just before his disappearance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deaf to her sisters’ protests, Yeva hunts this strange Beast back into his own territory—a cursed valley, a ruined castle, and a world of creatures that Yeva’s only heard about in fairy tales. A world that can bring her ruin or salvation. Who will survive: the Beauty, or the Beast?</description>

  <description>Betrothed since childhood to the prince of Mynaria, Princess Dennaleia has always known what her future holds. Her marriage will seal the alliance between Mynaria and her homeland, protecting her people from other hostile lands. But Denna has a secret. She possesses an Affinity for fire—a dangerous gift for the future queen of a kingdom where magic is forbidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Denna must learn the ways of her new home while trying to hide her growing magic. To make matters worse, she must learn to ride Mynaria’s formidable warhorses—and her teacher is the person who intimidates her most, the prickly and unconventional Princess Amaranthine—called Mare—the sister of her betrothed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a shocking assassination leaves the kingdom reeling, Mare and Denna reluctantly join forces to search for the culprit. As the two become closer, Mare is surprised by Denna’s intelligence and bravery, while Denna is drawn to Mare’s independent streak. And soon their friendship is threatening to blossom into something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with dangerous conflict brewing that makes the alliance more important than ever, acting on their feelings could be deadly. Forced to choose between their duty and their hearts, Mare and Denna must find a way to save their kingdoms—and each other.</description>

  <description>It started as playful, if barbed, banter before rising to a fateful wager with a most notorious rake—the Captain of the Guard, Jalal al-Khoury—who may have finally met his match in a lovely, if haughty, handmaiden, Despina. But she, too, seems to have met her match in the handsome Jalal. What begins as a tempestuous battle of will and wit in short order becomes a passionate affair spurred on by tragedy of the worst kind.</description>

  <description>Seventy-one days and seventy-one nights had come and gone since Khalid began killing his brides. This dawn, Khalid would mark the loss of the seventy-second girl, Shahrzad al-Khayzuran. Khalid didn’t know how many more of these dawns he could take. And there was something about this latest girl that piqued his interest. Not only had she volunteered to marry him, but at their wedding ceremony, she had seemed not the least bit afraid. In fact, what he had seen in her eyes was nothing short of pure hatred. She was about to lose her life. Why wasn’t she afraid? Why did she hate him so? He had never before gone to his wife’s chambers before her death at dawn. Tonight would be different.</description>

  <description>The city of Rey is burning. With smoke billowing, fires blazing and his people fleeing, Khalid races back to defend his city, and protect his queen. But Khalid is too late to do either. He and his men arrive to find the city in ruins, nothing but a maze of destruction, and Shahrzad is gone. But who could have wrought such devastation? Khalid fears he may already know the answer, the price of choosing love over the people of Rey all too evident.</description>

She takes a badly needed job working for ex–Master of the Universe Will Traynor, who is wheelchair bound after an accident. Will has always lived a huge life—big deals, extreme sports, worldwide travel—and now he’s pretty sure he cannot live the way he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will is acerbic, moody, bossy—but Lou refuses to treat him with kid gloves, and soon his happiness means more to her than she expected. When she learns that Will has shocking plans of his own, she sets out to show him that life is still worth living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Love Story&lt;/i&gt; for this generation and perfect for fans of John Green’s &lt;i&gt;The Fault in Our Stars&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Me Before You&lt;/i&gt; brings to life two people who couldn’t have less in common—a heartbreakingly romantic novel that asks, &lt;i&gt;What do you do when making the person you love happy also means breaking your own heart?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Presented by James Patterson's new children's imprint, this deliciously creepy horror novel has a storyline inspired by the Ripper murders and an unexpected, blood-chilling conclusion...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Audrey Rose Wadsworth was born a lord's daughter, with a life of wealth and privilege stretched out before her. But between the social teas and silk dress fittings, she leads a forbidden secret life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against her stern father's wishes and society's expectations, Audrey often slips away to her uncle's laboratory to study the gruesome practice of forensic medicine. When her work on a string of savagely killed corpses drags Audrey into the investigation of a serial murderer, her search for answers brings her close to her own sheltered world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story's shocking twists and turns, augmented with real, sinister period photos, will make this dazzling, #1 New York Times bestselling debut from author Kerri Maniscalco impossible to forget.</description>

  <description>Trudchen grew up hearing Odette’s stories of their monster-slaying mother and a magician’s curse. But now that Tru’s older, she’s starting to wonder if her older sister’s tales were just comforting lies, especially because there’s nothing fantastic about her own life—permanently disabled and in constant pain from childhood polio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1909, after a two-year absence, Od reappears with a suitcase supposedly full of weapons and a promise to rescue Tru from the monsters on their way to attack her. But it’s Od who seems haunted by something. And when the sisters’ search for their mother leads them to a face-off with the Leeds Devil, a nightmarish beast that’s wreaking havoc in the Mid-Atlantic states, Tru discovers the peculiar possibility that she and her sister—despite their dark pasts and ordinary appearances—might, indeed, have magic after all.</description>

  <description>In Alaska, 1970, being a teenager here isn’t like being a teenager anywhere else. Ruth has a secret that she can’t hide forever. Dora wonders if she can ever truly escape where she comes from, even when good luck strikes. Alyce is trying to reconcile her desire to dance, with the life she’s always known on her family’s fishing boat. Hank and his brothers decide it’s safer to run away than to stay home—until one of them ends up in terrible danger.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Four very different lives are about to become entangled.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Two clans. Only one will survive.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only life seventeen-year-old Kol knows is hunting at the foot of the Great Ice with his brothers. But food is becoming scarce, and without another clan to align with, Kol, his family, and their entire group are facing an uncertain future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traveling from the south, Mya and her family arrive at Kol’s camp with a trail of hurt and loss behind them, and hope for a new beginning. When Kol meets Mya, her strength, independence, and beauty instantly captivate him, igniting a desire for much more than survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then on a hunt, Kol makes a grave mistake that jeopardizes the relationship that he and Mya have only just started to build. Mya was guarded to begin with—and for good reason—but no apology or gesture is enough for her to forgive him. Soon after, another clan arrives on their shores. And when Mya spots Lo, a daughter of this new clan, her anger intensifies, adding to the already simmering tension between families. After befriending Lo, Kol learns of a dark history between Lo and Mya that is rooted in the tangle of their pasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When violence erupts, Kol is forced to choose between fighting alongside Mya or trusting Lo’s claims. And when things quickly turn deadly, it becomes clear that this was a war that one of them had been planning all along.</description>

  <description>One of the most celebrated comics titles of the late 1990s, PREACHER is a modern American epic of life, death, love and redemption also packed with sex, booze, blood and bullets - not to mention angels, demons, God, vampires and deviants of all stripes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance, the Reverend Jesse Custer doesn't look like anyone special-just another small-town minister slowly losing his flock and his faith. But he's about to come face-to-face with proof that God does indeed exist. Merging with a bizarre spiritual force called Genesis, Jesse now possesses the power of "the Word," an ability to make people do whatever he utters. He begins a violent and riotous journey across the country in search of answers from the elusive deity.</description>
