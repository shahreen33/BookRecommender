  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bestselling &lt;i&gt;Rebel of the Sands&lt;/i&gt; author Alwyn Hamilton is back with a glittering thriller about a glamorous media darling, a surprise heiress, and the magical competition of a lifetime.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At sixteen, Honora “Nora” Holtzfall is the daughter of the most powerful heiress in all of Walstad. Her family controls all the money–and all the magic–in the entire country. But despite being the center of attention, Nora has always felt like an outsider. When her mother is found dead in an alley, the family throne and fortune are suddenly up for grabs, and Nora will be pitted against her cousins in the Veritaz, the ultimate magical competition for power that determines the one family heir. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there’s a surprise contestant this time: Lotte, the illegitimate daughter of Nora’s aunt. When Lotte’s absent mother retrieves her from the rural convent she’d abandoned her to, Lotte goes from being an orphan to surrounded by family. Unfortunately, most of them want her dead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And soon, Nora discovers that her mother’s death wasn’t random–it was murder. And the only person she can trust to uncover the truth of what happened is a rakish young reporter who despises everything Nora and her family stand for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With everyone against her, Lotte’s last hope is hunting for the identity of her father. But the dangerous competition–and her feelings for Theo, one of the Holtzfalls’ sworn protectors–turns her world upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incredible tests, impossible choices and deadly odds await both girls. But there can only be one winner.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From a critically acclaimed author, a twisty and gorgeously written YA ghost story about young women separated by centuries but connected by a desire to control their futures. Read an excerpt below!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am no longer a creature, yet my habits remain. My desires, still the old ones. Lurking amidst the brush, watching squirrels collect acorns and deer drink from puddles. Watching my girls. I am allowed pleasure here, too, despite the warnings of the Bible my mother loved so well. It is pleasure, and my delight, to see my girls, their skin supple and sweating, their mouths eating, their fists clamping over their hips as their legs bend and stretch over the earth. The work of bodies never ends. I particularly like their hair, how it grows long and shaggy until lopped off by one of their mothers, the priestly one whose thoughts swirl like perfume in lilac time; she finds such joyful thrift in snipping the little girls’ tresses. Where I had watched Patrick feed Arthur Ganey’s horses is now a kitchen with an unlikely polished floor; over what was dirt and hay, the priestly mother sweeps up the girls’ lost tresses—gold, white, mahogany. The priestly one’s sister, a midwife, makes each daughter gulp down spoonfuls of castor and fish oil; one year, they each suffered needle jabs, given for their own good. Their tears brimmed and they winced under the puncture, their betrayed howls ringing out through the open windows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The palomino girl loves so harshly; she sees everything as a prize to be won or lost. The unicorn girl’s love ripples uncontained; her soul is flimsy, easily stained by sadness or goaded into laughter. The dark bay foal, who has since become steady on her feet in a manner that I envy, rushes through the brush. She is a thirsty creature. I ache when I see her touch the cool water at the bottom of the ravine where Patrick liked to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A house helmed by two sisters, and their three daughters. The mothers’ love, borne of their sister pact, has made a world where no men ever deigned to rule. The daughters’ love at times is heavy, a pail of milk to a waiting hand; other times, easy as a hairbrush before Sunday service. It is most visible in their hands: what they make and toss away, what they strive to hold. I watch for restfulness. The after hours of tables cleared and dishes washed and floors swept and pencils and needles jabbing at paper and cloth; here their thick love dreams and wraps over each other, like hair in a braid. This reminds me of my own sister, and I recall my beating heart, strong beneath my chemise, galloping in grief for her. I think of my own hair—long gone, a cat’s cradle for the faeries—and the relief of unwinding it each night, the burden heavy no more. I think of my own hands and what they learned about desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How quickly everything in God’s world disintegrates. Everything but the loneliness of young women.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There's something bad in the water . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lola Nox is the daughter of a celebrated horror filmmaker, and thinks she knows all about Harrow Lake, the setting of his most famous movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when her father is brutally attacked and she's sent there to stay with her reclusive grandmother, she realizes the town is harbouring secrets more horrifying than she could ever have imagined. Not only is this the place where her mother disappeared without a trace, it's a town holding on to a dark past that's even more frightening than her father's movies. As Lola is drawn deeper into the town's grip, she starts to question what's real, what happened to her mother, and whether she'll ever get out of Harrow Lake alive.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gossip Girl&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;One of Us Is Lying &lt;/i&gt;with a dash of &lt;i&gt;The Secret History&lt;/i&gt; in this slick, taut murder mystery set against the backdrop of an exclusive prep school on Long Island.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Gold Coast, Long Island, everything from the expensive downtown shops to the manicured beaches, to the pressed uniforms of Jill Newman and her friends, looks perfect. But as Jill found out three years ago, nothing is as it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freshman year Jill's best friend, the brilliant, dazzling Shaila Arnold, was killed by her boyfriend. After that dark night on the beach, Graham confessed, the case was closed, and Jill tried to move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it's Jill's senior year and she's determined to make it her best yet. After all, she's a senior &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a Player--a member of Gold Coast Prep's exclusive, not-so-secret secret society. Senior Players have the best parties, highest grades and the admiration of the entire school. This is going to be Jill's year. She's sure of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Jill starts getting texts proclaiming Graham's innocence, her dreams of the perfect senior year start to crumble. If Graham didn't kill Shaila, who did? Jill vows to find out, but digging deeper could mean putting her friendships, and her future, in jeopardy.</description>

  <description>Libby's having a rough senior year. Her older brother absconded with his college money and is bartending on a Greek island. Her dad just told her she's got to pay for college herself, and he's evicting her when she graduates so he can Airbnb her room. A drunken hook-up with her coworker Kyle has left her upset and confused. So when Perry Ackerman, serial harasser and the most handsy customer at The Goat where she waitresses, pushes her over the edge, she can hardly be blamed for dumping a pitcher of sangria on his head. Unfortunately, Perry is a local industry hero, the restaurant's most important customer, and Libby's mom's boss. Now Libby has to navigate the fallout of her outburst, find an apartment, and deal with her increasing rage at the guys who've screwed up her life--and her increasing crush on the one guy who truly gets her. As timely as it is timeless, He Must Like You is a story about consent, rage, and revenge, and the potential we all have to be better people.</description>

  <description>My Eyes Are Up Here is YA novel from debut author Laura Zimmerman about a teenage girl struggling to rediscover her balance—and her voice—in the year after a surprising growth spurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A "monomial" is a simple algebraic expression consisting of a single term. 30H, for example. 15-year-old Greer Walsh hasn't been fazed by basic algebra since fifth grade, but for the last year, 30H has felt like an unsolvable equation--one that's made her world a very small, very lonely place. 30H is her bra size--or it was the last time anyone checked. She stopped letting people get that close to her with a tape measure a while ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since everything changed the summer before ninth grade, Greer has felt out of control. She can't control her first impressions, the whispers that follow, or the stares that linger after. The best she can do is put on her faithful XXL sweatshirt and let her posture--and her expectations for other people--slump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But people—strangers and friends—seem strangely determined to remind her that life is not supposed to be this way. Despite carefully avoiding physical contact and anything tighter than a puffy coat, Greer finds an unexpected community on the volleyball squad, the team that hugs between every point and wears a uniform "so tight it can squeeze out tears." And then there's Jackson Oates, newly arrived at her school and maybe actually more interested in her banter than her breasts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura Zimmermann's debut is both laugh-out-loud funny and beautifully blunt, vulnerable and witty, heartbreaking and hopeful. And it will invite readers to look carefully at a girl who just wants to be seen for all she is.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Perfect for fans of Victoria Aveyard and Holly Black, this enthralling fantasy adventure follows a teenage girl chosen to be the human sacrifice in a deadly game between three heirs who will do anything for the crown.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the magical kingdom of Orkena, Zahru has long dreamed of a life beyond the desert, even though she knows her lowly position as a stable girl who can commune with animals will never afford her such a luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that changes when the ailing ruler invokes an ancient tradition known as the Crossing. It’s a death-defying race across the desert, in which the first of his heirs to finish–and take the life of a human sacrifice at the journey’s end–will ascend to the throne and be granted unparalleled abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As preparations and celebrations commence, Zahru jumps at the chance to experience a small taste of glamour by sneaking into the palace. But the minor indiscretion quickly turns into the worst mistake of her life as she gets caught up in a feud between the heirs and is ultimately forced to become the Crossing’s human sacrifice. Zahru is left with only one hope for survival: somehow figuring out how to overcome the most powerful people in the world.</description>

  <description>A lush, slow-burn romance set in 17th century France, and centered around the broken history of the Hope Diamond-- the high-society intrigue of Richelle Mead's Glittering Court series meets the romance of Melissa de la Cruz's Alex and Eliza.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the depths of the Bastille, sixteen-year-old Juliet Pitau sits cold and filthy in her cell. Charged with stealing what has come to be known as the Hope Diamond from King Louis XIV, she has one final chance to convince the King that her motives were pure. If she fails, this night may be her last. Recording her confession is Rene, a scribe for the king and the man she loves. But Rene won't even look her way, let alone begin to forgive her for her betrayal of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Juliet was imprisoned, she was the daughter of the finest gem cutter in all of Paris. The young King Louis XIV hand-selected Jean Pitau to be his crown jeweler, the only man who could make him shine like the sun. When Louis purchases the Tavernier Violet, a large, deep-blue diamond the likes of which the French court has never seen, Jean is tasked with turning it brilliant. But Juliet's father has never cut a diamond quite like this--and shaping it is risky business. While Jean spirals into depression, Juliet takes it upon herself to have the diamond cut for the King. But with every misstep, she brings her family closer to ruin, and closer to probable death at morning's light once Louis casts his sentence.</description>

  <description>A ripped-from-the-headlines novel of desperation, escape, and survival across the U.S.-Mexico border.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pulga has his dreams. &lt;br /&gt;Chico has his grief.&lt;br /&gt;Pequeña has her pride. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And these three teens have one another. But none of them have illusions about the town they’ve grown up in and the dangers that surround them. Even with the love of family, threats lurk around every corner. And when those threats become all too real, the trio knows they have no choice but to run: from their country, from their families, from their beloved home.&lt;br /&gt;Crossing from Guatemala through Mexico, they follow the route of La Bestia, the perilous train system that might deliver them to a better life–if they are lucky enough to survive the journey. With nothing but the bags on their backs and desperation drumming through their hearts, Pulga, Chico, and Pequeña know there is no turning back, despite the unknown that awaits them. And the darkness that seems to follow wherever they go. &lt;br /&gt;In this powerful story inspired by current events, the plight of migrants at the U.S. southern border is brought to painful, poignant, vivid life. An epic journey of danger, resilience, heartache, and hope.</description>

She’s an elite cellist, and when she’s not working in her stepmom’s indie comic shop, she’s prepping for the biggest audition of her life.Ridley is barely holding it together. His parents own the biggest comic-store chain in the country, and Ridley can’t stop disappointing them–that is, when they’re even paying attention.They meet one fateful night at a comic convention prom, and the two can’t help falling for each other. Too bad their parents are at each other’s throats every chance they get, making a relationship between them nearly impossible . . . unless they manage to keep it a secret.Then again, the feud between their families may be the least of their problems. As Ridley’s anxiety spirals, Jubilee tries to help but finds her focus torn between her fast-approaching audition and their intensifying relationship. What if love can’t conquer all? What if each of them needs more than the other can give?</description>

  <description>When seventeen-year-old Andromeda breaks free from her cryonic chamber, she’s prepared for a bleak reception on humanity's new colony planet. She definitely isn’t expecting to be revived in a desert wasteland by a soldier with a vagabond smile who introduces her to the villagers as their 'Goddess'. Andra has woken a thousand years too late, in a desperate society where technology is considered magic and its practitioners revered as Deities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zhade has been searching for the Third Goddess ever since he was banished from his home city four years ago. She doesn't wield magic as well as the first two Goddesses did, and they weren't even strong enough to save themselves, let alone the world. Zhade only hopes Andra will live long enough to get him back to his rightful place in Eerensed. His city. His throne. She is a bargaining chip and nothing more. Or so he thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;​Together, a girl a thousand years from home and the exiled prince who woke her will have to fight to save themselves and the people of Eerensed, whose lives rely on ancient and deteriorating technology. If the people find out Andra’s not really a goddess, they’ll kill her. If they start loving her more than their king, he’ll kill her. If she doesn’t find a way to get back to Earth, the planet will kill them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first book in the duology is scheduled for summer 2020.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A gutsy, queer coming-of-age story perfect for fans of Nina LaCour, Rainbow Rowell, and Elizabeth Acevedo.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliet Milagros Palante is a self-proclaimed closeted Puerto Rican baby dyke from the Bronx. Only, she's not so closeted anymore. Not after coming out to her family the night before flying to Portland, Oregon, to intern with her favorite feminist writer--what's sure to be a life-changing experience. And when Juliet's coming out crashes and burns, she's not sure her mom will ever speak to her again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Juliet has a plan--sort of. Her internship with legendary author Harlowe Brisbane, the ultimate authority on feminism, women's bodies, and other gay-sounding stuff, is sure to help her figure out this whole "Puerto Rican lesbian" thing. Except Harlowe's white. And not from the Bronx. And she definitely doesn't have all the answers . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a summer bursting with queer brown dance parties, a sexy fling with a motorcycling librarian, and intense explorations of race and identity, Juliet learns what it means to come out--to the world, to her family, to herself.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;New York Times bestselling author Renée Ahdieh returns with the second installment of her new sumptuous, sultry and romantic series, The Beautiful.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the events of The Beautiful, Sébastien Saint Germain is now cursed and forever changed. The treaty between the Fallen and the Brotherhood has been broken, and war between the immortals seems imminent. The price of loving Celine was costly. But Celine has also paid a high price for loving Bastien. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still recovering from injuries sustained during a night she can’t quite remember, her dreams are troubled. And she doesn’t know she has inadvertently set into motion a chain of events that could lead to her demise and unveil a truth about herself she’s not quite ready to learn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forces hiding in the shadows have been patiently waiting for this moment for centuries. And just as Bastien and Celine begin to uncover the danger around them, they learn their love could tear them apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"A refreshingly funny and blisteringly unsentimental coming-of-age memoir." -&lt;b&gt;John Green, #1 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Turtles All The Way Down &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Fault in Our Stars&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Akilah Hughes's world, family--and life--are often complicated, but always funny. Through intimate and hilarious essays, Akilah takes readers along on her journey from the small Kentucky town where she was born--and eventually became a spelling bee champ and 15-year-old high school graduate--to New York City, where she took careful steps to fulfill her dream of becoming a writer and performer. Like Tiffany Haddish's &lt;i&gt;The Last Black Unicorn&lt;/i&gt; or Mindy Kaling's &lt;i&gt;Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?&lt;/i&gt; for the YA set, Akilah pens revealing and laugh-out-loud funny essays about her life, covering everything from her racist fifth grade teacher, her struggles with weight and acne, her failed attempts at joining the cheerleading team, how to literally get to New York (hint: for a girl on a budget, it may include multiple bus transfers) and exactly how to "make it" once you finally get there.</description>

  <description>Meet Juliet Milagros Palante. A self-proclaimed closeted Puerto Rican baby dyke from the Bronx. Only, she's not so closeted anymore after coming out to her family the evening before she flies to Portland, Oregon (of all places), to intern with her favorite feminist writer—an experience that Juliet is certain will change her world. However, coming out doesn't go so well, and, when she leaves home, Juliet's not so sure if her mother will ever speak to her again. As she embarks on a summer full of explorations of race and identity, queer brown dance parties, and a motorcycle-riding librarian, Juliet will ultimately learn that feminism is whatever she decides it is, and only she can create the life she wants. As praised by Roxane Gay, Juliet Takes a Breath is "quite dazzling, funny as hell, poignant, [and] F***ing outstanding." You'll fall in love with this coming-of-age story about a young woman's journey to find herself—to define herself—as she comes out to her family, herself, and the world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The saga of the Logan family--made famous in the Newbery Medal-winning &lt;i&gt;Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry&lt;/i&gt;--concludes in a long-awaited and deeply fulfilling story.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her tenth book, Mildred Taylor completes her sweeping saga about the Logan family of Mississippi, which is also the story of the civil rights movement in America of the 20th century. Cassie Logan, first met in&lt;i&gt; Song of the Trees&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt; Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry&lt;/i&gt;, is a young woman now, searching for her place in the world, a journey that takes her from Toledo to California, to law school in Boston, and, ultimately, in the 60s, home to Mississippi&lt;br /&gt;to participate in voter registration. She is witness to the now-historic events of the century: the Great Migration north, the rise of the civil rights movement, preceded and precipitated by the racist society of America, and the often violent confrontations that brought about change. Rich, compelling storytelling is Ms. Taylor's hallmark, and she fulfills expectations as she brings to a close the stirring family story that has absorbed her for over forty years. It is a story she was born to tell.</description>

  <description>In this utterly gripping thriller, Sarah, the fearless heroine of Orphan Monster Spy, hunts a rogue German doctor in West Africa who might be a serial murderer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still hiding in plain sight as "Ursula Haller," the Shirley Temple of Nazi high society, Sarah Goldstein gathers information for Captain Floyd at parties, and when he learns of a German doctor who went rogue in West Africa, she wants to help him hunt the doctor down. Rumors say the doctor has discovered a tool of germ warfare known as "the Bleeding" that could wipe out whole nations. The journey begins as a thrilling adventure for Sarah but as they get closer to the doctor, and see more effects of "the Bleeding" in the communities they pass through, their trip turns from caper to nightmare. A biracial German/Senegalese girl who travels with them, a black French priest with a foul mouth, and the doctor's glamorous daughter round out the cast of this unbearably high-stakes thriller that pushes Sarah to face the worst humanity is capable of--and challenges her to find reasons to keep fighting.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;From the award-winning author of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Flygirl&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; comes this powerful WWII romance between two Japanese teens caught in the cogs of an unwinnable war, perfect for fans of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Salt to the Sea&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Lovely War&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;, and &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Code Name Verity&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Japan 1945. Taro is a talented violinist and a kamikaze pilot in the days before his first and only mission. He believes he is ready to die for his country . . . until he meets Hana. Hana hasn't been the same since the day she was buried alive in a collapsed trench during a bomb raid. She wonders if it would have been better to have died that day . . . until she meets Taro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A song will bring them together. The war will tear them apart. Is it possible to live an entire lifetime in eight short days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sherri L. Smith has been called "an author with astonishing range" and "a stellar storyteller" by E. Lockhart, the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;We Were Liars&lt;/i&gt;, and "a truly talented writer" by Jacqueline Woodson, the National Book Award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Brown Girl Dreaming&lt;/i&gt;. Here, with achingly beautiful prose, Smith weaves a tale of love in the face of death, of hope in the face of tragedy, set against a backdrop of the waning days of the Pacific War.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Mixing everything that's best about dragons, dystopia, and generational conflict, Tang delivers a high flying debut that pulls no punches." --E.K. Johnston, #1 New York Times Bestselling Author&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Business is booming for Prudence Wu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A black-market-media smuggler and scholarship student at the prestigious New Columbia Preparatory Academy, Pru is lucky to live in the Barricade Coalition where she is free to study, read, watch, and listen to whatever she wants. But between essays and exams, she chooses to spend her breaks sweet-talking border patrol with her best friend, Anabel, in order to sell banned media to the less fortunate citizens of the United Continental Confederacy, Inc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a drop-off goes awry, Pru narrowly escapes UCC enforcers to find that her rescuer is, of all things, a sentient cybernetic dragon. On the one hand, Pru is lucky not to be in prison, or worse. On the other, the dragon seems to have imprinted on her permanently, which means she has no choice but to be its pilot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawn into a revolution she has no real interest in leading, Pru, Anabel, and friends Alex and Cat become key players in a brewing conflict with the UCC as the corporate government develops advanced weaponry more terrifying and grotesque than Pru could have ever imagined.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Perfect for fans of Sarah J. Maas and Red Queen, this is the first novel in a sweeping YA fantasy-romance duet about a deadly assassin, his mysterious apprentice, and the country they are sworn to protect from #1 NYT bestselling author Melissa de la Cruz.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caledon Holt is the Kingdom of Renovia's deadliest weapon. No one alive can best him in brawn or brains, which is why he's the Guild's most dangerous member and the Queen's one and only assassin. He's also bound to the Queen by an impossible vow--to find the missing Deian Scrolls, the fount of all magical history and knowledge, stolen years ago by a nefarious sect called the Aphrasians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shadow has been training all her life to follow in the footsteps of her mother and aunts--to become skilled enough to join the ranks of the Guild. Though magic has been forbidden since the Aphrasian uprising, Shadow has been learning to control her powers in secret, hoping that one day she'll become an assassin as feared and revered as Caledon Holt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a surprise attack brings Shadow and Cal together, they're forced to team up as assassin and apprentice to hunt down a new sinister threat to Renovia. But as Cal and Shadow grow closer, they'll uncover a shocking web of lies and secrets that may destroy everything they hold dear. With war on the horizon and true love at risk, they'll stop at nothing to protect each other and their kingdom in this stunning first novel in the Queen's Secret series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Marie Lu comes a historical YA fantasy about a musical prodigy and the dangerous lengths she'll go to make history remember her—perfect for fans of Susanna Clarke and &lt;i&gt;The Hazel Wood&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two siblings. Two brilliant talents. But only one Mozart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born with a gift for music, Nannerl Mozart has just one wish—to be remembered forever. But even as she delights audiences with her masterful playing, she has little hope she'll ever become the acclaimed composer she longs to be. She is a young woman in 18th century Europe, and that means composing is forbidden to her. She will perform only until she reaches a marriageable age—her tyrannical father has made that much clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as Nannerl's hope grows dimmer with each passing year, the talents of her beloved younger brother, Wolfgang, only seem to shine brighter. His brilliance begins to eclipse her own, until one day a mysterious stranger from a magical land appears with an irresistible offer. He has the power to make her wish come true—but his help may cost her everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her first work of historical fiction, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Marie Lu spins a lush, lyrically-told story of music, magic, and the unbreakable bond between a brother and sister.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Eighteen-year-old Keely Collins is determined to change her status as the last virgin standing in this sweet, hilarious rom-com for fans of Meg Cabot and Jenny Han.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed like a good plan at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the only other virgin in her group of friends loses it at Keely's own eighteenth birthday party, she knows it's time for drastic measures. If she's going to avoid heading to college without any experience of her own, she needs to find the guy, and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, she's known all the boys in her small high school forever, and it's kinda hard to be into a guy when you watched him eat crayons in kindergarten. So she can't believe her luck when she meets a ridiculously hot new guy named Dean. Not only does he look like he's fallen out of a classic movie poster, but he drives a motorcycle, flirts with ease, and might actually be into her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Dean's already in college, and Keely is convinced he'll drop her if he finds out how inexperienced she is. That's when she talks herself into a new plan: her lifelong best friend, Andrew, would never hurt or betray her, and he's clearly been with enough girls that he can show her the ropes before she goes all the way with Dean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the plan only works if Andrew and Keely stay friends--just friends--so things are about to get complicated.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A reflective, romantic coming-of-age novel that explores life after high school--perfect for fans of Fangirl and Emergency Contact&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A boy desperate to hold on, a girl ready to let go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fitz Holton waits in fear for the day his single mother's early-onset Alzheimer's starts stealing her memory. He's vowed to stay close to home to care for her in the years to come--never mind the ridiculous college tour she's forcing him on to visit schools where he knows he'll never go. Juniper Ramirez is counting down the days until she can leave home, a home crowded with five younger siblings and zero privacy. Against the wishes of her tight-knit family, Juniper plans her own college tour of the East Coast with one goal: get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Fitz and Juniper cross paths on their first college tour in Boston, they're at odds from the moment they meet-- while Juniper's dying to start a new life apart for her family, Fitz faces the sacrifices he must make for his. Their relationship sparks a deep connection--in each other's eyes, they glimpse alternate possibilities regarding the first big decision of their adult lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time of Our Lives is a story of home and away, of the wonder and weight of memory, of outgrowing fears and growing into the future.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;If I Stay meets One of Us is Lying in this gripping contemporary thriller.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When band-geek Ivy and her friends get together, things start with a rousing board game and end with arguments about Star Wars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her older sister Autumn is a different story. Enigmatic, aloof, and tough as nails, Autumn hasn't had real friends--or trusted anyone--in years. Even Ivy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Autumn might not be tough enough. After a drug deal gone wrong, Autumn is beaten, bound, and held hostage. Now, trapped between life and death, she leaves her body, seeking help. No one can sense her presence--except her sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Autumn doesn't come home, Ivy just knows she's in trouble. Unable to escape the chilling feeling that something isn't right, Ivy follows a string of clues that bring her closer to rescuing her sister... and closer to danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Autumn needs Ivy to find her before time runs out. But soon, both sisters realize that finding her also means untangling the secrets that lead to the truth--about where they're hiding Autumn, and what Autumn has been hiding.</description>

  <description>From the acclaimed author of Forest of a Thousand Lanterns comes a fantastical new tale of darkness and love, in which magical bonds are stronger than blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will love break the spell? After cruelly rejecting Bao, the poor physician's apprentice who loves her, Lan, a wealthy nobleman's daughter, regrets her actions. So when she finds Bao's prized flute floating in his boat near her house, she takes it into her care, not knowing that his soul has been trapped inside it by an evil witch, who cursed Bao, telling him that only love will set him free. Though Bao now despises her, Lan vows to make amends and help break the spell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, the two travel across the continent, finding themselves in the presence of greatness in the forms of the Great Forest's Empress Jade and Commander Wei. They journey with Wei, getting tangled in the webs of war, blood magic, and romance along the way. Will Lan and Bao begin to break the spell that's been placed upon them? Or will they be doomed to live out their lives with black magic running through their veins?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this fantastical tale of darkness and love, some magical bonds are stronger than blood.</description>

  <description>Jennifer Donaldson is back with another twisted thriller perfect for fans of One of Us Is Lying and Gone Girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zahra Gaines is missing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three long years away, Ruthie Hayden arrives in her hometown of Anchorage, Alaska to this devastating news. Zahra was Ruthie's best friend--the only person who ever really understood her--and she vows to do whatever it takes to find her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zahra vanished from a party just days before Ruthie's return, but the more people she talks to, the more she realizes that the Zahra she knew disappeared long before that fateful night. Gone is the whimsical, artistic girl who loved books and knew Ruthie's every secret. In her place is an athlete, a partier, a girl with secrets of her own. Darker still are the rumors that something happened to Zahra while Ruthie was gone, something that changed her forever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Ruthie desperately tries to piece together the truth, she falls deeper and deeper into her friend's new world, circling closer to a dangerous revelation about what Zahra experienced in the days before her disappearance--one that might be better off buried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her stunning follow-up to Lies You Never Told Me, Jennifer Donaldson once again delivers a propulsive thriller with a masterful twist, skillfully creating a world where nothing is quite as it seems.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A portrait of love, silence, and secrets under a Spanish dictatorship.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madrid, 1957. Under the fascist dictatorship of General Francisco Franco, Spain is hiding a dark secret. Meanwhile, tourists and foreign businessmen flood into Spain under the welcoming promise of sunshine and wine. Among them is eighteen-year-old Daniel Matheson, the son of an oil tycoon, who arrives in Madrid with his parents hoping to connect with the country of his mother's birth through the lens of his camera. Photography--and fate--introduce him to Ana, whose family's interweaving obstacles reveal the lingering grasp of the Spanish Civil War--as well as chilling definitions of fortune and fear. Daniel's photographs leave him with uncomfortable questions amidst shadows of danger. He is backed into a corner of difficult decisions to protect those he loves. Lives and hearts collide, revealing an incredibly dark side to the sunny Spanish city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes vintage media reports, oral history commentary, photos, and more.</description>

  <description>The stunning finale of the epic fantasy duology from New York Times bestselling author Beth Revis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alchemy student turned necromancer Nedra Brysstain has made a life-changing decision to embrace the darkness--but can the boy who loves her bring her back to the light before she pays the ultimate price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lunar Island is trying to heal. The necromantic plague that ravaged the land has been eradicated, and Emperor Auguste, the young and charming leader of the Allyrian Empire, has a plan: rid the island of necromancy once and for all. Though Greggori "Grey" Astor wants what's best for his people, he knows that allying himself with Auguste threatens the one person he loves most: necromancer Nedra Brysstain. Feeling like he already failed to save Nedra once, Grey becomes determined to help the Emperor rebuild Lunar Island while still keeping Nedra safe from harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back at the quarantine hospital, Nedra's army of revenants are growing increasingly inhuman by the day. Wracked with guilt for imprisoning their souls, Nedra vows to discover a way to free the dead while still keeping her sister by her side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, still reeling from the trauma of the plague, the people of Lunar Island are looking for someone to blame, and Grey can only protect Nedra for so long. And when Nedra and Grey are thrust into a battle with an even more terrifying adversary, Nedra will be pushed to the darkest depths of her necromantic powers. But can Grey let her go that far?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Told in two distinct and irresistible voices, Junauda Petrus’s bold and lyrical debut is the story of two black girls from very different backgrounds finding love and happiness in a world that seems determined to deny them both.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trinidad. Sixteen-year-old Audre is despondent, having just found out she’s going to be sent to live in America with her father because her strictly religious mother caught her with her secret girlfriend, the pastor’s daughter. Audre’s grandmother Queenie (a former dancer who drives a white convertible Cadillac and who has a few secrets of her own) tries to reassure her granddaughter that she won’t lose her roots, not even in some place called Minneapolis. “America have dey spirits too, believe me,” she tells Audre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minneapolis. Sixteen-year-old Mabel is lying on her bed, staring at the ceiling and trying to figure out why she feels the way she feels–about her ex Terrell, about her girl Jada and that moment they had in the woods, and about the vague feeling of illness that’s plagued her all summer. Mabel’s reverie is cut short when her father announces that his best friend and his just-arrived-from-Trinidad daughter are coming for dinner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mabel quickly falls hard for Audre and is determined to take care of her as she tries to navigate an American high school. But their romance takes a turn when test results reveal exactly why Mabel has been feeling low-key sick all summer and suddenly it’s Audre who is caring for Mabel as she faces a deeply uncertain future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Junauda Petrus’s debut brilliantly captures the distinctly lush and lyrical voices of Mabel and Audre as they conjure a love that is stronger than hatred, prison, and death and as vast as the blackness between the stars.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In the faux-documentary style of The Blair Witch Project comes the campfire story of a missing girl, a vengeful ghost, and the girl who is determined to find her sister--at all costs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a year, the path appears in the forest and Lucy Gallows beckons. Who is brave enough to find her--and who won't make it out of the woods?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been exactly one year since Sara's sister, Becca, disappeared, and high school life has far from settled back to normal. With her sister gone, Sara doesn't know whether her former friends no longer like her...or are scared of her, and the days of eating alone at lunch have started to blend together. When a mysterious text message invites Sara and her estranged friends to "play the game" and find local ghost legend Lucy Gallows, Sara is sure this is the only way to find Becca--before she's lost forever. And even though she's hardly spoken with them for a year, Sara finds herself deep in the darkness of the forest, her friends--and their cameras--following her down the path. Together, they will have to draw on all of their strengths to survive. The road is rarely forgiving, and no one will be the same on the other side.</description>

  <description>It's been more than 50 years since a tornado tore through a drive-in movie theater in tiny Mercer, Illinois, leaving dozens of teens -- a whole generation of Mercerites -- dead in its wake. So when another tornado touches down in the exact same spot on the anniversary of this small-town tragedy, the town is shaken. For Brenna Ortiz, Joshua Calloway, and Callie Keller, the apprehension is more than just a feeling. Though they seem to share nothing more than a struggle to belong, the teens' paths continue to intersect, bringing them together when they least expect it, and perhaps, when they need it most. Both the living and the dead have secrets and unresolved problems, but they may be able to find peace and move forward--if only they work together.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The second book in a heart-stopping trilogy that follows the captain of an all-female ship intent on taking down a vicious warlord's powerful fleet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caledonia may have lost her crew, but she's not done fighting yet. After nearly dying at the hand of a powerful foe, Caledonia is pulled from the sea and nursed back to health by a crew of former Bullets that call themselves Blades. The Blades escaped Aric Athair's clutches and now live a nomadic existence, ready to disappear at a moment's notice should trouble come their way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Caledonia wants to do more than just hide. She wants to find the Mors Navis and her beloved sisters. She wants to continue fighting Aric's fleet and to take back the Bullet seas. She'll need to do everything in her power to convince the Blades that fighting is their only option, that there has to be a life better than the one under Aric Athair's reign, and that finding the women of the Mors Navis is the first step to revolution.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The day after the funeral all our mourning clothes hung out on the line like sleeping bats. 'This will be really embarrassing,' I kept saying to my family, 'when she shows up at the door in a week or two.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Deena's wild and mysterious sister Mandy disappears - presumed dead - her family are heartbroken. But Mandy has always been troubled. It's just another bad thing to happen to Deena's family. Only Deena refuses to believe it's true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the letters start arriving. Letters from Mandy, claiming that their family's blighted history is not just bad luck or bad decisions - but a curse, handed down through the generations. Mandy has gone in search of the curse's roots, and now Deena must find her. What they find will heal their family's rotten past - or rip it apart forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A timely, searing, and unconventional romance from an urgent new voice in young adult fiction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one impulsive moment the summer before they leave for college, overachievers Scarlett and David plunge into an irresistible swirl of romance, particle physics, and questionable decisions. Told in non-linear, vivid first-person chapters, &lt;i&gt;As Many Nows As I Can Get&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a grounded girl who's pulled into a lightning-strike romance with an electric-charged boy, and the enormity of the aftermath. Cerebral, accessible, bold, and unconventionally romantic, this is a powerful debut about grief, guilt, and reconciling who you think you need to be with the person you've been all along.</description>

  <description>The year is 1973. The Watergate hearings are in full swing. The Vietnam War is still raging. And homosexuality is still officially considered a mental illness. In the midst of these trying times is sixteen-year-old Jonathan Collins, a bullied, anxious, asthmatic kid, who aside from an alcoholic father and his sympathetic neighbor and friend Starla, is completely alone. To cope, Jonathan escapes to the safe haven of his imagination, where his hero David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust and dead relatives, including his mother, guide him through the rough terrain of his life. In his alternate reality, Jonathan can be anything: a superhero, an astronaut, Ziggy Stardust, himself, or completely “normal” and not a boy who likes other boys. When he completes his treatments, he will be normal—at least he hopes. But before that can happen, Web stumbles into his life. Web is everything Jonathan wishes he could be: fearless, fearsome and, most importantly, not ashamed of being gay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan doesn’t want to like brooding Web, who has secrets all his own. Jonathan wants nothing more than to be “fixed” once and for all. But he’s drawn to Web anyway. Web is the first person in the real world to see Jonathan completely and think he’s perfect. Web is a kind of escape Jonathan has never known. For the first time in his life, he may finally feel free enough to love and accept himself as he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A poignant coming-of-age tale, Ziggy, Stardust and Me heralds the arrival of a stunning and important new voice in YA.</description>

  <description>By day, seventeen-year-old Jo Kuan works as a lady's maid for the cruel daughter of one of the wealthiest men in Atlanta. But by night, Jo moonlights as the pseudonymous author of a newspaper advice column for the genteel Southern lady, "Dear Miss Sweetie." When her column becomes wildly popular, she uses the power of the pen to address some of society's ills, but she's not prepared for the backlash that follows when her column challenges fixed ideas about race and gender. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While her opponents clamor to uncover the secret identity of Miss Sweetie, a mysterious letter sets Jo off on a search for her own past and the parents who abandoned her as a baby. But when her efforts put her in the crosshairs of Atlanta's most notorious criminal, Jo must decide whether she, a girl used to living in the shadows, is ready to step into the light.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The epic, magical saga of royalty, romance, and violence continues.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A princess. A soldier. A servant. A demon hunter. A thief. When we last saw them, this unlikely group was heading into the Northern Territory of the kingdom of Pitoria, on the run from the sadistic and power-hungry King Aloysius of Brigant. The Smoke Thieves have discovered that demon smoke is not only an illegal drug used for pleasure, but in fact, when taken by children, demon smoke briefly gives its users super-human strength. Aloysius' plan is simple and brutal: kill the demons for their smoke, and use that smoke to build an unstoppable army of children to take over Pitoria, Calidor, and then the rest of the world. The Smoke Thieves are the only ones who understand this plan—but can they stop it? Catherine, Aloysius' daughter, is seen as a traitor from all sides; Tash is heartbroken after the loss of her one friend and sees nothing left for her in the human world; Edyon is wanted for murder; March is carrying the secret of his betrayal of his new love; Ambrose is out for revenge--and all the while, the demons have plans of their own...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A multigenerational story about two teenagers: Victoria, who joins the circus in 1965, and her granddaughter, Callie, who leaves the circus fifty years later.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1965 seventeen-year-old Victoria, having just escaped an unstable home, flees to the ultimate place for dreamers and runaways--the circus. Specifically, the VanDrexel Family Circus where, among the lion tamers, roustabouts, and trapeze artists, Victoria hopes to start a better life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifty years later, Victoria's sixteen-year-old granddaughter Callie is thriving. A gifted and focused tightrope walker with dreams of being a VanDrexel high wire legend just like her grandmother, Callie can't imagine herself anywhere but the circus. But when Callie's mother accepts her dream job at an animal sanctuary in Florida just months after Victoria's death, Callie is forced to leave her lifelong home behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeling unmoored and out of her element, Callie pores over memorabilia from her family's days on the road, including a box that belonged to Victoria when she was Callie's age. In the box, Callie finds notes that Victoria wrote to herself with tips and tricks for navigating her new world. Inspired by this piece of her grandmother's life, Callie decides to use Victoria's circus prowess to navigate the uncharted waters of public high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across generations, Victoria and Callie embrace the challenges of starting over, letting go, and finding new families in unexpected places.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;This stunning YA debut is a timely and heartfelt speculative narrative about healing, faith, and freedom.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Marisol has always dreamed of being American, learning what Americans and the US are like from television and Mrs. Rosen, an elderly expat who had employed Marisol's mother as a maid. When she pictured an American life for herself, she dreamed of a life like Aimee and Amber's, the title characters of her favorite American TV show. She never pictured fleeing her home in El Salvador under threat of death and stealing across the US border as "an illegal", but after her brother is murdered and her younger sister, Gabi's, life is also placed in equal jeopardy, she has no choice, especially because she knows everything is her fault. If she had never fallen for the charms of a beautiful girl named Liliana, Pablo might still be alive, her mother wouldn't be in hiding and she and Gabi wouldn't have been caught crossing the border.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they have been caught and their asylum request will most certainly be denied. With truly no options remaining, Marisol jumps at an unusual opportunity to stay in the United States. She's asked to become a grief keeper, taking the grief of another into her own body to save a life. It's a risky, experimental study, but if it means Marisol can keep her sister safe, she will risk anything. She just never imagined one of the risks would be falling in love, a love that may even be powerful enough to finally help her face her own crushing grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Grief Keeper is a tender tale that explores the heartbreak and consequences of when both love and human beings are branded illegal.

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this stunning and heartrending tale set in a Swaziland boarding school, two girls of different castes bond over a shared copy of &lt;em&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adele Joubert loves being one of the popular girls at Keziah Christian Academy. She knows the upcoming semester at school is going to be great with her best friend Delia at her side. Then Delia dumps her for a new girl with more money, and Adele is forced to share a room with Lottie, the school pariah, who doesn't pray and defies teachers' orders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as they share a copy of &lt;em&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/em&gt;, Lottie's gruff exterior and honesty grow on Adele, and Lottie learns to be a little sweeter. Together, they take on bullies and protect each other from the vindictive and prejudiced teachers. Then a boy goes missing on campus and Adele and Lottie must rely on each other to solve the mystery and maybe learn the true meaning of friendship.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A fresh and addictive fantasy-romance set in modern-day Seoul.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eighteen-year-old Gu Miyoung has a secret--she's a gumiho, a nine-tailed fox who must devour the energy of men in order to survive. Because so few believe in the old tales anymore, and with so many evil men no one will miss, the modern city of Seoul is the perfect place to hide and hunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after feeding one full moon, Miyoung crosses paths with Jihoon, a human boy, being attacked by a goblin deep in the forest. Against her better judgment, she violates the rules of survival to rescue the boy, losing her fox bead--her gumiho soul--in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jihoon knows Miyoung is more than just a beautiful girl--he saw her nine tails the night she saved his life. His grandmother used to tell him stories of the gumiho, of their power and the danger they pose to humans. He's drawn to her anyway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With murderous forces lurking in the background, Miyoung and Jihoon develop a tenuous friendship that blossoms into something more. But when a young shaman tries to reunite Miyoung with her bead, the consequences are disastrous . . . forcing Miyoung to choose between her immortal life and Jihoon's.</description>

  <description>A powerful coming-of-age story about grief, guilt, and the risks a Filipino-American teenager takes to uncover the truth about his cousin's murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay Reguero plans to spend the last semester of his senior year playing video games before heading to the University of Michigan in the fall. But when he discovers that his Filipino cousin Jun was murdered as part of President Duterte's war on drugs, and no one in the family wants to talk about what happened, Jay travels to the Philippines to find out the real story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to uncover more about Jun and the events that led to his death, Jay is forced to reckon with the many sides of his cousin before he can face the whole horrible truth -- and the part he played in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As gripping as it is lyrical, Patron Saints of Nothing is a page-turning portrayal of the struggle to reconcile faith, family, and immigrant identity.</description>

  <description>In the tradition of Laurie Halse Anderson and Sara Zarr, one girl embraces the power of her voice: rules are meant to be broken and she won’t stay silent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Skye has her sights set on one thing: getting the heck out of Dodge. Art school is her ticket out and she’s already been accepted to her first choice, MICA. All she has to do is survive her senior year, not get too drunk at parties, and be there for her little sister, Emma. Sure, she’s usually battling a hangover when she drives to pick Emma up, but she has everything under control. Until he returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her mom’s ex-boyfriend slithers his way back into her family, it’s all Skye can do to keep the walls of her world from crumbling. Her family has no idea Skye has been guarding a dark secret about her past–about him–and she never thought she would have to face him again. She knows she has to get away from him at all costs. But how can she abandon Emma? Skye’s heart is torn between escaping the man who hurt her years ago and protecting her loved ones from the monster in their midst. Running away from her fears isn’t an option. To save her sister–and herself–she’ll have to break all the rules.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Bold Type&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Social Network&lt;/i&gt; when three girls vying for prestigious summer internships through a startup incubator program uncover the truth about what it means to succeed in the male-dominated world of tech.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This summer Silicon Valley is a girls' club.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three thousand applicants. An acceptance rate of two percent. A dream internship for the winning team. ValleyStart is the most prestigious high school tech incubator competition in the country. Lucy Katz, Maddie Li, and Delia Meyer have secured their spots. And they've come to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet the Screen Queens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Katz was born and raised in Palo Alto, so tech, well, it runs in her blood. A social butterfly and CEO in-the-making, Lucy is ready to win &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;East Coast designer, Maddie Li left her home and small business behind for a summer at ValleyStart. Maddie thinks she's only there to bolster her graphic design portfolio, not to make friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delia Meyer taught herself how to code on a hand-me-down computer in her tiny Midwestern town. Now, it's time for the big leagues--ValleyStart--but super shy Delia isn't sure if she can hack it (pun intended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the competition kicks off, Lucy, Maddie, and Delia realize just how challenging the next five weeks will be. As if there wasn't enough pressure already, the girls learn that they would be the only all-female team to win &lt;i&gt;ever.&lt;/i&gt; Add in one first love, a two-faced mentor, and an ex-boyfriend turned nemesis and things get...&lt;i&gt;complicated&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with humor, heart, and a whole lot of girl power, &lt;i&gt;Screen Queens&lt;/i&gt; is perfect for fans of Morgan Matson, Jenny Han, and &lt;i&gt;The Bold Type&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>A novel about speaking out, standing up, and breaking free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miriam lives in New Jerusalem, a haven in the desert far away from the sins and depravity of the outside world. Within the gates of New Jerusalem, and under the eye of its founder and leader, Daniel, Miriam knows she is safe. Cared for. Even if she’s forced, as a girl, to quiet her tongue when she has thoughts she wants to share, Miriam knows that New Jerusalem is a far better life than any alternative. So when God calls for a Matrimony, she’s thrilled; she knows that Caleb, the boy she loves, will choose her to be his wife and they can finally start their life together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the ceremony goes wrong and Miriam winds up with someone else, she can no longer keep quiet. For the first time, Miriam begins to question not only the rules that Daniel has set in place, but also what it is she believes in, and where she truly belongs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alongside unexpected allies, Miriam fights to learn–and challenge–the truth behind the only way of life she’s ever known, even if it means straying from the path of Righteousness.</description>

  <description>Hannah's a witch, but not the kind you're thinking of. She's the real deal, an Elemental with the power to control fire, earth, water, and air. But even though she lives in Salem, Massachusetts, her magic is a secret she has to keep to herself. If she's ever caught using it in front of a Reg (read: non-witch), she could lose it. For good. So, Hannah spends most of her time avoiding her ex-girlfriend (and fellow Elemental Witch) Veronica, hanging out with her best friend, and working at the Fly by Night Cauldron selling candles and crystals to tourists, goths, and local Wiccans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But dealing with her ex is the least of Hannah's concerns when a terrifying blood ritual interrupts the end-of-school-year bonfire. Evidence of dark magic begins to appear all over Salem, and Hannah's sure it's the work of a deadly Blood Witch. The issue is, her coven is less than convinced, forcing Hannah to team up with the last person she wants to see: Veronica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the pair attempt to smoke out the Blood Witch at a house party, Hannah meets Morgan, a cute new ballerina in town. But trying to date amid a supernatural crisis is easier said than done, and Hannah will have to test the limits of her power if she's going to save her coven and get the girl, especially when the attacks on Salem's witches become deadlier by the day.</description>

  <description>Millie Quint is devastated when she discovers that her sort-of-best friend/sort-of-girlfriend has been kissing someone else. And because Millie cannot stand the thought of confronting her ex every day, she decides to apply for scholarships to boarding schools . . . the farther from Houston the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Millie can't believe her luck when she's accepted into one of the world's most exclusive schools, located in the rolling highlands of Scotland. Everything about Scotland is different: the country is misty and green; the school is gorgeous, and the students think Americans are cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem: Mille's roommate Flora is a total princess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's also an &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; princess. Of Scotland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, the girls can barely stand each other--Flora is both high-class &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; high-key--but before Millie knows it, she has another sort-of-best-friend/sort-of-girlfriend. Even though Princess Flora could be a new chapter in her love life, Millie knows the chances of happily ever afters are slim . . . after all, real life isn't a fairy tale . . . or is it?</description>

  <description>Biz knows how to float. She has her people, her posse, her mom and the twins. She has Grace. And she has her dad, who tells her about the little kid she was, who loves her so hard, and who shouldn't be here but is. So Biz doesn't tell anyone anything. Not about her dark, runaway thoughts, not about kissing Grace or noticing Jasper, the new boy. And she doesn't tell anyone about her dad. Because her dad died when she was six. And Biz knows how to float, right there on the surface—normal okay regular fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after what happens on the beach—first in the ocean, and then in the sand--the tethers that hold Biz steady come undone. Dad disappears, and with him, all comfort. It might be easier, better, sweeter to float all the way away? Or maybe stay a little longer, find her father, bring him back to her. Or maybe—maybe maybe maybe—there's a third way Biz just can't see yet.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A universal, deeply moving exploration of grief and empathy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its spare, poignant text and irresistibly sweet illustrations, &lt;i&gt;The Rabbit Listened &lt;/i&gt;is a tender meditation on loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When something terrible happens, Taylor doesn't know where to turn. All the animals are sure they have the answer. The chicken wants to talk it out, but Taylor doesn't feel like chatting. The bear thinks Taylor should get angry, but that's not quite right either. One by one, the animals try to tell Taylor how to process this loss, and one by one they fail. Then the rabbit arrives. All the rabbit does is listen, which is just what Taylor needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether read in the wake of tragedy or as a primer for comforting others, this is a deeply moving and unforgettable story sure to soothe heartache of all sizes.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;An enthralling debut perfect for fans of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Children of Blood and Bone&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; set in a North African-inspired fantasy world where two sisters must fight to the death to win the crown. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Eva is a princess, born with the magick of marrow and blood--a dark and terrible magick that hasn't been seen for generations in the vibrant but fractured country of Myre. Its last known practitioner was Queen Raina, who toppled the native khimaer royalty and massacred thousands, including her own sister, eight generations ago, thus beginning the Rival Heir tradition. Living in Raina's long and dark shadow, Eva must now face her older sister, Isa, in a battle to the death if she hopes to ascend to the Ivory Throne--because in the Queendom of Myre only the strongest, most ruthless rulers survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Eva is attacked by an assassin just weeks before the battle with her sister, she discovers there is more to the attempt on her life than meets the eye--and it isn't just her sister who wants to see her dead. As tensions escalate, Eva is forced to turn to a fey instructor of mythic proportions and a mysterious and handsome khimaer prince for help in growing her magick into something to fear. Because despite the love she still has for her sister, Eva will have to choose: Isa's death or her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A River of Royal Blood is an enthralling debut set in a lush North African inspired fantasy world that subtly but powerfully challenges our notions of power, history, and identity.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Red Rising&lt;/i&gt; in a debut young adult fantasy that's full of rivalry, romance... and dragons.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie and Lee were just children when a brutal revolution changed their world, giving everyone—even the lowborn—a chance to test into the governing class of dragonriders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now they are both rising stars in the new regime, despite backgrounds that couldn’t be more different. Annie’s lowborn family was executed by dragonfire, while Lee’s aristocratic family was murdered by revolutionaries. Growing up in the same orphanage forged their friendship, and seven years of training have made them rivals for the top position in the dragonriding fleet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everything changes when survivors from the old regime surface, bent on reclaiming the city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With war on the horizon and his relationship with Annie changing fast, Lee must choose to kill the only family he has left or to betray everything he’s come to believe in. And Annie must decide whether to protect the boy she loves . . . or step up to be the champion her city needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From debut author Rosaria Munda comes a gripping adventure that calls into question which matters most: the family you were born into, or the one you’ve chosen.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two sisters are torn apart by war and must fight their way back to each other in a futuristic, &lt;i&gt;Black Panther&lt;/i&gt;–inspired Nigeria.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 2172. Climate change and nuclear disasters have rendered much of earth unlivable. Only the lucky ones have escaped to space colonies in the sky. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a war-torn Nigeria, battles are fought using flying, deadly mechs and soldiers are outfitted with bionic limbs and artificial organs meant to protect them from the harsh, radiation-heavy climate. Across the nation, as the years-long civil war wages on, survival becomes the only way of life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two sisters, Onyii and Ify, dream of more. Their lives have been marked by violence and political unrest. Still, they dream of peace, of hope, of a future together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they're willing to fight an entire war to get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acclaimed author Tochi Onyebuchi has written an immersive, action-packed, deeply personal novel perfect for fans of Nnedi Okorafor, Marie Lu, and Paolo Bacigalupi.</description>

  <description>From Danielle Vega, YA’s answer to Stephen King, comes a new paranormal novel about dark family secrets, deep-seated vengeance, and the horrifying truth that evil often lurks in the unlikeliest of places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hendricks Becker-O’Malley is new in town, and she’s bringing baggage with her. With a dark and wild past, Hendricks doesn’t think the small town her parents moved her to has much to offer her in terms of excitement. She plans on laying low, but when she’s suddenly welcomed into the popular crowd at school, things don’t go as expected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hendricks learns from her new friends that the fixer-upper her parents are so excited about is notorious in town. Local legend says it’s haunted. Hendricks doesn’t believe it. Until she’s forced to. Blood-curdling screams erupt from the basement, her little brother wakes up covered in scratches, and something, or someone pushes her dad down the stairs. With help from the mysterious boy next door, Hendricks makes it her mission to take down the ghosts . . . if they don’t take her first.</description>

  <description>For seventeen-year-old Opal Hopper, code is magic. She builds entire worlds from scratch: Mars craters, shimmering lakes, any virtual experience her heart desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she can't code her dad back into her life. When he disappeared after her tenth birthday, leaving only a cryptic note, Opal tried desperately to find him. And when he never turned up, she enrolled at a boarding school for technical prodigies and tried to forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now. Because WAVE, the world's biggest virtual reality platform, has announced a contest where the winner gets to meet its billionaire founder. The same billionaire who worked closely with Opal's dad. The one she always believed might know where he went. The one who maybe even murdered him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What begins as a small data hack to win the contest spirals out of control when Opal goes viral, digging her deeper into a hole of lies, hacks, and manipulation. How far will Opal go for the answers--or is it the attention--she's wanted for years?</description>

  <description>High school senior Frank Li is a Limbo–his term for Korean-American kids who find themselves caught between their parents’ traditional expectations and their own Southern California upbringing. His parents have one rule when it comes to romance–“Date Korean”–which proves complicated when Frank falls for Brit Means, who is smart, beautiful–and white. Fellow Limbo Joy Song is in a similar predicament, and so they make a pact: they’ll pretend to date each other in order to gain their freedom. Frank thinks it’s the perfect plan, but in the end, Frank and Joy’s fake-dating maneuver leaves him wondering if he ever really understood love–or himself–at all.</description>

  <description>In 1872, New Orleans is a city ruled by the dead. But to seventeen-year-old Celine Rousseau, New Orleans provides her a refuge after she's forced to flee her life as a dressmaker in Paris. Taken in by the sisters of the Ursuline convent along with six other girls, Celine quickly becomes enamored with the vibrant city from the music to the food to the soirées and—especially—to the danger. She soon becomes embroiled in the city's glitzy underworld, known as La Cour des Lions, after catching the eye of the group's leader, the enigmatic Sébastien Saint Germain. When the body of one of the girls from the convent is found in the lair of La Cour des Lions, Celine battles her attraction to him and suspicions about Sébastien's guilt along with the shame of her own horrible secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When more bodies are discovered, each crime more gruesome than the last, Celine and New Orleans become gripped by the terror of a serial killer on the loose—one Celine is sure has set her in his sights . . . and who may even be the young man who has stolen her heart. As the murders continue to go unsolved, Celine takes matters into her own hands and soon uncovers something even more shocking: an age-old feud from the darkest creatures of the underworld reveals a truth about Celine she always suspected simmered just beneath the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At once a sultry romance and a thrilling murder mystery, master storyteller Renée Ahdieh embarks on her most potent fantasy series yet: &lt;i&gt;The Beautiful.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>High school senior Cameron Bright’s reputation can be summed up in one word: bitch. It’s no surprise she’s queen bee at her private L.A. high school—she’s beautiful, talented, and notorious for her cutting and brutal honesty. So when she puts her foot in her mouth in front of her crush, Andrew, she fears she may have lost him for good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to win him over, Cameron resolves to “tame” herself, much like Katherine in Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew. First, she’ll have to make amends with those she’s wronged, which leads her to Brendan, the guy she labelled with an unfortunate nickname back in the sixth grade. At first, Brendan isn’t all that receptive to Cameron’s ploy. But slowly, he warms up to her when they connect over the computer game he’s developing. Now if only Andrew would notice…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the closer Cameron gets to Brendan, the more she sees he appreciates her personality—honesty and all—and wonders if she’s compromising who she is for the guy she doesn’t even want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a previously published edition of ISBN 9780451481092. An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46225216-if-i-m-being-honest" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The Shoveler, the Freak, CanIHelpYou?, Loretta the Flea-Circus Ring Mistress, and First-Class Malcolm. These are the five teenagers lost in the Hemmings family's maze of tangled secrets. Only a generation removed from being simple Pennsylvania potato farmers, Gottfried and Marla Hemmings managed to trade digging spuds for developing subdivisions and now sit atop a seven-figure bank account, wealth they've declined to pass on to their adult children or their teenage grand children. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Because we want them to thrive," Marla always says. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does thriving look like? Like carrying a snow shovel everywhere. Like selling pot at the Arby's drive-thru window. Like a first class ticket to Jamiaca between cancer treatments. Like a flea-circus in a doublewide. Like the GPS coordinates to a mound of dirt in a New Jersey forest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the rot just beneath the surface of the Hemmings precious white suburban respectability begins to spread, the far flung grand children gradually find their ways back to each other, just in time to uncover the terrible cost of maintaining the family name.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A romantic comedy that sweeps you up with breezy writing and canny social commentary, set behind the scenes of the classical music world during one hot, anything-can-happen, New York City summer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruby has always been &lt;i&gt;Ruby Chertok&lt;/i&gt; future classical pianist, heir to the Chertok family legacy, daughter of renowned composer Martin Chertok. But after bungling her audition for the prestigious Amberley School of Music--where her father is on &lt;i&gt;faculty&lt;/i&gt;--Ruby is suddenly just . . . Ruby. And who is that again? All she knows is that she wants out of the orbit of her relentlessly impressive family, and away from the world of classical music for good. Yes? &lt;i&gt;Yes. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oscar is a wunderkind, a musical genius. Just ask any of the 1.8 million people who've watched him conduct his own compositions on YouTube--or hey, just ask Oscar. But while he might be the type who'd name &lt;i&gt;himself&lt;/i&gt; when asked about his favorite composer and somehow make you love him more for it, Oscar is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the type to jeopardize his chance to study under the great Martin Chertok--not for a crush. He's all too aware of how the ultra-privileged, ultra-white world of classical music might interpret a black guy like him falling for his benefactor's white daughter. Right? &lt;i&gt;Right.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the New York City summer heats up, so does the spark between Ruby and Oscar. Soon their connection crackles with the same alive, uncontainable energy as the city itself. But can two people still figuring &lt;i&gt;themselves&lt;/i&gt; out figure out how to be together? Or will the world make the choice for them?</description>

  <description>Almost everyone in the small town of Splendor, Ohio, was affected when the local steel mill exploded. If you weren’t a casualty of the accident yourself, chances are a loved one was. That’s the case for seventeen-year-old Franny, who, five years after the explosion, still has to stand by and do nothing as her brother lies in a coma. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of the tragedy, Franny found solace in a group of friends whose experiences mirrored her own. The group calls themselves The Ordinary, and they spend their free time investigating local ghost stories and legends, filming their exploits for their small following of YouTube fans. It’s silly, it’s fun, and it keeps them from dwelling on the sadness that surrounds them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one evening, when the strange and dangerous thing they film isn’t fiction–it’s a bright light, something massive hurdling toward them from the sky. And when it crashes and the teens go to investigate…everything changes.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;The stunning finale of the Project Nemesis trilogy from &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; bestselling author Brendan Reichs.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 64 members of Fire Lake's sophomore class have managed to survive the first two phases of the Program--and each other. Now, they alone have emerged into the dawn of a new era on Earth, into a Fire Lake valley that's full of otherworldly dangers and challenges. Although staying alive in this broken world &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; force Min, Noah, Tack, and the others to form new alliances, old feuds die hard, and the brutality of the earlier Program phases cannot be forgotten. But being a team isn't easy for the sophomores, and when they discover that they may not be alone on the planet after all, they'll have to decide if they're going to work together . . . or die together.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sweeping, multi-layered romance with a divine twist, by the Printz Honor-winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Passion of Dolssa&lt;/i&gt;, set in the perilous days of World Wars I and II.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1917, and World War I is at its zenith when Hazel and James first catch sight of each other at a London party. She's a shy and talented pianist; he's a newly minted soldier with dreams of becoming an architect. When they fall in love, it's immediate and deep—and cut short when James is shipped off to the killing fields.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aubrey Edwards is also headed toward the trenches. A gifted musician who's played Carnegie Hall, he's a member of the 15th New York Infantry, an all-African-American regiment being sent to Europe to help end the Great War. Love is the last thing on his mind. But that's before he meets Colette Fournier, a Belgian chanteuse who's already survived unspeakable tragedy at the hands of the Germans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty years after these four lovers' fates collide, the Greek goddess Aphrodite tells their stories to her husband, Hephaestus, and her lover, Ares, in a luxe Manhattan hotel room at the height of World War II. She seeks to answer the age-old question: Why are Love and War eternally drawn to one another? But her quest for a conclusion that will satisfy her jealous husband uncovers a multi-threaded tale of prejudice, trauma, and music and reveals that War is no match for the power of Love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A searing poetic memoir and call to action from the bestselling and award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Speak&lt;/i&gt;, Laurie Halse Anderson!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling author Laurie Halse Anderson is known for the unflinching way she writes about, and advocates for, survivors of sexual assault. Now, inspired by her fans and enraged by how little in our culture has changed since her groundbreaking novel &lt;i&gt;Speak&lt;/i&gt; was first published twenty years ago, she has written a poetry memoir that is as vulnerable as it is rallying, as timely as it is timeless. In free verse, Anderson shares reflections, rants, and calls to action woven between deeply personal stories from her life that she's never written about before. Searing and soul-searching, this important memoir is a denouncement of our society's failures and a love letter to all the people with the courage to say #metoo and #timesup, whether aloud, online, or only in their own hearts. &lt;i&gt;Shout&lt;/i&gt; speaks truth to power in a loud, clear voice-- and once you hear it, it is impossible to ignore.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the "unputdownable" international hit &lt;i&gt;The One Memory of Flora Banks&lt;/i&gt; comes a fast-paced cross-continental journey of identity, family, darkness and light, and the ways in which we define ourselves.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella Black has always had dark inclinations. She's successfully hidden her evil alter ego from her family and friends, but Bella is always there, ready to take control and force Ella to do bad things. When Ella's parents drag her out of school one afternoon and fly across the globe to Rio de Janeiro with no believable explanation, Bella longs to break free--and so does Ella. Because for all that her parents claim to be doing what's best for her, Ella knows there is something going on that they're not divulging, and she is determined to find out what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in Rio, Ella learns a shocking truth about her family that gives way to a mission through the streets and beaches of Brazil in search of her authentic self. But the truth has many layers, and as Ella uncovers more and more about her own history, she struggles to come to terms with just where it is that she came from.</description>

  <description>In a parallel present San Francisco, Natalia Peña works as a hotel maid, practices martial arts, and cares for her eleven-year-old brother, Calvino. In this version of our world, all children start to "wane" when they reach Cal's age; by their teen years, they've lost their ability to feel emotion. But Cal isn't waning. When a mysterious corporation kidnaps him for testing, Natalia's reaction surprises her: she's crushed, and she'll do anything to save her brother from their experiments. But the road to his rescue leads her into the path of a dashing but troubled billionaire's son, a cadre of killers, and, eventually, the shocking truth about waning.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Keralie Corrington may seem harmless, but in fact, she's one of Quadara's most skilled thieves and a liar. Varin, on the other hand, is an honest, upstanding citizen of Quadara's most enlightened region, Eonia. Varin runs afoul of Keralie when she steals a package from him, putting his life in danger. When Varin attempts to retrieve the package, he and Keralie find themselves entangled in a conspiracy that leaves all four of Quadara's queens dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no other choices and on the run from Keralie's former employer, the two decide to join forces, endeavoring to discover who has killed the queens and save their own lives in the process. When their reluctant partnership blooms into a tenuous romance, they must overcome their own dark secrets in hopes of a future together that seemed impossible just days before. But first they have to stay alive and untangle the secrets behind the nation's four dead queens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An enthralling fast-paced murder mystery where competing agendas collide with deadly consequences, &lt;i&gt;Four Dead Queens&lt;/i&gt; heralds the arrival of an exciting new YA talent.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The final book in the Valiant series takes Fallon and her warrior sisters on an epic journey from the corrupt Roman Republic to the wonder of the ancient world: Alexandria, Egypt.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“You are from a world, Fallon, that values honor over everything else. Rome is not that world.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of their victorious fight to win back the Ludus Achillea, Fallon and her gladiatrix sisters have become the toast of the Republic. Only for Fallon, glory turns to ashes when she learns that Cai has been stripped of his Decurion rank and declared infamia, cast down to serve as one of Caesar’s gladiators. All because he chose his love for her over the life of his treacherous father during the ludus uprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But treachery in Rome runs far deeper than Fallon ever suspected. While she is fighting for Cai’s freedom, the unthinkable happens and the Republic begins to tear itself apart at the seams. In the chaos that follows, the Achillea gladiatrices lose any protection they might have had once and for all. They’re not the only ones. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Fallon discovers that Cleopatra is in grave danger, she and her sister Sorcha rally their war band in an attempt to spirit the Queen of Aegypt out of Rome, embarking on a remarkable journey that will take them to Alexandria—the wonder of the ancient world—and beyond. Far beyond. Along the way, Fallon will have to decide where her heart truly lies, as well as what—and who—she is willing to sacrifice to get there.</description>

  <description>Warsaw, Poland. The year is 1940 and Lillia is 15 when her mother, Alenka, disappears and her father flees with Lillia and her younger sister, Naomi, to Shanghai, one of the few places that will accept Jews without visas. There they struggle to make a life; they have no money, there is little work, no decent place to live, a culture that doesn't understand them. And always the worry about Alenka. How will she find them? Is she still alive? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Meanwhile Lillia is growing up, trying to care for Naomi, whose development is frighteningly slow, in part from malnourishment. Lillia finds an outlet for her artistic talent by making puppets, remembering the happy days in Warsaw when they were circus performers. She attends school sporadically, makes friends with Wei, a Chinese boy, and finds work as a performer at a "gentlemen's club" without her father's knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But meanwhile the conflict grows more intense as the Americans declare war and the Japanese force the Americans in Shanghai into camps. More bombing, more death. Can they survive, caught in the crossfire?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Forced to become a child soldier, a sixteen-year-old Somali refugee must confront his painful past in this haunting, thrilling tale of loss and redemption for fans of &lt;i&gt;A Long Way Gone&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;What is the What&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Abdi's family is kidnapped, he's forced to do the unthinkable: become a child soldier with the ruthless jihadi group Al Shabaab. In order to save the lives of those he loves, and earn their freedom, Abdi agrees to be embedded as a spy within the militia's ranks and to send dispatches on their plans to the Americans. The jihadists trust Abdi immediately because his older brother, Dahir, is already one of them, protégé to General Idris, aka the Butcher. If Abdi's duplicity is discovered, he will be killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For weeks, Abdi trains with them, witnessing atrocity after atrocity, becoming a monster himself, wondering if he's even pretending anymore. He only escapes after he is forced into a suicide bomber's vest, which still leaves him stumps where two of his fingers used to be and his brother near death. Eventually, he finds himself on the streets of Sangui City, Kenya, stealing what he can find to get by, sleeping nights in empty alleyways, wondering what's become of the family that was stolen from him. But everything changes when Abdi's picked up for a petty theft, which sets into motion a chain reaction that forces him to reckon with a past he's been trying to forget. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this riveting, unflinching tale of sacrifice and hope, critically-acclaimed author Natalie C. Anderson delivers another tour-de-force that will leave readers at the edge of their seats.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Dead must stay buried.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karthia is nothing like it used to be. The kingdom's borders are open for the first time in nearly three hundred years, and raising the dead has been outlawed. Odessa is determined to explore the world beyond Karthia's waters, hoping to heal a heart broken in more ways than she can count. But with Meredy joining the ocean voyage, vanquishing her sorrow will be a difficult task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the daily reminder of the history they share, Odessa and Meredy are fascinated when their journey takes them to a land where the Dead rule the night and dragons roam the streets. Odessa can't help being mesmerized by the new magic--and by the girl at her side. But just as she and Meredy are beginning to explore the new world, a terrifying development in Karthia summons them home at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing political unrest on top of threats from foreign invaders means Odessa and Meredy are thrust back into the lives they tried to leave behind while specters from their past haunt their tenuous relationship. Gathering a force big enough to ward off enemies seems impossible, until one of Queen Valoria's mages creates a weapon that could make them invincible. As danger continues to mount inside the palace, Odessa fears that without the Dead, even the greatest invention won't be enough to save their fates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this enthralling, heartrending sequel to Reign of the Fallen, Odessa faces the fight of her life as the boundaries between the Dead and the living are challenged in a way more gruesome than ever before.</description>

  <description>It has been a year since the mysterious godsgem cured Cadrium’s king and ushered in what promised to be a new golden age. The heroes who brought the gem home are renowned in story and song, but for two fellows on the quest, peace and prosperity do not come easily. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Apprentice Knight Kalanthe Ironheart wasn't meant for heroism this early in life, and while she has no intention of giving up the notoriety she has earned, her reputation does not pay her bills. With time running out, Kalanthe may be forced to betray not her kingdom or her friends, but her own heart as she seeks a stable future for herself and those she loves.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Olsa Rhetsdaughter was never meant for heroism at all. Beggar, pick pocket, thief, she lived hand to mouth on the city streets until fortune--or fate--pulled her into Kalanthe's orbit. And now she's quite reluctant to leave it. Even more alarmingly, her fame has made her recognizable, which makes her profession difficult, and a choice between poverty and the noose isn't much of a choice at all.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Both girls think their paths are laid out, but the godsgem isn't quite done with them and that new golden age isn’t a sure thing yet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a tale both sweepingly epic and intensely personal, Kalanthe and Olsa fight to maintain their newfound independence and to find their way back to each other.</description>

  <description>Alex Mata doesn’t want to worry about rumors of alien incursions – he’d rather just skate and tag and play guitar. But when he comes home to find an alien has murdered his parents, he’s forced to confront a new reality: Aliens are real, his parents are dead, and nobody will believe him if he says what he saw. On the run, Alex finds himself led to the compound of tech guru Jeffrey Sabazios, the only public figure who stands firm in his belief that aliens are coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Sabazios’ invitation, Alex becomes a “Witness”—one of a special group of teens gifted with an ability that could save the Earth: they can glide through time and witness futures. When a Witness sees a future it guarantees that it will happen the way it’s been seen, making their work humanity’s best hope for controlling what happens next and stopping the alien threat. Guided by Sabazios, befriended by his fellow time travelers, and maybe even falling in love, Alex begins to find a new home at the compound -- until a rogue glide shows him the dangerous truth about his new situation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in a race against time, Alex must make a terrible choice: save the people he loves or save the world instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debut author Constantine Singer's fresh-voiced protagonist leaps off the page in this captivating novel that weaves sci-fi and contemporary fiction.</description>

  <description>The thrilling, genre-bending conclusion to Lady Helen's demon-hunting adventures, set in the glittering Regency world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Helen has retreated to a country estate outside Bath to prepare for her wedding to the Duke of Selburn, yet she knows she has unfinished business to complete. She and the dangerously charismatic Lord Carlston have learned they are a dyad, bonded in blood, and only they are strong enough to defeat the Grand Deceiver, who threatens to throw mankind into chaos. But the heinous death-soaked Ligatus Helen has absorbed is tearing a rift in her mind. Its power, if unleashed, will annihilate both Helen and Carlston unless they can find a way to harness its ghastly force and defeat their enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the final book of the trilogy that began with THE DARK DAYS CLUB and continued with THE DARK DAYS PACT, the intrepid Lady Helen's story hurtles to a shocking conclusion full of action, heartbreak, and betrayal.</description>

  <description>Sefia is determined to keep Archer out of the Guard's clutches and their plans for war between the Five Kingdoms. The Book, the ancient, infinite codex of the past, present and future, tells of a prophecy that will plunge Kelanna in that bloody war, but it requires a boy—Archer—and Sefia will stop at nothing to ensure his safety. The Guard has already stolen her mother, her father, and her Aunt Nin. Sefia would sooner die than let them take anymore from her—especially the boy she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But escaping the Guard and the Book's prophecy is no easy task. After all, what is written always comes to pass. As Sefia and Archer watch Kelanna start to crumble to the Guard's will, they will have to choose between their love and joining a war that just might tear them apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this heart-pounding, deeply-felt debut for fans of Jeff Zentner and Marieke Nijkamp, Sorboni Banerjee crafts a powerful story about the unbreakable bonds of friendship, the headiness of first love, and the courage to fight for a brighter future against all odds.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the dying cornfields of his family's farm, seventeen-year-old Cade finds a mysterious girl broken and bleeding. She has one request: hide me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With help from Cade's best friend, the son of the local veterinarian, the mysterious Jane Doe starts to heal, and details of her past surface. A foster kid looking for a way out, Jane got caught up in the wrong crowd and barely escaped with her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cade has been trapped in the border town of Tanner, Texas all his life and has a difficult past of his own. Reeling from his parents' separation, he's focused on one thing: a football scholarship--his one-way ticket out of town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the two plan their escapes, Jane and Cade spend their nights in the abandoned barn on the edge of the farm and their days with Cade's friends: sweet, artistic, Mateo and his vivacious sister Jojo who vows to be president one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just across the border in a city in Mexico lies the life Jane desperately wants to leave behind--a past filled with drugs and secrets, information she never wanted, and a cartel boss who is watching her every move.</description>

  <description>For Teodora DiSangro, a mafia don’s daughter, family is fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All her life, Teodora has hidden the fact that she secretly turns her family’s enemies into music boxes, mirrors, and other decorative objects. After all, everyone in Vinalia knows that stregas—wielders of magic—are figures out of fairytales. Nobody believes they’re real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the Capo, the land’s new ruler, sends poisoned letters to the heads of the Five Families that have long controlled Vinalia. Four lie dead and Teo’s beloved father is gravely ill. To save him, Teo must travel to the capital as a DiSangro son—not merely disguised as a boy, but transformed into one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Cielo, a strega who can switch back and forth between male and female as effortlessly as turning a page in a book. Teo and Cielo journey together to the capital, and Teo struggles to master her powers and to keep her growing feelings for Cielo locked in her heart. As she falls in love with witty, irascible Cielo, Teo realizes how much of life she’s missed by hiding her true nature. But she can’t forget her mission, and the closer they get to the palace, the more sinister secrets they uncover about what’s really going on in their beloved country—and the more determined Teo becomes to save her family at any cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the sequel to the acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Beasts Made of Night&lt;/i&gt;, Taj has escaped Kos, but Queen Karima will go to any means necessary—including using the most deadly magic—to track him down.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taj is headed west, but the consequences of leaving Kos behind confront him at every turn. Innocent civilians flee to refugee camps as Karima's dark magic continues to descend on the city. Taj must return, but first he needs a plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Arzu's help, Taj and Aliya make it to the village of her ancestors, home of the tastahlik—sin-eaters with Taj's same ability to both battle and call forth sins. As Taj comes to terms with his new magic, he realizes there are two very different groups of tastahlik—one using their powers for good, the other for more selfish ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aliya is struggling with her own unique capabilities. She's immersed in her work to uncover the secret to Karima's magic, but her health begins to mysteriously deteriorate. With the help of a local western mage, Aliya uncovers her true destiny—a future she's not sure she wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Taj and Aliya explore their feelings for each other and Arzu connects with her homeland, the local westerners begin to question Taj's true identity. Karima is on his heels, sending dark warnings to the little village where he's hiding. Taj will have to go back and face her before she sends her mostly deadly weapon—Taj's former best friend, Bo.</description>

  <description>The #1 bestselling series returns with a thrilling new story arc set in America!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vintage photographs reveal the never-before-seen world of peculiar America with a stunning addition—full-color images.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having defeated the monstrous threat that nearly destroyed the peculiar world, Jacob Portman is back where his story began, in Florida. Except now Miss Peregrine, Emma, and their peculiar friends are with him, and doing their best to blend in. But carefree days of beach visits and normalling lessons are soon interrupted by a discovery—a subterranean bunker that belonged to Jacob’s grandfather, Abe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clues to Abe’s double-life as a peculiar operative start to emerge, secrets long hidden in plain sight. And Jacob begins to learn about the dangerous legacy he has inherited—truths that were part of him long before he walked into Miss Peregrine’s time loop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the stakes are higher than ever as Jacob and his friends are thrust into the untamed landscape of American peculiardom—a world with few ymbrynes, or rules—that none of them understand. New wonders, and dangers, await in this brilliant next chapter for Miss Peregrine’s peculiar children. Their story is again illustrated throughout by haunting vintage photographs, but with a striking addition for this all-new, multi-era American adventure—full color.</description>

  <description>When seventeen-year-old Nedra Brysstain leaves her home in the rural, northern territories of Lunar Island to attend the prestigious Yugen Academy, she has only one goal in mind: learn the trade of medicinal alchemy. A scholarship student matriculating with the children of Lunar Island's wealthiest and most powerful families, Nedra doesn't quite fit in with the other kids at Yugen, who all look down on her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All, except for Greggori "Grey" Astor. Grey is immediately taken by the brilliant and stubborn Nedra, who he notices is especially invested in her studies. And that's for a good reason: a deadly plague has been sweeping through the North, and it's making its way toward the cities. With her family's life--and the lives of all of Lunar Island's citizens--on the line, Nedra is determined to find a cure for the plague. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grey and Nedra continue to grow closer, but as the sickness spreads and the body count rises, Nedra becomes desperate to find a cure. Soon, she finds herself diving into alchemy's most dangerous corners--and when she turns to the most forbidden practice of all, necromancy, even Grey might not be able to pull her from the darkness.</description>

  <description>Emika Chen barely made it out of the Warcross Championships alive. Now that she knows the truth behind Hideo's new NeuroLink algorithm, she can no longer trust the one person she's always looked up to, who she once thought was on her side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to put a stop to Hideo's grim plans, Emika and the Phoenix Riders band together, only to find a new threat lurking on the neon-lit streets of Tokyo. Someone's put a bounty on Emika's head, and her sole chance for survival lies with Zero and the Blackcoats, his ruthless crew. But Emika soon learns that Zero isn't all that he seems--and his protection comes at a price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caught in a web of betrayal, with the future of free will at risk, just how far will Emika go to take down the man she loves?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;The heartbreaking story of five generations of young people from a single African-and-American family pursuing an elusive dream of freedom.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The novel begins in suburban Minneapolis at the moment when seventeen-year-old Kollie Flomo begins to crack under the strain of his life as a Liberian refugee. He's exhausted by being at once too black and not black enough for his African American peers and worn down by the expectations of his own Liberian family and community. When his frustration finally spills into violence and his parents send him back to Monrovia to reform school, the story shifts. Like Kollie, readers travel back to Liberia, but also back in time, to the early twentieth-century and the point of view of Togar Somah, an eighteen-year-old indigenous Liberian on the run from government militias that would force him to work the plantations of the Congo people, descendants of the African-American slaves who colonized Liberia almost a century earlier. When Togar's section draws to a shocking close, the novel jumps again, back to America in 1827, to the children of Yasmine Wright, who leave a Virginia plantation with their mother for Liberia, where they're promised freedom and a chance at self-determination by the American Colonization Society. The Wrights begin their section by fleeing the whip and by its close, they are then ones who wield it. With each new section, the novel uncovers fresh hope and resonating heartbreak, all based on historical fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Dream Country, &lt;/i&gt; Shannon Gibney spins a riveting tale of the nightmarish spiral of death and exile connecting America and Africa, and of how one determined young dreamer tries to break free and gain control of her destiny.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A walk-the-walk, talk-the-talk, hands-on, say-it-loud handbook for activist kids who want to change the world!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by Abbie Hoffman's radical classic, &lt;i&gt;Steal This Book&lt;/i&gt;, author Alexandra Styron's stirring call for resistance and citizen activism will be clearly heard by young people who don't accept "it is what it is," who want to make sure everybody gets an equal piece of the American pie, and who know that the future of the planet is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Styron's irreverent and informative primer on how to make a difference is organized into three sections: The Why, The What, and The How. The book opens with a personal essay and a historic look at civil disobedience and teenage activism in America. That's followed by a deep dive into several key issues: climate change, racial justice, women's rights, LGBTQIA rights, immigration, religious understanding, and intersectionality. Each chapter is introduced by an original full page comic and includes a summary of key questions, interviews with movers and shakers--from celebrities to youth activists--and spotlights on progressive organizations. The book's final section is packed with how-to advice on ways to engage, from group activities such as organizing, marching, rallying, and petitioning to individual actions like voting with your wallet, volunteering, talking with relatives with different viewpoints, and using social activism to get out a progressive message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect book for older middle-schoolers and teens who care about the planet, the people with whom they share it, and the future for us all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A horror story about friendship, growing up, and finding a place in the world: &lt;i&gt;Gremlins&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Breakfast Club&lt;/i&gt; by way of Stephen King and &lt;i&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1982, the summer before seventh grade. &lt;/b&gt;Five kids with nothing in common--Sep, Arkle, Hadley, Lamb, and Mack--become instant friends. On the last day of summer, they find a stone box buried in the forest, and each places an object inside to seal their friendship. And they make rules:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never come to the box alone. &lt;br /&gt;Never open it after dark. &lt;br /&gt;Never take back your sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1986, the summer before eleventh grade.&lt;/b&gt; The five haven't spoken since that day in 1982. Sep has gone through the past four years alone and plans to escape to boarding school. But strange things are happening--mirrors are breaking unexpectedly, electricity is flickering in and out, and people are coming down with inexplicable physical ailments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone has broken the rules. And it seems the five committed more than objects to the box's ancient stone--they gave it their deepest secrets and darkest fears, and now these are being returned in a flood of shambling corpses, murderous toys, and undead pets. The gang must reunite in an attempt to discover the secrets of the sacrifice box--and Sep might be the only one who can stem its tide of evil before it's too late.</description>

  <description>Ava's disappearance was the crack in the Rivers family glacier. I wish I could explain to you how we were before, but I can't, because the before is so filmy and shadowed with the after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The after is all Vera remembers. When her twin sister, Ava, disappeared one Halloween night, her childhood became a blur of theories, tips, and leads, but never any answers. The case made headlines, shocked Vera's Northern California community, and turned her family into tragic celebrities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, at eighteen, Vera is counting down the days until she starts her new life at college in Portland, Oregon, far away from the dark cloud she and family have lived under for twelve years. But all that changes when a girl shows up at the local hospital. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her name is Ava Rivers and she wants to go home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ava's return begins to mend the fractures in the Rivers family. Vera and Ava's estranged older brother returns. Vera reconnects with Max, the sweet, artistic boy from her childhood. Their parents smile again. But the questions remain: Where was Ava all these years? And who is she now?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Darius doesn't think he'll ever be enough, in America or in Iran.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darius Kellner speaks better Klingon than Farsi, and he knows more about Hobbit social cues than Persian ones. He's about to take his first-ever trip to Iran, and it's pretty overwhelming--especially when he's also dealing with clinical depression, a disapproving dad, and a chronically anemic social life. In Iran, he gets to know his ailing but still formidable grandfather, his loving grandmother, and the rest of his mom's family for the first time. And he meets Sohrab, the boy next door who changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sohrab makes sure people speak English so Darius can understand what's going on. He gets Darius an Iranian National Football Team jersey that makes him feel like a True Persian for the first time. And he understands that sometimes, best friends don't have to talk. Darius has never had a true friend before, but now he's spending his days with Sohrab playing soccer, eating rosewater ice cream, and sitting together for hours in their special place, a rooftop overlooking the Yazdi skyline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sohrab calls him Darioush--the original Persian version of his name--and Darius has never felt more like himself than he does now that he's Darioush to Sohrab. When it's time to go home to America, he'll have to find a way to be Darioush on his own.</description>

  <description>After her family is killed by corrupt warlord Aric Athair and his bloodthirsty army of Bullets, Caledonia Styx is left to chart her own course on the dangerous and deadly seas. She captains her ship, the &lt;i&gt;Mors Navis&lt;/i&gt;, with a crew of girls and women just like her, who have lost their families and homes because of Aric and his men. The crew has one mission: stay alive, and take down Aric's armed and armored fleet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Caledonia's best friend and second-in-command barely survives an attack thanks to help from a Bullet looking to defect, Caledonia finds herself questioning whether to let him join their crew. Is this boy the key to taking down Aric Athair once and for all . . . or will he threaten everything the women of the &lt;i&gt;Mors Navis&lt;/i&gt; have worked for?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bonnie and Clyde may be the most notorious--and celebrated--outlaw couple America has ever known. This is the true story of how they got that way.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonnie and Clyde: we've been on a first name basis with them for almost a hundred years. Immortalized in movies, songs, and pop culture references, they are remembered mostly for their storied romance and tragic deaths. But what was life really like for Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker in the early 1930s? How did two dirt-poor teens from west Texas morph from vicious outlaws to legendary couple? And why?</description>

  <description>Ever since her older brother Andy died, Alison's life has been just as dark as her home in Tacoma, Washington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her mom is in perpetual mourning, her father ran out on them, and after hanging out with Andy's hard-partying friends for a year, Alison's reputation is trashed. She planned on taking the path of least resistance during her senior year--hanging out with her punk rocker boyfriend and trying not to flunk out of school--until a massive fight with her mother pushes her over the edge, and she runs away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, joining a group of radical environmentalists who are occupying a Washington State forest is just about having a place to crash. But the ancient woods prove to be as vibrant and welcoming as they are vulnerable, and for the first time, Alison realizes that she might be more powerful than she thought. As tensions in the forest mount and confrontations with authorities get physical, Alison has to decide whether she's willing to put her own life on the line to fight for what she believes in.</description>

  <description>Audrey's life has been planned out for her since she was born, and now she's supposed to attend Whedon College in the fall, where both of her parents work. But Audrey has a different plan in mind: She's not going to attend college at all. She's going to earn some money and move to Seattle, the city she's loved since she was a child. And the best way to earn that money is by working the night shift at the local nursing home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seth O'Malley works there, too, and a romance quickly blossoms between them. But things get complicated when Audrey saves the life of Cameron Suzuki, Seth's ex. A video of her performing CPR at the beach goes viral, and suddenly, Audrey's wanted for TV interviews and newspaper articles. And just when Audrey starts to love life at the nursing home--and life with Seth--Seattle comes knocking. Does she follow the path she set out for herself, even when it means leaving behind Seth and the cast of quirky patients she's come to care for? Or does she embrace a future with Seth--at least for the foreseeable future--at the cost of abandoning her dreams?</description>

  <description>Ever since her father moved out, Cassidy feels like her life has been falling apart. So a summer of riding horses at a ranch camp in Wyoming sounds like just what she needs--never mind the fact that she has a paralyzing fear of horses. She's determined to move past her fear, even if that means taking lessons from the insufferable (yet irresistible) junior wrangler Justin and embarrassing herself in front of the other campers. What follows is a summer of rodeos, complicated friendships, and a wild mustang thief on the loose.</description>

  <description>After&lt;br /&gt;Jess is alone. Her cabin has burned to the ground. She knows if she doesn’t act fast, the cold will kill her before she has time to worry about food. But she is still alive—for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before&lt;br /&gt;Jess hadn’t seen her survivalist, off-the-grid dad in over a decade. But after a car crash killed her mother and left her injured, she was forced to move to his cabin in the remote Canadian wilderness. Just as Jess was beginning to get to know him, a secret from his past paid them a visit, leaving her father dead and Jess stranded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After&lt;br /&gt;With only her father’s dog for company, Jess must forage and hunt for food, build shelter, and keep herself warm. Some days it feels like the wild is out to destroy her, but she’s stronger than she ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess will survive. She has to. She knows who killed her father… and she wants revenge.</description>

  <description>#AlexFromTarget meets queer Prince Charming in this glittering romcom following a teen music prodigy and the handsome socialite who unwittingly turns him into an internet sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a dingy Los Angeles club late one night, Cameron and Nate meet and find they have much more in common than their love of an obscure indie band. But when Nate learns that Cameron is the heir to a record label, the very one that destroyed his father's life, he runs away as fast as he can. The only evidence of their brief but intense connection is a blurry photo Cameron snaps of Nate's Sharpie-decorated Chuck Taylors as he flees. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that Cameron is a real life Prince Charming--he's handsome, famous, and rich--it's only fitting that he sets out to find the owner of the Sharpied shoes. Cameron's twin sister, a model and socialite, posts the picture of Nate's shoes on Instagram to her legions of fans with the caption, "Anyone know the gorgeous owner of these shoes? My hottie brother is looking for him." The internet just about breaks with the news of a modern fairy tale and the two become entwined in each other's lives in this sparkling story about the power of music, the demons that haunt us, and the flutterings of first real love.</description>

  <description>For the past eight years, sixteen-year-old Emilia DeJesus has done her best to move on from the traumatic attack she suffered in the woods behind her elementary school. She's forced down the memories--the feeling of the twigs cracking beneath her, choking on her own blood, unable to scream. Most of all, she's tried to forget about Jeremy Lance, the boy responsible, the boy who caused her such pain. Emilia believes that the crows who watched over her that day, who helped her survive, are still on her side, encouraging her to live fully. And with the love and support of her mother, brother, and her caring boyfriend, Emilia is doing just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a startling discovery about her attacker's identity comes to light, and the memories of that day break through the mental box in which she'd shut them away, Emilia is forced to confront her new reality and make sense of shifting truths about her past, her family, and herself.</description>

  <description>For Napoleon's stepdaughter, nothing is simple -- especially love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paris, 1798. Hortense de Beauharnais is engrossed in her studies at a boarding school for aristocratic girls, most of whom suffered tragic losses during the tumultuous days of the French Revolution. She loves to play and compose music, read and paint, and daydream about Christophe, her brother's dashing fellow officer. But Hortense is not an ordinary girl. Her beautiful, charming mother, Josephine, has married Napoleon Bonaparte, soon to become the most powerful man in France, but viewed by Hortense as a coarse, unworthy successor to her elegant father, who was guillotined during the Terror. &lt;br /&gt; Where will Hortense's future lie?&lt;br /&gt; Inspired by Hortense's real-life autobiography with charming glimpses of teen life long ago, this is the story of a girl chosen by fate to play a role she didn't choose.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A poignant, deeply funny coming-of-age story about first love, first loss, and the power of history to give life meaning.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History buff Ray knows everything about the peculiar legends and lore of his rural Connecticut hometown. Burgerville's past is riddled with green cow sightings and human groundhogs, but the most interesting thing about the present is the new girl--we'll call her Jane Doe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inscrutable, cool, and above all mysterious, Jane seems as determined to hide her past as Ray is to uncover it. As fascination turns to friendship and then to something more, Ray is certain he knows Jane's darkest, most painful secrets and Jane herself--from past to present. But when the unthinkable happens, Ray is forced to acknowledge that perhaps history can only tell us so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixing humor with heartache, this is an unmissable coming-of-age story from an exciting new voice in YA.</description>

  <description>The fourth book of the scream-worthy cult series The Merciless combines Stephen King level terror with true crime stories like the Amanda Knox case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ropes tighten on Berkley Hubbard's wrists. Blood drips down her fingers and lands with a smack on the cold floor of the church basement. She's trapped, bound, and petrified by fear. A knife punctures her fragile skin as Berkley's captors search for the mark of the devil on her body. They say they want to save her--drive the devil away and cleanse her soul--but will she make it out alive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Berkley arrived in Italy a week ago, the last thing she expected was that she'd end up fighting for her life. After spending six months at the Institute, confined to a room with the dangerous-yet-alluring Sofia Flores, Berkley was certain that a vacation in Italy with her two best friends would be the perfect getaway. But Berkley is hiding a terrible secret, one that threatens to undo everything. As she's forced to face her wicked past, she learns that the devil is always watching, and no one is coming to save her.</description>

  <description>For weeks, seventeen-year-old Mariko pretended to be a boy to infiltrate the notorious Black Clan and bring her would-be murderer to justice. She didn't expect to find a place for herself among the group of fighters—a life of usefulness—and she certainly didn't expect to fall in love. Now she heads to the imperial castle to resume a life she never wanted to save the boy she loves.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ōkami has been captured, and his execution is a certainty. Mariko will do what she must to ensure his survival—even marry the sovereign's brother, saying goodbye to a life with Ōkami forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Mariko settles into her days at court—making both friends and enemies—and attempting Ōkami's rescue at night, the secrets of the royal court begin to unravel as competing agendas collide. One arrow sets into motion a series of deadly events even the most powerful magic cannot contain. Mariko and Ōkami risk everything to right past wrongs and restore the honor of a kingdom thrown into chaos by a sudden war, hoping against hope that when the dust settles, they will find a way to be together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set against the backdrop of feudal Japan, &lt;i&gt;Smoke in the Sun&lt;/i&gt; is the breathless, romantic, not-to-be-missed fiery conclusion to a spell-binding adventure.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The highly anticipated third book in Sabaa Tahir's &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling EMBER QUARTET.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the Empire and within it, the threat of war looms ever larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blood Shrike, Helene Aquilla, is assailed on all sides. Emperor Marcus, haunted by his past, grows increasingly unstable, while the Commandant capitalizes on his madness to bolster her own power. As Helene searches for a way to hold back the approaching darkness, her sister's life and the lives of all those in the Empire hang in the balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far to the east, Laia of Serra knows the fate of the world lies not in the machinations of the Martial court, but in stopping the Nightbringer. But while hunting for a way to bring him down, Laia faces unexpected threats from those she hoped would aid her, and is drawn into a battle she never thought she'd have to fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in the land between the living and the dead, Elias Veturius has given up his freedom to serve as Soul Catcher. But in doing so, he has vowed himself to an ancient power that will stop at nothing to ensure Elias's devotion--even at the cost of his humanity.</description>

  <description>Gabe and Elyse have never met. But they both have something to hide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quiet, shy Elyse can't believe it when she's cast as the lead in her Portland high school's production of Romeo and Juliet. Her best friend, Brynn, is usually the star, and Elyse isn't sure she's up to the task. But when someone at rehearsals starts to catch her eye--someone she knows she absolutely shouldn't be with--she can't help but be pulled into the spotlight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Austin native Gabe is contemplating the unthinkable--breaking up with Sasha, his headstrong, popular girlfriend. She's not going to let him slip through her fingers, though, and when rumors start to circulate around school, he knows she has the power to change his life forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabe and Elyse both make the mistake of falling for the wrong person, and falling hard. Told in parallel narratives, this twisty, shocking story shows how one bad choice can lead to a spiral of unforeseen consequences that not everyone will survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two lives. Two worlds apart. One deeply compelling story set in both Bosnia and the United States, spanning decades and generations, about the brutality of war and the trauma of everyday life after war, about hope and the ties that bind us together.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zara and her mother, Nadja, have a strained relationship. Nadja just doesn't understand Zara's creative passion for, and self-expression through, photography. And Zara doesn't know how to reach beyond their differences and connect to a closed-off mother who refuses to speak about her past in Bosnia. But when a bomb explodes as they're shopping in their local farmers' market in Rhode Island, Zara is left with PTSD--and her mother is left in a coma. Without the opportunity to get to know her mother, Zara is left with questions--not just about her mother, but about faith, religion, history, and her own path forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Zara tries to sort through her confusion, she meets Joseph, whose grandmother is also in the hospital, and whose exploration of religion and philosophy offer comfort and insight into Zara's own line of thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in chapters that alternate between Zara's present-day Providence, RI, and Nadja's own childhood in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War of the 1990s, We Are All That's Left shows the ways in which, no matter the time and place, struggle and tragedy can give way to connection, healing and love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Shouldn't a girl get to star in her own love story?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Megan Harper is about due for her next sweeping romance. It's inevitable—each of her relationships starts with the perfect guy and ends with him falling in love . . . with someone else. But instead of feeling sorry for herself, Megan focuses on pursuing her next fling, directing theater, and fulfilling her dream college's acting requirement in the smallest role possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when she’s cast as Juliet (yes, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; Juliet) in her high school’s production, it’s a complete nightmare. Megan’s not an actress, and she’s used to being upstaged—both in and out of the theater. In fact, with her mom off in Texas and her dad remarried and on to baby #2 with his new wife, Megan worries that, just like her exes, her family is moving on without her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she meets Owen Okita, an aspiring playwright inspired by Rosaline from Shakespeare's &lt;i&gt;R+J&lt;/i&gt;. A character who, like Megan, knows a thing or two about short-lived relationships. Megan agrees to help Owen with his play in exchange for help catching the eye of a sexy stagehand/potential new boyfriend. Yet Megan finds herself growing closer to Owen, and wonders if he could be the Romeo she never expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their fresh and funny debut, Emily Wibberly and Austin Siegemund-Broka break down the high school drama to find there's always room for familial love, romantic love, and—most importantly—self-love.</description>

  <description>Meet Daisy Winters. She’s an offbeat sixteen-year-old Floridian with mermaid-red hair; a part time job at a bootleg Walmart, and a perfect older sister who’s nearly engaged to the Crown Prince of Scotland. Daisy has no desire to live in the spotlight, but relentless tabloid attention forces her to join Ellie at the relative seclusion of the castle across the pond. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the dashing young Miles has been appointed to teach Daisy the ropes of being regal, the prince’s roguish younger brother kicks up scandal wherever he goes, and tries his best to take Daisy along for the ride. The crown–and the intriguing Miles–might be trying to make Daisy into a lady . . . but Daisy may just rewrite the royal rulebook to suit herself.</description>

  <description>A princess, a traitor, a hunter and a thief. Four teenagers with the fate of the world in their hands. Four nations destined for conflict. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In Brigant, Princess Catherine prepares for a loveless political marriage arranged by her brutal and ambitious father. In Calidor, downtrodden servant March seeks revenge on the prince who betrayed his people. In Pitoria, feckless Edyon steals cheap baubles for cheaper thrills as he drifts from town to town. And in the barren northern territories, thirteen-year-old Tash is running for her life as she plays bait for the gruff demon hunter Gravell.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As alliances shift and shatter, and old certainties are overturned, our four heroes find their past lives transformed and their futures inextricably linked by the unpredictable tides of magic and war. Who will rise and who will fall? And who will claim the ultimate prize?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Happily Ever After gets a serious makeover in this swoony, non-stop, thrill-ride of a conclusion to the Trouble Is a Friend of Mine trilogy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one makes getting into trouble look as good as Philip Digby—and he looks good doing it. Now that he's back in town, he's plunged Zoe (and their Scooby Gang of wealthy frenemy Sloane, nerd-tastic genius Felix, and aw-shucks-handsome Henry) back into the deep end on the hunt for his kidnapped sister. He's got a lead, but it involves doing a deal with the scion of an alarmingly powerful family, not to mention committing some light treason. Zoe and Digby are officially together now, and she's definitely up for whatever closure this new caper might offer, even though this mystery will come with a twist neither expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With acerbic banter, steamy chemistry, and no small amount of sarcasm, Zoe and Digby are the will-they-or-won't-they, charismatic crime solving couple you've been waiting for.</description>

Maas.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although she was born to save the kingdom by sacrificing herself to the rising sea, Khosa's marriage to King Vincent has redeemed her. As the Queen of Stille, she's untouchable. But being Queen hasn't stopped her heart from longing for the King's stepbrother, Donil. And it hasn't stopped her body from longing for the sea itself, which still calls for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Khosa is made to choose between loyalty and love, Dara is on a mission for vengeance. Years ago, the Pietra slaughtered the entire Indiri race, leaving only Dara and her twin, Donil, alive. Now, spurned by King Vincent, Dara has embarked on a mission to spill the blood of Pietra's leader, Witt, and will stop at nothing to show his people the wrath of the last Indiri. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the waves crash ever closer to Stille, secrets are revealed, hearts are won and lost, and allegiances change like the shifting sand.</description>

  <description>1780. Albany, New York. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the war for American Independence carries on, two newlyweds are settling into their new adventure: marriage. But the honeymoon's over, and Alexander Hamilton and Eliza Schuyler are learning firsthand just how tricky wedded life can be. Alex is still General George Washington's right-hand man and his attention these days is nothing if not divided--much like the colonies' interests as the end of the Revolution draws near. Alex &amp;amp; Eliza's relationship is tested further by lingering jealousies and family drama.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;All-consuming fame and fortune prove too much for a teen popstar who suddenly goes missing--Eddie and the Cruisers for the Justin Bieber era.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 15-year-old Joshua Blackbird posts a performance of an original song on YouTube, he becomes an overnight sensation, catapulting to the dizzying heights of celebrity. Joshua is plucked from his middle-of-nowhere small town to pursue a pop star career complete with million-dollar record deals, international tours with sold-out crowds, and a diehard following who call themselves "Birdies." But it's not long before the never-blinking eye of fame begins weighing this bird down--the constant hunger of managers, record execs, paparazzi, even family, all leeching onto him. Then there is the staged romance with a teen pop princess and the unsettling fear brought on by a stalker. Everyone reaching out, determined to grab their piece of stardom, forgetting that an actual person--a kid nonetheless--is on the other side their grasp. It's all too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until, that is, Joshua Blackbird disappears. Was it a suicide? An accident?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Narrated from the perspective of Joshua's girlfriend from home, Roxie, The Falling Between Us presents every wannabe teen heartthrob's dream come true . . . only to realize it is a nightmare.</description>

  <description>The autumn morning after sixteen-year-old Audrey Harper loses her virginity, she wakes to a loud, persistent knocking at her front door. Waiting for her are two firemen, there to let her know that the moment she's been dreading has arrived: the enormous wildfire sweeping through Orange County, California, is now dangerously close to her idyllic gated community of Coto de Caza, and it's time to evacuate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of the next twenty-four hours, as Audrey wrestles with the possibility of losing her family home, she also recalls her early, easy summer days with Brooks, the charming, passionate, but troubled volunteer firefighter who enchants Audrey--and who is just as enthralled by her. But as secrets from Brooks's dark past come to light, Audrey can't help but wonder if there's danger in the pull she feels--both toward this boy, and toward the fire burning in the distance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A debut novel based on the true story of the iconic painter, Artemisia Gentileschi.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her mother died when she was twelve, and suddenly Artemisia Gentileschi had a stark choice: a life as a nun in a convent or a life grinding pigment for her father's paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She chose paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time she was seventeen, Artemisia did more than grind pigment. She was one of Rome's most talented painters, even if no one knew her name. But Rome in 1610 was a city where men took what they wanted from women, and in the aftermath of rape Artemisia faced another terrible choice: a life of silence or a life of truth, no matter the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He will not consume&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;my every thought.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I am a painter.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I will paint.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I will show you&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;what a woman can do.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Noah Livingston knows he is destined to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 64 members of Fire Lake's sophomore class are trapped in a place where morals have no meaning, and zero rules apply. But Noah's deaths have trained him--hardened him--to lead the strongest into the future . . . whatever that may be. And at any cost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Min Wilder knows that survival alone isn't enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped in a violent world where brute force passes for leadership, it's tempting to lay back and let everyone else fight it out. But Min's instincts rebel against allowing others to decide who lives and who dies. She's ready to fight for what she believes in. And against whomever might stand in her way.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A Jewish girl-turned-spy must infiltrate an elite Nazi boarding school in this highly commercial, relentlessly nail-biting World War II drama!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her mother is shot at a checkpoint, fifteen-year-old Sarah--blonde, blue-eyed, and Jewish--finds herself on the run from a government that wants to see every person like her dead. Then Sarah meets a mysterious man with an ambiguous accent, a suspiciously bare apartment, and a lockbox full of weapons. He's a spy, and he needs Sarah to become one, too, to pull off a mission he can't attempt on his own: infiltrate a boarding school attended by the daughters of top Nazi brass, befriend the daughter of a key scientist, and steal the blueprints to a bomb that could destroy the cities of Western Europe. With years of training from her actress mother in the art of impersonation, Sarah thinks she's ready. But nothing prepares her for her cutthroat schoolmates, and soon she finds herself in a battle for survival unlike any she'd ever imagined.</description>

  <description>When gunslinging Amani Al'Hiza escaped her dead-end town, she never imagined she'd join a revolution, let alone lead one. But after the bloodthirsty Sultan of Miraji imprisoned the Rebel Prince Ahmed in the mythical city of Eremot, she doesn't have a choice. Armed with only her revolver, her wits, and her untameable Demdji powers, Amani must rally her skeleton crew of rebels for a rescue mission through the unforgiving desert to a place that, according to maps, doesn't exist. As she watches those she loves most lay their lives on the line against ghouls and enemy soldiers, Amani questions whether she can be the leader they need or if she is leading them all to their deaths.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Hope is a decision, but it is a hard one to recognize in the face of oppression, belittlement, alienation, and defeat. To help embolden hope, here is a powerhouse collection of essays and letters that speak directly to teens and all YA readers. Featuring Marie Lu, James Dashner, Gayle Forman, David Levithan, Julie Murphy, Jeff Zentner, Renee Ahdieh, and many more!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"The hope of a secure and livable world lies with disciplined nonconformists who are dedicated to justice, peace and brotherhood."--Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all experience moments when we struggle to understand the state of the world, when we feel powerless and--in some cases--even hopeless. The teens of today are the caretakers of tomorrow, and yet it's difficult for many to find joy or comfort in such a turbulent society. But in trying times, words are power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of today's most influential young adult authors come together in this highly personal nonfiction collection of essays, poems, and letters, each a first-hand account that ultimately strives to inspire hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a modern day &lt;i&gt;Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Don't Sweat the Small Stuff for Teens&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hope Nation&lt;/i&gt; acknowledges the pain and shines a light on what comes after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors include: &lt;/b&gt;Marie Lu, David Levithan, Gayle Forman, Renee Ahdieh, Alex London, Julie Murphy, James Dashner, Christina Diaz Gonzalez, Sarah Mlynowski, Jeff Zentner, Ally Condie, Jenny Torres Sanchez, Romina Russell, Angie Thomas, Howard Bryant, Aisha Saeed, Margaret Stohl, Ally Carter, Nic Stone, I.W.Gregorio, Kate Hart, Atia Abawi, Libba Bray</description>

  <description>In the hours after a bridge collapse rocks their city, a group of Boston teenagers meet in the waiting room of Massachusetts General Hospital: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Siblings Jason and Alexa have already experienced enough grief for a lifetime, so in this moment of confusion and despair, Alexa hopes that she can look to her brother for support. But a secret Jason has been keeping from his sister threatens to tear the siblings apart…right when they need each other most. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Scott is waiting to hear about his girlfriend, Aimee, who was on a bus with her theater group when the bridge went down. Their relationship has been rocky, but Scott knows that if he can just see Aimee one more time, if she can just make it through this ordeal and he can tell her he loves her, everything will be all right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And then there’s Skyler, whose sister Kate—the sister who is more like a mother, the sister who is basically Skyler’s everything—was crossing the bridge when it collapsed. As the minutes tick by without a word from the hospital staff, Skyler is left to wonder how she can possibly move through life without the one person who makes her feel strong when she’s at her weakest.</description>

  <description>Scott Ferdowsi has a track record of quitting. Writing the Great American Novel? Three chapters. His summer internship? One week. His best friends know exactly what they want to do with the rest of their lives, but Scott can hardly commit to a breakfast cereal, let alone a passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With college applications looming, Scott's parents pressure him to get serious and settle on a career path like engineering or medicine. Desperate for help, he sneaks off to Washington, DC, to seek guidance from a famous professor who specializes in grit, the psychology of success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He never expects an adventure to unfold out of what was supposed to be a one-day visit. But that's what Scott gets when he meets Fiora Buchanan, a ballsy college student whose life ambition is to write crossword puzzles. When the bicycle she lends him gets Scott into a high-speed chase, he knows he's in for the ride of his life. Soon, Scott finds himself sneaking into bars, attempting to pick up girls at the National Zoo, and even giving the crossword thing a try--all while opening his eyes to fundamental truths about who he is and who he wants to be.</description>

  <description>Hollywood rising star and passionate humanitarian Rowan Blanchard shares her beloved personal scrapbook with the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring art and writing from her favorite photographers, poets, and friends alongside her own journal entries and snapshots,&lt;b&gt; STILL HERE &lt;/b&gt; is an unedited look at Rowan Blanchard’s inner life–and a poignant representation of teen life in general. Alongside Rowan’s own raw diary entries, poems, and personal photos are taped in letters, photos, and poems from her friends who inspire her, like the poet rupi kaur, photographer Gia Coppola, and writer Jenny Zhang, among others. The result is an intimate portrayal of modern girlhood and a thoughtful reflection on what it means to be a teenager in today’s world.</description>

  <description>Darrian dreams of writing for the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;. To hone his skills and learn more about the power of words, he enrolls in Mr. Ward's class, known for its open-mic poetry readings and boys vs. girls poetry slam. Everyone in class has something important to say, and in sharing their poetry, they learn that they all face challenges and have a story to tell--whether it's about health problems, aging out of foster care, being bullied for religious beliefs, or having to take on too much responsibility because of an addicted parent. As Darrian and his classmates get to know one another through poetry, they bond over the shared experiences and truth that emerge from their writing, despite their private struggles and outward differences.</description>

  <description>Kay Donovan may have skeletons in her closet, but the past is past, and she's reinvented herself entirely. Now she's a star soccer player whose group of gorgeous friends run their private school with effortless popularity and acerbic wit. But when a girl's body is found in the lake, Kay's carefully constructed life begins to topple. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dead girl has left Kay a computer-coded scavenger hunt, which, as it unravels, begins to implicate suspect after suspect, until Kay herself is in the crosshairs of a murder investigation. But if Kay's finally backed into a corner, she'll do what it takes to survive. Because at Bates Academy, the truth is something you make...not something that happened.</description>

  <description>In a country ripped apart by war, Tareq lives with his big and loving family . . . until the bombs strike. His city is in ruins. His life is destroyed. And those who have survived are left to figure out their uncertain future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of destruction, he's threatened by Daesh fighters and witnesses a public beheading. Tareq's family knows that to continue to stay alive, they must leave. As they travel as refugees from Syria to Turkey to Greece, facing danger at every turn, Tareq must find the resilience and courage to complete his harrowing journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while this is one family's story, it is also the timeless tale of all wars, of all tragedy, and of all strife. When you are a refugee, success is outliving your loss.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The darling of the Roman Empire is in for the fight of her life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Be brave, gladiatrix… And be wary. Once you win Caesar’s love, you’ll earn his enemies’ hate.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fallon was warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she is about to pay the price for winning the love of the Roman people as Caesar’s victorious gladiatrix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this highly anticipated sequel to THE VALIANT, Fallon and her warrior sisters find themselves thrust into a vicious conflict with a rival gladiator academy, one that will threaten not only Fallon’s heart – and her love for Roman soldier Cai – but the very heart of the ancient Roman Empire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When dark treachery and vicious power struggles threaten her hard-won freedom, the only thing that might help the girl known as Victrix save herself and her sisters is a tribe of long-forgotten mythic Amazon warriors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only trouble is, they might just kill her themselves first.</description>

  <description>Odessa is one of Karthia's master necromancers, catering to the kingdom's ruling Dead. Whenever a noble dies, it's Odessa's job to raise them by retrieving their souls from a dreamy and dangerous shadow world called the Deadlands. But there is a cost to being raised--the Dead must remain shrouded, or risk transforming into zombie-like monsters known as Shades. If even a hint of flesh is exposed, the grotesque transformation will begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dramatic uptick in Shade attacks raises suspicions and fears among Odessa's necromancer community. Soon a crushing loss of one of their own reveals a disturbing conspiracy: someone is intentionally creating Shades by tearing shrouds from the Dead--and training them to attack. Odessa is faced with a terrifying question: What if her necromancer's magic is the weapon that brings Karthia to its knees?</description>

  <description>Mila Flores and her best friend Riley have always been inseparable. There's not much excitement in their small town of Cross Creek, so Mila and Riley make their own fun, devoting most of their time to Riley's favorite activity: amateur witchcraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Riley and two Fairmont Academy mean girls die under suspicious circumstances, Mila refuses to believe everyone's explanation that her BFF was involved in a suicide pact. Instead, armed with a tube of lip gloss and an ancient grimoire, Mila does the unthinkable to uncover the truth: she brings the girls back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Riley, June, and Dayton have no recollection of their murders, but they do have unfinished business to attend to. Now, with only seven days until the spell wears off and the girls return to their graves, Mila must wrangle the distracted group of undead teens and work fast to discover their murderer...before the killer strikes again.</description>

  <description>In the walled city of Kos, corrupt mages can magically call forth sin from a sinner in the form of sin-beasts – lethal creatures spawned from feelings of guilt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taj is the most talented of the aki, young sin-eaters indentured by the mages to slay the sin-beasts. But Taj’s livelihood comes at a terrible cost. When he kills a sin-beast, a tattoo of the beast appears on his skin while the guilt of committing the sin appears on his mind. Most aki are driven mad by the process, but 17-year-old Taj is cocky and desperate to provide for his family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Taj is called to eat a sin of a royal, he’s suddenly thrust into the center of a dark conspiracy to destroy Kos. Now Taj must fight to save the princess that he loves – and his own life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gritty Nigerian-influenced fantasy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;As bubbly as champagne and delectable as wedding cake, &lt;i&gt;Once and for All&lt;/i&gt;, Sarah Dessen's thirteenth novel, is set in the world of wedding planning, where crises are routine.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Louna, daughter of famed wedding planner Natalie Barrett, has seen every sort of wedding: on the beach, at historic mansions, in fancy hotels and clubs. Perhaps that's why she's cynical about happily-ever-after endings, especially since her own first love ended tragically. When Louna meets charming, happy-go-lucky serial dater Ambrose, she holds him at arm's length. But Ambrose isn't about to be discouraged, now that he's met the one girl he really wants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sarah Dessen’s many, many fans will adore her latest, a richly satisfying, enormously entertaining story that has everything—humor, romance, and an ending both happy and imperfect, just like life itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the critically acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Wolf Hollow&lt;/i&gt; comes a moving story of identity and belonging.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twelve-year-old Crow has lived her entire life on a tiny, isolated piece of the starkly beautiful Elizabeth Islands in Massachusetts. Abandoned and set adrift on a small boat when she was just hours old, Crow's only companions are Osh, the man who rescued and raised her, and Miss Maggie, their fierce and affectionate neighbor across the sandbar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crow has always been curious about the world around her, but it isn't until the night a mysterious fire appears across the water that the unspoken question of her own history forms in her heart. Soon, an unstoppable chain of events is triggered, leading Crow down a path of discovery and danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivid and heart wrenching, Lauren Wolk's &lt;i&gt;Beyond the Bright Sea&lt;/i&gt; is a gorgeously crafted and tensely paced tale that explores questions of identity, belonging, and the true meaning of family.</description>

They're going to face Munch the gator themselves, and they're going to reclaim their destinies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if the legend of Munch is nothing but a legend, after all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of friendship, family, and the everyday magic and adventure that readers of &lt;i&gt;Savvy&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A Snicker of Magic &lt;/i&gt;love, Cassie Beasley's newest middle grade book is another crowd-pleasing heart-warmer--perfect for reading by yourself, or sharing with someone you love.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;If you’re not careful, you can spend your whole life looking for what you’ve lost.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One stormy summer in a small Irish town, things begin to disappear. It starts with trivial stuff—hair clips, house keys, socks—but soon it escalates to bigger things: a memory, a heart, a classmate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olive can tell that her best friend, Rose, is different all of a sudden. Rose isn’t talking, and Olive starts to worry she’s losing her. Then diary pages written by someone named Laurel begin to appear all over town. And Olive meets three mysterious strangers: Ivy, Hazel, and her twin brother, Rowan, secretly squatting in an abandoned housing development. The trio are wild and alluring, but they seem lost too—and like Rose, they’re holding tightly to painful secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a tattered handwritten spellbook falls into the lives of these six teenagers, it changes everything. The spellbook is full of charms to conjure back that which has been lost, and it lists a part for each of them to play in the calling. It might be their best chance to set everything back to rights, but only if they’re willing to pay the price.</description>

  <description>Molly Mavity is not a normal teenage girl. For one thing, her father is a convicted murderer, and his execution date is fast approaching. For another, Molly refuses to believe that her mother is dead, and she waits for the day when they’ll be reunited . . . despite all evidence that this will never happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pepper Yusef is not your average teenage boy. A Kuwaiti immigrant with epilepsy, serious girl problems, and the most useless seizure dog in existence, he has to write a series of essays over the summer . . . or fail out of school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Ava Dreyman—the brave and beautiful East German resistance fighter whose murder at seventeen led to the destruction of the Berlin Wall—is unlike anyone you’ve met before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Molly gets a package leading her to Pepper, they’re tasked with solving a decades-old mystery: find out who killed Ava, back in 1989. Using Ava’s diary for clues, Molly and Pepper realize there’s more to her life—and death—than meets the eye. Someone is lying to them. And someone out there is guiding them along, desperate for answers.</description>

  <description>Everyone who really knows Brooklyn knows Devonairre Street girls are different. They’re the ones you shouldn’t fall in love with. The ones with the curse. The ones who can get you killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lorna Ryder is a Devonairre Street girl, and for years, paying lip service to the curse has been the small price of living in a neighborhood full of memories of her father, one of the thousands killed five years earlier in the 2001 Times Square Bombing. Then her best friend’s boyfriend is killed, and suddenly a city paralyzed by dread of another terrorist attack is obsessed with Devonairre Street and the price of falling in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in an America where recent history has followed a different path.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In a middle grade adventure full of humor, heart and cinematic storytelling, a boy takes off on a once-in-a-lifetime journey through a mysterious land, with the help of some monster friends&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s Halloween, and everyone in Charlie’s small town is excited for this year’s festivities. Charlie’s grandfather, Old Joe, is famous for his holiday haunts, and his pumpkin patch is the center of the town’s zealous celebrations. But for Charlie, Halloween’s just one more reminder that his cousin Billy isn’t around anymore. Charlie plans to keep to himself this year, hanging out in the haunted barn with his trusty dog Ringo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Charlie runs into some neighborhood bullies who are after his candy, he heads off into the woods to escape. He quickly gets lost, but spots a kid who he thinks is Billy. As Charlie chases after him deeper and deeper into the woods, he finds himself entering Monsterland—a mysterious place where werewolves live amongst trolls and goblins. Here he meets the Prime Minister, a vampire who tells Charlie he may be able to see his cousin again in this strange new land. Accompanied by a hulking monster chaperone, Charlie’s determined to find out just what happened to his cousin, and sets off to explore the secrets hiding in this uncharted territory.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The romantic companion to&lt;i&gt; My Life Next Door&lt;/i&gt;—great for fans of Sarah Dessen and Jenny Han. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tim Mason was The Boy Most Likely To find the liquor cabinet blindfolded, need a liver transplant, and drive his car into a house&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Alice Garrett was The Girl Most Likely To . . . well, not date her little brother’s baggage-burdened best friend, for starters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For Tim, it wouldn’t be smart to fall for Alice. For Alice, nothing could be scarier than falling for Tim. But Tim has never been known for making the smart choice, and Alice is starting to wonder if the “smart” choice is always the right one. When these two crash into each other, they crash hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Told in Tim’s and Alice’s distinctive, disarming, entirely compelling voices, this novel is for readers of&lt;i&gt; The Spectacular Now&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Paper Towns&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this royal adventure, Princess Juniper learns what it means to rule a kingdom–at least for the summer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For her thirteenth nameday all Princess Juniper wants is a country of her own. So when rumblings of unrest start in his kingdom, Juniper's father decides to grant his daughter's wish and sends her to a small, idyllic corner of the Hourglass Mountains until trouble blows over. Once there, Juniper discovers that ruling a small country–even just for the summer–is a bit harder than she'd expected, especially when cousin Cyril challenges her rule. Still, the most difficult part is to come. Juniper and her friends discover that her father's kingdom is at war. The only way to stay safe is to remain in the Hourglass Mountains much longer than planned. Juniper may have her own country after all . . . but what will that mean for the kingdom of Torr?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Frozen &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Brave&lt;/i&gt;, who like their princess strong and smart as well as sparkly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Princess Juniper of the Hourglass&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I absolutely loved &lt;i&gt;Princess Juniper of the Hourglass&lt;/i&gt;!  It's fantastically delightful, delicious, and satisfying.  You'll want to follow Juniper to her kingdom -- or even better, start your own!"--Sarah Beth Durst, author of &lt;i&gt;Enchanted Ivy &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Ice&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I adored Princess Juniper!

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Freaks and bullies, classes and crushes, this is high school.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting high school is never easy. Seniors take your lunch money. Girls you’ve known forever are suddenly beautiful and unattainable. And you can never get enough sleep. Could there be a worse time for Scott’s mother to announce she’s pregnant? Scott decides high school would be a lot less overwhelming if it came with a survival manual, so he begins to write down tips for his new sibling. Meanwhile, he’s trying his best to capture the attention of Julia, the freshman goddess. In the process, Scott manages to become involved in nearly everything the school has to offer. So while he tries to find his place in the confusing world of high school, win Julia’s heart, and keep his sanity, Scott will be recording all the details for his sibling’s—and your—enjoyment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;

  <description>Anna—who prefers to be called Anastasia—is a spooky and complicated high school girl with a penchant for riddles, Houdini tricks, and ghost stories. She is unlike anyone the narrator has ever known, and they make an unlikely, though happy, pair. Then Anna disappears, leaving behind only a dress near a hole in the frozen river, and a string of unanswered questions. Desperate to find out what happened the narrator begins to reconstruct the past five months. And soon the fragments of curious events, intimate conversations, secrets, letters—and the anonymous messages that continue to arrive—coalesce into haunting and surprising revelations that may implicate friends, relatives, and even Anna herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I’m the daughter of murdered parents.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’m the friend of a dead girl.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’m the lover of my enemy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And I will have my revenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; In the wake of the devastating destruction of the luxury yacht &lt;i&gt;Persephone&lt;/i&gt;, just three souls remain to tell its story—and two of them are lying. Only Frances Mace knows the terrifying truth, and she’ll stop at nothing to avenge the murders of everyone she held dear. Even if it means taking down the boy she loves and possibly losing herself in the process.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Sharp and incisive, &lt;i&gt;Daughter of Deep Silence&lt;/i&gt; by bestselling author Carrie Ryan is a deliciously smart revenge thriller that examines perceptions of identity, love, and the lengths to which one girl is willing to go when she thinks she has nothing to lose.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“Even if everyone thought I was lying, why couldn’t they just leave me alone? I hadn’t asked for any of them to believe me. I hadn’t asked for them to worship me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn’t asked them for anything.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mina is top of her class, girlfriend to the most ambitious guy in school, able to reason and study her way through anything. But when she finds herself pregnant—despite having never had sex—her orderly world collapses. Almost nobody believes Mina’s claims of virginity. Her father assumes that her boyfriend is responsible; her boyfriend thinks she must have cheated on him. As news of Mina’s story spreads, there are those who brand her a liar. There are those who brand her a heretic. And there are those who believe that miracles are possible—and that Mina’s unborn child could be the greatest miracle of all.</description>

  <description>On corporately controlled Castra, rally racing is a high-stakes game that seventeen-year-old Phoebe Van Zant knows all too well. Phee's legendary racer father disappeared mysteriously, but that hasn't stopped her from speeding headlong into trouble. When she and her best friend, Bear, attract the attention of Charles Benroyal, they are blackmailed into racing for Benroyal Corp, a company that represents everything Phee detests. Worse, Phee risks losing Bear as she falls for Cash, her charming new teammate. But when she discovers that Benroyal is controlling more than a corporation, Phee realizes she has a much bigger role in Castra's future than she could ever have imagined. It's up to Phee to take Benroyal down. But even with the help of her team, can a street-rat destroy an empire?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;It’s not easy being an undercover restaurant critic—especially when you’re only twelve years old!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After successfully completing her first restaurant review for the New York Standard newspaper, Gladys Gatsby is looking forward to a quiet summer of cooking and eating. But her plans quickly go awry when her friend Charissa Bentley delivers Gladys’s birthday gift: a free summer at Camp Bentley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Gladys feared, camp life is not easy; she struggles to pass her swim test, can’t keep the other campers happy while planning lunches, and cannot seem to get away from the annoying new “celebrity” camper. The worst part is she’s not able to find a moment to sneak away for her latest reviewing assignment: finding the best hot dog in New York City. But when Gladys learns that her hot dog assignment might actually be a dirty trick made up by a jealous fellow critic, she fears her reviewing career could be over forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfectly plotted sequel brings readers on a rollicking summertime adventure through New York City with all of the charm of All Four Stars—and even more foodie flavor!</description>

  <description>Missouri, 1849: Samantha dreams of moving back to New York to be a professional musician—not an easy thing if you’re a girl, and harder still if you’re Chinese. But a tragic accident dashes any hopes of fulfilling her dream, and instead, leaves her fearing for her life. With the help of a runaway slave named Annamae, Samantha flees town for the unknown frontier. But life on the Oregon Trail is unsafe for two girls, so they disguise themselves as Sammy and Andy, two boys headed for the California gold rush. Sammy and Andy forge a powerful bond as they each search for a link to their past, and struggle to avoid any unwanted attention. But when they cross paths with a band of cowboys, the light-hearted troupe turn out to be unexpected allies. With the law closing in on them and new setbacks coming each day, the girls quickly learn that there are not many places to hide on the open trail.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; This beautifully written debut is an exciting adventure and heart-wrenching survival tale. But above all else, it’s a story about perseverance and trust that will restore your faith in the power of friendship.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A book that challenges the word "powerful" and obliterates it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Written in searing prose, this is the story of two boys: Erik, who performs miracles, and Thorn, who hears voices. The book chronicles their lives as their minds devolve into hallucinations, and shows the way their worlds intersect, culminating in a final stand-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This debut novel offer a raw, insightful look at the forces that compel us to act against our will. Even more so, it captivates and dares us to look away, knowing full well we can't.</description>

  <description>Best friends. BFFs. Soul twinsies. Whatever you want to call them, Harper and Lily were born to be besties. With high school just around the corner, casual-cool Cali girl Harper and awkward, always-costumed Lily make sure to text each other every day about their bond:&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Harper:&lt;/b&gt; I love you so much that I am going to sneak out of detention to pay that guy from Craigslist $100 to cut off all your hair for my secret collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lily:&lt;/b&gt; I love you so much I’m going destroy everyone in your life that matters and force you to depend and love only me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Harper: &lt;/b&gt;That sounds beautiful. I love you.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Not even the threat of different high schools could throw this BFFship off-course, even if Lily begs her parents not to send her to the “dreaded Pathways," a special school for creative types, while effortlessly-popular Harper attends Beverly High with the rest of their class.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But in a city where fitting in means standing out and there’s nothing more uncool than being cool, it’s the naturally charismatic Harper--with her blond hair and perfect bone structure--who finds herself fighting the tide of American Apparel’d teens who rule the school. Meanwhile, it’s the perpetually “gawkward” Lily--who accessories every ensemble with a pair of tattered fairy wings--who finds herself flying alongside the queen bees of Pathways. Can BFF-ship survive the tidal wave of HS drama, or does growing up mean leaving some friends behind?</description>

  <description>Every October Cara and her family become inexplicably and unavoidably accident-prone. Some years it's bad, like the season when her father died, and some years it's just a lot of cuts and scrapes. This accident season—when Cara, her ex-stepbrother, Sam, and her best friend, Bea, are 17—is going to be a bad one. But not for the reasons they think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cara is about to learn that not all the scars left by the accident season are physical: There's a long-hidden family secret underneath the bumps and bruises. This is the year Cara will finally fall desperately in love, when she'll start discovering the painful truth about the adults in her life, and when she'll uncover the dark origins of the accident season—whether she's ready or not.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A gritty, powerful debut that evokes &lt;i&gt;The Outsiders&lt;/i&gt;. You won't be able to look away.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; High school senior Jason knows how to take a punch. Living with an abusive father will teach a kid that. But he’s also learned how to hit back, earning a reputation at school that ensures no one will mess with him. Even so, all Jason truly wants is to survive his father long enough to turn eighteen, take his younger sister, Janie, and run away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Then one day, the leader of the in crowd at school, Michael, offers to pay Jason to hang out with him. Jason figures Michael simply wants to be seen with someone with a tough rep and that the money will add up fast, making Jason’s escape plan a reality. Plus, there’s Michael’s girl, Cyndra, who looks at Jason as if she sees something behind his false smile. As Jason gets drawn deeper into Michael’s game, the money keeps flowing, but the stakes grow ever more dangerous. Soon, even Jason’s fists and his ability to think on his feet aren’t enough to keep his head above water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still Waters&lt;/i&gt; is an intense, gritty thriller that pulls no punches—yet leaves you rooting for the tough guy. A powerful, dynamic debut.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>This was going to be the year Normandy Pale came into her own. The year she emerged from her older sister’s shadow—and Kiera, who became a best-selling graphic novelist before she even graduated from high school, casts a long one. But it hasn’t worked out that way, not quite. So Normandy turns to her art and writing, and the “truth commission” she and her friends have started to find out the secrets at their school. It’s a great idea, as far as it goes—until it leads straight back to Kiera, who has been hiding some pretty serious truths of her own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Juby’s The Truth Commission: A story about easy truths, hard truths, and those things best left unsaid.</description>

  <description>Juliana Romano's expressive debut is an absorbing and bittersweet story about first love, first loss, and the friends that carry us through it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lima and Hailey have always been best friends: Lima shy and sensitive, Hailey funny and free-spirited. But Hailey abandons Lima to party with the popular kids and pursue Nate, her disinterested crush. As their friendship falters, Lima and Nate begin spending more time together. And before Lima knows what she’s feeling, she and Nate do something irreversible. Something that would hurt Hailey....if she knew it happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lima thinks she’s saving her friendship by lying, but she’s only buying time. As the secrets stack up, Lima is forced to make a choice: between her best friend forever, and the boy who wasn’t meant to be hers.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Though technically twins,&lt;/b&gt; Kyle and Connor McAdams couldn't be more different. Connor's the star of the track team, the valedictorian, a demigod living among the students at Rose Hill High School. But Kyle is more of a loner who's most comfortable playing video games in the basement. Also, these twins were born two years apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conceived in vitro at the Genesis Innovations Laboratory after their parents struggled to have children, the boys were carried separately; they thought it'd be safer that way. And it was, until Connor suddenly dies of a heart attack on his eighteenth birthday. Soon Kyle learns of other kids conceived in the Genesis lab who've died the exact same way. It turns out the doctor their parents enlisted to help them may not have been everything he seemed. He gave them perfect children, but with one fatal flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as he's falling in love, Kyle's caught in a race against time to unlock the secrets hidden in his DNA. A thrilling adventure that will keep readers guessing at every turn, &lt;i&gt;Deadly Design&lt;/i&gt; is packed with adrenaline and heart.</description>

  <description>It’s Tiny Cooper’s turn in the spotlight in this companion novel to &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Will Grayson, Will Grayson.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Jazz hands at the ready! Tiny Cooper (“the world’s largest person who is also really, really gay”) stole readers’ hearts when he was introduced to the world in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling book &lt;i&gt;Will Grayson, Will Grayson, &lt;/i&gt;co-authored by John Green and David Levithan. Now Tiny finally gets to tell his story—from his fabulous birth and childhood to his quest for true love and his infamous parade of ex-boyfriends—the way he always intended: as a musical! Filled with honesty, humor, and “big, lively, belty” musical numbers, the novel is told through the full script of the musical first introduced in &lt;i&gt;Will Grayson, Will Grayson&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I am a collection of oddities, a circus of neurons and electrons: my heart is the ringmaster, my soul is the trapeze artist, and the world is my audience. It sounds strange because it is, and it is, because I am strange.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the sudden collapse of her family, Mim Malone is dragged from her home in northern Ohio to the "wastelands" of Mississippi, where she lives in a medicated milieu with her dad and new stepmom. Before the dust has a chance to settle, she learns her mother is sick back in Cleveland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So she ditches her new life and hops aboard a northbound Greyhound bus to her real home and her real mother, meeting a quirky cast of fellow travelers along the way. But when her thousand-mile journey takes a few turns she could never see coming, Mim must confront her own demons, redefining her notions of love, loyalty, and what it means to be sane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in an unforgettable, kaleidoscopic voice, &lt;i&gt;Mosquitoland&lt;/i&gt; is a modern American odyssey, as hilarious as it is heartbreaking.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An epic fantasy about dragons, dark secrets, Pendragons, and magic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On the southernmost tip of Wilde Island--far from the Dragonswood sanctuary and the Pendragon Castle--live the native Euit people. Uma, who is half Euit and half English, and not fully accepted by her tribe, wants to become a healer like her Euit father. But the mad English queen in the north, desperate for another child, kidnaps Uma and her father and demands that he cure her barrenness. After her father dies, Uma must ensure that the queen is with child by the time of the Dragon Moon, or be burned at the stake.&lt;br /&gt; Terrified and alone, Uma reaches out to her only possible ally: the king's nephew Jackrun, a fiery dragonrider with dragon, fairy, and human blood. Together, they must navigate through a sea of untold secrets, unveil a dark plot spawned long ago in Dragonswood, and find a way to accept all the elements--Euit, English, dragon, and fairy--that make them who they are.</description>

  <description>Fans of Mary Poppins will love this whimsical tale of a boarding school for children of very busy parents, where an extraordinary headmistress teaches them life lessons about courage, adventure, friendship . . . and the importance of birthday cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nestled inside a lighthouse, Great Rapscott School for the Daughters of Busy Parents takes its motto from Amelia Earhart: Adventure is worthwhile in itself. Headmistress Ms. Rapscott couldn’t agree more, but her students, who are shipped to the school in boxes, could use a little convincing. Still, despite their initial reluctance, the students are soon soaring through the sky and getting lost on purpose. In addition to learning what birthday cakes are and how best to approach a bumbershoot tree, the students also manage to learn a little something about strength and bravery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling author Elise Primavera has created an irresistible, richly illustrated story about finding your way.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Of course I didn’t like Digby when I first met him. No one does.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time Philip Digby shows up on Zoe Webster’s doorstep, he’s rude and he treats her like a book he’s already read and knows the ending to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before she knows it, Zoe’s allowed Digby—annoying, brilliant, and somehow…attractive? Digby—to drag her into a series of hilarious, dangerous, and only vaguely legal schemes all related to the kidnapping of a local teenage girl. A kidnapping that might be connected to the tragic disappearance of his little sister eight years ago. When it comes to Digby, Zoe just can’t say no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is Digby a hero? Or is his manic quest an indication of a desperate attempt to repair his broken family and exorcize his own obsessive-compulsive tendencies? And does she really care anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a contemporary debut with razor-sharp dialogue, ridiculously funny action, and a dynamic duo you won’t soon forget.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One Life to One Dawn.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a land ruled by a murderous boy-king, each dawn brings heartache to a new family. Khalid, the eighteen-year-old Caliph of Khorasan, is a monster. Each night he takes a new bride only to have a silk cord wrapped around her throat come morning. When sixteen-year-old Shahrzad's dearest friend falls victim to Khalid, Shahrzad vows vengeance and volunteers to be his next bride. Shahrzad is determined not only to stay alive, but to end the caliph's reign of terror once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night after night, Shahrzad beguiles Khalid, weaving stories that enchant, ensuring her survival, though she knows each dawn could be her last. But something she never expected begins to happen: Khalid is nothing like what she'd imagined him to be. This monster is a boy with a tormented heart. Incredibly, Shahrzad finds herself falling in love. How is this possible? It's an unforgivable betrayal. Still, Shahrzad has come to understand all is not as it seems in this palace of marble and stone. She resolves to uncover whatever secrets lurk and, despite her love, be ready to take Khalid's life as retribution for the many lives he's stolen. Can their love survive this world of stories and secrets?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A hard-hitting and hopeful story about the dangers of blind faith—and the power of having faith in yourself&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Kevinian cult has taken everything from seventeen-year-old Minnow: twelve years of her life, her family, her ability to trust. And when she rebelled, they took away her hands, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now their Prophet has been murdered and their camp set aflame, and it's clear that Minnow knows something—but she's not talking. As she languishes in juvenile detention, she struggles to un-learn everything she has been taught to believe, adjusting to a life behind bars and recounting the events that led up to her incarceration. But when an FBI detective approaches her about making a deal, Minnow sees she can have the freedom she always dreamed of—if she’s willing to part with the terrible secrets of her past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeously written, breathlessly page-turning and sprinkled with moments of unexpected humor, this harrowing debut is perfect for readers of Emily Murdoch's &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;If You Find Me&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and Nova Ren Suma's &lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;The Walls Around Us&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, as well as for fans of &lt;b&gt;Orange is the New Black&lt;/b&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Morgan Rhodes takes readers into exhilarating new high-fantasy territory with A BOOK OF SPIRITS AND THIEVES. Written in alternating perspectives that shift between modern-day Toronto and the ancient kingdoms of Mytica, Rhodes masterfully weaves the dark, magical world of her Falling Kingdoms series into an epic contemporary saga that will leave you breathless.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Modern-day Toronto:&lt;/b&gt; A heavy leather-bound book written in an unrecognizable language is delivered to the Speckled Muse, the antique bookshop owned by Crystal and Becca Hatcher’s mother. When Becca opens it, she’s sent into a coma, leaving Crys behind to uncover a series of terrifying secrets.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ancient Mytica:&lt;/b&gt; A merciless goddess hunts for the elusive treasure that will make her ruler not only of Mytica, but of all the unseen worlds that lay beyond it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Modern-day Toronto:&lt;/b&gt; Rich and aimless Farrell Grayson finally has the chance to prove himself when the mysterious leader of a powerful secret society invites him into his fold.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ancient Mytica:&lt;/b&gt; Maddox Corso has always been different, but never remarkable. Everything changes the day he meets a pretty, unfamiliar girl from a faraway land, only to realize that he’s the only one who can see her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fate has brought these young people together, but ancient magic threatens to rip them apart.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The eagerly-awaited sequel to the best-selling &lt;i&gt;The Glass Sentence&lt;/i&gt; -- a historical, fantastical adventure perfect for fans of Philip Pullman!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the summer of 1892, one year since Sophia Tims and her friend Theo embarked upon the dangerous adventure that rewrote the map of the world. Since their return home to Boston, she has continued searching for clues to her parents’ disappearance, combing archives and libraries, grasping at even the most slender leads. Theo has apprenticed himself to an explorer in order to follow those leads across the country—but one after another proves to be a dead end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Sophia discovers that a crucial piece of the puzzle exists in a foreign Age. At the same time, Theo discovers that his old life outside the law threatens to destroy the new one he has built with Sophia and her uncle Shadrack. What he and Sophia do not know is that their separate discoveries are intertwined, and that one remarkable person is part of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a city that holds all of the answers—but it cannot be found on any map. Surrounded by plague, it can only be reached by a journey through darkness and chaos, which is at the same time the plague’s cure: The Golden Specific.</description>

  <description>Do you believe in magic? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Micah Tuttle does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though his awful Great-Aunt Gertrudis doesn’t approve, Micah believes in the stories his dying Grandpa Ephraim tells him of the magical Circus Mirandus: the invisible tiger guarding the gates, the beautiful flying birdwoman, and the magician more powerful than any other—the Man Who Bends Light. Finally, Grandpa Ephraim offers proof. The Circus is real. And the Lightbender owes Ephraim a miracle. With his friend Jenny Mendoza in tow, Micah sets out to find the Circus and the man he believes will save his grandfather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is, the Lightbender doesn't want to keep his promise. And now it's up to Micah to get the miracle he came for.</description>

He needs to find his friend Gabriel and rescue Annalise, now a prisoner of the powerful Black witch Mercury. Most of all he needs to learn how to control his Gift – a strange, wild new power that threatens to overwhelm him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Soul O'Brien has seized control of the Council of White Witches and is expanding his war against Black witches into Europe. In response, an unprecedented alliance has formed between Black and White witches determined to resist him.

But can all the rebels be trusted, or is Nathan walking into a trap?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;If you could trade your biggest burden for someone else’s, would you do it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Five teenagers sit around a bonfire in the middle of the New Mexico desert. They don’t know it yet, but they are about to make the biggest sacrifice of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lo &lt;/b&gt;has a family history of MS, and is starting to come down with all the symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thomas&lt;/b&gt;, a former child soldier from Liberia, is plagued by traumatic memories of his war-torn past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kaya &lt;/b&gt;would do anything to feel physical pain, but a rare condition called CIP keeps her numb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ellen&lt;/b&gt; can’t remember who she was before she started doing drugs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kit &lt;/b&gt;lost his girlfriend in a car accident and now he just can’t shake his newfound fear of death.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; When they trade totems as a symbol of shedding and adopting one another’s sorrows, they think it’s only an exercise.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But in the morning, they wake to find their burdens gone…and replaced with someone else’s.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; As the reality of the ritual unfolds, this unlikely group of five embarks on a week of beautiful, terrifying experiences that all culminate in one perfect truth: In the end, your soul is stronger than your burdens.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

[Smith’s novels] are the freshest, richest, and weirdest books to hit the YA world in years.” —&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skillfully blending multiple story strands that transcend time and place, award-winning  &lt;i&gt;Grasshopper Jungle &lt;/i&gt; author Andrew Smith chronicles the story of Ariel, a refugee who is the sole survivor of an attack on his small village. Now living with an adoptive family in Sunday, West Virginia, Ariel's story is juxtaposed against those of a schizophrenic bomber and the diaries of a failed arctic expedition from the late nineteenth century . . . and a depressed, bionic reincarnated crow.</description>

  <description>Everyone needs a little attention from time to time. Just ask our gorilla who will stop at nothing to be noticed by the boy with his eyes glued to the TV set. But for the gorilla, it’s going to take more than a quiet nudge to steal away the boy’s attention. When his usual antics fail to catch the boy’s eye—LOOK OUT! The gorilla has some other tricks up his sleeve.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt; Best Illustrated Children's Book of 2015&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the early 1900s, Robert Miller, a.k.a. “Count Victor Lustig,” moved to Paris hoping to be an artist. A &lt;i&gt;con&lt;/i&gt; artist, that is. He used his ingenious scams on unsuspecting marks all over the world, from the Czech Republic, to Atlantic ocean liners, and across America. Tricky Vic pulled off his most daring con in 1925, when he managed to "sell" the Eiffel Tower to one of the city’s most successful scrap metal dealers! Six weeks later, he tried to sell the Eiffel Tower all over again. Vic was never caught. For that particular scam, anyway. . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kids will love to read about Vic's thrilling life, and teachers will love the informational sidebars and back matter. Award-winner Greg Pizzoli’s humorous and vibrant graphic style of illustration mark a bold approach to picture book biography.</description>

  <description>Sophie knows lots of words, but she doesn’t always use them.  It’s more fun to speak in hyena talk or space language.  “Use your words, Sophie!” urge her parents, but Sophie just won’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when her new baby sister arrives, Sophie is the only one who can find out what she really wants.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Use Your Words, Sophie &lt;/i&gt;is the third book about the irrepressible two-year old who is wonderful, terrible, and always lovable.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Fans of Jon Klassen and Oliver Jeffers will love this mischievously funny read-aloud from award-winning author/illustrator Jon Agee&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mysterious noises keep waking up the Wimbledon family. "That's very odd," says Mr. Wimbledon each time, but when he returns from checking on the sounds, he's always reassuring: "It's only Stanley; he's fixing the oil tank." "It's only Stanley; he's clearing the bathtub drain."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Stanley the dog is actually doing while his oblivious family goes back to bed is deliciously absurd: he's turning the house into a rocket ship to zoom himself and his family to another planet for an alien encounter. This is a perfect rhyming read-aloud for fans of irreverent tales like &lt;i&gt;Click Clack Moo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;I Want My Hat Back&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Edmund is a ball of yarn and a ball of energy! From the time he could roll, he’s been bouncing down his front steps to explore, and his parents have always been right there to reel him in and roll him back up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now that he’s bigger, Edmund is ready to discover the wonders of the world. Everything is new and exciting—but sometimes, even a little ball of yarn gets lonely, and there’s nothing better than the comfort of being around those he cares about.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling memoir of the heroic young inventor who brought electricity to his Malawian village is now perfect for young readers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When a terrible drought struck William Kamkwamba's tiny village in Malawi, his family lost all of the season's crops, leaving them with nothing to eat and nothing to sell. William began to explore science books in his village library, looking for a solution. There, he came up with the idea that would change his family's life forever: he could build a windmill. Made out of scrap metal and old bicycle parts, William's windmill brought electricity to his home and helped his family pump the water they needed to farm the land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Retold for a younger audience, this exciting memoir shows how, even in a desperate situation, one boy's brilliant idea can light up the world. Complete with photographs, illustrations, and an epilogue that will bring readers up to date on William's story, this is the perfect edition to read and share with the whole family.</description>

  <description>William Kamkwamba was born in Malawi, a country where magic ruled and modern science was mystery. It was also a land withered by drought and hunger, and a place where hope and opportunity were hard to find. But William had read about windmills in a book called Using Energy, and he dreamed of building one that would bring electricity and water to his village and change his life and the lives of those around him. His neighbors may have mocked him and called him misala—crazy—but William was determined to show them what a little grit and ingenuity could do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enchanted by the workings of electricity as a boy, William had a goal to study science in Malawi's top boarding schools. But in 2002, his country was stricken with a famine that left his family's farm devastated and his parents destitute. Unable to pay the eighty-dollar-a-year tuition for his education, William was forced to drop out and help his family forage for food as thousands across the country starved and died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet William refused to let go of his dreams. With nothing more than a fistful of cornmeal in his stomach, a small pile of once-forgotten science textbooks, and an armory of curiosity and determination, he embarked on a daring plan to bring his family a set of luxuries that only two percent of Malawians could afford and what the West considers a necessity—electricity and running water. Using scrap metal, tractor parts, and bicycle halves, William forged a crude yet operable windmill, an unlikely contraption and small miracle that eventually powered four lights, complete with homemade switches and a circuit breaker made from nails and wire. A second machine turned a water pump that could battle the drought and famine that loomed with every season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, news of William's &lt;em&gt;magetsi a mphepo&lt;/em&gt;—his "electric wind"—spread beyond the borders of his home, and the boy who was once called crazy became an inspiration to those around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the remarkable story about human inventiveness and its power to overcome crippling adversity. &lt;em&gt;The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind&lt;/em&gt; will inspire anyone who doubts the power of one individual's ability to change his community and better the lives of those around him.</description>

  <description>An owl with an unusual passion learns to shine in this fresh, funny debut picture book introducing a poetry-loving owl whom kids will cheer for.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Otto loves poetry—Keats, Rossetti, Dickinson, even T. S. Eliot. He prefers reading to roosting and reciting to hunting. Ordinarily, this wouldn’t be a problem. But, you see, Otto is an owl. When the other owls begin to make fun of Otto, he embarks on a difficult journey, finding along the way both his inner poet and a community that accepts him for who he is. Celebrating courage and the importance of sticking with your passion, and incorporating an engaging mix of original and famous poems, Vern Kousky has created an enchanting and inviting world—a forest filled with the sounds of poetry.</description>

  <description>Nobunny does an Easter egg hunt quite like Betty Bunny! For fans of &lt;i&gt;Ladybug Girl&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fancy Nancy&lt;/i&gt;, check out the loveable handful from the creator of Disney’s T.V. series &lt;i&gt;Dog with a Blog.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Betty Bunny &lt;i&gt;loves&lt;/i&gt; Easter. She loves it so much that she just knows when she grows up, she will be the Easter Bunny. So it comes as quite a shock when she learns that her brothers and sister have been helping her in the egg hunt every year. Determined to find eggs on her own, this time, Betty Bunny also finds out a thing or two about the satisfaction of accomplishment.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Going it alone, Betty Bunny strikes again in the latest in her series, a funny Easter tale of independence.</description>

  <description>Ty Perry’s second-grade life is crazier than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s trying hard not to worry too much, but that’s not easy when his brain is filled with so many thoughts, like finally finding a pet for Baby Maggie, his sometimes-crazy classmates, and the dreaded neck-pinch-of-death. And then there’s his upcoming recitation about doing an act of kindness in front of the whole class!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ty remains his wacky, curious self in this bighearted second installment of the Life of Ty series. Practicing kindness, random or not, doesn’t take that much worrying after all. Being kind is part of being Ty.</description>

  <description>A real-life astronaut is coming to Edith B. Sugarman Elementary School, and one lucky kid gets to interview him! Not only that, a trip to a space adventurer program is also up for grabs. To win the contest, students must complete a physical fitness challenge and come up with three interesting questions to ask the astronaut. As always, George intends to beat his rival, Louie. But when the competition heats up, George is too distracted to notice how much the prize means to his best friend, Alex. For George, winning may not be everything this time around. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;WHAT IF YOU BUILT A CONTINENT OF YOUR OWN? AND WHAT IF IT WAS ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH AUSTRALIA?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rick and Evie Lane have finally converted the Great Pacific Garbage Patch into an eighth continent. But their dream of a new homeland for their family turns out to be short-lived. Because when robots from the villainous Condo Corp crash into their continent, a fatal oversight in the building process is revealed: the land mass was never anchored to the ocean floor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the eighth continent is sent barreling toward the coast of Australia, thrusting Rick and Evie’s dreams, 23 million people, and countless plants and animals into jeopardy.  If Rick and Evie are ever to get their family back together and have a continent to run—and not run after—they must find a way to root their beloved paradise to the Earth’s crust. Or else everything that they built will go pow like Pangaea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUILD IT - RUN IT - RULE IT&lt;br /&gt;at 8thContinentBooks.com</description>

  <description>“Everybody is smart in different ways. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its life believing it is stupid.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ally has been smart enough to fool a lot of smart people. Every time she lands in a new school, she is able to hide her inability to read by creating clever yet disruptive distractions. She is afraid to ask for help; after all, how can you cure dumb? However, her newest teacher Mr. Daniels sees the bright, creative kid underneath the trouble maker. With his help, Ally learns not to be so hard on herself and that dyslexia is nothing to be ashamed of. As her confidence grows, Ally feels free to be herself and the world starts opening up with possibilities. She discovers that there’s a lot more to her—and to everyone—than a label, and that great minds don’t always think alike.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winner of the Mildred L. Batchelder medal for most oustanding children's book in translation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Escaping Nazi Germany on the kindertransport changes one girl's life forever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the start of World War II, ten-year-old Franziska Mangold is torn from her family when she boards the kindertransport in Berlin, the train that secretly took nearly 10,000 children out of Nazi territory to safety in England. Taken in by strangers who soon become more like family than her real parents, Frances (as she is now known) courageously pieces together a new life for herself because she doesn't know when or if she'll see her true family again. Against the backdrop of war-torn London, Frances struggles with questions of identity, family, and love, and these experiences shape her into a dauntless, charming young woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally published in Germany, Anne Voorhoeve's award-winning novel is filled with humor, danger, and romance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Life As We Knew It&lt;/i&gt; and Michael Grant's &lt;i&gt;Gone&lt;/i&gt;--the conclusion to the thrilling No Safety in Numbers trilogy &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; First--a bomb released a deadly flu virus and the entire mall was quarantined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Next--the medical teams evacuated and the windows were boarded up just before the virus mutated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now--the power is out and the mall is thrown into darkness. Shay, Marco, Lexi, Ryan, and Ginger aren't the same people they were two weeks ago. Just like the virus, they've had to change in order to survive. And not all for the better. When no one can see your face, you can be anyone you want to be, and, when the doors finally open, they may not like what they've become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you think it's silly to be afraid of the dark, you're wrong.&lt;br /&gt; Very wrong.</description>

  <description>In the past year Zel lost her father, the boy she loves, her safety, and any future she might have imagined for herself. Now she, her sister, and the band of genetic outcasts they've come to call their family are forced on the run when their safe house is attacked by men with neural guns. But on the way to a rumored haven in Chicago, Zel hears something--a whisper from Cy, the boy who traded himself for her sister's safety. And when she veers off plan in order to search for him, what she finds is not what she expected. There's more to their genetic mutations than they ever imagined...aspects that make them wonder if they might be accepted by the outside world after all.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Deep in the Kalahari Desert, a Corpus lab protects a dangerous secret…&lt;br /&gt;But what happens when that secret takes on a life of its own? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an educational safari goes wrong, five teens find themselves stranded in the Kalahari Desert without a guide. It’s up to Sarah, the daughter of zoologists, to keep them alive and lead them to safety, calling on survival know-how from years of growing up in remote and exotic locales. Battling dehydration, starvation and the pangs of first love, she does her best to hold it together, even as their circumstances grow increasingly desperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But soon a terrifying encounter makes Sarah question everything she’s ever known about the natural world. A silver lion, as though made of mercury, makes a vicious, unprovoked attack on the group. After a narrow escape, they uncover the chilling truth behind the lion’s silver sheen: a highly contagious and deadly virus that threatens to ravage the entire area—and eliminate life as they know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this breathtaking new novel by the acclaimed author of Origin and Vitro, Sarah and the others must not only outrun the virus, but its creators, who will stop at nothing to wipe every trace of it.</description>
