  <description>Continuing the post-television &lt;i&gt;Deep Space Nine&lt;/i&gt; saga comes this thrilling original novel from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author David R. George III!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than two years have passed since the destruction of the original Deep Space 9. In that time, a brand-new, state-of-the-art starbase has replaced it, commanded by Captain Ro Laren, still the crew and residents of the former station continue to experience the repercussions of its loss. For instance: Quark continues his search for Morn, as the Lurian—his best customer and friend—left Bajor without a word and never returned. Quark enlists a private detective to track Morn down, and she claims to be hot on his trail. Yet the barkeep distrusts the woman he hired, and his suspicions skyrocket when she too suddenly vanishes. At the same time, Kira Nerys emerges from a wormhole after being caught inside it when it collapsed two years earlier. She arrives on the new DS9 to discover Altek Dans already there. While inside the Celestial Temple, Kira lived a different life in Bajor’s past, where she fell in love with Altek. So why have the Prophets moved him forward in time…and why have They brought him and Kira together?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ™, ®, &amp;amp; © 2016 CBS Studios, Inc.

      <![CDATA[This novel deals with three bits of the Trek universe that I am not especially interested in: Bajoran religion, Vic Fontaine, and a relationship between Quark and Ro Laren. Though there were moments that challenged by ability to suspend disbelief, I enjoy George’s writing and by the end, the plot...]]>

  <description>A thrilling original novel set in the universe of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation / Deep Space Nine&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2367, Captain Benjamin Maxwell of the starship &lt;i&gt;Phoenix&lt;/i&gt; ordered the destruction of a Cardassian warship and a supply vessel, killing more than six hundred crew members. Maxwell believed that the Cardassians were arming for a new attack on the Federation, and though history eventually proved he was probably correct, the Federation had no choice but to court martial and incarcerate him.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Almost twenty years have passed, and now Maxwell is a free man, working as a maintenance engineer on the private science station &lt;i&gt;Robert Hooke&lt;/i&gt;, home to crackpots, fringe researchers, and, possibly, something much darker and deadlier. Maxwell’s former crewmate, Chief Miles O’Brien, and O’Brien’s colleague, Lieutenant Commander Nog, have come for a visit. Unfortunately, history has proven that whenever O’Brien and Nog leave &lt;i&gt;Deep Space 9&lt;/i&gt; together, unpredictable forces are set into motion…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;™, ®, &amp;amp; © 2016 CBS Studios, Inc.

      <![CDATA[This is a great little adventure for Nog and O’Brien. It also does a great job of fleshing out the life of a memorable TNG guest star. I really like that it is a self-contained story in the fashion of the 80s and 90s Trek novels. ]]>

  <description>Jim Henson's iconic puppet characters, fantastic worlds, and warm humor have delighted millions of people of all ages. His incredibly diverse body of work, from the Muppets to the world of &lt;em&gt;The Dark Crystal&lt;/em&gt;, reveals his charm and genius to fans old and new. Compiled directly from The Jim Henson Company archives, &lt;em&gt;Imagination Illustrated&lt;/em&gt; adapts the diary that Jim faithfully kept throughout his career, supplementing it with a trove of little-seen visual material, including rare sketches, personal and production photographs, storyboards, doodles, and much more. Throughout, archivist Karen Falk delves into the behind-the-scenes details of Henson's life and artistic process. Sure to delight anyone who has enjoyed Henson's creations—seeing early drawings of Kermit and Rowlf is like smiling over childhood photos of dear friends—this lovely book celebrates Jim's life and his magic.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;alternate cover for this ISBN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386282.Good_Omens" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter - the world's only &lt;i&gt;totally reliable&lt;/i&gt; guide to the future - the world will end on a Saturday. Next Saturday, in fact. Just after tea...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have been predicting the end of the world almost from its very beginning, so it’s only natural to be sceptical when a new date is set for Judgement Day. This time though, the armies of Good and Evil really do appear to be massing. The four Bikers of the Apocalypse are hitting the road. But both the angels and demons – well, &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; fast-living demon and a somewhat fussy angel – would quite like the Rapture not to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And someone seems to have misplaced the Antichrist…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover illustration by Douglas Smith&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The final chapter of Jim Henson's The Creation Myths Trilogy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRIAN FROUD, legendary conceptual designer of the beloved Jim Henson fantasy film THE DARK CRYSTAL, returns to the world he helped create in this stunning conclusion of the official prequel to original movie. The world of Thra is shattered. Following the events of The Great Conjunction, the once-powerful Urskeks have been split into two separate beings: the Skeksis and the Mystics. Only Raunip and Aughra know their true origins, but they are trapped in the bowels of the world of Thra, searching for the shard of the Dark Crystal. But as the aftermath of the Great Conjunction wreaks havoc upon the Gelfling tribes, the Geflings may have no choice but to rely upon the one race offering aid: the Skeksis. The species of Thra will have to decide who they can trust if they hope to keep their world together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Written by Matthew Dow Smith (Doctor Who, X-Files) and gorgeously illustrated by Alex Sheikman (Robotika) and Lizzy John (Fraggle Rock), this third volume is the epic conclusion to the Creation Myths saga. This volume features behind the scenes photos and concept sketches from the Jim Henson Company Archives documenting how creature and puppet designs that never made it into the film were adapted and brought to life on the page.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cecilia Robin--Cece to her friends--is a simple fourth-grade schoolteacher who has fallen in with a splinter group of the Resistance. Never in her life would she have expected to be chosen to assassinate Zo'or, head of the Taelon synod. And never in her life would she actually do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her refusal leads her away from the Resistance and to the protection of Augur, whom she puts in a terrible position. Now he--the ultimate loner, the guy whose credo is "I'm out for nobody but myself"--has to risk his cover, his life, and worst of all, possibly, the loss of some income, to save his favorite teacher from both the Taelons and the Resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Augur save Cece without crippling the Resistance and destroying humanity's hope for the future? Maybe, and maybe not. But for sure, he's really going to mess up his social life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>“They’re creepy and they’re kooky,” is how the catchy theme song of &lt;i&gt;The Addams Family &lt;/i&gt;described everyone’s favorite nonconformists–Morticia, Gomez, Lurch, Uncle Fester, Grandmama, Wednesday, and Pugsley. But for all the novelty of the sitcom based on Charles Addams’s groundbreaking &lt;i&gt;New Yorker &lt;/i&gt;cartoons, Hollywood’s Addams family paled beside the cartoonist’s. “Not half as evil as my original characters,” sighed Addams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the haunted-household cartoons developed a following among &lt;i&gt;New Yorker &lt;/i&gt;readers long before the 1960s sitcom, and the Addams and their seedy Victorian mansion soon became recognizable types, the artist with the well-known signature “Chas Addams” remained an enigma. Called “the Bela Lugosi of the cartoonists,” Addams was the cartoonist everyone–even Hitchcock–wanted to meet. He was bedeviled by rumors. People claimed that he slept in a coffin, collected severed fingers sent by fans, and suffered bouts of madness that sent him to the insane asylum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The true Addams was even more fabulous than the wildest stories and cartoons. Here was a sunny, funny urbane man, “a normal American boy,” as he called himself, with a dog who hated children and a taste for crossbows. While producing a unique body of work featuring lovingly drawn homicidal spouses, demonic children, genteel monsters, and an everyday world crosshatched with magic, Addams raced classic sports cars, juggled beautiful women (Joan Fontaine, Jackie Kennedy, and Greta Garbo, to name a few), and charmed everyone. But though his pursuits suggest lighthearted romantic comedy, Addams’s life had its sinister side. Far darker than anything Addams created with a brush was his relationship with a dangerous woman who forever changed his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this first biography of the great cartoonist, written with exclusive access to Addams’s intimates and his private papers, we finally meet the man behind the famed cartoons and circling rumors. Here is his surprising childhood in New Jersey, the cartoon that offended the Nazis, the friend whose early death Addams long mourned. Here are his wives, the stories behind his most famous–and some of his most private–cartoons, and the Addams whom even his closest friends didn’t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With wit, humor, poignancy, and insight–enhanced by rare family photographs, classic and previously unpublished cartoons, and private drawings–Linda H. Davis paints an engaging and endearing portrait of a marvelous American original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of America’s most gifted biographers, Linda Davis has given us an engrossing, unforgettable portrait of the legendary &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; cartoonist. In Davis’s empathetic narrative and in accompanying cartoons, photographs, and drawings, the great artist lives again in all his eccentric brilliance,&lt;br /&gt;ghoulish sense of humor, fecund love life, and warm and gentle humanity. Beautifully written and exhaustively researched, &lt;i&gt;Chas Addams: A Cartoonist’s&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Life&lt;/i&gt; deserves to win every literary prize there is for best biography.--Stephen B. Oates, Paul Murray Kendall Professor of Biography and Professor History Emeritus, The University of Massachusetts at Amherst&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“If you don’t appreciate martinis with eyeballs in them, this is not the book for you. For the rest of us here is an irresistible riot of a read, an exhilarating expertly mixed cocktail of words and images. Charles Addams’s life was crowded with women–famous women, smart women, witty women, garden-variety drop-dead beautiful women–but in Linda Davis he has truly met his match.” --Stacy Schiff, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for &lt;i&gt;Vera&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;“Seldom have we found as satisfying a fit of subject and author as this. Linda Davis has distilled years of research, travel and interviews into a rollicking and fascinating review of Addams’s astonishing life as artist, playboy and–from time to time–husband. We can all be grateful that Addams and Davis finally found one another.”--Harrison Kinney,&lt;br /&gt;author of &lt;i&gt;James Thurber: His Life and Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The second original companion novel to &lt;i&gt;Jim Henson's The Dark Crystal&lt;/i&gt; follows Naia and Kylan as they seek help from the Gelfling clans to prevent the Skeksis from implementing the next stage of their sinister plan.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kylan of Sami Thicket is a skilled song teller, but singing the tales of long-gone heroes won't help his friends as they journey into dangerous, unknown lands. After uncovering the betrayal of the Skeksis Lords, he and his friend Naia are on the run, pursued by the Skeksis's underlings and outcast even among their fellow Gelfling. But Kylan knows the truth must be told, no matter how difficult the telling. Maybe there's use for a song teller after all . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jim Henson's The Dark Crystal &lt;/i&gt;is one of the most beloved and enduring fantasy stories of the past thirty years. This series of young adult novels will both please the diehard fans and bring new fans in to the world of &lt;i&gt;The Dark Crystal&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Continuing the milestone 50th anniversary celebration of Star Trek—an epic new trilogy that stretches from the events of The Original Series movie &lt;i&gt;The Search for Spock&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;The Next Generation&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Klingon Empire stands on the precipice. In the wake of violence from the cult known as the Unsung, paranoia threatens to break Chancellor Martok’s regime. Klingons increasingly call for a stronger hand to take control...one that Lord Korgh, master manipulator, is only too willing to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But other forces are now in motion. Assisted by a wily agent, the Empire’s enemies secretly conspire to take full advantage of the situation. Aboard the USS&lt;i&gt; Titan&lt;/i&gt;, Admiral William T. Riker realizes far more than the Federation’s alliance with the Klingons is in danger. With the Empire a wounded animal, it could either become an attacker—or a target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Yet even as hostilities increase, Commander Worf returns to the USS&lt;i&gt; Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; and Captain Jean-Luc Picard with a daring plan of his own. The preservation of both the Empire and the Federation alliance may hinge on an improbable savior leading a most unlikely force....</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;William Boone. When the Taelons came to Earth, he was tapped to be the human who would work most closely with Da'an, the mysteriously powerful and enigmatic leader who speaks for the alien Companions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boone became many things: confidant, bodyguard, interpreter...and undercover agent for the human Resistance. But little has been told of Boone's past, of the events that prepared him for this perilous assignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it is revealed: from his duty overseas during the S/I War to his life in the United States, from the arrival of aliens on Earth to his first encounter with the mysterious Augur, here for the first time is the story behind mankind's first double agent in the underground war between human and alien--and the Resistance's first martyr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Continuing the milestone 50th anniversary celebration of Star Trek—an epic new trilogy that stretches from the events of The Original Series movie &lt;i&gt;The Search for Spock&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;The Next Generation&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Klingon-Federation alliance is in peril as never before. Lord Korgh has seized control of the House of Kruge, executing a plot one hundred years in the making. The Klingon cult known as the Unsung rampages across the stars, striking from the shadows in their cloaked Birds-of-Prey. And the mysterious figure known as Buxtus Cross launches a scheme that will transform the Klingon Empire forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Into danger flies Admiral William T. Riker and the USS&lt;i&gt; Titan&lt;/i&gt;, charged with protecting the peace forged nearly a century before during the Khitomer Accords. Aided by Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the USS&lt;i&gt; Enterprise&lt;/i&gt;, Riker and his officers scour the stars, seeking to find the Unsung and uncover the truth behind the conspiracy before time runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Yet even as Commander Worf departs on a deeply personal mission of honor, hidden sinister forces seek to turn the crisis to their advantage. And the conspirators’ plans threaten to spiral out of control, jeopardizing the very empire they aspire to rule.</description>

      <![CDATA[I often find the second book in a trilogy to be fairly dull. They tend to do a lot of setup and forget to tell a worthwhile story of their own. That’s not the case with this novel. It’s very action-driven but it has a story. There’s some good character moments for Worf, and more exploration of Kl...]]>

  <description>Continuing the milestone 50th anniversary celebration of Star Trek—an epic new trilogy that stretches from the events of The Original Series movie &lt;i&gt;The Search for Spock&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;The Next Generation&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Klingon commander Kruge died in combat against James T. Kirk on the Genesis planet back in 2285, he left behind a powerful house in disarray—and a series of ticking time bombs: the Phantom Wing, a secret squadron of advanced Birds-of-Prey; a cabal of loyal officers intent on securing his heritage; and young Korgh, his thwarted would-be heir, willing to wait a Klingon lifetime to enact his vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now, one hundred years later, while on a diplomatic mission for the United Federation of Planets, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the USS &lt;i&gt;Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; are snared in the aged Korgh’s trap—and thrust directly in the middle of an ancient conflict. But as Commander Worf soon learns, Korgh may be after far bigger game than anyone imagines, confronting the Federation-Klingon alliance with a crisis unlike any it has ever seen!</description>

      <![CDATA[This is an excellent celebration of Star Trek’s 50th anniversary. Miller does a great job of crafting a story that includes roles for Spock and Kirk, as well as for Picard and Worf. Fans of Klingon culture will be impressed and entertained. I look forward to reading book two.]]>

  <description>This spooky addition to Alvin Schwartz's popular books on American folklore is filled with tales of eerie horror and dark revenge that will make you jump with fright. There is a story here for everyone -- skeletons with torn and tangled flesh who roam the earth; a ghost who takes revenge on her murderer; and a haunted house where every night a bloody head falls down the chimney. Stephen Gammell's splendidly creepy drawings perfectly capture the mood of more than two dozen scary stories -- and even scary songs -- all just right for reading alone or for telling aloud in the dark.If You Dare!</description>

      <![CDATA[I’m rating the 2010 edition. I recommend the original edition with Stephen Gammell’s artwork. That one deserves five stars.<br /><br />This is an excellent introduction for young people to horror.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An all-new novel based upon the explosive &lt;i&gt;Star Trek &lt;/i&gt;TV series!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A shattered ship, a divided crew—trapped in the infernal nightmare of conflict!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hearing of the outbreak of hostilities between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire, Captain Christopher Pike attempts to bring the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; home to join in the fight. But in the hellish nebula known as the Pergamum, the stalwart commander instead finds an epic battle of his own, pitting ancient enemies against one another—with not just the &lt;i&gt;Enterprise,&lt;/i&gt; but her crew as the spoils of war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lost and out of contact with Earth for an entire year, Pike and his trusted first officer, Number One, struggle to find and reunite the ship’s crew—all while Science Officer Spock confronts a mystery that puts even his exceptional skills to the test…with more than their own survival possibly riding on the outcome….</description>

Together with the alien, they set out on an incredible journey, around the planet and to a destiny greater than the humans can possibly imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Ma'el has come to judge Earth, and their travels will have consequences far into the future--consequences that will change both humanity and the Taelon race forever . . .&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The USS Enterprise under the command of Captain James T. Kirk is en route to the extreme edge of the Alpha Quadrant, and to a region known as the Vara Nebula. Its mission: to investigate why science outpost Zeta Gibraltar is not answering all Federation hailing messages. When the Enterprise arrives, a scan shows no life forms in the science station. Kirk leads a landing party and quickly discovers the reason for the strange silence–signs of a violent firefight are everywhere. Zeta Gibraltar has been completely raided. Yet there are no bodies and the entire roster of station personnel is missing ...</description>

  <description>Who better to investigate the literary spirit world than that supreme connoisseur of the unexpected, Roald Dahl? Of the many permutations of the macabre, Dahl was always especially fascinated by the classic ghost story. For this superbly disquieting collection, he selected fourteen of his favorite tales by such authors as E.F. Benson, Rosemary Timperley, and Edith Wharton&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes:&lt;br /&gt;"W.S." L.P.

  <description>An original enovella set in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine universe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his Starfleet assignment temporarily on hold, Odo needs a distraction. He welcomes Chief O’Brien’s offer to loan him some of the action-packed books that both men relish: tales about hard-boiled private eyes, threatening thugs, and duplicitous dames. Then Quark suddenly goes missing during a hastily planned trip to Ferenginar. His concerned friends on Deep Space Nine feel that Odo, as the station’s former chief of security, is uniquely suited to track Quark down. But once on Ferenginar, Odo learns that Quark is trapped in the seamy underbelly of a criminal enterprise that could have been ripped from the pages of one of O’Brien’s novels. To find the bartender, Odo discovers that he must rely not only on his law enforcement background, but his knowledge of all things noir….</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Sol Majestic&lt;/i&gt; is a big-hearted intergalactic adventure for fans of Becky Chambers and &lt;i&gt;The Good Place&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kenna, an aspirational teen guru, wanders destitute across the stars as he tries to achieve his parents' ambition to advise the celestial elite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything changes when Kenna wins a free dinner at The Sol Majestic, the galaxy's most renown restaurant, giving him access to the cosmos's one-percent. His dream is jeopardized, however, when he learns his highly-publicized "free meal" risks putting The Sol Majestic into financial ruin. Kenna and a motley gang of newfound friends -- including a teleporting celebrity chef, a trust-fund adrenaline junkie, an inept apprentice, and a brilliant mistress of disguise -- must concoct an extravagant scheme to save everything they cherish. In doing so, Kenna may sacrifice his ideals -- or learn even greater lessons about wisdom, friendship, and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Utterly charming and out of this world, &lt;i&gt; The Sol Majestic &lt;/i&gt;is will satisfy the appetites of sci-fi aficionados and newcomers alike.</description>

  <description>The post-television &lt;i&gt;Deep Space Nine&lt;/i&gt; saga continues with this original novel from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author David R. George III!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the original Deep Space Nine, Captain Kira Nerys watches as the nearby wormhole opens and discharges a single, bladelike vessel. Attempts to contact its crew fail, and the ship is soon followed by another vessel of similar design. When an armada subsequently begins to emerge from the wormhole, it seems clear that DS9 is under attack. Kira orders her first officer, Commander Elias Vaughn, to board the U.S.S. &lt;i&gt;Defiant&lt;/i&gt; and defend the station, and alerts Starfleet to send additional forces as her crew prepares DS9&amp;amp;#8217;s shields and weaponry for the onslaught to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, on the lead ship, Iliana Ghemor considers launching an attack on DS9 and finally ending the life of Kira, the fountainhead of all the ills in her miserable life. Her vengeance demands more than mere death, though&amp;amp;#8212;it requires pain. Ghemor refocuses, choosing to follow her plan to mete out her revenge on the captain by first decimating the population of Bajor&amp;amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;amp;#8482;, &amp;amp;#174;, &amp;amp; &amp;amp;#169; 2015 CBS Studios, Inc.

  <description>They dared to risk it all in a skiff of reeds or leather, on a ship of wood or steel, knowing the only thing between them and certain death was their ship. To explore, to seek out what lay beyond the close and comfortable, every explorer had to embrace danger. And as they did so, what arose was a mystical bond, a passion for the ships that carried them. From the very first time humans dared to warp the fabric of space, escaping from the ashes of the third World War, they also created ships. These vessels have become the icons of mankind's desire to rise above the everyday, to seek out and make the unknown known. And these ships that travel the stellar seas have stirred the same passions as the ones that floated in the oceans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; While every captain has wished that their starship could be outfitted in the same manner as the sailing ship H.M.S. Beagle -- without weapons -- that proved untenable. From the start, Starfleet realized that each vessel, due to the limited range of the early warp engines, must be able to stand alone against any attack. Thus arose the idea, taken from the days of wooden sailing ships, that every Starfleet vessel must stand as a ship of the line. Through the actions of their captains and crews, countless starships have taken on that role. Here we remember some of those ships and their heroic crews. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In celebration of the fortieth anniversary of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt;, here for the very first time collected together are the spectacular images from the highly successful and acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt;: Ships of the Line calendars. Gloriously rendered, each of these illustrations was created exclusively for Pocket Books. With text by Michael Okuda (&lt;i&gt;The Star Trek Encyclopedia&lt;/i&gt;), the story of each of these valiant starships comes to life.</description>

  <description>An original spin-off novel set in the popular &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/i&gt; universe from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author James Swallow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of political upheaval across the United Federation of Planets, Admiral William Riker and the crew of the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Titan&lt;/i&gt; find themselves in uncertain waters as roles aboard the ship change to reflect a new mandate and a new mission. On orders from Starfleet, &lt;i&gt;Titan&lt;/i&gt; sets out toward the edge of Federation space to tackle its latest assignment: to work with an alien species known as the Dinac, who are taking their first steps into the galaxy at large as a newly warp-capable civilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when disaster befalls the Dinac, the &lt;i&gt;Titan&lt;/i&gt; crew discovers they have unknowingly drawn the attention of a deadly, merciless enemy—a nightmare from Riker’s past lurking in the darkness. Friendships will be tested to the limit as familiar faces and new allies must risk everything in a fight against an unstoppable invader—or a horrific threat will be unleashed on the galaxy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;™, ®, &amp;amp; © 2015 CBS Studios, Inc.

      <![CDATA[This is a really enjoyable “sequel” to a memorable TNG episode. My principle criticism of the post-Nemesis Trek novels is that there’s too much interpersonal strife between Starfleet crewmates. The Titan novels get away with it by having mostly non-human characters but it still stands out to me.<...]]>

The story of Doors’ father is mysterious and entertaining. I quite enjoyed it.<br /><br />I did read this once when it...]]>

  <description>Amoral, shrouded in secrecy, and answerable to no one, Section 31 is the mysterious covert operations division of Starfleet, a rogue shadow group committed to safeguarding the Federation at any cost.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Doctor Julian Bashir sacrificed his career for a chance to infiltrate Section 31 and destroy it from within. Now it's asking him to help it stop the Breen from stealing a dangerous new technology from the Mirror Universe - one that could give the Breen control over the galaxy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a mission Bashir can't refuse - but is it really the shot he's been waiting for? Or is it a trap from which even his genetically enhanced intellect can't escape?</description>

  <description>Uncharitable goes where no other book on the nonprofit sector has dared to tread. Where other texts suggest ways to optimize performance inside the existing paradigm, Uncharitable suggests that the paradigm itself is the problem and calls into question our fundamental canons about charity. Author Dan Pallotta argues that society's nonprofit ethic acts as a strict regulatory mechanism on the natural economic law. It creates an economic apartheid that denies the nonprofit sector critical tools and permissions that the for-profit sector is allowed to use without restraint (e.g., no risk-reward incentives, no profit, counterproductive limits on compensation, and moral objections to the use of donated dollars for anything other than program expenditures). &lt;br /&gt;These double-standards place the nonprofit sector at extreme disadvantage to the for profit sector on every level. While the for profit sector is permitted to use all the tools of capitalism to advance the sale of consumer goods, the nonprofit sector is prohibited from using any of them to fight hunger or disease. Capitalism is blamed for creating the inequities in our society, but charity is prohibited from using the tools of capitalism to rectify them. &lt;br /&gt;Ironically, this is all done in the name of charity, but it is a charity whose principal benefit flows to the for-profit sector and one that denies the nonprofit sector the tools and incentives that have built virtually everything of value in society. The very ethic we have cherished as the hallmark of our compassion is in fact what undermines it. &lt;br /&gt;This irrational system, Pallotta explains, has its roots in 400-year-old Puritan ethics that banished self-interest from the realm of charity. The ideology is policed today by watchdog agencies and the use of "efficiency" measures, which Pallotta argues are flawed, unjust, and should be abandoned. By declaring our independence from these obsolete ideas, Pallotta theorizes, we can dramatically accelerate progress on the most urgent social issues of our time. Pallotta has written an important, provocative, timely, and accessible book a manifesto about equal economic rights for charity. Its greatest contribution may be to awaken society to the fact that they were so unequal in the first place.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An all-new &lt;i&gt;Star Trek &lt;/i&gt;adventure set during &lt;i&gt;The Original Series&lt;/i&gt; era and featuring James T. Kirk! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The saga of James T. Kirk’s historic command of the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Enterprise &lt;/i&gt;is known throughout the galaxy. But one part of the legend has barely been touched upon until now: the story of Kirk’s first starship command and the remarkable achievements by which Starfleet’s youngest captain earned the right to succeed Christopher Pike as the commander of the famous &lt;i&gt;Enterprise&lt;/i&gt;. From his early battles with the Klingons to the rescue of endangered civilizations, Kirk grapples with difficult questions: Is he a warrior or a peacemaker? Should he obey regulations or trust his instincts? This thrilling novel illustrates the events and choices that would shape James T. Kirk into one of the most renowned captains in Starfleet history.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is really a brief survey featuring but a handful each of various types of folklore from indigenous myths, to French legends, to sailor’s stories, and even Newfie jokes. What impressed me is the amount of effort that must have gone into the research for this book. It must have been quite a ti...]]>

  <description>It is a new age of exploration, and the U.S.S. Enterprise is dispatched to the Odyssean Pass; a region charted only by unmanned probes and believed to contain numerous inhabited worlds. Approaching a star system with two such planets, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and his crew find a massive alien vessel, drifting in interstellar space for decades. Sensors detect life aboard the derelict;aliens held in suspended animation. Thought to be an immense sleeper ship, the vessel actually is a weapon capable of destroying entire worlds...the final gambit in a war that has raged for generations across the nearby system. Captain Picard is now caught in the middle of this conflict and attempts to mediate, as both sides want this doomsday weapon, which was sent from the future with the sole purpose of ending the interplanetary war before it even began.</description>

  <description>Critics have heralded Richard Wilbur's translations of Molière's seventeenth-century dramas as masterpieces. In brilliant rhymed couplets Wilbur renders into English not only the form and spirit of Molière's language but also its substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Misanthrope&lt;/i&gt;, one of Molière's most popular plays, is a searching comic study of falsity, shallowness, and self-righteousness. The misanthrope in this case is Alceste, a man whose conscience and sincerity are too rigorous for his time. In &lt;i&gt;Tartuffe&lt;/i&gt; the title character, a wily opportunist and swindler, affects sanctity and gains complete ascendancy over Orgon, a rich bourgeois who in his middle years has become a bigot and prude. Only when Orgon actually witnesses Tartuffe's attempt to seduce his wife does he come to his senses. Richard Wilbur won a share of the Bollingen Translation Prize for his much-acclaimed translation of this satiric turn on religious hypocrisy.</description>

      <![CDATA[Utterly underwhelming. I expected to really enjoy The Misanthrope but it’s like a middling sitcom. There are a handful of funny one-liners, a really simple plot, and that’s it.<br /><br />Tartuff is stronger. It’s more consistently funny and I can imagine actors having a ball with it. But it too...]]>

With this book you don’t get some of the nuanced character bits that you catch in animation but it’s still enjoyable. I look forward to giving it to my niece who’s about to turn 8.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of the &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Dream of Eagles&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; series and &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;The Guardians&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; trilogy comes a tale of revenge, dark secrets, and a mysterious cataclysm that decimated a Roman legion: the story behind the story that began it all.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fleeing the massacre of his entire family save a single uncle, young Roman aristocrat Quintus Varrus arrives in fourth-century London not knowing who is to blame for the murders nor whom he can trust now. He fears for his life, but when he meets a young Irish woman named Lydia Mcuil, their lives quickly become intertwined and her father offers to set the young Roman up as a smith (under an Irish alias) in the town of Colchester while the young lovers get to know each other from a distance.&lt;br /&gt; But the assassins haven't forgotten Quintus and a deadly ambush is barely thwarted, bringing the young Roman into friendship with his rescuer, a hardened former military policeman known as Rufus Cato, who has his own score to settle with the powerful man behind the attack. Quintus is introduced to the secrets of an ancient brotherhood that is trying to halt the rot that is destroying their beloved Empire--secrets that may finally reveal the identity of those who murdered his family, and expose the shocking reason why.&lt;br /&gt; Set against the backdrop of a world in turmoil, this prequel to &lt;i&gt;The Skystone&lt;/i&gt;, first in the &lt;i&gt;Dream of Eagles&lt;/i&gt; series, is richly textured, intricately plotted, and filled with action and adventure: a perfect addition to the works of this master storyteller.</description>

  <description>Part detective novel, part psychological thriller, &lt;i&gt;Surfacing&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a young woman who returns to northern Quebec, to the remote island of her childhood, with her lover and two friends, to investigate the mysterious disappearance of her father. Flooded with memories, she begins to realize that going home means entering not only another place, but another time. As the wild island exerts its elemental hold and she is submerged in the language of the wilderness, she discovers that what she is really searching for is her own past. Permeated with an aura of suspense, complex with layered meanings, and written in brilliant, diamond-sharp prose, &lt;i&gt;Surfacing &lt;/i&gt;has grown in reputation as a novel unique in modern literature for its mythic exploration of one woman’s spiritual pilgrimage.</description>

  <description>The latest novel in the ongoing &lt;i&gt;Next Generation/Deep Space Nine&lt;/i&gt; expanded universe crossover, from &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author David George!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days after the assassination of Federation President Nan Bacco on Deep Space 9, the unexpected appearance of a stranger on the station raises serious concerns. He seems dazed and confused, providing in a peculiar patois of the Bajoran language, unsatisfactory answers. He offers his identity as Altek, of which there is no apparent record, and he claims not to know where he is or how he got there. A quick scan confirms the visitor is armed with a projectile weapon;a firearm more antiquated than, but similar to, the one that took President Bacco's life. But the Bajoran liaison to the station believes that Altek has been sent from the Prophets, out of a nearby wormhole. The last time such an event occurred, it was to reassure Benjamin Sisko of his place as the Emissary. For what purpose has Altek now been sent out of the Celestial Temple?</description>

  <description>An original eNovella set in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine universe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the space station Deep Space 9, Quark’s Public House, Café, Gaming Emporium, Holosuite Arcade, and Ferengi Embassy can’t legitimately be called an embassy until the Grand Nagus—namely, Quark’s brother Rom—dedicates it as such. Not that Quark really cares about Ferengi protocol, but a well-publicized dedication ceremony will naturally draw people to the bar. Everybody loves a good open house—free appetizers, half-price drinks, door prizes, etc.—all of which Quark can write off as Embassy expenses. It’s a win-win situation, with him on both sides of the win. There’s even a plan to display the original scroll of the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition—which no one has seen for decades given that it’s been held in protective storage—and charge patrons by the minute to look at it up close. Nothing, of course, could possibly go wrong with this big plan. Absolutely nothing at all…</description>

  <description>An original novel set in the universe of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&lt;/i&gt; a direct sequel to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling story arc, &lt;i&gt;The Fall&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep Space 9 is once again becoming an important way station in the Alpha Quadrant for many different people with many different agendas. Uniquely crewed by representatives of different species from both the Khitomer Powers and the Typhon Pact, the Federation science and exploration vessel &lt;i&gt;Athene Donald &lt;/i&gt;stops at the station as its final port of call before heading into uncharted territories. The whole project is the brainchild of Dr. Katherine Pulaski, who hopes that science will do what diplomacy alone cannot, and help various powers put aside the tensions of recent years, returning to scientific research and the exploration of space. On DS9, base commander Ro Laren has her hands full with the sudden arrival of a ragtag flotilla of small ships crewed by a group calling themselves the People of the Open Sky. Ro is not keen on handling this first-contact duty, but becomes increasingly intrigued by the People, who are made up of several hitherto unknown species. Describing themselves as explorers, they are interested in everything about the station. Ro begins to enjoy her assignment, particularly as she takes counsel from the logs of Jean-Luc Picard. Blackmer, however, is more suspicious about these apparently friendly arrivals and monitors their movements around DS9&amp;amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;amp;#8482;, &amp;amp;#174;, &amp;amp; &amp;amp;#169; 2014 CBS Studios, Inc.

  <description>Business is down at Quark’s Public House, Café, Gaming Emporium, Holosuite Arcade, and Ferengi Embassy to Bajor. Way down. Lower level of hell down. The station is bustling, but residents and visitors are spending more time (and latinum) at the new Deep Space 9's park, sports fields, theater, swimming complex, and who knows what else, than they are at Quark’s establishment. All of Quark's misfortunes just could be reversed, however, when he finds out that one of the steamiest holonovels to hit the Alpha Quadrant in years is up for grabs. And he has an inroad to acquiring it before anyone else. Or does he?</description>

  <description>An all-new novel of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/i&gt;—one of the most popular &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt; series of all-time, featuring the adventures of Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Enterprise&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When renegade Federation starships begin wreaking destruction across the Alpha Quadrant, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; are shocked to discover that the mastermind behind this sudden threat is none other than Picard’s protégé and friend: Admiral William T. Riker. The newly minted admiral is on board the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Aventine&lt;/i&gt; as part of a special assignment, even as the mystery deepens behind his involvement in the growing crisis. But the &lt;i&gt;Aventine&lt;/i&gt; is helmed by Captain Ezri Dax—someone who is no stranger to breaking Starfleet regulations—and her starship is by far the faster vessel…and Riker cannot yield even to his former mentor. It’s a battle of tactical geniuses and a race against time as Picard struggles to find answers before the quadrant’s great powers violently retaliate against the Federation…</description>

The crux of the story relies on a trope we’ve probably seen a dozen times in Star Trek before but it’s still enjoyable. Overall, this reminds me of one of the old scho...]]>

  <description>On his deathbed, Kia's father discloses a secret to her alone: a magnificent diamond he has been hiding for years. Fearing he stole it, she too keeps it secret. She learns it comes from the distant colonized planet of Malem, where her father caught the illness that eventually killed him. Now she is even more convinced he stole it, as it is illegal for any off-worlder to possess a Malemese diamond. &lt;br /&gt;When 16-yr-old Kia is training to be a translator, she is co-opted by a series of events into travelling as a translator to Malem. Using her skill in languages and another skill she picked up after her father s death, the skill of picking locks - she unravels the secret of the mysterious gem and learns what she must do to set things right: return the diamond to its original owner. But how will she find out who that is when no one can know that she, an off-worlder, has a Malemese diamond? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Tense, thrilling, edge-of-the-seat reading--I tore through this! Kia and Agatha are a fascinating pair, Kia so practical, down-to-earth, and wilful; Agatha so mystical and driven. More, please!"&lt;br /&gt; ~ Tamora Pierce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"J. A. McLachlan is a terrific writer -- wry and witty, with a keen eye for detail. I've been following her work with interest and delight since 2003. In a world where young-adult fiction is booming, The Occasional Diamond Thief propels McLachlan to the front of the pack." ~ Robert J. Sawyer</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A conspiracy that promises bloodshed and the only woman who can stop it collide in the page-turning thriller by Christopher Rice, Amazon Charts bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Bone Music&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kidnapped and raised by serial killers, Charlotte Rowe suffered an ordeal that made her infamous. Everyone in the world knew who she was. But no one in the world has any idea what she’s become…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte is an experiment. And a weapon. Enabled by a superpower drug, she’s partnered with a shadowy pharmaceutical company to hunt down and eliminate society’s most depraved human predators. But her latest mission goes off the rails in a horrifying way. Unsettled by her own capacity for violence, Charlotte wants some time to retreat so she can work on her new relationship with Luke, a sheriff’s deputy in the isolated Central California town she now calls home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only the threats hadn’t followed Charlotte there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something sinister is evolving in Altamira, California—a massive network of domestic terrorists with ties to Charlotte’s influential and corrupt employers. As a vast and explosive criminal conspiracy grows, the fate of Charlotte’s hometown hangs in the balance. With everyone she cares about in danger, Charlotte has no choice but to bring her powers home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Rowe has been triggered, and now she’ll have to take matters into her own powerful hands.</description>

  <description>Returning to the story begun in the novel &lt;i&gt;Immortal Coil&lt;/i&gt; and continuing in the bestselling &lt;i&gt;Cold Equations&lt;/i&gt; trilogy, this is the next fascinating chapter in the artificial life of one of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek’&lt;/i&gt;s most enduring characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was perhaps the ultimate human achievement: a sentient artificial life-form—self-aware, self-determining, possessing a mind and body far surpassing that of his makers, and imbued with the potential to evolve beyond the scope of his programming. And then Data was destroyed. Four years later, Data’s creator, Noonien Soong, sacrificed his life and resurrected his android son, who in turn revived the positronic brain of his own artificial daughter, Lal. Having resigned his commission, the former Starfleet officer now works to make his way on an alien world, while also coming to grips with the very human notion of wanting versus having a child. But complicating Data’s new life is an unexpected nemesis from years ago on the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Enterprise&lt;/i&gt;—the holographic master criminal Professor James Moriarty. Long believed to be imprisoned in a memory solid, Moriarty has created a siphon into the "real" world as a being of light and thought. Moriarity wants the solid form that he was once told he could never have, and seeks to manipulate Data into finding another android body for him to permanently inhabit...even if it means evicting the current owner, and even if that is Data himself.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;™, ®, &amp;amp; © 2013 CBS Studios, Inc.

  <description>Despite being an inexperienced Starfleet cadet, Sylvia Tilly became essential to the U.S.S. Discovery finding its way back home from the Mirror Universe. But how did she find that courage? From where did she get that steel? Who nurtured that spark of brilliance? The Way to the Stars recounts for fans everywhere the untold story of Tilly’s past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not easy being sixteen, especially when everyone expects great things from Tilly. It’s even harder when her mother and father are Federation luminaries, not to mention pressing her to attend one of the best schools that the Federation has to offer. Tilly wants to achieve great things—even though she hasn’t quite worked out how to do that or what it is she wants to do. But this year, everything will change for Tilly, as she about to embark upon the adventure of a lifetime—an adventure that will take her ever closer to the stars…</description>

      <![CDATA[I had a lot of fun with this! It’s a light, breezy read that would be perfect for introducing a young person to The X-Files, but the story and characterizations are strong enough to appeal to adult fans as well. I’m looking forward to book two.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the iconic and bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Mummy&lt;/i&gt; and The Vampire Chronicles, a mesmerizing, glamorous new tale of ancient feuds and modern passions. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ramses the Great, former pharaoh of Egypt, is reawakened by the elixir of life in Edwardian England. Now immortal with his bride-to-be, he is swept up in a fierce and deadly battle of wills and psyches against the once-great Queen Cleopatra. Ramses has reawakened Cleopatra with the same perilous elixir whose unworldly force brings the dead back to life. But as these ancient rulers defy one another in their quest to understand the powers of the strange elixir, they are haunted by a mysterious presence even older and more powerful than they, a figure drawn forth from the mists of history who possesses spectacular magical potions and tonics eight millennia old. This is a figure who ruled over an ancient kingdom stretching from the once-fertile earth of the Sahara to the far corners of the world, a queen with a supreme knowledge of the deepest origins of the elixir of life. She may be the only one who can make known to Ramses and Cleopatra the key to their immortality--and the secrets of the miraculous, unknowable, endless expanse of the universe.</description>

Included here are some of del Toro's favorites, from Mary Shelley's &lt;i&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/i&gt; and Ray Russell's short story 'Sardonicus', considered by Stephen King to be 'perhaps the finest example of the modern Gothic ever written', to Shirley Jackson's &lt;i&gt;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/i&gt; and stories by Ray Bradbury, Joyce Carol Oates, Ted Klein, and Robert E. Howard. These stunningly creepy deluxe hardcovers will be perfect additions to the shelves of horror, sci-fi, fantasy, and paranormal aficionados everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Haunted Castles&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Haunted Castles &lt;/i&gt;is the definitive, complete collection of Ray Russell's masterful Gothic horror stories, including the famously terrifying novella trio of 'Sardonicus', 'Sanguinarius', and 'Sagittarius'. The characters that sprawl through &lt;i&gt;Haunted Castles&lt;/i&gt; are frightful to the core: the heartless monster holding two lovers in limbo; the beautiful dame journeying down a damned road toward depravity (with the help of an evil gypsy); the man who must wear his fatal crimes on his face in the form of an awful smile. Engrossing, grotesque, perverted, and completely entrancing, Russell's Gothic tales are the best kind of dreadful.&lt;br /&gt;RAY RUSSELL was born in 1924 in Chicago, Illinois, and served in the United States Air Force during World War II in the South Pacific. After the war, he attended the Chicago Conservatory of Music and eventually joined the editorial staff at &lt;i&gt;Playboy&lt;/i&gt;, where he published such writers as Ray Bradbury, Kurt Vonnegut, Richard Matheson, Jack Finney, Robert Bloch, and Charles Beaumont. His best-known work, 'Sardonicus', was called by Stephen King 'perhaps the finest example of the modern Gothic ever written'. He died in Los Angeles in 1999.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GUILLERMO DEL TORO is a Mexican director, producer, screenwriter, novelist, and designer, most famous for his Academy Award-winning film,&lt;i&gt;Pan's Labyrinth&lt;/i&gt;, and the &lt;i&gt;Hellboy &lt;/i&gt;film franchise. He has received the Nebula, Hugo, and Bram Stoker awards and is an avid collector and student of arcane memorabilia and weird fiction.</description>

  <description>In the Tale of The Fall of Gondolin are two of the greatest powers in the world. There is Morgoth of the uttermost evil, unseen in this story but ruling over a vast military power from his fortress of Angband. Deeply opposed to Morgoth is Ulmo, second in might only to Manwë, chief of the Valar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Central to this enmity of the gods is the city of Gondolin, beautiful but undiscoverable. It was built and peopled by Noldorin Elves who, when they dwelt in Valinor, the land of the gods, rebelled against their rule and fled to Middle-earth. Turgon King of Gondolin is hated and feared above all his enemies by Morgoth, who seeks in vain to discover the marvellously hidden city, while the gods in Valinor in heated debate largely refuse to intervene in support of Ulmo's desires and designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Into this world comes Tuor, cousin of Túrin, the instrument of Ulmo's designs. Guided unseen by him Tuor sets out from the land of his birth on the fearful journey to Gondolin, and in one of the most arresting moments in the history of Middle-earth the sea-god himself appears to him, rising out of the ocean in the midst of a storm. In Gondolin he becomes great; he is wedded to Idril, Turgon's daughter, and their son is Eärendel, whose birth and profound importance in days to come is foreseen by Ulmo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At last comes the terrible ending. Morgoth learns through an act of supreme treachery all that he needs to mount a devastating attack on the city, with Balrogs and dragons and numberless Orcs. After a minutely observed account of the fall of Gondolin, the tale ends with the escape of Tuor and Idril, with the child Eärendel, looking back from a cleft in the mountains as they flee southward, at the blazing wreckage of their city. They were journeying into a new story, the Tale of Eärendel, which Tolkien never wrote, but which is sketched out in this book from other sources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following his presentation of Beren and Lúthien Christopher Tolkien has used the same 'history in sequence' mode in the writing of this edition of The Fall of Gondolin. In the words of J.R.R. Tolkien, it was ‘the first real story of this imaginary world’ and, together with Beren and Lúthien and The Children of Húrin, he regarded it as one of the three 'Great Tales' of the Elder Days.</description>

  <description>It's decision time for the mighty Warrior Princess . . . left for dead by the Romans on the cross, Xena struggles with delirium and deceit as she must decide her fate -- to relive her dark past or to face the grim spectacle of her present. And when her choice casts her into Hell, the Big Bad Guy himself offers her the opportunity to sit at his right hand if she will lure to the Netherworld a pure, powerful soul -- a certain Norse God of Thunder! -- to lead a war against Heaven! These storylines are interwoven with those of the finale of the season four and the premiere of season five of "Xena: Warrior Princess" and as such are integral companions to the epic saga of Xena's struggle against evil and oppression.</description>

But a run-in with slave traders and the rescue of a young girl in chains leaves little room for rest as Xena discovers the girl is Egyptian royalty and the center of a plot involving none other than Cleopatra -- and Set, the Egyptian god of evil! Xena must stop the blood sacrifice that will bring the fearsome Set into this world, but she'll have to cut her way through the Egyptian priesthood and the Roman Army to get the job done!</description>

      <![CDATA[This is an enjoyable read. It contains the main “Slave” story, and also a shorter story called “Ghost”. Both pick up in what would be early season five. Xena and Gabrielle are dealing with the trauma they’ve undergone and Rome and Egypt are in a state of chaos after Caesar’s death. <br /><br />In “Slave”, Xe...]]>

  <description>Thomas hears voices, the most prominent of which is that of a demon called Dinn. The demon re-frames Thomas' declining mental health as a kind of nightmarish adventure, an opportunity to leave behind the world that he has known and join the forces of hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Thomas takes the demon at his word, applying himself to his so-called training, he finds himself being called upon to perform unspeakable acts. But Dinn has painted the world in such dark, forbidding colours that soon Thomas lacks both the will and the means to seek the help he so desperately needs.</description>

  <description>When everything is easily crushable under well-meaning feet, how can a Humongo ever fit in in such a little world?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the creator of "The Night of the Living Dead" and the Zombie movement that permeates our culture today, comes a sarcastic and cynical children's tale of different creatures trying to coexist in a benign, yet power-hungry environment. In line with Antoine de Saint-Exupery’s Little Prince, The Little World of Humongo Bongo is a beautiful metaphor on the evolution of our civilization, depicted with humour and simplicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring illustrations by Romero himself, welcome to a zany little world captured by the lens of one of the world’s visionary film creators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Xena, Warrior Princess, has toppled nations through the force of her will. She's captained the most deadly pirate crew ever to sail the seas. She even turned her back on her past, seeking redemption for her darker acts alongside her partner Gabrielle. And yet, despite her propensity for defeating all odds, her thousand-strong army has fallen to an implacable and ancient evil. Her only recourse? To use the dreaded Necronomicon to summon Ash Williams - the wise-ass, butt-kicking, smooth-talkin' demon-killer from the future - for aid! But how can Xena save the world when that chainsaw-wielding knucklehead's every temporal mishap threatens to unravel time itself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cult favorite media sensations Army of Darkness and Xena, Warrior Princess collide in a wildly hilarious adventure written by Scott Lobdell (Red Hood and the Outlaws, Uncanny X-Men) and featuring artwork by Elliot Fernandez and Diego Galindo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A superlative job of capturing the spirit of both Xena, Warrior Princess and Ash of Army Of Darkness." - SciFiPulse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Lobdell balances the personalities of his distinct cast and Fernandez's layouts are superb." - Nerds on the Rocks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"(Lobdell's) dialogue is hilarious and flows very well." - Big Glasgow Comic Page</description>

      <![CDATA[I was disappointed by this. I’m giving it two stars because I enjoy some of the art but the story is barely coherent. By the end it’s possible to sort of figure out what was going on but it’s really a bit of nonsense that doesn’t fit well into either the Xenaverse or the Evil Dead universe.]]>

      <![CDATA[This is entertaining but not as good as the first volume. The tone is perfect for Evil Dead and Ash’s voice is spot on. That can’t be said for the XWP side of things. I also think the likenesses were not as strong in this one.]]>

  <description>This adventure finds Ashley J. Williams transported to the world of Xena and Gabrielle - and, most importantly, Autolycus, who of course, bears more than a passing resemblance to our main man Ash.</description>

  <description>An all-new &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt; adventure across time—the latest of the acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Original Series &lt;/i&gt;novels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arctic Circle, 1845: Escaping the tyranny under which their people have lived for generations, aliens from a distant planet crash land on Earth’s inhospitable frozen wastes. Surviving the harsh conditions will pose a challenge, but over time the aliens will migrate to more populated areas, with decades passing as they work to conceal their presence from their former oppressors, who continue to hunt them at any cost.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;San Francisco, 2283: When a mysterious craft is detected entering the solar system, Admiral James Kirk is dispatched by Starfleet to confront the vessel. He meets with an emissary from the Iramahl, a previously unknown alien race who have come in search of their brothers and sisters thought to have gone missing in this area of space centuries earlier. Having recently thrown off the last chains of subjugation by another species, the Ptaen, they now believe their lost people hold the key to saving their entire race from eventual extinction.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;New York, 1970: Roberta Lincoln, young protégé of the mysterious agent Gary Seven, is shocked when she receives the oddest request for help—from the future…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ™, ®, &amp;amp; © 2016 CBS Studios, Inc.

      <![CDATA[This was released during Star Trek’s 50th anniversary and it’s clearly a love letter to the franchise. It ties together Trek tidbits from TNG, DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise with a TOS time travel plot. I also appreciated the Canadian content.]]>

      <![CDATA[This is kind of a pocket guide to the history of Wonder Woman. It focuses mostly on Comics with a few references to animation, toys, and the Lynda Carter series. It really is too small to be able to fully enjoy some of the art work but it’s a nice sampler.]]>

  <description>Washington Black is an eleven-year-old field slave who knows no other life than the Barbados sugar plantation where he was born. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his master's eccentric brother chooses him to be his manservant, Wash is terrified of the cruelties he is certain await him. But Christopher Wilde, or "Titch," is a naturalist, explorer, scientist, inventor, and abolitionist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He initiates Wash into a world where a flying machine can carry a man across the sky; where two people, separated by an impossible divide, might begin to see each other as human; and where a boy born in chains can embrace a life of dignity and meaning. But when a man is killed and a bounty is placed on Wash's head, Titch abandons everything to save him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is their flight along the eastern coast of America, and, finally, to a remote outpost in the Arctic, where Wash, left on his own, must invent another new life, one which will propel him further across the globe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the sultry cane fields of the Caribbean to the frozen Far North, &lt;i&gt;Washington Black&lt;/i&gt; tells a story of friendship and betrayal, love and redemption, of a world destroyed and made whole again--and asks the question, what is true freedom?</description>

      <![CDATA[Despite the improbable plot, this is an enjoyable read. One gets sucked in by the author’s beautiful writing. The first half of the novel is stronger. The second half gave off some slight Heart of Darkness vibes but I don’t think it was realized as well as it might have been.]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this profoundly honest and examined memoir about returning to Iowa to care for her ailing parents, the star of&lt;em&gt; Orange Is the New Black&lt;/em&gt; and bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Born with Teeth&lt;/em&gt; takes us on an unexpected journey of loss, betrayal, and the transcendent nature of a daughter’s love for her parents.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say you can’t go home again. But when her father is diagnosed with aggressive lung cancer and her mother with atypical Alzheimer’s, New York-based actress Kate Mulgrew returns to her hometown in Iowa to spend time with her parents and care for them in the time they have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The months Kate spends with her parents in Dubuque—by turns turbulent, tragic, and joyful—lead her to reflect on each of their lives and how they shaped her own. Those ruminations are transformed when, in the wake of their deaths, Kate uncovers long-kept secrets that challenge her understanding of the unconventional Irish Catholic household in which she was raised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breathtaking and powerful, laced with the author’s irreverent wit,&lt;em&gt; How to Forget&lt;/em&gt; is a considered portrait of a mother and a father, an emotionally powerful memoir that demonstrates how love fuses children and parents, and an honest examination of family, memory, and indelible loss.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a heartbreaking and beautiful memoir about the loss of Mulgrew’s parents. The author’s voice is strong, and assured. It has matured since her first book. Though the subject matter is sometimes tragic, I found it difficult to put this down. I hope that Mulgrew will continue writing.]]>

  <description>The #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling original graphic novel by the critically acclaimed author Paul Dini! DARK NIGHT: A TRUE BATMAN STORY is the harrowing and eloquent autobiographical tale of Dini's courageous struggle to overcome a truly desperate situation. It is a Batman story like no other and one that will truly resonate with fans, with art by the incredible and talented Eduardo Risso (100 BULLETS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 1990s, writer Paul Dini had a flourishing career penning the hugely popular &lt;i&gt;Batman: The Animated Series&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tiny Toon Adventures&lt;/i&gt;. It was a golden era of television screenwriting, and Dini and his fellow writers were at the forefront of the glittering Hollywood scene. In one night, everything would change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walking home one evening, Dini was jumped and viciously beaten. With several broken bones and a shattered face, Dini experienced an arduous recovery process, hampered by the imagined antics of the villains he was writing for television, including the Joker, Harley Quinn, and the Penguin. But despite how bleak his circumstances were, or perhaps because of it, Dini also always imagined the Batman at his side, constantly chivvying him along during his darkest moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While most know the Caped Crusader as the all-abiding icon of justice and authority, in this surprising story, we see Batman in a new light--not as the dark avenger, but the savior who helped a discouraged man recover mentally from a brutal attack that left him unable to face the world.</description>

  <description>An all-new original Star Trek: The Next Generation e-novella!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wedding of Captain Jean-Luc Picard to Doctor Beverly Crusher was a small, private affair overseen by the mayor of La Barre, France, and witnessed by the groom’s sister-in-law and the mayor’s wife. At least that’s what the happy couple always told their friends. On the anniversary of that blessed day, however, Worf and Geordi La Forge manage to coax the real story out of the pair, to discover a tale of mythical treasure and a lost civilization in the Delta Quadrant. It all begins when the omnipotent being Q crashes the festivities, declaring himself best man and bringing along an unwilling guest as a surprise for the groom…</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Q and Picard, Together Again</strong><br /><br />This was a successful novella. It’s a very cute idea to have Q involved in this momentous occasion in Picard’s life. I find myself hoping that John DeLancie will re-appear as Q in the new Picard TV series!]]>

  <description>From the author of The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared comes a picaresque tale of how one person's actions can have far-reaching-even global-consequences&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On June 14, 2007, the king and the prime minister of Sweden went missing from a gala banquet at the royal castle. Later it was said that both had fallen ill, but the truth is different. The real story starts much earlier, in 1961, with the birth of Nombeko Mayeki in a shack in Soweto. Nombeko was fated to grow up fast and die early in her poverty-stricken township, be it from drugs, alcohol, or just plain despair. But Nombeko takes a different path. She finds work as a housecleaner and eventually makes her way up to the position of chief advisor, at the helm of one of the world's most secret projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is where the tale merges with then diverges from reality. South Africa developed six nuclear missiles in the 1980s, then voluntarily dismantled them in 1994. This is the story of the seventh missile, the one that was never supposed to have existed. Nombeko Mayeki knows too much about it, and now she's on the run from both the South African justice system and the most terrifying secret service in the world. The fate of the planet now lies in Nombeko's hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonasson introduces us to a cast of eccentrics: a nerve-damaged American Vietnam deserter, twin brothers who are officially only one person, three careless Chinese girls, an angry young woman, a potato-growing baroness, the Swedish king and the prime minister. Quirky and utterly unique, The Girl Who Saved the King of Sweden is a charming and humorous account of one young woman's unlikely adventure.</description>

      <![CDATA[I’m afraid I didn’t enjoy this as much as I did the 100 Year-Old Man. Maybe it was a bit too wacky? Jonasson’s voice is still entertaining. It has a hint of Douglas Adams in it but I didn’t enjoy the characters in this book as much as the last.]]>

  <description>SIGNED BY THE AUTHOR, ANNE RICE! The Vampire Chronicles continue with a riveting, rich saga--part adventure, part suspense--of Prince Lestat and the story of the Blood Communion as he tells the tale of his coming to rule the vampire world and the eternal struggle to find belonging, a place in the universe for the undead, and how, against his will, he must battle the menacing, seemingly unstoppable force determined to thwart his vision and destroy the entire vampire netherworld. In this spellbinding novel, Lestat, rebel outlaw, addresses the tribe of vampires, directly, intimately, passionately, and tells the mesmerizing story of the formation of the Blood Communion and how he became Prince of the vampire world, the true ruler of this vast realm, and how his vision for all the Children of the Universe to thrive as one, came to be. The tale spills from Lestat's heart, as he speaks first of his new existence as reigning monarch--and then of his fierce battle of wits and words with the mysterious Rhoshamandes, proud Child of the Millennia, reviled outcast for his senseless slaughter of the legendary ancient vampire Maharet, avowed enemy of Queen Akasha; Rhoshamandes, a demon spirit who refuses to live in harmony at the Court of Prince Lestat and threatens all that Lestat has dreamt of. As the tale unfolds, Lestat takes us from the towers and battlements of his ancestral castle in the snow-covered mountains of France to the verdant wilds of lush Louisiana with its lingering fragrances of magnolias and night jasmine; from the far reaches of the Pacific's untouched islands to the 18th-century city of St. Petersburg and the court of the Empress Catherine . . .</description>

  <description>100,000 years ago, at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Sapiens&lt;/i&gt;, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power ... and our future.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Starship Repo&lt;/i&gt; is a fast-paced romp through the galaxy from Patrick S. Tomlinson.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstname Lastname is a no one with nowhere to go. With a name that is the result of an unfortunate clerical error and destined to be one of the only humans on an alien space station. That is until she sneaks aboard a ship and joins up with a crew of repomen (they are definitely not pirates).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she's traveling the galaxy "recovering" ships. What could go wrong?</description>

      <![CDATA[The good people at Tor sent me a copy of this book in exchange for a fair review. II enjoyed it — perhaps not as much as Gate Crashers, but Tomlinson’s voice is very open and engaging. This is a perfect, fun summer read.<br /><br />As with Gate Crashers, one can sense Douglas Adams’ influence in...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;"THE ULTIMATE DINOSAUR BIOGRAPHY," hails &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;: A thrilling new history of the age of dinosaurs, from one of our finest young scientists. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"A masterpiece of science writing." —&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller • Goodreads Choice Awards Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; • &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR: &lt;em&gt;Smithsonian,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Science Friday,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt; (London), &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Popular Mechanics,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This is scientific storytelling at its most visceral, striding with the beasts through their Triassic dawn, Jurassic dominance, and abrupt demise in the Cretaceous." —&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dinosaurs. &lt;/em&gt;Sixty-six million years ago, the Earth’s most fearsome creatures vanished. Today they remain one of our planet’s great mysteries. Now &lt;em&gt;The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs &lt;/em&gt;reveals their extraordinary, 200-million-year-long story as never before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this captivating narrative (enlivened with more than seventy original illustrations and photographs), Steve Brusatte, a young American paleontologist who has emerged as one of the foremost stars of the field—naming fifteen new species and leading groundbreaking scientific studies and fieldwork—masterfully tells the complete, surprising, and &lt;em&gt;new &lt;/em&gt;history of the dinosaurs, drawing on cutting-edge science to dramatically bring to life their lost world and illuminate their enigmatic origins, spectacular flourishing, astonishing diversity, cataclysmic extinction, and startling living legacy. Captivating and revelatory, &lt;em&gt;The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs&lt;/em&gt; is a book for the ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brusatte traces the evolution of dinosaurs from their inauspicious start as small shadow dwellers—themselves the beneficiaries of a mass extinction caused by volcanic eruptions at the beginning of the Triassic period—into the dominant array of species every wide-eyed child memorizes today, &lt;em&gt;T. rex&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Triceratops&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Brontosaurus&lt;/em&gt;, and more. This gifted scientist and writer re-creates the dinosaurs’ peak during the Jurassic and Cretaceous, when thousands of species thrived, and winged and feathered dinosaurs, the prehistoric ancestors of modern birds, emerged. The story continues to the end of the Cretaceous period, when a giant asteroid or comet struck the planet and nearly every dinosaur species (but not all) died out, in the most extraordinary extinction event in earth’s history, one full of lessons for today as we confront a “sixth extinction.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brusatte also recalls compelling stories from his globe-trotting expeditions during one of the most exciting eras in dinosaur research—which he calls “a new golden age of discovery”—and offers thrilling accounts of some of the remarkable findings he and his colleagues have made, including primitive human-sized tyrannosaurs; monstrous carnivores even larger than &lt;em&gt;T. rex&lt;/em&gt;; and paradigm-shifting feathered raptors from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An electrifying scientific history that unearths the dinosaurs’ epic saga, &lt;em&gt;The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs&lt;/em&gt; will be a definitive and treasured account for decades to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Includes 75 images, world maps of the prehistoric earth, and a dinosaur family tree.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Following the resolution of the fertility crisis that nearly caused their extinction, the Andorian people now stand ready to rejoin the United Federation of Planets. The return of one of its founding member worlds is viewed by many as the first hopeful step beyond the uncertainty and tragedy that have overshadowed recent events in the Alpha Quadrant. But as the Federation looks to the future and the special election to name President Bacco’s permanent successor, time is running out to apprehend those responsible for the respected leader’s brutal assassination. Even as elements of the Typhon Pact are implicated for the murder, Admiral William Riker holds key knowledge of the true assassins— a revelation that could threaten the fragile Federation-Cardassian alliance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions and concerns also continue to swell around Bacco’s interim successor, Ishan Anjar, who uses the recent bloodshed to further a belligerent, hawkish political agenda against the Typhon Pact. With the election looming, Riker dispatches his closest friend, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, in a desperate attempt to uncover the truth. But as Picard and the Enterprise crew pursue the few remaining clues, Riker must act on growing suspicions that someone within Ishan’s inner circle has been in league with the assassins from the very beginning . . . .</description>

  <description>One simple act, and the troubles of the United Federation of Planets have grown darker overnight. The mystery behind the heinous terrorist attack that has rocked the Federation to its core grows ever deeper, and William Riker finds himself beset by rumors and half-truths as the U.S.S. Titan is ordered back to Earth on emergency orders from the admiralty. Soon, Riker finds himself drawn into a game of political intrigue, bearing witness to members of Starfleet being detained—including people he considered friends—pending an investigation at the highest levels. And while Riker tries to navigate the corridors of power, Titan’s tactical officer, Tuvok, is given a series of clandestine orders that lead him into a gray world of secrets, lies, and deniable operations. Who can be trusted when the law falls silent and justice becomes a quest for revenge? For the crew of the U.S.S. Titan, the search for answers will become a battle for every ideal the Federation stands for. . .</description>

  <description>On humanity’s first extra-solar mission, the exploration vessel Magellan discovers an alien construction. Deciding that finding advanced alien life is too important to ignore, the ship’s captain chooses to return to Earth while reverse engineering technology far beyond anything back home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, at mission control, the governments struggle to maintain the existence of aliens a secret while also combating bureaucracy, the military industrial complex, and everyone else who wants a piece of the science that could sky-rocket a species into a new technological golden age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little does everyone involved know that the bumbling of a few highly-evolved apes in space hasn’t gone unnoticed, and humanity has put itself on a collision course with a far wider, and potentially hostile, galaxy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because, in space, no one can see you screw up…</description>

  <description>Anne Rice continues her astonishing Vampire Chronicles in a new novel that begins where &lt;b&gt;Blackwood Farm&lt;/b&gt; left off — and tells the story of Lestat’s quest for redemption, goodness, and the love of Rowan Mayfair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome back to Blackwood Farm. Here are all of the brilliantly conceived characters that make up the two worlds of vampires and witches: Mona Mayfair, who’s come to the farm to die and is brought into the realm of the undead; her uncle, Julian Mayfair, guardian of the family, determined to forever torment Lestat for what he has done to Mona; Rowan Mayfair, brilliant neurosurgeon and witch, who finds herself dangerously drawn to the all-powerful Lestat; her husband, Michael Curry, hero of the Mayfair Chronicles, who seeks Lestat’s help with the temporary madness of his wife; Ash Templeton, a 5,000-year-old Taltos who has taken Mona’s child; and Patsy, the country-western singer, who returns to avenge her death at the hands of her son, Quinn Blackwood. Delightfully, at the book’s centre is the Vampire Lestat, once the epitome of evil, now pursuing the transformation set in motion with &lt;b&gt;Memnoch the Devil&lt;/b&gt;. He struggles with his vampirism and yearns for goodness, purity and love, as he saves Patsy’s ghost from the dark realm of the Earthbound, uncovers the mystery of the Taltos and unselfishly decides the fate of his beloved Rowan Mayfair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A story of love and loyalty, of the search for passion and promise, &lt;b&gt;Blood Canticle&lt;/b&gt; is Anne Rice at her finest.</description>

  <description>Cardassia Prime is home to a prideful people who, for centuries, forged alliances with those they believed would strengthen them and their place in the Alpha Quadrant, and expanded their empire at great cost to other worlds. For generations, dissenting voices were silenced by either fear or an early grave. When their wartime ally, the Dominion, suddenly turned on them, seeking to transform Cardassia into a tomb for every last member of their race, their old adversary—the United Federation of Planets— put an end to the carnage, and even now works to help rebuild Cardassia Prime. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To celebrate this alliance, the Castellan of the Cardassian Union is to welcome the Federation president to Cardassia Prime. As a symbol of this deepening friendship, the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Enterprise-&lt;/i&gt;E is tasked to carry the Cardassian ambassador to the Federation back home. For his part, Ambassador Elim Garak is working with Captain Jean-Luc Picard to oversee the diplomatic reception that will commemorate the last of Starfleet’s personnel finally leaving the homeworld. However, there are malevolent forces at work, who even now strive to “restore Cardassia to its proper place and glory,” and are willing to do anything to achieve their goal....</description>

      <![CDATA[I really like the basic concept behind this e-novella but I disagree with how Picard’s experience in the Nexus was executed. Without spoiling anything, I think it negates a couple of very important story points from the series and from Generations, weakening those works. ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The climax of a new trilogy by the national bestselling author of   &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: Destiny&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the center of the Galaxy, a planet-sized Machine of terrifying power and unfathomable purpose hurls entire star systems into a supermassive black hole. Wesley Crusher, now a full-fledged Traveler, knows the Machine must be stopped…but he has no idea how. He enlists the help of Captain Picard and the&lt;i&gt; Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; crew, who also fail to halt the unstoppable alien juggernaut’s destructive labors. But they soon divine the Machine’s true purpose, which threatens to exterminate all life in the Milky Way Galaxy. With time running out, Picard realizes he knows of only one person who might be able to stop the Machine in time to avert a galactic catastrophe—but he has no idea how to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

      <![CDATA[For me, this book is reminiscent of the TNG TV series. The universe is at stake and Data and Wesley manage to save it. David Mack does a great job with high stakes suspense. It’s just a very entertaining read.<br /><br />My one criticism would be that Wesley sometimes sounds more like Wil Wheaton...]]>

  <description>Restored from Tolkien’s manuscripts and presented for the first time as a fully continuous and standalone story, the epic tale of Beren and Lúthien will reunite fans of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings with Elves and Humans, Dwarves and Orcs and the rich landscape and creatures unique to Tolkien’s Middle-earth. The tale of Beren and Lúthien was, or became, an essential element in the evolution of The Silmarillion, the myths and legends of the First Age of the World conceived by J.R.R. Tolkien. Returning from France and the battle of the Somme at the end of 1916, he wrote the tale in the following year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essential to the story, and never changed, is the fate that shadowed the love of Beren and Lúthien: for Beren was a mortal man, but Lúthien was an immortal Elf. Her father, a great Elvish lord, in deep opposition to Beren, imposed on him an impossible task that he must perform before he might wed Lúthien. This is the kernel of the legend; and it leads to the supremely heroic attempt of Beren and Lúthien together to rob the greatest of all evil beings, Melkor, called Morgoth, the Black Enemy, of a Silmaril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book Christopher Tolkien has attempted to extract the story of Beren and Lúthien from the comprehensive work in which it was embedded; but that story was itself changing as it developed new associations within the larger history. To show something of the process whereby this legend of Middle-earth evolved over the years, he has told the story in his father's own words by giving, first, its original form, and then passages in prose and verse from later texts that illustrate the narrative as it changed. Presented together for the first time, they reveal aspects of the story, both in event and in narrative immediacy, that were afterwards lost.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old and not-so-openly gay Simon Spier prefers to save his drama for the school musical. But when an email falls into the wrong hands, his secret is at risk of being thrust into the spotlight. Now Simon is actually being blackmailed: if he doesn’t play wingman for class clown Martin, his sexual identity will become everyone’s business. Worse, the privacy of Blue, the pen name of the boy he’s been emailing, will be compromised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With some messy dynamics emerging in his once tight-knit group of friends, and his email correspondence with Blue growing more flirtatious every day, Simon’s junior year has suddenly gotten all kinds of complicated. Now, change-averse Simon has to find a way to step out of his comfort zone before he’s pushed out—without alienating his friends, compromising himself, or fumbling a shot at happiness with the most confusing, adorable guy he’s never met.</description>

  <description>An original novel based upon the explosive new&lt;i&gt; Star Trek &lt;/i&gt;TV series on CBS All Access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lieutenant Saru is a Kelpien, a member of a prey species born on a world overrun by monstrous predators...and a being who very intimately understands the nature of fear. Challenged on all sides, he is determined to surpass his origins and succeed as a Starfleet officer aboard the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Shenzhou&lt;/i&gt;. But when Saru breaks protocol in order to prove himself to his crewmates, what begins as a vital rescue mission to save a vessel in distress soon escalates out of control. Forced into a command role he may not be ready for, Saru is caught between his duty and the conflicting agendas of two antagonistic alien races. To survive, he will need to seek a path of peace against all odds, and risk compromising the very ideals he has sworn to uphold....</description>

  <description>It all happened in a flash. On a beautiful spring morning in 2007, sitting in my backyard and licking my wounds from a spectacular career derailment, I came up with a big idea-and I found myself contemplating the most daring and unconventional pursuit of my life." In this memoir, by turns hilarious, weird and tender, but always engaging, musical prodigy, numbers nerd and weather geek Andreas Souvaliotis takes us with him on his zigzag journey to that moment-and on the subsequent rollercoaster ride that transformed him from a misfit into a changemaker. PRAISE A book by someone who has more ideas in a minute than most of us have in a year. - Jeffrey Simpson, National Affairs Columnist, The Globe and Mail Andreas's message is straightforward and powerful: harness the things that make you different in order to change your world for the better. We're all misfits, with our own particularities. And, in our quest to fit in and live "normal," we too often quash those very things that could make us special. - Justin Trudeau &amp;amp; Sophie Gregoire Misfits have always been the architects of change and innovation for our world. My dear friend Andreas's story offers an awesome and rare glimpse into the mind and soul of a passionate innovator-a true misfit. - W. Brett Wilson, Entrepreneur, Philanthropist &amp;amp; Dragon Have you ever been fired? Your ideas trashed, your dream rejected? The worst day of Andreas Souvaliotis's career opened the way to his greatest success. His amazing story will inspire overachieving "misfits" everywhere. - David Frum, CNN Contributor What happens when you mix a Greek immigrant whose favorite day is April Fools' with Alan Greenspan and Muhammad Yunus? Canada's Central Banker for Social Change, Andreas Souvaliotis. - Toby Heaps, CEO, Corporate Knights The inspiring tale of a courageous innovator who consistently transforms adversity into positive energy and passion. - Karen Kain, Artistic Director, The National Ballet of Canada The beautiful story of Canada's most energetic, dynamic, fun and outspoken social entrepreneur. - Greg Kiessling, Executive Chairman, Bullfrog Power Inc.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The second book in a new trilogy by the national bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: Destiny&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years after the disastrous final Borg Invasion, a bitter cold war against the Typhon Pact has pushed Starfleet’s resources to the breaking point.

  <description>An all-new Star Trek e-novella featuring the Department of Temporal Investigations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dedicated agents of the Federation Department of Temporal Investigations have their work cut out for them protecting the course of history from the dangers of time travel. But the galaxy is littered with artifacts that, in the wrong hands, could threaten reality. One of the DTI's most crucial jobs is to track down these objects and lock them safely away in the Federation’s most secret and secure facility. When Agents Lucsly and Dulmur bring home an alien obelisk of incredible power, they are challenged by a 31st-century temporal agent who insists they surrender the mysterious artifact to her. But before they know it, the three agents are pulled into a corrupted future torn apart by a violent temporal war. While their DTI colleagues attempt to track them down, Lucsly and Dulmur must restore temporal peace by setting off on an epic journey through the ages, with the future of the galaxy hanging in the balance...</description>

It is stronger than Emerson’s previous Xena novels but I don’t think it’s quite a 3.<br /><br />Some time has passed since the last book and this has given Emerson time to correct some details and get to know the series better.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An all-new novel set in the universe of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation, &lt;/i&gt;in which tensions escalate between two powerful forces in interstellar space.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Venette Convention has always remained independent, but it is about to become the flashpoint for a tense military standoff between the two power blocs now dominating interstellar space--the United Federation of Planets and the recently formed Typhon Pact. The Venetan government turns to the Typhon Pact's Tzenkethi Coalition for protection in the new order, and has agreed to allow three of their supply bases for Tzenkethi use. But these bases--if militarized--would put Tzenkethi weapons unacceptably close to Federation, Cardassian, and Ferengi space. While Captain Ezri Dax and the crew of the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Aventine &lt;/i&gt;are sent to investigate exactly what is happening at one of the Venette bases, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Enterprise &lt;/i&gt;are assigned to a diplomatic mission sent to the Venette homeworld in order to broker a mutually acceptable resolution. But the Cardassian delegates don't seem particularly keen on using diplomacy to resolve the situation, which soon spirals out of control toward all-out war. . . .</description>

  <description>After the disastrous events in the Bajoran system, Captain Benjamin Sisko must confront the consequences of the recent choices he has made in his life. At the same time, the United Federation of Planets and its Khitomer Accords allies have come to the brink of war with the Typhon Pact. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While factions within the Pact unsuccessfully used the recent gestures of goodwill–the opening of borders and a joint Federation-Romulan exploratory mission–to develop quantum slipstream drive, they have not given up their goals. Employing a broad range of assets, from Romulus to Cardassia, from Ab-Tzenketh to Bajor, they embark on a dangerous new plan to acquire the technology they need to take control of the Alpha and Beta Quadrants. While UFP President Bacco and Romulan Praetor Kamemor work feverishly to reestablish peace, Captains Sisko, Jean-Luc Picard, and Ro Laren stand on the front lines of the conflict... even as a new danger threatens the Bajoran wormhole as it once more becomes a flashpoint of galactic history.</description>

  <description>Second novel in the hard sci-fi Reunification series, The Gate to Futures Past continues the Clan Chronicles, perfect for space opera readers looking for unique aliens and interstellar civilizations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Betrayed and attacked, the Clan fled the Trade Pact for Cersi, believing that world their long-lost home. With them went a lone alien, the Human named Jason Morgan, Chosen of their leader, Sira di Sarc. Tragically, their arrival upset the Balance between Cersi’s three sentient species. And so the Clan, with their newfound kin, must flee again.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their starship, powered by the M’hir, follows a course set long ago, for Clan abilities came from an experiment their ancestors—the Hoveny—conducted on themselves. But it’s a perilous journey. The Clan must endure more than cramped conditions and inner turmoil. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their dead are Calling.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sira must keep her people from answering, for if they do, they die. Morgan searches the ship for answers, afraid the Hoveny’s tech is beyond his grasp. Their only hope? To reach their destination. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Little do Sira and Morgan realize their destination holds the gravest threat of all....</description>

  <description>The agents of the Department of Temporal Investigations are assigned to look into an anomaly that has appeared deep in Federation territory. It's difficult to get clear readings, but a mysterious inactive vessel lies at the heart of the anomaly, one outfitted with some sort of temporal drive disrupting space-time and subspace. To the agents' shock, the ship bears a striking resemblance to a Constitution-class starship, and its warp signature matches that of the original Federation starship Enterprise NCC-1701--the ship of James T. Kirk, that infamous bogeyman of temporal investigators, whose record of violations is held up by DTI agents as a cautionary tale for Starfleet recklessness toward history. But the vessel's hull markings identify it as Timeship Two, belonging to none other than the DTI itself. At first, Agents Lucsly and Dulmur assume the ship is from some other timeline . . . but its quantum signature confirms that it came from their own past, despite the fact that the DTI never possessed such a timeship. While the anomaly is closely monitored, Lucsly and Dulmur must search for answers in the history of Kirk's Enterprise and its many encounters with time travel--a series of events with direct ties to the origins of the DTI itself. . . .</description>

  <description>The most talented Starfleet engineers of two generations unite to solve a two-hundred-year-old technological mystery that turns out to be only the beginning of a wider quest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the support of Guinan and Nog, as well as the crew of the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Challenger&lt;/i&gt;, Geordi La Forge and Montgomery Scott soon find themselves drawn into a larger, deadlier, and far more personal adventure. Helped by old friends and hindered by old enemies, their investigation will come to threaten everything they hold dear. Seeking out the new, and going where no one has gonebefore, Geordi, Scotty, and Guinan find that their pasts are very much of the present, and must determine whether any sufficiently advanced technology is really indistinguishable from magic.</description>

  <description>Stephen Hawking, one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists in history, wrote the modern classic &lt;i&gt;A Brief History of Time&lt;/i&gt; to help non-scientists understand fundamental questions of physics and our existence: where did the universe come from? How and why did it begin? Will it come to an end, and if so, how?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hawking attempts to deal with these questions (and where we might look for answers) using a minimum of technical jargon. Among the topics gracefully covered are gravity, black holes, the Big Bang, the nature of time and physicists' search for a grand unifying theory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is deep science; the concepts are so vast (or so tiny) that they cause mental vertigo while reading, and one can't help but marvel at Hawking's ability to synthesize this difficult subject for people not used to thinking about things like alternate dimensions. The journey is certainly worth taking for as Hawking says, the reward of understanding the universe may be a glimpse of “the mind of God”.&lt;br /&gt;(From Hawking.org.uk)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Brief History of Time&lt;/i&gt;, published in 1988, was a landmark volume in science writing and in world-wide acclaim and popularity, with more than 9 million copies in print globally. The original edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the ensuing years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic world—observations that have confirmed many of Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book. Now a decade later, this edition updates the chapters throughout to document those advances, and also includes an entirely new chapter on Wormholes and Time Travel and a new introduction. It makes vividly clear why &lt;i&gt;A Brief History of Time&lt;/i&gt; has transformed our view of the universe. (Refers to later editions)</description>

  <description>An original novel based upon the explosive new Star Trek TV series on CBS All Access!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 2246, ten years prior to the Battle at the Binary Stars, and an aggressive contagion is ravaging the food supplies of the remote Federation colony Tarsus IV and the eight thousand people who call it home. Distress signals have been sent, but any meaningful assistance is weeks away. Lieutenant Commander Gabriel Lorca and a small team assigned to a Starfleet monitoring outpost are caught up in the escalating crisis, and bear witness as the colony’s governor, Adrian Kodos, employs an unimaginable solution in order to prevent mass starvation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While awaiting transfer to her next assignment, Commander Philippa Georgiou is tasked with leading to Tarsus IV a small, hastily assembled group of first responders. It’s hoped this advance party can help stabilize the situation until more aid arrives, but Georgiou and her team discover that they‘re too late—Governor Kodos has already implemented his heinous strategy for extending the colony’s besieged food stores and safeguarding the community’s long-term survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the midst of their rescue mission, Georgiou and Lorca must now hunt for the architect of this horrific tragedy and the man whom history will one day brand “Kodos the Executioner”….</description>

  <description>Mercantilius and Pastoralis are two towns on the verge of all-out war. When Hercules wanders into their little disagreement, he's shocked to learn that he's already been there--and he's betrayed them all! There is only one possibility. Someone is posing as Hercules. Someone with superhuman powers of trickery and deception. Perhaps a certain cloven-hoofed god with a bad attitude.</description>

      <![CDATA[I had high hopes that this fourth novel in the series might be better than the first three which were by Timothy Boggs. I think Seidman’s characterization of Hercules is better but that’s about all for improvements.<br /><br />The story is convoluted. It reminds me of first season episodes like “...]]>

  <description>An original novel set in the universe of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: Voyager,&lt;/i&gt; from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Federation &lt;i&gt;Starship Voyager &lt;/i&gt;continues to lead the Full Circle Fleet in its exploration of the Delta Quadrant, Admiral Kathryn Janeway remains concerned about the Krenim Imperium and its ability to rewrite time to suit its whims. At Captain Chakotay's suggestion, however, she orders the fleet to focus its attention on a unique planet in a binary system, where a new element has been discovered. Several biospheres exist on this otherwise uninhabitable world, each containing different atmospheres and features that argue other sentient beings once resided on the surface. Janeway hopes that digging into an old-fashioned scientific mystery will lift the crews' morale, but she soon realizes that the secrets buried on this world may be part of a much larger puzzle—one that points to the existence of a species whose power to reshape the galaxy might dwarf that of the Krenim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Meanwhile, Lieutenants Nancy Conlon and Harry Kim continue to struggle with the choices related to Conlon’s degenerative condition. Full Circle’s medical staff discovers a potential solution, but complications will force a fellow officer to confront her people’s troubled past and her own future in ways she never imagined…&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There’s more than one way to stoke the flames of revenge…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Rowe spent the first seven years of her life in the hands of the only parents she knew—a pair of serial killers who murdered her mother and tried to shape Charlotte in their own twisted image. If only the nightmare had ended when she was rescued. Instead, her real father exploited her tabloid-ready story for fame and profit—until Charlotte finally broke free from her ghoulish past and fled. Just when she thinks she has buried her personal hell forever, Charlotte is swept into a frightening new ordeal. Secretly dosed with an experimental drug, she’s endowed with a shocking new power—but pursued by a treacherous corporation desperate to control her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except from now on, if anybody is going to control Charlotte, it’s going to be Charlotte herself. She’s determined to use the extraordinary ability she now possesses to fight the kind of evil that shattered her life—by drawing a serial killer out from the shadows to face the righteous fury of a victim turned avenger.</description>

  <description>In the wake of the final Borg invasion, which destroyed entire worlds, cost the lives of sixty-three billion people, and struck a crippling blow to Starfleet, six nations adversarial to the United Federation of Planetsâ��the Romulan Star Empire, the Breen Confederacy, the Tholian Assembly, the Gorn Hegemony, the Tzenkethi Coalition, and the Holy Order of the Kinshayaâ�� joined ranks to form the Typhon Pact. For almost three years, the Federation and the Klingon Empire, allied under the Khitomer Accords, have contended with the nascent coalition on a predominantly cold-war footing. But as Starfleet rebuilds itself, factions within the Typhon Pact grow restive, concerned about their own inability to develop a quantum slipstream drive to match that of the Federation. Will leaders such as UFP President Bacco and RSE Praetor Kamemor bring about a lasting peace across the Alpha and Beta Quadrants, or will the cold war between the two alliances deepen, and perhaps even lead to an all-out shooting war?</description>

      <![CDATA[It feels like the bulk of this novel was spent summarizing past events and setting up what happens in the final pages. It sprawls across many months and across the galaxy but really says very little. As I’ve commented before, what I miss in most of these post-Nemesis novels is the exploration of...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Fierce Femmes and Notorious Liars: A Dangerous Trans Girl’s Confabulous Memoir&lt;/i&gt; by Kai Cheng Thom is the highly sensational, ultra-exciting, sort-of true coming-of-age story of a young Asian trans girl, pathological liar, and kung-fu expert who runs away from her parents’ abusive home in a rainy city called Gloom. Striking off on her own, she finds her true family in a group of larger-than-life trans femmes who live in a mysterious pleasure district known only as the Street of Miracles. Under the wings of this fierce and fabulous flock, Dearly blossoms into the woman she has always dreamed of being, with a little help from the unscrupulous Doctor Crocodile. When one of their number is brutally murdered, the protagonist joins her sisters in forming a vigilante gang to fight back against the transphobes, violent johns, and cops that stalk the Street of Miracles. But when things go terribly wrong, she must find the truth within herself in order to stop the violence and discover what it really means to grow up and find your family.</description>

  <description>In the aftermath of a colossal battle, the future of the Seven Kingdoms hangs in the balance—beset by newly emerging threats from every direction. In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys’s claim to Westeros forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone—a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.</description>

  <description>The saga of the &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; TV series continues with this thrilling original novel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time has come to act. Following the destructive consequences of the Ware crisis, Admiral Jonathan Archer and Section 31 agent Trip Tucker both attempt to change their institutions to prevent further such tragedies. Archer pushes for a Starfleet directive of non-interference, but he faces opposition from allies within the fleet and unwelcome support from adversaries who wish to drive the Federation into complete isolationism. Meanwhile, Tucker plays a dangerous game against the corrupt leaders of Section 31, hoping to bring down their conspiracy once and for all. But is he willing to jeopardize Archer’s efforts—and perhaps the fate of an entire world—in order to win?</description>

  <description>The perfect companion piece to an enthralling new exhibition on the visionary work and fervent imagination of director Guillermo del Toro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2016, a new exhibit on the work of visionary director Guillermo del Toro will begin at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), before moving on to the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) and the Minneapolis Museum of Art (MIA). This book will be the perfect accompaniment to the exhibition, which focuses on del Toro’s creative process, including the well-defined themes that he obsessively returns to in all his films, the journals in which he logs his ideas, and the vast and inspiring collection of art and pop culture ephemera that he has amassed at his private “man cave,” Bleak House. Filled with imagery from the exhibit, including favorite pieces of art that del Toro has chosen for the exhibit, and pertinent journal pages, the book will further delve further into the director’s world through exclusive in-depth interviews and commentary from notable figures in the art world.

  <description>Here is the gorgeous and sinister story of Marius, patrician by birth, scholar by choice, one of the oldest vampires of them all, which sweeps from his genesis in ancient Rome, in the time of the Emperor Augustus, to his meeting in the present day with a creature of snow and ice. Thorne is a Northern vampire in search of Maharet, his 'maker', the ancient Egyptian vampire queen who holds him and others in thrall with chains made of her red hair, 'bound with steel and with her blood and gold'. When the Visigoths sack his city, Marius is there; with the resurgence of the glory that was Rome, he is there, still searching for his lost love Pandora, but bewitched in turn by Botticelli, the Renaissance beauty Bianca, with her sordid secrets, and the boy he calls Amadeo (otherwise known as the Vampire Armand). Criss-crossing through the stories of other vampires from Rice's glorious Pantheon of the undead, haunted by Pandora and by his alter ego Mael, tracked by the Talamasca, the tale of Marius, the self-styled guardian of 'those who must be kept' is the most wondrous and mind-blowing of them all.</description>

  <description>On the eve of World War Two, Nazi sorcerers come gunning for Cade but kill his family instead. His one path of vengeance is to become an apprentice of The Midnight Front—the Allies’ top-secret magickal warfare program—and become a sorcerer himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unsure who will kill him first—his allies, his enemies, or the demons he has to use to wield magick—Cade fights his way through occupied Europe and enemy lines. But he learns too late the true price of revenge will be more terrible than just the loss of his soul—and there’s no task harder than doing good with a power born of ultimate evil.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Farmer Giles of Ham&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fabulous tale of the days when giants and dragons walked the kingdom. Full of scholar's wit.&lt;/i&gt; - Sunday Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;By turns gay, prattling, melancholy nonsensical, mysterious. And what is most exciting and attractive about them is their superb technical skill. Professor Tolkien revealed in the verses scattered through &lt;b&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/b&gt; that he had a talent for songs, riddling rhymes, and a kind of balladry. In &lt;b&gt;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&lt;/b&gt; the talent can be seen to be something close to genius.&lt;/i&gt; - Anthony Thwaite, The Listener&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover illustration: Pauline Baynes</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;An original e-novella in the acclaimed Typhon Pact series! The Enterprise-E is on a diplomatic mission to the Talarian Republic, the last holdout in the Federation’s efforts to expand the Khitomer Accords in response to the emergence of the Typhon Pact. In the wake of Andor’s recent secession, the Federation is more concerned than ever with strengthening its alliances. The Talarians have been a tenuous potential partner at best, given the history of conflict and mistrust between them and the Federation. But the negotiations between Picard and the Talarians are disrupted by a growing public protest of those who are demanding greater rights—and before long, it becomes clear that the dissidents are not limiting themselves to nonviolent means….</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Starship Titan&lt;/i&gt; continues on her outward voyage of discovery in this latest exciting novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the United Federation of Planets still reels from Andor’s political decision that will forever affect the coalition, Captain William T. Riker and the crew of the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Titan &lt;/i&gt;are carrying out Starfleet’s renewed commitment to deep space exploration. While continuing to search the Beta Quadrant’s unknown expanses for an ancient civilization’s long-lost quick-terraforming technology— a potential boon to many Borg-ravaged worlds across the Federation and beyond—&lt;i&gt;Titan&lt;/i&gt;’s science specialists encounter the planet Ta’ith, home to the remnant of a once-great society that may hold the very secrets they seek. But this quest also takes &lt;i&gt;Titan &lt;/i&gt;perilously close to the deadly Vela Pulsar, the galaxy’s most prolific source of lethal radiation, potentially jeopardizing both the ship and what remains of the Ta’ithan civilization. Meanwhile, Will Riker finds himself on a collision course with the Federation Council and the Andorian government, both of which intend to deprive &lt;i&gt;Titan &lt;/i&gt;of its Andorian crew members. And one of those Andorians—Lieutenant Pava Ek’Noor sh’Aqaba—has just uncovered a terrible danger, which has been hiding in plain sight for more than two centuries. . . .</description>

  <description>Anne Rice's richly told new novel for the first time weaves together two irresistible worlds - the witches' world and the vampires' world - in a dance of seduction, death and rebirth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lestat's mesmerizing friend Louis de Pointe du Lac is tortured by the memory of the child vampire Claudia, whom he loved and lost. With the help of David Talbot, vampire and ultimate fixer from the secret Talamasca organization, Louis appeals to Merrick, the beautiful, mixed-race, illegitimate daughter of the New Orleans Mayfair clan. Merrick must use her black witchcraft to call up the ghost of Claudia - however dangerous this may be - and her search takes her close to the edge, through blood and terror, voodoo and violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweeping from New Orleans to the Guatemalan jungle, this is vampire literature at its most hypnotic, exotic and splendid.</description>

      <![CDATA[Emerson is clearly a Xenite but not someone who was given any special access or insight into the writer’s room. This book, again, has a number of anachronisms with the TV series. Characters like Atalanta, Meleager, and Arachne are presented here quite differently than they were on TV. This was a...]]>

  <description>The Full Circle Fleet has resumed its unprecedented explorations of the Delta Quadrant and former Borg space. Commander Liam O'Donnell of the U.S.S. Demeter makes a promising first contact with the Nihydron—humanoid aliens that are collectors of history. They rarely interact with the species they study but have created a massive database of numerous races, inhabited planets, and the current geopolitical landscape of a large swath of the quadrant. When an exchange of data is proposed via a formal meeting, the Nihydron representatives are visibly shaken when Admiral Kathryn Janeway greets them. For almost a century, two local species—the Rilnar and the Zahl—have fought for control of the nearby planet Sormana, with both sides claiming it as their ancestral homeworld. The shocking part is that for the last several years, the Rilnar have been steadily gaining ground, thanks to the tactics of their current commanding officer: a human woman, who appears to be none other than Kathryn Janeway herself...</description>

  <description>From award-winning and bestselling author Michael Redhill comes a darkly comic literary thriller about a woman who fears for her sanity--and then her life--when she learns that her doppelganger has appeared in a local park. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jean Mason has a doppelganger. At least, that's what people tell her. Apparently it hangs out in Kensington Market, where it sometimes buys churros and shops for hats. Jean doesn't rattle easy, not like she used to. She's a grown woman with a husband and two kids, as well as a thriving business, and Toronto is a fresh start for the whole family. She certainly doesn't want to get involved in anything dubious, but still . . . why would two different strangers swear up and down they'd just seen her--with shorter hair furthermore? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jean's curiosity quickly gets the better of her, and she visits the market, but sees no one who looks like her. The next day, she goes back to look again. And the day after that. Before she knows it, she's spending an hour here, an afternoon there, watching, taking notes, obsessing and getting scared. With the aid of a small army of locals who hang around in the market's only park, she expands her surveillance, making it known she'll pay for information or sightings. A peculiar collection of drug addicts, scam artists, philanthropists, philosophers and vagrants--the regulars of Bellevue Square--are eager to contribute to Jean's investigation. But when some of them start disappearing, it becomes apparent that her alleged double has a sinister agenda. Unless Jean stops her, she and everyone she cares about will face a fate stranger than death.</description>

  <description>Admiral Kathryn Janeway faces a tribunal determined to execute her for supposed crimes committed during Voyager’s maiden trek through the Delta Quadrant. Captain Chakotay knows that the Kinara, several species now allied against the Full Circle fleet, are not all they appear to be. The Confederacy of the Worlds of the First Quadrant—a pact he cannot trust—is his only hope for unraveling the Kinara’s true agenda and rescuing Admiral Janeway. Meanwhile, Seven and Tom Paris are forced to betray the trust of their superiors in a desperate bid to reveal the lengths to which a fellow officer has gone in the name of protecting the Federation from the legendary Caeliar.</description>

  <description>With &lt;i&gt;Pandora&lt;/i&gt;, Anne Rice began a magnificent new series of vampire novels. Now, in the second of her New Tales of the Vampires, she tells the mesmerizing story of Vittorio, a vampire in the Italian Age of Gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Educated in the Florence of Cosimo de' Medici, trained in knighthood at his father's mountaintop castle, Vittorio inhabits a world of courtly splendor and country pleasures - a world suddenly threatened when his entire family is confronted by an unholy power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the midst of this upheaval, Vittorio is seduced by the vampire Ursula, the most beautiful of his supernatural enemies. As he sets out in pursuit of vengeance, entering the nightmarish Court of the Ruby Grail, increasingly more enchanted (and confused) by his love for the mysterious Ursula, he finds himself facing demonic adversaries, war and political intrigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against a backdrop of the wonders - both sacred and profane - and the beauty and ferocity of Renaissance Italy, Anne Rice creates a passionate and tragic legend of doomed young love and lost innocence.</description>

  <description>Hercules and his comrades-in-arms, Iolaus, heed the desperate plea of a small village. A deadly sea monster has been terrorizing the townsfolk, and only the great strength of Hercules can save them. But the duo is in for a deadly shock, for as powerful as the sea serpent is, something far greater waits in the shadow. An old enemy who wants Hercules dead--once and for all.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is better than the first book in this series. Boggs has clearly seen more episodes of the TV series by this point which has greatly improved his characterization of Hercules. This book also includes Iolaus who was missed in the first book. I enjoyed the early scenes with Hercules' mother, Al...]]>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The time: the waning years of the 1990s at the dawn of the millennium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The place: an isolated rural town called Auburn, which could be anywhere at all—a town where everyone knows everyone else—where dark secrets run through its veins like blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows that sixteen-year old Mikey Childress is “different.” A target for bullies since he was a small boy, everything Mikey does attracts abuse: the way he walks, the way he talks, the way he looks. Everyone knows he’s not like the other boys in Auburn—the boys who play hockey, who fight, the boys who pursue girls. Only his friend Wroxy, a girl almost as isolated as he is, can even guess at the edges of his pain, or the depths of his yearning for love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even the people who hate Mikey couldn’t dream of how many secrets he has, or how badly he could hurt them if he wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the night Mikey is pushed beyond endurance by his abusers. The night he makes a pact with dark forces older than time to visit a terrible vengeance on his enemies. The night he inadvertently opens a doorway that should never, ever have been opened, and unleashes something into the world that should have remained damned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Michael Rowe, the Shirley Jackson Award-nominated author of &lt;i&gt;Wild Fell&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Enter, Night&lt;/i&gt; comes a Faustian tale of the horrific cost of the murder of innocence in a small town, and of the vicious price extracted for the ultimate revenge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In the latest installment of The Vampire Chronicles, Anne Rice summons up dazzling worlds to bring us the story of Armand–eternally young, with the face of a Botticelli angel. Armand, who first appeared in all his dark glory more than twenty years ago in the now-classic Interview with the Vampire, the first of The Vampire Chronicles, the novel that established its author worldwide as a magnificent storyteller and creator of magical realms.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, we go with Armand across the centuries to the Kiev Rus of his boyhood–a ruined city under Mongol dominion–and to ancient Constantinople, where Tartar raiders sell him into slavery. And in a magnificent palazzo in the Venice of the Renaissance we see him emotionally and intellectually in thrall to the great vampire Marius, who masquerades among humankind as a mysterious, reclusive painter and who will bestow upon Armand the gift of vampiric blood.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the novel races to its climax, moving through scenes of luxury and elegance, of ambush, fire, and devil worship to nineteenth-century Paris and today’s New Orleans, we see its eternally vulnerable and romantic hero forced to choose between his twilight immortality and the salvation of his immortal soul.</description>

  <description>When powerful real-estate tycoon Nero Golden immigrates to the States under mysterious circumstances, he and his three adult children assume new identities, taking 'Roman' names, and move into a grand mansion in downtown Manhattan. Arriving shortly after the inauguration of Barack Obama, he and his sons, each extraordinary in his own right, quickly establish themselves at the apex of New York society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of the powerful Golden family is told from the point of view of their Manhattanite neighbour and confidant, René, an aspiring filmmaker who finds in the Goldens the perfect subject. René chronicles the undoing of the house of Golden: the high life of money, of art and fashion, a sibling quarrel, an unexpected metamorphosis, the arrival of a beautiful woman, betrayal and murder, and far away, in their abandoned homeland, some decent intelligence work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invoking literature, pop culture, and the cinema, Rushdie spins the story of the American zeitgeist over the last eight years, hitting every beat: the rise of the birther movement, the Tea Party, Gamergate and identity politics; the backlash against political correctness; the ascendency of the superhero movie, and, of course, the insurgence of a ruthlessly ambitious, narcissistic, media-savvy villain wearing make-up and with coloured hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a new world order of alternative truths, Salman Rushdie has written the ultimate novel about identity, truth, terror and lies. A brilliant, heartbreaking realist novel that is not only uncannily prescient but shows one of the world’s greatest storytellers working at the height of his powers.</description>

  <description>An original novel set in the universe of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: Voyager&lt;/i&gt;; and the sequel to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller &lt;i&gt;Protectors&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admiral Kathryn Janeway has now taken command of the Full Circle Fleet. Her first mission: return to the Delta Quadrant and open diplomatic relations with the Confederacy of the Worlds of the First Quadrant, a civilization whose power rivals that of the Federation. Captain Chakotay knows that his choices could derail the potential alliance. While grateful to the Confederacy Interstellar Fleet for rescuing the Federation starships from an alien armada, &lt;i&gt;Voyager&lt;/i&gt;'s captain cannot forget the horrors upon which the Confederacy was founded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More troubling, it appears that several of &lt;i&gt;Voyager&lt;/i&gt;'s old adversaries have formed a separate and unlikely pact that is determined to bring down the Confederacy at all costs. Sins of the past haunt the crew members of the Full Circle Fleet as they attempt to chart a course for the future. Will they learn much too late that some sins can never be forgiven... or forgotten?</description>

      <![CDATA[This was obviously written fairly early in the series run. Emerson refers to Xena's horse as a "he" and the characterization of Gabrielle is that of a teenaged chatterbox. Emerson also refers to Xena's chakram as a "shakra". <br /><br />This story cannot be canon. It would have to take place after "Beware Gr...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An all-original novel based upon the explosive new series on CBS All Access&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aboard the Starship Shenzhou, Lieutenant Michael Burnham, a human woman raised and educated among Vulcans, is promoted to acting first officer. But if she wants to keep the job, she must prove to Captain Philippa Georgiou that she deserves to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She gets her chance when the Shenzhou must protect a Federation colony that is under attack by an ancient alien vessel that has surfaced from the deepest fathoms of the planet’s dark, uncharted sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the menace from this mysterious vessel grows stronger, Starfleet declares the colony expendable in the name of halting the threat. To save thousands of innocent lives, Burnham must infiltrate the alien ship. But to do so, she needs to face the truth of her troubled past, and seek the aid of a man she has tried to avoid her entire life—until now.</description>

  <description>An all-new novel that continues the epic saga of the Starship &lt;i&gt;Voyager&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the destruction of four fleet vessels at the hands of the Omega Continuum, the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Voyager&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Demeter&lt;/i&gt; set course for a region of the Delta Quadrant far beyond any­thing previously explored. Captain Chakotay is determined to prove to Starfleet Command that the fleet’s ongoing mission is vital to Federation interests . . . and the key to doing so may lie in a distress call &lt;i&gt;Voyager&lt;/i&gt; received nine years earlier but could not investigate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Vice Admiral Kathryn Janeway is recalled to the Alpha Quadrant for an evaluation period to determine her next assignment. Given the trauma she has recently endured, Admiral Akaar, Starfleet’s commander in chief, is questioning Janeway’s fitness to command the fleet. Janeway’s primary concern remains the fleet’s safety— for their mission to continue, she must find a way to secure the resources they require. But the uncertainty of her superior officers has left her powerless to act in their best interests.</description>

  <description>Anne Rice, creator of the Vampire Lestat, the Mayfair witches and the amazing worlds they inhabit, now gives us the first in a new series of novels linked together by the fledgling vampire David Talbot, who has set out to become a chronicler of his fellow Undead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The novel opens in present-day Paris in a crowded café, where David meets Pandora. She is two thousand years old, a Child of the Millennia, the first vampire ever made by the great Marius. David persuades her to tell the story of her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pandora begins, reluctantly at first and then with increasing passion, to recount her mesmerizing tale, which takes us through the ages, from Imperial Rome to eighteenth-century France to twentieth-century Paris and New Orleans. She carries us back to her mortal girlhood in the world of Caesar Augustus, a world chronicled by Ovid and Petronius. This is where Pandora meets and falls in love with the handsome, charismatic, lighthearted, still-mortal Marius. This is the Rome she is forced to flee in fear of assassination by conspirators plotting to take over the city. And we follow her to the exotic port of Antioch, where she is destined to be reunited with Marius, now immortal and haunted by his vampire nature, who will bestow on her the Dark Gift as they set out on the fraught and fantastic adventure of their two turbulent centuries together.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the #1 international best seller &lt;i&gt;The Girl in the Spider's Web:&lt;/i&gt; the new book in the Millennium series, which began with Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisbeth Salander - the girl with the dragon tattoo, the brilliant hacker, the obstinate outsider, the volatile seeker of justice for herself and others - has never been able to uncover the most telling facts of her traumatic childhood, the secrets that might finally, fully explain her to herself. Now, when she sees a chance to uncover them once and for all, she enlists the help of Mikael Blomkvist, the editor of the muckraking, investigative journal &lt;i&gt;Millennium&lt;/i&gt;. And nothing will stop her - not the anti-Muslim gang she enrages by rescuing a young woman from their brutality; not the deadly reach from inside the Russian mafia of her long-lost twin sister, Camilla; and not the people who will do anything to keep buried knowledge of a sinister pseudo-scientific experiment known only as The Registry. Once again, Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist, together, are the fierce heart of a thrilling full-tilt novel that takes on some of the most insidious problems facing the world at this very moment.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is my least favourite entry in this series. It tries to be something very contemporary by constantly mentioning the rise of populism, fascism, racism, and the culture of lies and fake news that we live in but the story fails to really connect on a meaningful level with any of those concepts....]]>

  <description>In a world of soaring continents and bottomless skies, where a burgeoning new science lifts skyships into the cloud-strewn heights and ancient blood-borne sorceries cling to a fading glory, Princess Isabelle des Zephyrs is about to be married to a man she has barely heard of, the second son of a dying king in an empire collapsing into civil war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born without the sorcery that is her birthright but with a perspicacious intellect, Isabelle believes her marriage will stave off disastrous conflict and bring her opportunity and influence. But the last two women betrothed to this prince were murdered, and a sorcerer-assassin is bent on making Isabelle the third. Aided and defended by her loyal musketeer, Jean-Claude, Isabelle plunges into a great maze of prophecy, intrigue, and betrayal, where everyone wears masks of glamour and lies. Step by dangerous step, she unravels the lies of her enemies and discovers a truth more perilous than any deception.</description>

  <description>On a diplomatic mission to the planet Andor, Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise-E bear witness to the rank devastation resulting from the Borg invasion. With the reproductive issues that have long plagued the Andorian people reaching crisis level, avenues of research that at first held great promise have proven largely unhelpful, and may well indeed be worsening the problem.&lt;br /&gt;Despite the Federation's seeming inability to provide assistance and growing doubt over its commitment to a staunch, longtime ally, Andorian scientists now offer renewed hope for a solution. However, many segments of Andorian society are protesting this controversial new approach, and more radical sects are beginning to make their displeasure known by any means available. In response, President Nanietta Bacco has sent the Enterprise crew and a team of diplomats and scientists to Andor to convene a summit, in the hope of demonstrating that the Federation's pledge to helping Andor is sincere. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Typhon Pact is watching, and their interests may very well lead the Andorian people down an even more treacherous path. . . .</description>

  <description>In the fifth Vampire Chronicle, Lestat is searching for Dora, the beautiful and charismatic mortal daughter of a drug lord. Dora has moved Lestat like no other mortal ever has, and he cannot get her out of his visions. At the same time, he is increasingly aware that the Devil knows who he is and wants something from him. While torn betwen his vampire world and his passion for Dora, Lestat is sucked in by Memnoch, who claims to be the Devil himself. Memnoch presents Lestat with unimagined opportunities: to witness creation, to visit purgatory, to be treated like a prophet. Lestat faces a choice between the Devil or God. Whom does he believe in? Who does he serve? What are the element of religious belief? Lestat finds himself caught in a whirlpool of the ultimate choice</description>

      <![CDATA[Published in 1998, halfway through the run of the series, this book is everything you'd want in a TV companion. Weisbrot interviews many members of the production team and crew as well as cast members. He does a good job of covering the origins of the series and linking the episodes to the myths...]]>

  <description>The conclusion to the epic trilogy that stretches from the earliest voyages of the Starship &lt;i&gt;Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; to Captain Kirk’s historic five-year-mission—and from one universe to another—just in time for the milestone 50th anniversary of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: The Original Series&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eighteen years ago, the Starship&lt;i&gt; Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; thwarted an alien invasion from another universe, and Captain Robert April took possession of the interdimensional transfer device that made it possible. Since then, each captain of the &lt;i&gt;Enterprise,&lt;/i&gt; from Christopher Pike to James T. Kirk, has guarded this secret with his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Romulan agents have succeeded in stealing the device and using it to banish Ambassador Sarek and Councillor Gorkon to an unknown realm in the midst of their groundbreaking Federation-Klingon peace negotiations. With time running out as interstellar war looms in one universe—and alien forces marshal in another—will Captain Kirk and his crew preserve the tenuous peace and reclaim the key between the dimensions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;™, ®, &amp;amp; © 2016 CBS Studios, Inc.

      <![CDATA[This was a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. I really enjoyed that the authors gave Uhura, Chekov, and Sulu moments to show off their tech skills and shine. I always like to see Sarek and Amanda so I was glad they had a role to play here. It was also fun to finally see a Klingon woman in comm...]]>

  <description>Just in time for the milestone 50th Anniversary of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: The Original Series&lt;/i&gt;, an epic new trilogy that stretches from the earliest voyages of the Starship&lt;i&gt; Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; to Captain Kirk’s historic five-year-mission—and from one universe to another!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A debt of honor: One brave woman ventures alone into a parallel universe to save her old shipmates, exiled there decades earlier by a mysterious device called the Transfer Key. She soon learns the alternate universe harbors not just an alien invasion force, but a secret that underpins its very existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A mission of peace: A long-awaited Klingon-Federation peace conference convenes, led by Ambassador Sarek of Vulcan and Councillor Gorkon of Qo’noS. But both sides have enemies who would prefer the two great powers remain at war—and who will do anything to make certain hate wins the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; An errand of justice: Captain Kirk and his crew seek the stolen Transfer Key that opens a door between universes, but their hunt is cut short by Ambassador Sarek’s plea for help. The &lt;i&gt;Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; crew soon becomes targets in a deadly crossfire—one whose outcome will decide the fate of two universes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ™, ®, &amp;amp; © 2016 CBS Studios, Inc.

  <description>An epic new trilogy begins—a tie-in for the milestone fiftieth anniversary of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: The Original Series&lt;/i&gt;—that stretches from the earliest voyages of the Starship&lt;i&gt; Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; to Captain Kirk’s historic five-year-mission…and from one universe to another!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hidden aboard the U.S.S. &lt;i&gt;Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; is a secret that has been passed from captain to captain, from Robert April to Christopher Pike to James T. Kirk. Now the return of the enigmatic woman once known as Number One has brought that secret to light, and Kirk and his crew must risk everything to finish a mission that began with April so many years ago…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly two decades earlier, April and his crew first visited the planet Usilde, where they found both tragedy and a thorny moral dilemma. Today, the legacy of that fateful occasion will compel Kirk to embark on a risky voyage back to that forbidden world—which is now deep in territory claimed by the Klingon Empire!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;™, ®, &amp;amp; © 2016 CBS Studios, Inc.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Daughter of immortals.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Princess Diana longs to prove herself to her legendary warrior sisters. But when the opportunity finally comes, she throws away her chance at glory and breaks Amazon law—risking exile—to save a mortal. Diana will soon learn that she has rescued no ordinary girl, and that with this single brave act, she may have doomed the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Daughter of death.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alia Keralis just wanted to escape her overprotective brother with a semester at sea. She doesn’t know she is being hunted by people who think her very existence could spark a world war. When a bomb detonates aboard her ship, Alia is rescued by a mysterious girl of extraordinary strength and forced to confront a horrible truth: Alia is a Warbringer—a direct descendant of the infamous Helen of Troy, fated to bring about an age of bloodshed and misery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Together.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two girls will face an army of enemies—mortal and divine—determined to either destroy or possess the Warbringer. Tested beyond the bounds of their abilities, Diana and Alia must find a way to unleash hidden strengths and forge an unlikely alliance. Because if they have any hope of saving both their worlds, they will have to stand side by side against the tide of war.</description>

      <![CDATA[There's not much story in this volume. It's still entertaining. I enjoy Catula and the introduction of Atheen-owl was fun. It was light on the titular character and the giant cat toy was a bit much for me. I'm still looking forward to volume three.]]>

  <description>Still on Romulus in pursuit of his goal of reunifying the Vulcans and Romulans, Spock finds himself in the middle of a massive power struggle. In the wake of the assassination of the Praetor and the Senate, the Romulans have cleaved in two. While Empress Donatra has led her nascent Imperial Romulan State to establish relations with the Federation, Praetor Tal’aura has guided the original Romulan Star Empire toward joining the newly formed Typhon Pact. But numerous factions within the two Romulan nations vie for power and undivided leadership, and Machiavellian plots unfold as forces within and without the empires conduct high-stakes political maneuvers. &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, four years after Benjamin Sisko returned from the Celestial Temple, circumstances have changed, his hopes for a peaceful life on Bajor with his wife and daughter beginning to slip away. After temporarily rejoining Starfleet for an all-hands-on-deck battle against the Borg, he must consider an offer to have him return for a longer stint. Beset by troubling events, he seeks spiritual guidance, facing demons new and old, including difficult memories from his time in the last Federation-Tzenkethi war.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In a gripping feat of storytelling, Anne Rice continues the extraordinary Vampire Chronicles that began with the now-classic &lt;i&gt;Interview with the Vampire&lt;/i&gt;. For centuries, Lestat—vampire-hero, enchanter, seducer of mortals—has been a courted prince in the dark and flourishing universe of the living dead. Now he is alone. And in his overwhelming need to destroy his doubts and his loneliness, Lestat embarks on the most dangerous enterprise he has undertaken in all the years of his haunted existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;The Tale of the Body Thief&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Tinged with mystery, full of drama . . . The story is involving, the twists surprising.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “Rice is our modern messenger of the occult, whose nicely updated dark-side passion plays twist and turn in true Gothic form.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Fast-paced . . . . mesmerizing . . . silkenly sensuous . . . No one writing today matches her deftness with the erotic.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Hypnotic . . . masterful.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;Cosmopolitan&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Paperback edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Scarborough is a low-income, culturally diverse neighborhood east of Toronto, the fourth largest city in North America; like many inner city communities, it suffers under the weight of poverty, drugs, crime, and urban blight. &lt;i&gt;Scarborough&lt;/i&gt; the novel employs a multitude of voices to tell the story of a tight-knit neighborhood under fire: among them, Victor, a black artist harassed by the police; Winsum, a West Indian restaurant owner struggling to keep it together; and Hina, a Muslim school worker who witnesses first-hand the impact of poverty on education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there are the three kids who work to rise above a system that consistently fails them: Bing, a gay Filipino boy who lives under the shadow of his father's mental illness; Sylvie, Bing's best friend, a Native girl whose family struggles to find a permanent home to live in; and Laura, whose history of neglect by her mother is destined to repeat itself with her father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scarborough&lt;/i&gt; offers a raw yet empathetic glimpse into a troubled community that locates its dignity in unexpected places: a neighborhood that refuses to be undone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Catherine Hernandez&lt;/b&gt; is a queer theatre practitioner and writer who has lived in Scarborough off and on for most of her life. Her plays &lt;i&gt;Singkil&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kilt Pins&lt;/i&gt; were published by Playwrights Canada Press, and her children's book &lt;i&gt;M is for Mustache: A Pride ABC Book&lt;/i&gt; was published by Flamingo Rampant. She is the Artistic Director of Sulong Theatre for women of color.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Shortly after revealing its union with the Federation’s newest adversary—a coalition of galactic powers known as the Typhon Pact—the Gorn Hegemony suffers an ecological disaster that destroys the hatchery world of their critically important warrior caste. Fortunately, the Gorn had already been investigating traces of an ancient but powerful “quick terraforming” technology left behind by a long-vanished civilization. This technology, should it prove controllable, promises to restore their delicate biological and social status quo. But when a Gorn soldier prepares to use the technology to reshape the planet Hranrar into a new warrior-caste spawning ground, threatening to extinguish the native Hranrarii, he draws the unwanted attention of a mad Gorn trooper determined to bring the military caste into dominance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Titan &lt;/i&gt;embarks upon a search for this potent technology in the hope of using it to heal the wounds the Federation sustained during the recent Borg crisis, Captain Riker must balance his responsibility for his crew’s safety against the welfare of the Hranrarii and his duty to the Prime Directive. With a menacing Typhon Pact fleet nipping at his heels, Riker must not only stop the Gorn warriors but also plumb the secrets of an ancient terraforming artifact. But of everyone serving aboard &lt;i&gt;Titan&lt;/i&gt;, Commander Tuvok may be the only one who understands how dangerous such planet-altering technology can be, even when used with the best of intentions. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Michael Crichton's recently discovered novel—an adventure set in the Wild West during the golden age of fossil hunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 1876. Warring Indian tribes still populate America's western territories, even as lawless gold-rush towns begin to mark the landscape, and two paleontologists pillage the Wild West, hunting for dinosaur fossils while surveilling, deceiving, and sabotaging each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Into this treacherous territory plunges William Johnson, a student who has joined world-renowned paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh on his latest expedition. But when Marsh becomes convinced that William is spying for his nemesis, Edwin Drinker Cope, he abandons him in Cheyenne, Wyoming, a locus of crime and vice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William joins forces with Cope and soon stumbles upon a discovery of historic proportions. With this extraordinary treasure, however, comes exceptional danger, and Johnson's newfound resilience will be sorely tested..</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a fun summer read. It's very uncomplicated and simple but entertaining. It does a good job of fictionalizing the early dinosaur fossil hunters in the US. I have a feeling that Crichton would have done more work on it before he published it but it's still a nice contribution to his legacy...]]>

  <description>Headline: A peak behind the Hollywood mask by one of its foremost makeup artists In Hollywood's heyday, almost every major studio had a Westmore heading up the makeup department. Since 1917, there has never been a time when Westmores weren't shaping the visages of stardom. For their century-long dedication to the art of makeup, the Westmores were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2008. In this lively memoir, Michael Westmore not only regales us with tales of Hollywood's golden age, but also from his own career where he notably transformed Sylvester Stallone into Rocky Balboa and Robert DiNiro into Jake LaMotta, among many other makeup miracles. Westmore's talent as a makeup artist first became apparent when he created impenetrable disguises for Kirk Douglas, Tony Curtis, Burt Lancaster, Robert Mitchum, and Frank Sinatra for the 1963 film The List of Adrian Messenger. He later went on to become the preferred makeup man for Bobby Darin and Elizabeth Taylor, and worked on such movies and TV shows as The Munsters, Rosemary's Baby, Eleanor and Franklin, New York, New York, 2010: A Space Odyssey, and Mask, for which he won an academy award. The next phase of his career was to create hundreds of alien characters for over 600 episodes of Star Trek in all its iterations, from The Next Generation to Enterprise. Replete with anecdotes about Hollywood and its stars, from Bette Davis's preference for being made-up in the nude to Shelley Winters's habit of nipping from a "little bottle" while on the set, Makeup Man will satisfy any Hollywood's fan's appetite for gossip or a behind-the-scenes look at how tinsel town's most iconic film characters were created. Academy Award-winning Michael Westmore has been making up the stars for over fifty years. He frequently appears on the SyFy channel show Face Off with his daughter McKenzie Westmore.</description>

  <description>The Haunted Mansion is one of the most popular and beloved attractions in Disney theme park history, and can be found in each Magic Kingdom Park around the globe. This newly updated book brings the Mansion's inhabitants to an afterlife like never before. &lt;em&gt;Magic Kingdom's Haunted Mansion&lt;/em&gt; illustrates how the Mansion's 999 "grim grinning ghosts" moved from sketches to reality, evolving from earliest story concepts through adaptations and changes as it moved into each of the parks, to the very latest ideas for show enhancements. This book also confirms and dispels the various myths and rumors that have surrounded the mysterious Mansion since its opening. And now new history has been added as the attraction continues to evolve. In this third edition, there are even more details and artwork depicting the imagineering of the attractions in California and Florida, as well as the corresponding Haunted Mansion attractions in Paris, Hong Hong, and Tokyo.</description>

  <description>A spy for the Typhon Pact—a new political rival of the Federation—steals the plans for Starfleet’s newest technological advance: the slipstream drive. To stop the Typhon Pact from unlocking the drive’s secrets, Starfleet Intelligence recruits a pair of genetically enhanced agents: Dr. Julian Bashir, of station Deep Space 9, and Sarina Douglas, a woman whose talents Bashir helped bring to fruition, and whom Bashir thinks of as his long-lost true love.&lt;p&gt;Bashir and Douglas are sent to infiltrate the mysterious species known as the Breen, find the hidden slipstream project, and destroy it. Meanwhile, light-years away, Captain Ezri Dax and her crew on the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Aventine&lt;/i&gt; play a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a Typhon Pact fleet that stands between them and the safe retrieval of Bashir and Douglas from hostile territory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>It is 1991 when Ethan Jones finally wins the role of his dreams in an upcoming, big screen movie. With the envelope holding the script clutched in his hand, he arrives at his California apartment where he can hardly wait to tell his live-in girlfriend the exciting news. But when he finds the door unexpectedly ajar, he has no idea that in just a few seconds, the life he has fought so hard to obtain will be shattered. Eight years earlier, Ethan is attending university in Ottawa, Canada. One evening after seriously contemplating suicide, he finds his way into a club where he meets Mila Monahan, a beautiful acting student who saves him from himself. After he watches Mila rehearse a university play, Ethan catches the acting bug and decides to pursue his own creative passions, causing a collision with his more secure ideals. But when Mila suddenly disappears, Ethan vows he will never stop chasing the dream she inspired in him believing in a world entirely different from the one he is living in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Actor is a gripping tale of rejection, hardship, tragedy, and overwhelming joy as one man embarks on an unforgettable journey of self-discovery learning to portray anything he can imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight years earlier, Ethan is attending university in Ottawa, Canada.

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Introducing an instant classic—master storyteller Neil Gaiman presents a dazzling version of the great Norse myths.&lt;/p&gt;Neil Gaiman has long been inspired by ancient mythology in creating the fantastical realms of his fiction. Now he turns his attention back to the source, presenting a bravura rendition of the great northern tales. In &lt;em&gt;Norse Mythology&lt;/em&gt;, Gaiman fashions primeval stories into a novelistic arc that begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds; delves into the exploits of the deities, dwarves, and giants; and culminates in Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods and the rebirth of a new time and people. Gaiman stays true to the myths while vividly reincarnating Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin’s son, incredibly strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki, the son of giants, a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator. From Gaiman’s deft and witty prose emerges the gods with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to dupe others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Librarian's note: See alternate cover edition of ASIN B01HQA6EOC &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39673345-norse-mythology" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a wonderful retelling of some of the most famous Norse myths. It is full of all the humour and insight that I have come to appreciate in Neil Gaiman's work and I'm sure it will introduce a whole new generation to these ancient stories.]]>

  <description>Returning to the hypnotic world she so brilliantly created in &lt;b&gt;Interview with the Vampire&lt;/b&gt;, Anne Rice demonstrates once again her power to enthrall.  With the same richness of drama, atmosphere and incident, she tells the fantastic story of the vampire Lestat, whom we first perceived as the seductive devil-vampire of &lt;b&gt;Interview with the Vampire&lt;/b&gt; and whom we now follow through the ages as he searches for the origin and meaning of his own dark immortality.  And who, more and more, engages our sympathy until he stands revealed as a questing romantic, a vampire-hero with his own strange and passionate courage and morality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the novel opens, Lestat, having risen from the earth after a fifty-five years' sleep,  and infatuated with the modern world, presents himself in all his vampire brilliance as a rock star, a superstar, a seducer of millions.  And, in this blaze of adulation, daring to break the vampire oath of silence, he determines to tell his story, to rouse the generations of the living dead from their slumbers and to penetrate the riddle of his own existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he speaks we are plunged back into eighteenth-century France, into the castle where we meet the young Lestat: child of impoverished aristocrats, heroic hunter of wolves, at odds with his tyrannical father, running away to join a traveling troupe of actors.  We see him in the licentious Paris of the day, first apprentice at a boulevard theater, then its most celebrated actor, idolized, adored by many and--night after night--watched by one . . . until, in a sleep filled with dreams of the wolves he killed as a boy, he is shocked awake by a dark figure and suddenly, horribly, eternally joined to the unholy brotherhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We follow Lestat as he searches for others like him--in churches and brothels, in gambling houses, huts and palaces--sometimes joined by the vampire-angel Gabrielle, who is bound to him both by blood and by passion; sometimes traveling with his adored Nicolas, the violinist whose music and beauty are equally transcendent.  We follow Lestat as he travels from the snowcapped mountains of the Auvergne and the primeval forest of ancient Gaul to Sicily, Istanbul, Venice and Cairo, searching for his origins, sometimes finding clues to the birth of the vampire race, knowing always that the central truth eludes him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all the while, throughout his travels, through many lands and many times, Lestat has made enemies among his brethren--vampires who are in terror of his questions, who fear he will disturb the uneasy balance in which they exist with the mortal world, and who suspect in him a desire to rule.  And when, in the caves below a craggy Greek island, in a sanctuary whose walls are covered with gold-flecked murals, the very first of the living dead awake, the truth at the heart of his quest is at last revealed.  Ancient forces held immobile through the ages are irreversibly set in motion, and as the novel rushes to its stunning climax, Lestat's vampire foes converge in pursuit of him on the demonic freeways of the twentieth century.</description>

  <description>Carrie Fisher's first novel is set within the world she knows better than anyone else: Hollywood, the all-too-real fantasyland of drug users and deal makers. This stunning literary debut chronicles Suzanne Vale's vivid, excruciatingly funny experiences---from the rehab clinic to life in the outside world. Sparked by Suzanne's---and Carrie's---deliciously wry sense of the absurd, &lt;i&gt;Postcards from the Edge &lt;/i&gt;is a revealing look at the dangers and delights of all our addictions, from success and money to sex and insecurity.</description>

  <description>In keeping with Michael’s widely respected mentorship of up-and-coming writers, “Fade In: The Making of Star Trek - Insurrection” has been published as a textbook that can also be enjoyed as a coffee table book - full of exclusive, never before seen photos and commentary - for the enjoyment of Star Trek fans around the world. Written by Michael Piller, who has been variously described as a “writer’s writer” and the man who played a major role in saving the Star Trek franchise, here is the very inside story of the writing process that resulted in the franchise’s 1998 film Star Trek: Insurrection. Certainly for Star Trek fans – of which there are legions – and students of film and television, this is a sought-after look at the screenwriting process from concept to final film script through the inclusion of treatments, story meetings, storyboards, and the moving of the Trek characters on the resultant creative chessboard. Fans, hungry for this kind of rare access, may well be thoroughly engrossed in and entertained by the book; whereas students of writing for television and film will definitely benefit from this textbook as not only reference material but also as a bona fide annotated resource on this particular film and/or on the entire Star Trek oeuvre, in general.</description>

  <description>Henry Kyllo is a member of a secret society called the Inferne Cutis. A Runner whose goal is to achieve full-body lead content. He is chased through the city every day by Hunters whose goal is to shoot the Runners — with the threat to both sides that if they do not participate, through a mysterious force no one understands, one of their loved ones will simply vanish from the face of the earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumours abound about what happens when a Runner achieves “ascension”, but it has supposedly never happened before, so no one knows for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that it has happened before. And it is happening again. This time, to Henry Kyllo.</description>

  <description>The international publishing sensation—over two million copies sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A reluctant centenarian much like Forrest Gump (if Gump were an explosives expert with a fondness for vodka) decides it’s not too late to start over …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a long and eventful life, Allan Karlsson ends up in a nursing home, believing it to be his last stop. The only problem is that he’s still in good health, and in one day, he turns 100. A big celebration is in the works, but Allan really isn’t interested (and he’d like a bit more control over his vodka consumption). So he decides to escape. He climbs out the window in his slippers and embarks on a hilarious and entirely unexpected journey, involving, among other surprises, a suitcase stuffed with cash, some unpleasant criminals, a friendly hot-dog stand operator, and an elephant (not to mention a death by elephant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be the adventure of a lifetime for anyone else, but Allan has a larger-than-life backstory: Not only has he witnessed some of the most important events of the twentieth century, but he has actually played a key role in them. Starting out in munitions as a boy, he somehow finds himself involved in many of the key explosions of the twentieth century and travels the world, sharing meals and more with everyone from Stalin, Churchill, and Truman to Mao, Franco, and de Gaulle. Quirky and utterly unique, The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared has charmed readers across the world.</description>

  <description>Among the many "how-to" playwriting books that have appeared over the years, there have been few that attempt to analyze the mysteries of play construction. Lajos Egri's classic, &lt;i&gt;The Art of Dramatic Writing&lt;/i&gt;, does just that, with instruction that can be applied equally well to a short story, novel, or screenplay. &lt;br /&gt;Examining a play from the inside out, Egri starts with the heart of any drama: its characters. All good dramatic writing hinges on people and their relationships, which serve to move the story forward and give it life, as well as an understanding of human motives - why people act the way that they do. Using examples from everything from William Shakespeare's &lt;i&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/i&gt; to Henrik Ibsen's &lt;i&gt;A Doll's House&lt;/i&gt;, Egri shows how it is essential for the author to have a basic premise - a thesis, demonstrated in terms of human behavior - and to develop the dramatic conflict on the basis of that behavior.&lt;br /&gt;Using Egri's ABCs of premise, character, and conflict, &lt;i&gt;The Art of Dramatic Writing&lt;/i&gt; is a direct, jargon-free approach to the problem of achieving truth in writing.</description>

  <description>The #1 New York Times Bestseller. Set amid the civil rights movement, the never-before-told true story of NASA’s African-American female mathematicians who played a crucial role in America’s space program. Before Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, a group of professionals worked as ‘Human Computers’, calculating the flight paths that would enable these historic achievements. Among these were a coterie of bright, talented African-American women. Segregated from their white counterparts, these ‘coloured computers’ used pencil and paper to write the equations that would launch rockets and astronauts, into space. Moving from World War II through NASA’s golden age, touching on the civil rights era, the Space Race, the Cold War and the women’s rights movement, ‘Hidden Figures’ interweaves a rich history of mankind’s greatest adventure with the intimate stories of five courageous women whose work forever changed the world.</description>

  <description>At the novel's center: the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt, hero, leader, inspirer, irresistible force, irrepressible spirit, battling (and ultimately reconciling with) a strange otherworldly form that has somehow taken possession of Lestat's undead body and soul. This ancient and mysterious power and unearthly spirit of vampire lore has all the force, history, and insidious reach of the unknowable Universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is through this spirit, previously considered benign for thousands of vampire years and throughout the Vampire Chronicles, that we come to be told the hypnotic tale of a great sea power of ancient times; a mysterious heaven on earth situated on a boundless continent--and of how and why, and in what manner and with what far-reaching purpose, this force came to build and rule the great legendary empire of centuries ago that thrived in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as we learn of the mighty, far-reaching powers and perfections of this lost kingdom of Atalantaya, the lost realms of Atlantis, we come to understand its secrets, and how and why the vampire Lestat, indeed all the vampires, must reckon so many millennia later with the terrifying force of this ageless, all-powerful Atalantaya spirit.</description>

I love taking my time with them to savour the experience. <br /><br />Like Prince Lestat, this volume brings together the huge cast of characters we have met over the last 40 years in The Vampire Chronicles.

  <description>Freed with a thought, the greatest menace to humanity, the Borg, are gone, absorbed into the Caeliar gestalt. But are they? Can this deadly menace that has hovered over humanity for decades truly be gone? Might some shadow of the Caeliar remain? The Federation decides that they have to know, and Starfleet is ordered to find out. &lt;p&gt; The &lt;i&gt;Starship Voyager&lt;/i&gt; leads a fleet into a region of space that has lived in fear of instant annihilation for generations: the Delta quadrant, home of the Borg. Afsarah Eden -- the new captain of &lt;i&gt;Voyager -- &lt;/i&gt;is charged with getting answers, to reach out to possible allies and resolve old enmities in the Delta quadrant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The perfection that was given to the Borg was withheld from Seven of Nine. Left behind, she is living a twilight existence -- neither Borg nor human -- and slowly going mad. The whispers of the Collective, comforting murmurs she has always known, are replaced with a voice deep within her that keeps insisting she is Annika Hansen. Chakotay, the former captain of &lt;i&gt;Voyager,&lt;/i&gt; offers to help Seven rendezvous with the ships that Starfleet Command has sent into the Delta quadrant, the probable destination of the mysterious Caeliar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These are not the friendly stars of the Federation; the unknown and the unexpected are the everyday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He's fast. She's furious. They're in for the ride of their lives.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Rising star Roxanne St. Claire puts the pedal to the metal in a story of intrigue and passion that will get your heart racing! &lt;br /&gt; When sexy NASCAR racer Beau Lansing tracks down high society debutante Celeste Bennett, it's a matter of life or death. Stunned at the secret Beau reveals, Celeste is forced to make a life-altering decision. But with her love life on the skids and her family life in a tailspin, escaping incognito into Beau's world is just what she needs -- especially if she can get answers about her past. &lt;br /&gt; Beau needs Celeste to save a man's life -- he never expected a high-octane attraction that could wreck his well-protected heart. And when Celeste's life is threatened by someone who clearly knows her real identity, Beau has to risk everything -- including his own life -- to save her. With menacing forces in the driver's seat and time ticking too fast, the two must win the biggest race of all...the race for their lives and their love.</description>

The result is an SF novel that deftly parodies the genre while also paying fond homage to it.</description>

  <description>Dedicated to master dream weaver, Edgar Allan Poe! "Nevermore! Tales of Murder, Mystery and the Macabre "is an homage to the great American writer, the incomparable Edgar Allan Poe, and a must have for every fan of his work. Compiled by multi award winning editors, Nancy Kilpatrick and Caro Soles, Ne"vermore! Tales of Murder, Mystery and the Macabre "presents a tantalizing selection of imaginative stories by New York Times best selling and prize winning authors Margaret Atwood; Kelley Armstrong; Richard Christian Matheson; Tanith Lee; William F. Nolan; Nancy Holder; Christopher Rice; Chelsea Quinn Yarbro; Michael Jecks; Lisa Morton; J. Madison Davis; Barbara Fradkin, and many others. The anthology consists of 21 original tales that blend supernatural and mystery elements in unique reimaginings of Edgar Allan Poe's exquisite stories. In addition to these amazing stories, we've added two bonus items: BONUS #1 "The Opium Eater" by David Morrell Previously unavailable in print, now included here for the first time...... "The Opium Eater "by the New York Times best selling author, David Morrell, recipient of three Bram Stoker awards, finalist for an Edgar and Anthony award, winner of a Nero and Macavity award, and recipient of the Thriller Master award from the International Thriller Writers organization. BONUS #2 "Edgar Allan Poe, Genre Crosser" an essay by Uwe Sommerlad This essay adds an historical dimension to Ne"vermore! "as it enlightens readers to the fact that Poe's "oeuvre "went far beyond his fame as a writer of dark fantasy and supernatural tales. This well researched essay traces the powerful influence of Poe in the literature of other countries as well as in the English speaking world. Poe is the father of the modern mystery story, but Sommerlad shows that Poe's reach extends to realms as diverse as science fiction and romance. Ne"vermore! "is a blend of what Poe imagined, a genreless world of unique stories and re envisionings. "</description>

  <description>As the Federation recovers from the devastating events of "Star Trek: Destiny," Captain William Riker and the crew of the "U.S.S. Titan" are ordered to resume their deep-space assignment, reaffirming Starfleet's core principles of peaceful exploration. But even far from home on a mission of hope, the scars of the recent cataclysm remain with them as they slowly rebuild their lives. The planet Droplet is a world made mostly of water without a speck of solid ground. Life should not exist here, yet it thrives. Aili Lavena, "Titan"'s aquatic navigator, spearheads the exploration of this mysterious world, facing the dangers of the vast, wild ocean. When one native species proves to be sentient, Lavena finds herself immersed in a delicate contact situation, and Riker is called away from Deanna Troi at a critical moment in their marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when good intentions bring calamity, Lavena and Riker are cut off from the crew and feared lost. Troi must face a life-changing event without her husband, while the crew must brave the crushing pressures of the deep to undo the global chaos they have triggered. Stranded with her injured captain, Lavena must win the trust of the beings who control their fate -- but the price for Riker's survival may be the loss of everything he holds dear.</description>
