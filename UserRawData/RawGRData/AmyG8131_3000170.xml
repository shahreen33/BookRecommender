  <description>&lt;b&gt;FROM THE #1 &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF &lt;i&gt;GONE GIRL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Libby Day was seven when her mother and two sisters were murdered in “The Satan Sacrifice" of Kinnakee, Kansas.” She survived—and famously testified that her fifteen-year-old brother, Ben, was the killer. Twenty-five years later, the Kill Club—a secret secret society obsessed with notorious crimes—locates Libby and pumps her for details. They hope to discover proof that may free Ben. Libby hopes to turn a profit off her tragic history: She’ll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club—for a fee. As Libby’s search takes her from shabby Missouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the unimaginable truth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she started—on the run from a killer.</description>

      <![CDATA[Dark Places is definitely one of those thrillers that keeps the pages turning. It is a story about mistakes, horror, and how far one is willing to go to save the ones they love. Dark Places will definitely be a book that sticks with me for years to come. ]]>

  <description>Something strange is happening at the Orsk furniture superstore in Cleveland, Ohio. Every morning, employees arrive to find broken Kjerring bookshelves, shattered Glans water goblets, and smashed Liripip wardrobes. Sales are down, security cameras reveal nothing, and store managers are panicking.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To unravel the mystery, three employees volunteer to work a nine-hour dusk-till-dawn shift. In the dead of the night, they’ll patrol the empty showroom floor, investigate strange sights and sounds, and encounter horrors that defy the imagination.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A traditional haunted house story in a thoroughly contemporary setting, Horrorstör comes packaged in the form of a glossy mail order catalog, complete with product illustrations, a home delivery order form, and a map of Orsk’s labyrinthine showroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Designed by Andie Reid, cover photography by Christine Ferrara</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One pet crow fights to save humanity from an apocalypse in this uniquely hilarious debut from a genre-bending literary author.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S.T., a domesticated crow, is a bird of simple pleasures: hanging out with his owner Big Jim, trading insults with Seattle's wild crows (those idiots), and enjoying the finest food humankind has to offer: Cheetos ®.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Big Jim's eyeball falls out of his head, and S.T. starts to feel like something isn't quite right. His most tried-and-true remedies--from beak-delivered beer to the slobbering affection of Big Jim's loyal but dim-witted dog, Dennis--fail to cure Big Jim's debilitating malady. S.T. is left with no choice but to abandon his old life and venture out into a wild and frightening new world with his trusty steed Dennis, where he discovers that the neighbors are devouring each other and the local wildlife is abuzz with rumors of dangerous new predators roaming Seattle. Humanity's extinction has seemingly arrived, and the only one determined to save it is a foul-mouthed crow whose knowledge of the world around him comes from his TV-watching education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hollow Kingdom&lt;/i&gt; is a humorous, big-hearted, and boundlessly beautiful romp through the apocalypse and the world that comes after, where even a cowardly crow can become a hero.</description>

  <description>You've heard of these groups - the secretive ones that only the crème de la crème are invited into, the ones outsiders speculate about for centuries - I'm the second in my family invited to attend, but to them, I'm fresh meat. New blood. New money, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They think they'll elbow past me, that I'm here for their amusement, for them to walk all over, they'll find out soon enough that I'm not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may look like one of them, with my designer bags and clothes straight from the Parisian runways, but I'm not. I'm here for answers, to take revenge for blood spilled on their centuries-old Persian rugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I transferred here in search for answers about what happened to my older brother, who hightailed out of here, and my friend who seemingly disappeared into thin air. I certainly wasn't here for the attention of the star hockey player, regardless of how much he willed my eyes his way. I wasn't here for his scrutiny or his judgment or to read into his mysterious aura. I was here for the society, because only they held the answers I needed. That was, until I found out that in order to get those answers, I needed to to go through him. He's saying if I want in, I have to play by their rules, follow their lead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a game I'm willing to play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be the second person I know of to be invited into their society, but I'll be the first to make it out intact.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Nothing But a Dare is a second chance, enemies to lovers rom-com with a 	curvy, will punch you in the throat heroine, and a hero that will push every button she has for fun. Oh, and did I mention there's a cat that wears turtleneck sweaters?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After what could possibly be the world's worst morning, the &lt;i&gt;last&lt;/i&gt; thing Abbie expected to see as she walked into her meeting was her childhood nemesis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunter. Freaking. James. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title of world's worst morning now seemed like an understatement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Abbie walked into the conference room looking like a complete mess, 	and still killed her presentation, Hunter knew he'd made the right decision 	signing on with WCM Advertising. He was there for one reason, and one reason only. Abbie was going to be his, even if he had to dare her every step of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Game on.</description>

  <description>What do you do when you’re the reigning kissing booth champion but the only person you want to kiss is your best friend’s brother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me make this clear right here, right now: I, Halley Dawson, do not care that Preston Wright is kissing other women. &lt;br /&gt;Not a lick. Not at all. Nuh-uh-freakin’-uh.&lt;br /&gt;I do care that he’s doing it six feet away from me behind a gaudy velvet curtain—making him my competition in this year’s kissing contest.&lt;br /&gt;Why do I care, you ask? Because I’ve had an unfortunate crush on the insufferable idiot since I was sixteen years old, but I also know it’s never going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;He’s the Creek Falls bachelor to die for, and I’m the Creek Falls racoon lady who puts peanut butter sandwiches out for them every night.&lt;br /&gt;I’m not going to let him break my four-year-long reign—no matter how many times he breaks the rules and slides the curtain across to do the one thing he’s not allowed to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiss me.</description>

  <description>Rian Thompson thought she joined the gym to get healthy. Little did she know she was about to add hundred and ninety pounds of swoonworthy abdominal muscles and arrogance to her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day in Rians’s life follows a predictable pattern, and she wouldn’t have it any other way. She’s got a nice job, a nice place to live, and a nice family – even if they are a little wedding-zilla-ish at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t need anything spectacular to be happy. She just needs to get healthy – mentally, physically. . . and maybe spiritually if that happens. But she’ll settle for two out of three until her sister finally gets hitched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carlos Davies thought his life was perfect. Little did he know it was about to be turned upside down by a woman who is not his type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Carlos’s mind, his life is damn near perfect. He’s got a great job, a great place to live, and a great stash of pick up lines that always work. It has occurred to him that maybe no one actually takes him all that seriously. But with these bulging biceps and thick, dark hair, does that even matter since he’s never sleeping alone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Weight Expectations, where great—and unexpected—things happen.</description>

Trust doesn’t come easily to Wyatt. But living? That’s never been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;And he’d sure like to show her how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;'Crime and Periodicals' is a full-length contemporary romantic comedy, can be read as a standalone, and is book #2 in the Green Valley Library series, Green Valley World, Penny Reid Book Universe.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What happens when two frenemies can't stop pushing each other's buttons? Find out in this tender, laugh-out-loud funny romance from number-one New York Times best-selling author Lauren Blakely, available in audio first!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Never Have I Ever&lt;/i&gt; been so infuriated by a man I wanted to kiss. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say opposites attract, but I beg to differ. Combust is more like it. Because every single time I talk to Zach Nolan, I see red. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The too-good-looking, too-smart, too-effortlessly-charming single dad who works down the hall from me has turned getting under my skin into a sport. Call it the battle of wits between the wedding planner and the divorce attorney. Trouble is, when we’re forced into closer quarters, planning an engagement party for our best friends, I start to see his other sides. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I fear I’m falling for the enemy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not out to make friends. My goals are simple -- fight till the end for my clients, and my family. The last thing I need is a vibrant, outgoing, snarky, and surprisingly big-hearted wedding planner to spend my precious free time with…except, watching Piper bond with my daughter just might break down the cinder block walls I’ve built around my heart these last few years. Second chances don’t come around for guys like me…or do they?</description>

  <description>In the middle of the night, in a house on a quiet street in suburban Minneapolis, intruders silently murder Luke Ellis’s parents and load him into a black SUV. The operation takes less than two minutes. Luke will wake up at The Institute, in a room that looks just like his own, except there’s no window. And outside his door are other doors, behind which are other kids with special talents—telekinesis and telepathy—who got to this place the same way Luke did: Kalisha, Nick, George, Iris, and ten-year-old Avery Dixon. They are all in Front Half. Others, Luke learns, graduated to Back Half, “like the roach motel,” Kalisha says. “You check in, but you don’t check out.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this most sinister of institutions, the director, Mrs. Sigsby, and her staff are ruthlessly dedicated to extracting from these children the force of their extranormal gifts. There are no scruples here. If you go along, you get tokens for the vending machines. If you don’t, punishment is brutal. As each new victim disappears to Back Half, Luke becomes more and more desperate to get out and get help. But no one has ever escaped from the Institute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As psychically terrifying as Firestarter, and with the spectacular kid power of It, The Institute is Stephen King’s gut-wrenchingly dramatic story of good vs. evil in a world where the good guys don’t always win.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Nevada Frida Baylor and Connor Ander Rogan cordially invite you to join their wedding celebration. Summoning, weather manipulation, and other magical activities strictly forbidden.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catalina Baylor is looking forward to wearing her maid of honor dress and watching her older sister walk down the aisle. Then the wedding planner gets escorted off the premises, the bride’s priceless tiara disappears, and Rogan's extensive family overruns his mother’s home. Someone is cheating, someone is lying, and someone is plotting murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make this wedding happen, Catalina will have to do the thing she fears most: use her magic. But she’s a Baylor and there’s nothing she wouldn't do for her sister's happiness. Nevada will have her fairy tale wedding, even if Catalina has to tear the mansion apart brick by brick to get it done.</description>

  <description>Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him...</description>

  <description>Natalie, a young art student in New York City, is struggling to pay her bills when a friend makes a suggestion: Why not go online and find a sugar daddy—a wealthy, older man who will pay her for dates, and even give her a monthly allowance? Lots of girls do it, Nat learns. All that’s required is to look pretty and hang on his every word. Sexual favours are optional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though more than thirty years her senior, Gabe, a handsome corporate finance attorney, seems like the perfect candidate, and within a month, they are madly in love. At least, Nat is…Gabe already has a family, whom he has no intention of leaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when he abruptly ends things, Nat can’t let go. She begins drinking heavily and stalking him: watching him at work, spying on his wife, even befriending his daughter, who is not much younger than she is. But Gabe’s not about to let his sugar baby destroy his perfect life. What was supposed to be a mutually beneficial arrangement devolves into a nightmare of deception, obsession, and, when a body is found near Gabe’s posh Upper East Side apartment, murder.</description>

      <![CDATA[This year has definitely been the year I fell in love Karin Slaughter stories. I like the way she weaves a tale of murder, mayhem, and in the end hope. I really like the Will Trent series because there is just something about Will and the cast of characters in his life. All of these characters ar...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Four women learn their boss (a man who’s always been surrounded by rumors about how he treats women) is next in line to be CEO—what will happen when they decide enough is enough?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sloane, Ardie, Grace, and Rosalita are four women who have worked at Truviv, Inc., for years. The sudden death of Truviv's CEO means their boss, Ames, will likely take over the entire company. Ames is a complicated man, a man they’ve all known for a long time, a man who’s always been surrounded by...whispers. Whispers that have always been ignored by those in charge. But the world has changed, and the women are watching Ames’s latest promotion differently. This time, they’ve decided enough is enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sloane and her colleagues set in motion a catastrophic shift within every floor and department of the Truviv offices. All four women’s lives—as women, colleagues, mothers, wives, friends, even adversaries—will change dramatically as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"If only you had listened to us,” they tell us on page one, “none of this would have happened."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A decadent rock star. A deeply religious radio host. A disgraced scientist. And a teenage girl who may be the world's last hope.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shana wakes up one morning to discover her little sister in the grip of a strange malady. She appears to be sleepwalking. She cannot talk and cannot be woken up. And she is heading with inexorable determination to a destination that only she knows. But Shana and her sister are not alone. Soon they are joined by a flock of sleepwalkers from across America, on the same mysterious journey. And like Shana, there are other “shepherds” who follow the flock to protect their friends and family on the long dark road ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For on their journey, they will discover an America convulsed with terror and violence, where this apocalyptic epidemic proves less dangerous than the fear of it. As the rest of society collapses all around them–and an ultraviolent militia threatens to exterminate them–the fate of the sleepwalkers depends on unraveling the mystery behind the epidemic. The terrifying secret will either tear the nation apart–or bring the survivors together to remake a shattered world.</description>

  <description>With its gracious homes and tree-lined streets, Ansley Park is one of Atlanta's most desirable neighborhoods. But in one gleaming mansion, in a teenager's lavish bedroom, a girl has been savagely murdered. And in the hallway, her horrified mother stands amid shattered glass, having killed her daughter's attacker with her bare hands. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Will Trent of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation is here only to do a political favor; the murder site belongs to the Atlanta police. But Trent soon sees something that the cops are missing, something in the trail of blood, in a matrix of forensic evidence, and in the eyes of the shell-shocked mother. Within minutes, Trent is taking over the case -- and adding another one to it. He is sure that another teenage girl is missing, and that a killer is on the loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armed with only fleeting clues, teamed with a female cop who has her own personal reasons for hating him, Trent has enemies all around him -- and a gnawing feeling that this case, which started in the best of homes, is cutting quick and deep through the ruins of perfect lives broken wide-open: where human demons emerge with a vengeance.</description>

  <description>The Bishop siblings' family is on the verge of collapse as all three find themselves embroiled in danger. Family bonds may keep them alive...but only love can give them something to live for. Read BISHOP'S KNIGHT, the first novel in this ALL NEW heart-pounding Endgame trilogy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She needs his protection...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to years of government training, Evie Bishop knows how to get into places she doesn't belong—and she's very good at it. But years of doing black ops work burned her out so she returns home—to unexpected chaos. One of her brothers is in a coma and the other is in hiding, wanted for murder. Then a fellow operative from her past shows up shot and bleeding with news that an assassin is gunning for everyone involved with a past op. She's forced to turn to the one man she knows she can trust—the man whose heart she broke. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it will come with a price...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dylan Blackwood proposed a year ago, Evie turned him down flat and walked out of his life. He's stunned when he finds her on his doorstep covered in someone else's blood, needing his help. He always knew there was more to her than met the eye—that Evie was never simply the pampered society princess she wanted people to believe she was. But he never expected this. If she needs help, he'll give it. Even if he can't forget her betrayal. Even if he isn't sure he can trust her. But his protection will come with a price—her heart. Before they can have a chance at a future, they'll have to work together to take down a faceless enemy who has Evie firmly in his crosshairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST IN NEW TRILOGY&lt;br /&gt;Author note: This book can be read as a stand-alone, complete with HEA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Books in trilogy:&lt;br /&gt;Bishop's Knight, #1&lt;br /&gt;Bishop's Queen, #2&lt;br /&gt;Bishop's Endgame, #3</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Princess. Tribute. Sacrifice. Is she the one prophesied to unite two warring Fae courts? Or the one bound to destroy them?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a realm ruled by magic, the ruthless Queen of Thorns is determined to destroy her nemesis, the cursed Prince of Evernight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With war brewing between the bitter enemies, the prince forces Queen Adaia to uphold an ancient treaty: she will send one of her daughters to his court as a political hostage for three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The queen insists it’s the perfect opportunity for Princess Iskvien to end the war before it begins. But one look into Thiago’s smouldering eyes and Vi knows she’s no assassin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more secrets she uncovers about the prince and his court, the more she begins to question her mother’s motives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is the true enemy? The dark prince who threatens her heart? Or the ruthless queen who will stop at nothing to destroy him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when the curse threatens to shatter both courts, is she strong enough to break it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A fairytale twist inspired by the Hades and Persephone myth.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I will admit that fantasy romance is something I love. I love the idea of far away kingdoms with handsome princes, danger, and of course, true love’s kiss. Promise of Darkness offers all that and more. Promise of Darkness is a story of Fae and treachery. Because, how can you have a story of the F...]]>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I went to my neighbour’s apartment to investigate strange sounds, I never expected to fall through a portal into another world. Yet here I am, a stranger in an even stranger land... and I'm stranded. In this world, might makes right, men carry swords, and gods walk the earth. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Within minutes of arriving, I’m enslaved!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Fun place...&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How do I get home? GREAT question. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wish I had an answer!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The one person that might be able to help me is also the one person I want to throttle most. Aron, Lord of Storms, Butcher God of Battle, is my new companion. Or rather, I'm his. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As Aron's anchor to the mortal realm, I'm the one that's supposed to be guiding him through his exile in the mortal world...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ha. Joke's on him. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know nothing about this place!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But Aron and I have a common goal - get home. And we're bonded - anchor and god - with a bond unlike any other. So we travel together. We bicker. We bathe together. We fight our many, many enemies together. And sure, he’s a god, but he’s also an arrogant jerk. Brawny, smoking hot, irresistible jerk. I should want nothing to do with him. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I certainly shouldn’t want to do things to him...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mortals and gods don’t mix. We stick to the plan and ignore our attraction. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focused, with one goal in mind...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;One task...&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;One goal...&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Focused!&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;I-oh heck, I’m going to end up kissing him again, aren’t I? &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;From the New York Times bestselling author of the Wind Dragons and Cursed Ravens MC series comes sinners, saints and secrets…&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Skylar,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years. That’s a long time to go without talking to somebody, especially someone who was such a huge part of your life…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A letter from my first kiss and my childhood everything…from prison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He may be nicknamed Saint, but this sweet, sexy biker most definitely has a wild streak. Hearing from him draws me right back into the Knights of Fury motorcycle club—the people I’ll always think of as family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s still the only man I’ve ever wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each good, old-fashioned letter from my “prison pen pal” has my heart racing. Which is nothing compared to how I feel when Saint surprises me in person, as a free man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was just a kid the last time we saw each other, but the connection between us now is anything but innocent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s the type of man who would do anything to protect his woman. And with my world crashing down around me, that’s exactly what I’m going to need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is approximately 67,000 words&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: This book is part of the Knights of Fury MC series but can be read as a stand-alone.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Here is a special edition 20th anniversary release of the number-one New York Times best-selling novel that reignited the entire Star Wars publishing phenomenon - unabridged for the first time. The biggest event in the history of Star Wars books, Heir to the Empire follows the adventures of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia after they led the Rebel Alliance to victory in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years after the Death Star was destroyed and Darth Vader and the Emperor were defeated, the galaxy is struggling to heal the wounds of war, Princess Leia and Han Solo are married and expecting twins, and Luke Skywalker has become the first in a long-awaited line of new Jedi Knights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But thousands of light-years away, the last of the Emperor’s warlords - the brilliant and deadly Grand Admiral Thrawn - has taken command of the shattered Imperial fleet, readied it for war, and pointed it at the fragile heart of the New Republic. For this dark warrior has made two vital discoveries that could destroy everything the courageous men and women of the Rebel Alliance fought so hard to create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The explosive confrontation that results is a towering epic of action, invention, mystery, and spectacle on a galactic scale - in short, a story worthy of the name Star Wars.</description>

  <description>Now that high school is over, Ari is dying to move to the big city with his ultra-hip band―if he can just persuade his dad to let him quit his job at their struggling family bakery. Though he loved working there as a kid, Ari cannot fathom a life wasting away over rising dough and hot ovens. But while interviewing candidates for his replacement, Ari meets Hector, an easygoing guy who loves baking as much as Ari wants to escape it. As they become closer over batches of bread, love is ready to bloom . . . that is, if Ari doesn’t ruin everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writer Kevin Panetta and artist Savanna Ganucheau concoct a delicious recipe of intricately illustrated baking scenes and blushing young love, in which the choices we make can have terrible consequences, but the people who love us can help us grow.</description>

  <description>All Pen wants is to be the kind of girl she’s always been. So why does everyone have a problem with it? They think the way she looks and acts means she’s trying to be a boy—that she should quit trying to be something she’s not. If she dresses like a girl, and does what her folks want, it will show respect. If she takes orders and does what her friend Colby wants, it will show her loyalty. But respect and loyalty, Pen discovers, are empty words. Old-world parents, disintegrating friendships, and strong feelings for other girls drive Pen to see the truth--that in order to be who she truly wants to be, she’ll have to man up.</description>

  <description>Ivy Gamble has never wanted to be magic. She is perfectly happy with her life—she has an almost-sustainable career as a private investigator, and an empty apartment, and a slight drinking problem. It's a great life and she doesn't wish she was like her estranged sister, the magically gifted professor Tabitha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Ivy is hired to investigate the gruesome murder of a faculty member at Tabitha’s private academy, the stalwart detective starts to lose herself in the case, the life she could have had, and the answer to the mystery that seems just out of her reach.</description>

  <description>When Hazel Johnson and Mari McCray met at church bingo in 1963, it was love at first sight. Forced apart by their families and society, Hazel and Mari both married young men and had families. Decades later, now in their mid-'60s, Hazel and Mari reunite again at a church bingo hall. Realizing their love for each other is still alive, what these grandmothers do next takes absolute strength and courage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From TEE FRANKLIN (NAILBITER's "THE OUTFIT," Love is Love) and JENN ST-ONGE (Jem &amp;amp; the Misfits), BINGO LOVE is a touching story of love, family, and resiliency that spans over 60 years.</description>

  <description>BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Karin Slaughter's &lt;i&gt;Fallen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the city of Atlanta, women are dying—at the hands of a killer who signs his work with a single, chilling act of mutilation. Leaving behind enough evidence to fuel a frenzied police hunt, this cunning madman is bringing together dozens of lives, crossing the boundaries of wealth and race. And the people who are chasing him must cross those boundaries too. Among them is Michael Ormewood, a veteran detective whose marriage is hanging by a thread—and whose arrogance and explosive temper are threatening his career. And Angie Polaski, a beautiful vice cop who was once Michael's lover before she became his enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But another player has entered the game: a loser ex-con who has stumbled upon the killer's trail in the most coincidental of ways—someone who may be the key to breaking the case wide open...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Co-parenting with her best friend. What could go wrong?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next three decades of Abby Herbert's life are as carefully planned out as the last three were. Best career ever? Check. Great friends, one of whom she lives with in a stunning Tribeca apartment? Check. Perfect man to share her dream family? Surely just a matter of time. But then she gets devastating news from her doctor--if she wants to get pregnant, she needs to get started on that by...well, &lt;em&gt;yesterday&lt;/em&gt;. On the bright side, she has the &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; person in mind to be the father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tech entrepreneur Marcus Ross has been harboring decidedly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;-friends feelings toward Abby. He doesn't want to lose her and, knowing his feelings are one-sided, he's been trying to move on. When he learns about the curveball Abby's just been hit with, he promises to be there for her however she wants him to be, even if the idea of fatherhood is a little complicated for him right now. But it isn't long until boundaries start to blur, and a deal struck between friends starts to turn into something perilously close to feelings that could change everything...</description>

      <![CDATA[First I need to give a big thanks to Harlequin Publicity Team for sending this book my way. <br /><br />I really enjoyed Unexpected. It has two things I adore in a good romance: friends to lovers trope and a curvy nerdy heroine. Marcus and Abby are life long best friends. But, Abby has a problem. She is stru...]]>

  <description>You just dropped off your child at the bus stop. A panicked stranger calls your phone. Your child has been kidnapped, and the stranger explains that their child has also been kidnapped, by a completely different stranger. The only way to get your child back is to kidnap another child within 24 hours. Your child will be released only when the next victim's parents kidnap yet another child, and most importantly, the stranger explains, if you don't kidnap a child, or if the next parents don't kidnap a child, your child will be murdered. You are now part of The Chain.</description>

  <description>A speculative thriller in the vein of &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Power&lt;/i&gt;. Optioned by Universal and Elizabeth Banks to be a major motion picture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SURVIVE THE YEAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one speaks of the grace year. It’s forbidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Garner County, girls are told they have the power to lure grown men from their beds, to drive women mad with jealousy. They believe their very skin emits a powerful aphrodisiac, the potent essence of youth, of a girl on the edge of womanhood. That’s why they’re banished for their sixteenth year, to release their magic into the wild so they can return purified and ready for marriage. But not all of them will make it home alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Tierney James dreams of a better life—a society that doesn’t pit friend against friend or woman against woman, but as her own grace year draws near, she quickly realizes that it’s not just the brutal elements they must fear. It’s not even the poachers in the woods, men who are waiting for a chance to grab one of the girls in order to make a fortune on the black market. Their greatest threat may very well be each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With sharp prose and gritty realism, &lt;i&gt;The Grace Year&lt;/i&gt; examines the complex and sometimes twisted relationships between girls, the women they eventually become, and the difficult decisions they make in-between.</description>

  <description>The summer before my senior year of high school I had only one goal: to make Alden Warner see me as more than his best friend’s annoying little sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my wish came true and he noticed me. In a big way. Too bad that the next morning he had no memory of our night together, leaving me heartbroken, and as I later discovered…pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last four years, I’ve been rocking the single mom thing, making sure my daughter comes first. In fact, everything is going fine—until Alden storms back into my life, as my new boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His reappearance wasn’t something I planned for. Add my nosy, meddlesome three-year-old and an overprotective brother, and I’m obviously in way over my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only hope now is that I can sway Alden to see things my way…but you know what they say about the best laid plans…</description>

  <description>Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A standalone romantic thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover.</description>

  <description>Sugar is here for the cake and nothing more. She’s not proud of the fact that she sneaks into weddings just for the dessert, but she can’t help herself. There’s so much love in them and they’re so special and she knows she won’t ever get one for her very own. But everything changes when she has a taste of Hank. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hank works in construction, so he’s good with his hands. He never thought he’d have to step in as a baker, but when his brother's cake gets destroyed the morning of the wedding, what choice does he have? One look at the unfamiliar woman eating his sweet treat and he’s ready to give her more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: You think we can base a whole romance around a woman’s love for wedding cake? You’re g*ddamn right we can! Come for the cake and stay for the romance… We promise to leave you satisfied!</description>

  <description>Jack and I, we did everything backward. The day he lured me into his office-which was also the first day we met-he proposed. You'd think a guy who looked like him-a bit cold maybe, but still striking and very unattainable-would only ask the love of his life to marry him, right? You'd think he must be madly in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. It was me he asked. A complete stranger who had never even heard of him. A stranger who had been dumped by her fiancé only weeks before. You'd think I'd laugh in his face, call him insane-and a few other names-then walk away as quickly as possible. Well…I did all those things except the walking away part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took him only minutes to talk me into a business deal…erm, I mean marriage, and only days for us to officially tie the knot. Happiest day of my life. Magical. Pop the champagne… Not. It was the worst day. Jack Hawthorne was nothing like what I'd imagined for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I blamed him for my lapse in judgment. I blamed his eyes, the ocean blue eyes that looked straight into mine unapologetically, and that frown on his face I had no idea I would become so fascinated with in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn't long after he said I was the biggest mistake of his life that things started to change. No, he still didn't talk much, but anyone can string a few words together. His actions spoke the loudest to me. And day after day my heart started to get a mind of its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One second he was no one. The next he became everything. &lt;br /&gt;One second he was unattainable. The next he seemed to be completely mine.&lt;br /&gt;One second I thought we were in love. The next it was still nothing but a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, I was Rose and he was Jack. We were doomed from the very beginning with those names. Did you expect anything else?</description>

  <description>A new, sexy standalone from #1&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller, Vi Keeland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first encountered Ford Donovan, I had no idea who he was…well, other than the obvious. Young, gorgeous, successful, smart. Did I mention young? If I did, it bears repeating. Ford Donovan was &lt;i&gt;too young&lt;/i&gt; for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s back up to how it all started. My best friend decided I needed to start dating again. So, without my knowledge, she set up a profile for me on a popular dating site—one that invited men ages twenty-one to twenty-seven to apply for a date. Those nicknamed &lt;i&gt;Cunnilingus King&lt;/i&gt; were told they’d go straight to the top for consideration. The profile wasn’t supposed to go live. Another point that bears repeating—it wasn’t &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, that’s how I met Ford, and we started messaging. He made me laugh; yet I was adamant that because of his age, we could only be friends. But after weeks of wearing me down, I finally agreed to &lt;i&gt;one date only&lt;/i&gt;—my first after twenty years of being with my high school sweetheart. I knew it couldn’t last, but I was curious about him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though, you know what they say…&lt;i&gt;curiosity kills the cat&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs wobbled walking into the restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;Ford was seated at the bar. When he turned around, he took my breath away.&lt;br /&gt;His sexy smile nearly melted my panties. &lt;br /&gt;But…he looked &lt;i&gt;so familiar&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;As I got closer I realized why. &lt;br /&gt;He was the son of the neighbor at our family’s summer home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The boy next door&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Only now…he was all man. &lt;br /&gt;I hadn’t seen him in years.&lt;br /&gt;I left the restaurant and planned to put the entire crazy thing behind me. &lt;br /&gt;Which I did. &lt;i&gt;Until summer came&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;And guess who decided to use his family’s summer home this year?</description>

  <description>The former Tin Gypsy motorcycle club has everyone in Clifton Forge, Montana convinced they’ve locked their clubhouse doors and ripped off their patches. Everyone but Bryce Ryan. There’s more happening at the club’s garage than muscle car restorations and Harley rebuilds. Her instincts are screaming there’s a story—one she’s going to tell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the new owner of the small town’s newspaper, Bryce is hungry for more than birth announcements and obituaries. When a woman is brutally killed and all signs point to the Tin Gypsies, Bryce is determined to expose the club and their leader, Kingston “Dash” Slater, as murderers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bryce bests Dash match after match, disappointed her rugged and handsome opponent turns out to be an underwhelming adversary. Secrets are exposed. Truths defeat lies. Bryce is poised to win this battle in a landslide. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then Dash breaks all the rules and tips the scales. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One kiss, and she’s fighting to save more than just her story. She’s fighting to save her heart from the Gypsy King.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In the faux-documentary style of The Blair Witch Project comes the campfire story of a missing girl, a vengeful ghost, and the girl who is determined to find her sister--at all costs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a year, the path appears in the forest and Lucy Gallows beckons. Who is brave enough to find her--and who won't make it out of the woods?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been exactly one year since Sara's sister, Becca, disappeared, and high school life has far from settled back to normal. With her sister gone, Sara doesn't know whether her former friends no longer like her...or are scared of her, and the days of eating alone at lunch have started to blend together. When a mysterious text message invites Sara and her estranged friends to "play the game" and find local ghost legend Lucy Gallows, Sara is sure this is the only way to find Becca--before she's lost forever. And even though she's hardly spoken with them for a year, Sara finds herself deep in the darkness of the forest, her friends--and their cameras--following her down the path. Together, they will have to draw on all of their strengths to survive. The road is rarely forgiving, and no one will be the same on the other side.</description>

  <description>Geralt of Rivia is a witcher. A cunning sorcerer. A merciless assassin. And a cold-blooded killer. His sole purpose: to destroy the monsters that plague the world. But not everything monstrous-looking is evil and not everything fair is good... and in every fairy tale there is a grain of truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A collection of short stories introducing Geralt of Rivia, to be followed by the first novel in the actual series, &lt;i&gt;The Blood of Elves&lt;/i&gt;. Note that, while &lt;i&gt;The Last Wish&lt;/i&gt; was published after &lt;i&gt;The Sword of Destiny&lt;/i&gt;, the stories contained in &lt;i&gt;The Last Wish&lt;/i&gt; take place first chronologically, and many of the individual stories were published before &lt;i&gt;The Sword of Destiny&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Jack Torrance's new job at the Overlook Hotel is the perfect chance for a fresh start. As the off-season caretaker at the atmospheric old hotel, he'll have plenty of time to spend reconnecting with his family and working on his writing. But as the harsh winter weather sets in, the idyllic location feels ever more remote...and more sinister. And the only one to notice the strange and terrible forces gathering around the Overlook is Danny Torrance, a uniquely gifted five-year-old.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Can a dog heal two wounded souls? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Newly single Kerry Williams is at her wit’s end. She's juggling her injured father’s care, a new job as the manager of a hip new restaurant and her therapy dog Willow volunteering at the Veteran’s Center – all while struggling to rise above her humiliating heartbreak. When her father's caretaker fails to show one evening, she’s terrified she’ll lose her job. And then Willow runs away. Panicked, Kerry gives chase and immediately runs smack into a tall, dark and sexy wall of muscle, palming a squirming bundle of fur. Her new hero seems like an answer to her prayers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The last thing K-9 officer Caleb Bradshaw wants, is to babysit his neighbor's father and her dog. He’s facing a potential career-ending injury and grieving the death of his working partner, Trigger. Sure he can handle a cranky old man, but the quiet comfort of Willow who follows him around with liquid-eyed sympathy tugs at the heart he’s trying to keep walled-off after his many painful losses. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kerry knows Willow can ease Caleb’s grief, but he continues to push her away. Even though her life is in shambles and she too should walk, Kerry knows she can’t and won’t. Will Caleb accept her help or will he close himself off completely?</description>

  <description>The road in front of Dr. Louis Creed's rural Maine home frequently claims the lives of neighborhood pets. Louis has recently moved from Chicago to Ludlow with his wife Rachel, their children and pet cat. Near their house, local children have created a cemetery for the dogs and cats killed by the steady stream of transports on the busy highway. Deeper in the woods lies another graveyard, an ancient Indian burial ground whose sinister properties Louis discovers when the family cat is killed.&lt;br /&gt;source: stephenking.com</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bound as one to love, honor, or burn.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago, Louise le Blanc fled her coven and took shelter in the city of Cesarine, forsaking all magic and living off whatever she could steal. There, witches like Lou are hunted. They are feared. And they are burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sworn to the Church as a Chasseur, Reid Diggory has lived his life by one principle: &lt;i&gt;thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.&lt;/i&gt; His path was never meant to cross with Lou's, but a wicked stunt forces them into an impossible union—holy matrimony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The war between witches and Church is an ancient one, and Lou's most dangerous enemies bring a fate worse than fire. Unable to ignore her growing feelings, yet powerless to change what she is, a choice must be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And love makes fools of us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a previously published edition of ISBN 9780062878021.

  <description>Charlotte Gorman loves her job as an elementary school librarian, and is content to experience life through the pages of her books. Which couldn’t be more opposite from her identical twin sister. Ginny, an Instagram-famous beauty queen, has been chasing a crown since she was old enough to say "world peace," and she’s not giving up until she wins Miss American Treasure. But when Ginny has a face-altering allergic reaction the night before competition, Charlotte suddenly finds herself in a switcheroo the twins haven’t successfully pulled off in decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woefully unprepared for the glittery world of hair extensions, false eyelashes, and push-up bras, Charlotte realizes, after walking a mile in her twin's sky-high stilettos, there might be more to the pageant circuit than just a sparkly crown . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author of the National Book Award longlist title &lt;em&gt;The Poet X&lt;/em&gt; comes a dazzling novel in prose about a girl with talent, pride, and a drive to feed the soul that keeps her fire burning bright.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since she got pregnant freshman year, Emoni Santiago’s life has been about making the tough decisions—doing what has to be done for her daughter and her abuela. The one place she can let all that go is in the kitchen, where she adds a little something magical to everything she cooks, turning her food into straight-up goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though she dreams of working as a chef after she graduates, Emoni knows that it’s not worth her time to pursue the impossible. Yet despite the rules she thinks she has to play by, once Emoni starts cooking, her only choice is to let her talent break free.</description>

I don’t have time to fall in love—I’m too busy trying to run a business, keep the red socks out of the white laundry, and get the damn pillowcases on without owing a dollar to the swear jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, Frannie Sawyer is beautiful and sweet, but she’s twenty-seven, the boss’s daughter, and my new part-time nanny—which means she’s completely off-limits. It’s bad enough I can’t stop fantasizing about her, what kind of jerk would I be if I acted on the impulse to kiss her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Exactly the kind of jerk you’re thinking.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I’m worse than that—because I didn’t stop with a kiss, and now I can’t stay away. She makes me feel like myself again. She reminds me what it’s like to want something just for me. She’s everything I ever needed, but nothing I ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a former Marine. I should have had the strength to resist her from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I didn’t. And now I have to choose between the life I want and the life she deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it means giving her up.</description>

  <description>In her YA debut, New York Times bestselling author Carrie Ann Ryan dives into a world with magic and sacrifice with the Elements of Five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five hundred years ago, the Maison Realm was shattered, divided into warring kingdoms of elemental Wielders with fate and truth shadowed and uncertain. Now, factions of both the light and dark venture into the human realm in search of the prophesied Spirit Priestess who is said to Wield the Elements of Five to bring the two fractured kingdoms together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lyric has no idea that there's a realm outside the human one she lives in. When fate and circumstances are pulled from her hands after an accident, she finds out that nothing is as it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;War is raging around her, and when Lyric realizes that they are searching for her, she must rely on those she once trusted as she trains: a boy who isn't who she thought, and a new realm of warriors who have come to protect her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the darkness is coming, and the Queen of Obscurité wants to ensure that the King of Lumière can't get his hands on Lyric. And the only way to ensure that is if Lyric herself is no more...no matter the cost to prophecy.</description>

  <description>A young girl in Harlem discovers slam poetry as a way to understand her mother’s religion and her own relationship to the world. Debut novel of renowned slam poet Elizabeth Acevedo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xiomara Batista feels unheard and unable to hide in her Harlem neighborhood. Ever since her body grew into curves, she has learned to let her fists and her fierceness do the talking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Xiomara has plenty she wants to say, and she pours all her frustration and passion onto the pages of a leather notebook, reciting the words to herself like prayers—especially after she catches feelings for a boy in her bio class named Aman, who her family can never know about. With Mami’s determination to force her daughter to obey the laws of the church, Xiomara understands that her thoughts are best kept to herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when she is invited to join her school’s slam poetry club, she doesn’t know how she could ever attend without her mami finding out, much less speak her words out loud. But still, she can’t stop thinking about performing her poems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because in the face of a world that may not want to hear her, Xiomara refuses to be silent.</description>

But when her past catches up with her, Breezy must go to Sea Haven to seek out the man who almost destroyed her.

He’ll do whatever it takes to make Breezy his woman again—especially when he learns the real reason she came to him for help, and that the stakes are higher than he ever could have imagined…</description>

  <description>HE WANTS TO LOSE CONTROL.&lt;br /&gt;Between his parents’ messed up marriage and his narcissistic younger brother, Lincoln Moorehead has spent the majority of his life avoiding his family. After the death of his father, Lincoln finds himself in the middle of the drama. To top it all off, he’s been named CEO of Moorehead Media, much to his brother’s chagrin. But Lincoln’s bad attitude softens when he meets the no-nonsense, gorgeous woman who has been given the task of transforming him from the gruff, wilderness guy to a suave businessman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHE’S TRYING TO HOLD IT TOGETHER.&lt;br /&gt;Wren Sterling has been working double time to keep the indiscretions at Moorehead Media at bay, so when she’s presented with a new contract, with new responsibilities and additional incentives, she agrees. Working with the reclusive oldest son of a ridiculously entitled family is worth the hassle if it means she’s that much closer to pursuing her own dreams. What Wren doesn’t expect is to find herself attracted to him, or for it to be mutual. And she certainly doesn’t expect to fall for Lincoln. But when a shocking new Moorehead scandal comes to light, she’s forced to choose between her own family and the broody, cynical CEO.</description>

  <description>Eighteen-year-old Trinity Marrow may be going blind, but she can see and communicate with ghosts and spirits. Her unique gift is part of a secret so dangerous that she’s been in hiding for years in an isolated compound fiercely guarded by Wardens—gargoyle shape-shifters who protect humankind from demons. If the demons discover the truth about Trinity, they’ll devour her, flesh and bone, to enhance their own powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Wardens from another clan arrive with disturbing reports that something out there is killing both demons and Wardens, Trinity’s safe world implodes. Not the least because one of the outsiders is the most annoying and fascinating person she’s ever met. Zayne has secrets of his own that will upend her world yet again—but working together becomes imperative once demons breach the compound and Trinity’s secret comes to light. To save her family and maybe the world, she’ll have to put her trust in Zayne. But all bets are off as a supernatural war is unleashed…</description>

  <description>Harper Winston’s brother has disappeared. Pursuing his dream of sailing the Caribbean, Michael hasn’t responded to texts or emails in days. When even the Coast Guard can’t find him, Harper is forced to take desperate measures. Which means going to Chase Garrett, once her brother’s best friend, now the only man she can trust…or so she hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the successful owner of Maximum Security, Chase has learned to trust his gut. He knows Harper’s father is mixed up in a deadly business, and suspects there’s more to Michael’s disappearance than meets the eye. Getting involved again with the Winstons goes against everything he stands for, yet old loyalties die hard. As the case draws him closer to Harper and deeper into the Winstons’ snarled crime family, he is forced to put everything on the line to keep Harper safe…and both of them alive.</description>

  <description>Kristen Petersen doesn't do drama, will fight to the death for her friends, and has no room in her life for guys who just don't get her. She's also keeping a big secret: facing a medically necessary procedure that will make it impossible for her to have children.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Planning her best friend's wedding is bittersweet for Kristen—especially when she meets the best man, Josh Copeland. He's funny, sexy, never offended by her mile-wide streak of sarcasm, and always one chicken enchilada ahead of her hangry. Even her dog, Stuntman Mike, adores him. The only catch: Josh wants a big family someday. Kristen knows he'd be better off with someone else, but as their attraction grows, it's harder and harder to keep him at arm's length.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Friend Zone&lt;/i&gt; will have you laughing one moment and grabbing for tissues the next as it tackles the realities of infertility and loss with wit, heart, and a lot of sass.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A woman’s impossible journey through the ages could change everything…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Gallagher grew up enchanted by her grandfather’s stories of Ireland. Heartbroken at his death, she travels to his childhood home to spread his ashes. There, overcome with memories of the man she adored and consumed by a history she never knew, she is pulled into another time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ireland of 1921, teetering on the edge of war, is a dangerous place in which to awaken. But there Anne finds herself, hurt, disoriented, and under the care of Dr. Thomas Smith, guardian to a young boy who is oddly familiar. Mistaken for the boy’s long-missing mother, Anne adopts her identity, convinced the woman’s disappearance is connected to her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As tensions rise, Thomas joins the struggle for Ireland’s independence and Anne is drawn into the conflict beside him. Caught between history and her heart, she must decide whether she’s willing to let go of the life she knew for a love she never thought she’d find. But in the end, is the choice actually hers to make?</description>

      <![CDATA[What the Wind Knows is a very dramatic story that definitely wrapped me up the pages while I reading it. It is a story about a woman who goes to Ireland to spread her grandfather’s ashes. Once there she finds herself thrown back in time to 1922. This is a time of turmoil for Ireland because they...]]>

  <description>Olive is always unlucky: in her career, in love, in…well, everything. Her identical twin sister Ami, on the other hand, is probably the luckiest person in the world. Her meet-cute with her fiancé is something out of a romantic comedy (gag) and she’s managed to finance her entire wedding by winning a series of Internet contests (double gag). Worst of all, she’s forcing Olive to spend the day with her sworn enemy, Ethan, who just happens to be the best man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olive braces herself to get through 24 hours of wedding hell before she can return to her comfortable, unlucky life. But when the entire wedding party gets food poisoning from eating bad shellfish, the only people who aren’t affected are Olive and Ethan. And now there’s an all-expenses-paid honeymoon in Hawaii up for grabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting their mutual hatred aside for the sake of a free vacation, Olive and Ethan head for paradise, determined to avoid each other at all costs. But when Olive runs into her future boss, the little white lie she tells him is suddenly at risk to become a whole lot bigger. She and Ethan now have to pretend to be loving newlyweds, and her luck seems worse than ever. But the weird thing is that she doesn’t mind playing pretend. In fact, she feels kind of... lucky.</description>

In this story it is about Olive and Ethan, the only two people who don’t get sick at the wedding for their siblings. The thing is Olive and Ethan hate each other. So, they decide to go on th...]]>

  <description>No visitors. No nights spent away from the apartment. No disturbing the other residents, all of whom are rich or famous or both. These are the only rules for Jules Larsen's new job as an apartment sitter at the Bartholomew, one of Manhattan's most high-profile and mysterious buildings. Recently heartbroken and just plain broke, Jules is taken in by the splendor of her surroundings and accepts the terms, ready to leave her past life behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she gets to know the residents and staff of the Bartholomew, Jules finds herself drawn to fellow apartment sitter Ingrid, who comfortingly, disturbingly reminds her of the sister she lost eight years ago. When Ingrid confides that the Bartholomew is not what it seems and the dark history hidden beneath its gleaming facade is starting to frighten her, Jules brushes it off as a harmless ghost story—until the next day, when Ingrid disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searching for the truth about Ingrid's disappearance, Jules digs deeper into the Bartholomew's dark past and into the secrets kept within its walls. Her discovery that Ingrid is not the first apartment sitter to go missing at the Bartholomew pits Jules against the clock as she races to unmask a killer, expose the building's hidden past, and escape the Bartholomew before her temporary status becomes permanent.</description>

      <![CDATA[I have become a fan of Riley Sager thrillers ever since I read Final Girls two years ago. He has a habit of weaving a dark and twisted tale that is reminiscent of classic horror movie tropes. His stories explore: mass murder, summer camp, and now a creepy expensive New York apartment building. I...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For fans of &lt;i&gt;The Princess Diaries &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Royal We &lt;/i&gt;comes a fun and daring novel about a modern-day princess who teams up with a spy to find out what happened to the fiancé who left her at the altar—and who just might get her own fairytale in the process.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Princess Theodora Isabella Victoria of Drieden of the Royal House Laurent is &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; over this princess thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her fiancé jilted her on their wedding day, she’s finally back home after spending four months in exile—aka it’s back to press conferences, public appearances, and putting on a show for the Driedish nation as the perfect princess they expect her to be. But Thea’s sick of duty. After all, that’s what got her into this mess in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when she sneaks out of the palace and meets a sexy Scot named Nick in a local bar, she relishes the chance to be a normal woman for a change. But just as she thinks she’s found her Prince Charming for the night, he reveals his intentions are less than honorable: he’s the brother of her former fiancé, a British spy, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; he’s not above blackmail. As Thea reluctantly joins forces with Nick to find out what happened the day her fiancé disappeared, together they discover a secret that could destroy a centuries-old monarchy and change life as they know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, fast-paced, and full of more twists and turns than the castle Thea lives in, &lt;i&gt;The Royal Runaway &lt;/i&gt;is a fresh romantic comedy that will leave you cheering for the modern-day royal who chucks the rulebook aside to create her own happily-ever-after.</description>

  <description>They say your first kiss should be earned. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mine was stolen by a devil in a masquerade mask under the black Chicago sky. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say the vows you take on your wedding day are sacred. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mine were broken before we left church. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say your heart only beats for one man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mine split and bled for two rivals who fought for it until the bitter end. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was promised to Angelo Bandini, the heir to one of the most powerful families in the Chicago Outfit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then taken by Senator Wolfe Keaton, who held my father’s sins over his head to force me into marriage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say that all great love stories have a happy ending. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I, Francesca Rossi, found myself erasing and rewriting mine until the very last chapter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One kiss. &lt;br /&gt;Two men. &lt;br /&gt;Three lives. &lt;br /&gt;Entwined together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And somewhere between these two men, I had to find my forever.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>RELEASING MAY 15!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holly has spent her whole life as a walking disaster, from running into walls, tripping over invisible objects, and always being in the wrong place at the wrong time. When a seemingly normal outing taking her overly opinionated Corgi for a walk resulted in an object to the face, she didn’t think her day could get any worse. The moment she opened her eyes and saw the Adonis standing over her, she knew she’d been wrong. It was about to get a whole lot worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben’s lived his whole life disobeying his uptight, self-centered, shrew of a mother. Instead of going into the family business, he followed his dreams and opened his veterinarian clinic. One ordinary day at the dog park, and a rogue dog toy later, he found himself captivated by the curvy woman that had a feistiness which set him on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could only get better from here, right? Too bad his mother had other plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standalone Rom-Com. HEA.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He’s giving her children a season of wonder…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dani Capelli seized a chance to start over in a small town with her daughters. Now, facing her first Christmas in Haven Point, she wonders if leaving New York was a mistake. Dani loves working alongside veterinarian Dr. Morales, but her two children aren’t adjusting to small-town life. And then there’s Dr. Morales’s son, Ruben—Dani’s next-door neighbor. Gorgeous, muscled and dependable, the deputy sheriff is everything she secretly craves and can’t bear to risk loving…and losing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruben never pictured himself falling for a big-city woman like Dani. But beneath her prickly facade, she’s caring and softhearted and she needs all the love and protection he can give. When Dani’s teenage daughter starts acting out, Ruben draws on family traditions to show the girls just how magical a Haven Point Christmas can be. But can he convince Dani that she’s found a home for the holidays—and forever—in his arms?</description>

      <![CDATA[More like 3.5 stars and I rounded up up. So, if you like cheesy feel good Hallmark movies then this Christmas story is for you. Season of Wonder was a cute Holiday read full of feel good moments. It is definitely a safe Holiday romance that you can read or listen to at work. ]]>

  <description>The one day English teacher Reagan Wild is late for work—and looks like she dressed herself in the dark—she remembers Carter Anthony, a well-known football star, is coming to the school to deliver a talk to her overexcited students. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Reagan knows Carter from her high school days, since he was her past crush, she wasn’t ready to see him again. At the time, she hated being invisible. But right now, she wished she could simply disappear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carter Anthony is keen to give back to his hometown, but what he doesn’t expect is getting something in return. When a chance encounter with Reagan, the shy girl from his past, happens, he knows instinctively this woman is supposed to be in his life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With an embarrassing ability to blurt out whatever’s on her mind, Reagan doesn’t understand Carter’s attention. She has no doubt, though, he’ll soon realize his mistake when he discovers just how crazy she and her family are. But no matter what he sees, what he hears, or how her looney family behaves, he doesn’t run. In fact, Carter’s family seem just as unique as hers.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Through dog poop, naked yoga, and the paparazzi’s, can Carter and Reagan have any hope in love, even when it’s fumbled?</description>

      <![CDATA[I rounded up to four stars on this book. I have become a big Lila Rose fan because she writes about heroines that are quirky, funny, can put a smile on your face, and just happen to be plus size. I like that being plus is just part of who they are but doesn't define who they are because the heroi...]]>

  <description>Petite, kind, brilliant, and young, Stevie is nothing like the usual women bodyguard Shen Li is interested in. Even more surprising, the youngest of the lethal, ball-busting, and beautiful MacKilligan sisters is terrified of bears. But she’s not terrified of pandas. She loves pandas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Which means that whether Shen wants her to or not, she simply won’t stop cuddling him. He isn’t some stuffed Giant Panda, ya know! He is a Giant Panda shifter. He deserves respect and personal space. Something that little hybrid is completely ignoring.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Stevie has a way of finding trouble. Like going undercover to take down a scientist experimenting on other shifters. For what, Shen doesn’t want to know, but they’d better find out. And fast. Stevie might be the least violent of the honey badger sisters, but she’s the most dangerous to Shen’s peace of mind. Because she has absolutely no idea how much trouble they’re in . . . or just how damn adorable she is.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Thirty-one-year-old Charlie isn't in the mood for Christmas cheer.&lt;/i&gt;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her boyfriend has left her for his personal trainer, her mother has absconded with her latest husband for the holidays, and--adding insult to (literal) injury--her London apartment has just been destroyed by a gas leak. Single, mildly concussed and temporarily homeless, Charlie realizes there's only one place to go: Cozy Canine Cottages, where she'll spend the season looking after her cousin Jez's doggy day care center. And if she's not exactly a dog person, well, no one has to know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her plans for a quiet Christmas in a quaint country village are quickly dashed. Peggy the pregnant beagle and Malcolm the anxious Great Dane seem determined to keep her up all night. A strange man has been casing her cousin's house. And where is Cal, the unbearably patronizing but disturbingly handsome local vet, when she needs him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the days tick down to Christmas, Charlie's life has never felt so out of control--but with some help from her new four-legged friends, she just might learn a thing or two about living in the moment, embracing the unexpected and opening herself up to love...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What happens when America's First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius—his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casey McQuiston's Red, White &amp;amp; Royal Blue proves: true love isn't always diplomatic.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A brand new romantic comedy from New York Times bestseller Tessa Bailey!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgette Castle’s family runs the best home renovation business in town, but she picked balloons instead of blueprints and they haven’t taken her seriously since. Frankly, she’s over it. Georgie loves planning children’s birthday parties and making people laugh, just not at her own expense. She’s determined to fix herself up into a Woman of the World... whatever that means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase one: new framework for her business (a website from this decade, perhaps?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase two: a gut-reno on her wardrobe (fyi, leggings are pants.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase three: updates to her exterior (do people still wax?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase four: put herself on the market (and stop crushing on Travis Ford!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living her best life means facing the truth: Georgie hasn’t been on a date since, well, ever. Nobody’s asking the town clown out for a night of hot sex, that’s for sure. Maybe if people think she’s having a steamy love affair, they’ll acknowledge she’s not just the “little sister” who paints faces for a living. And who better to help demolish that image than the resident sports star and tabloid favorite?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis Ford was major league baseball’s hottest rookie when an injury ended his career. Now he’s flipping houses to keep busy and trying to forget his glory days. But he can’t even cross the street without someone recapping his greatest hits. Or making a joke about his… bat. And then there's Georgie, his best friend’s sister, who is not a kid anymore. When she proposes a wild scheme—that they pretend to date, to shock her family and help him land a new job—he agrees. What’s the harm? It’s not like it’s real. But the girl Travis used to tease is now a funny, full-of-life woman and there’s nothing fake about how much he wants her...</description>

  <description>Two people. Ten chances. One unforgettable love story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laurie is pretty sure love at first sight doesn't exist anywhere but the movies. But then, through a misted-up bus window one snowy December day, she sees a man who she knows instantly is the one. Their eyes meet, there's a moment of pure magic... and then her bus drives away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain they're fated to find each other again, Laurie spends a year scanning every bus stop and cafe in London for him. But she doesn't find him, not when it matters anyway. Instead they "reunite" at a Christmas party, when her best friend Sarah giddily introduces her new boyfriend to Laurie. It's Jack, the man from the bus. It would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows for Laurie, Sarah and Jack is ten years of friendship, heartbreak, missed opportunities, roads not taken, and destinies reconsidered. &lt;i&gt;One Day in December&lt;/i&gt; is a joyous, heartwarming and immensely moving love story to escape into and a reminder that fate takes inexplicable turns along the route to happiness.</description>

  <description>Mercenary Kate Daniels knows all too well that magic in post-Shift Atlanta is a dangerous business. But nothing she’s faced could have prepared her for this…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kate and the former Beast Lord Curran Lennart are finally making their relationship official. But there are some steep obstacles standing in the way of their walk to the altar…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kate’s father, Roland, has kidnapped the demigod Saiman and is slowly bleeding him dry in his never-ending bid for power. A Witch Oracle has predicted that if Kate marries the man she loves, Atlanta will burn and she will lose him forever. And the only person Kate can ask for help is long dead.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The odds are impossible. The future is grim. But Kate Daniels has never been one to play by the rules…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From award-winning author, Ilona Andrews, an original novella, set in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; #1 bestselling &lt;i&gt;Kate Daniels World&lt;/i&gt; and featuring fan-favorites, Derek, and Curran and Kate’s &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; independent ward, Julie.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Scarred, solitary Derek Gaunt has separated from his Pack, and is &lt;i&gt;truly&lt;/i&gt; a lone wolf. With no family he answers to no one; but is fiercely loyal to a chosen few. So, when several of those close to him are murdered, he’ll stop at nothing to hunt their killer through the magic-drenched streets of Atlanta. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Never one to be left on the sidelines, equally determined—some might say stubborn—Julie Lennart-Olsen soon joins in his pursuit; and what began as revenge turns into a race to save the city. Their search pits them against powers they never imagined and magic so old, it predates history. It may cost Derek his life, but there are things for which even he would risk everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the latest Kate Daniels novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Ilona Andrews, magic is coming and going in waves in post-Shift Atlanta—and each crest leaves danger in its wake…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After breaking from life with the Pack, mercenary Kate Daniels and her mate—former Beast Lord Curran Lennart—are adjusting to a very different pace. While they’re thrilled to escape all the infighting, Curran misses the constant challenges of leading the shapeshifters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when the Pack offers him its stake in the Mercenary Guild, Curran seizes the opportunity—too bad the Guild wants nothing to do with him and Kate. Luckily, as a veteran merc, Kate can take over any of the Guild’s unfinished jobs in order to bring in money and build their reputation. But what Kate and Curran don’t realize is that the odd jobs they’ve been working are all connected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ancient enemy has arisen, and Kate and Curran are the only ones who can stop it—before it takes their city apart piece by piece…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Trick…or wicked treat!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a devastating dirty trick—Joey Silvia just found out her boyfriend of two years is married. What. A. Dick. Joey knows her best chance to get over one guy is to get under another. Of course, heading home to her family's remote cabin in Oregon poses some challenges in the "available men" department…until she discovers this cabin comes with its own hot handyman! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy crap, Chris Steffensen. When did her brother's best friend turn into a hard-bodied pile of blond-bearded hotness? He's the perfect Halloween treat—and a surprisingly dirty rebound guy. For a couple of weeks, anyway. Except that Chris has other ideas…like proving to Joey that this blast from the past is a whole lot more than a naughty Halloween hookup.</description>

  <description>Cassie Hanwell was born for emergencies. As one of the only female firefighters in her Texas firehouse, she's seen her fair share of them, and she's excellent at dealing with other people's tragedies. But when her estranged and ailing mother asks her to uproot her life and move to Boston, it's an emergency of a kind Cassie never anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tough, old-school Boston firehouse is as different from Cassie's old job as it could possibly be. Hazing, a lack of funding, and poor facilities mean that the firemen aren't exactly thrilled to have a "lady" on the crew, even one as competent and smart as Cassie. Except for the handsome rookie, who doesn't seem to mind having Cassie around. But she can't think about that. Because she doesn't fall in love. And because of the advice her old captain gave her: &lt;i&gt;don't date firefighters. &lt;/i&gt;Cassie can feel her resolve slipping...but will she jeopardize her place in a career where she's worked so hard to be taken seriously?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katherine Center's &lt;i&gt;Things You Save in a Fire&lt;/i&gt; is a heartfelt, affecting novel about life, love, and the true meaning of courage.</description>

Caged behind an electrical fence, locked in a house in the middle of the snow, Senna is left to decode the clues to find out why she was taken.

  <description>Everyone knows Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six: The band's album &lt;i&gt;Aurora&lt;/i&gt; came to define the rock 'n' roll era of the late seventies, and an entire generation of girls wanted to grow up to be Daisy. But no one knows the reason behind the group's split on the night of their final concert at Chicago Stadium on July 12, 1979 . . . until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it’s the rock 'n' roll she loves most. By the time she’s twenty, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also getting noticed is The Six, a band led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she’s pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes that the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The making of that legend is chronicled in this riveting and unforgettable novel, written as an oral history of one of the biggest bands of the seventies. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a talented writer who takes her work to a new level with &lt;i&gt;Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six&lt;/i&gt;, brilliantly capturing a place and time in an utterly distinctive voice.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover edition exists &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6283263.here" title="here" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stephen King’s second novel, the classic vampire bestseller &lt;i&gt;’SALEM’S LOT&lt;/i&gt;, tells the story of evil in small-town America. For the first time in a major trade edition, this terrifying novel is accompanied by previously unpublished material from King’s archive, two short stories, and eerie photographs that bring King’s fictional darkness and evil to vivid life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Stephen King’s classic thriller&lt;i&gt;’SALEM’S LOT&lt;/i&gt; hit the stands in 1975, it thrilled and terrified millions of readers with tales of demonic evil in small-town America. Now, thirty years later and still scaring readers witless, &lt;i&gt;’SALEM’S LOT&lt;/i&gt; reemerges in a brilliant new edition, complete with photographs, fifty pages of deleted and alternate scenes, and two short stories related to the events of the novel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the original edition of &lt;i&gt;’SALEM’S LOT &lt;/i&gt;will forever be a premier horror classic, &lt;i&gt;’SALEM’S LOT: ILLUSTRATED EDITION&lt;/i&gt;, with the inclusion of material from King’s archive, is destined to become a classic in its own right and a must-have for all Stephen King fans. In this edition, the hair-raising story of Jerusalem’s Lot, a small town in Maine whose inhabitants succumb to the evil allure of a new resident, is told as the author envisioned it, complete with fifty pages of alternate and deleted scenes. With a new introduction by the author, two short stories related to the events and residents of Jerusalem’s Lot, the lavishly creepy photographs of Jerry Uelsmann, and a stunning new page design, this edition brings the story to life in words and pictures as never before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No library will be complete without this ideal collector’s item for any King aficionado, the definitive illustrated edition of the great &lt;i&gt;’SALEM’S LOT&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

      <![CDATA[I wish I could say I loved this book but that was not the case with Salem's Lot. This past year I have started reading more and more of Stephen King's works. I have been going back and forth with modern Stephen King and his older work. Salem's Lot is a book he published back in the late seventies...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;No one’s ever told Eleanor that life should be better than fine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Eleanor Oliphant: she struggles with appropriate social skills and tends to say exactly what she’s thinking. Nothing is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding unnecessary human contact, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and deeply unhygienic IT guy from her office. When she and Raymond together save Sammy, an elderly gentleman who has fallen, the three rescue one another from the lives of isolation that they had been living. Ultimately, it is Raymond’s big heart that will help Eleanor find the way to repair her own profoundly damaged one. If she does, she'll learn that she, too, is capable of finding friendship—and even love—after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart, warm, uplifting, &lt;i&gt;Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine&lt;/i&gt; is the story of an out-of-the-ordinary heroine whose deadpan weirdness and unconscious wit make for an irresistible journey as she realizes. . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;the only way to survive is to open your heart.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>What started as a normal, everyday, child-sucked-into-a-magical-land-to-fulfill-an-inane-quest has changed Fairyland forever. In the continuation of SKOTTIE YOUNG'S saccharine fantasy-satire, Gertrude hands over the spotlight to Larry, Duncan Dragon, and some of Fairyland's other supporting cast, misfits, and forgotten threats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collects issues 16 through 20.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I rounded up from 3.5 to four stars. If this was the end to the series I definitely like the irony of the ending. It did feel rushed and is not my favorite of the series. It had funny moments but went way too fast. I am actually a little sad to see the adventures of Gertrude end. ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A novel about a young woman determined to make her way in the wilds of North Carolina, and the two men that will break her isolation open.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, rumors of the "Marsh Girl" have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. She's barefoot and wild; unfit for polite society. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Kya is not what they say. Abandoned at age ten, she has survived on her own in the marsh that she calls home. A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life lessons from the land, learning from the false signals of fireflies the real way of this world. But while she could have lived in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world--until the unthinkable happens.</description>

If he prevails in the battle for Earth, his slave bands will be removed. Victory is his sole focus…until he meets her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On an arctic getaway with her foster sister, street tough but vulnerable Vale London is shocked to stumble upon a cave filled with ancient gods waging epic combat. When she is inadvertently drawn into their war, she is forced to team up with an unlikely ally—the sexy god who makes her burn with desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Vale is his enemy, Knox is consumed with lust and a fierce need to protect her. But only one combatant can triumph, and he will have to choose: live for freedom, or die for love.</description>

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, Abigail Linton devoted herself to caring for her aging parents and the children of her siblings. Now, eager to make her own life, she takes a position as governess on the neighboring estate. It shouldn’t matter that her absentee employer is Maxwell Bryce, the Duke of Rothwell, the infamous rake who once broke her youthful heart. Surely he’s forgotten her, for he hasn’t set foot on his estate for fifteen years. At least, that is, until he arrives unexpectedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max is incensed to meet his sister’s new governess. But why does Abby appear just as displeased to see him when it was she who’d rejected him all those years ago? Why is he so drawn to the independent spinster she has become? And why is there a sparkle in her beautiful blue eyes that suggests they might have a second chance at love?</description>

      <![CDATA[The Duke I Once Knew was, seriously, a cute story about a second chance at love. It is a story about never giving up and never settling for what you think you can get. <br />Abby is a woman that is almost thirty. She is unwed and unwilling to settle for anything less than love.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;No matter how much the paranormal politics of Atlanta change, one thing always remains the same: if there’s trouble, Kate Daniels will be in the middle of it…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the mate of the Beast Lord, Curran, former mercenary Kate Daniels has more responsibilities than it seems possible to juggle. Not only is she still struggling to keep her investigative business afloat, she must now deal with the affairs of the pack, including preparing her people for attack from Roland, a cruel ancient being with god-like powers. Since Kate’s connection to Roland has come out into the open, no one is safe—especially those closest to Kate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Roland’s long shadow looms ever nearer, Kate is called to attend the Conclave, a gathering of the leaders from the various supernatural factions in Atlanta. When one of the Masters of the Dead is found murdered there, apparently at the hands of a shapeshifter, Kate is given only twenty-four hours to hunt down the killer. And this time, if she fails, she’ll find herself embroiled in a war which could destroy everything she holds dear…</description>

  <description>Atlanta is a city plagued by magical problems. Kate Daniels will fight to solve them—no matter the cost.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mercenary Kate Daniels and her mate, Curran, the Beast Lord, are struggling to solve a heartbreaking crisis. Unable to control their beasts, many of the Pack’s shapeshifting children fail to survive to adulthood. While there is a medicine that can help, the secret to its making is closely guarded by the European packs, and there’s little available in Atlanta.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kate can’t bear to watch innocents suffer, but the solution she and Curran have found threatens to be even more painful. The European shapeshifters who once outmaneuvered the Beast Lord have asked him to arbitrate a dispute—and they’ll pay him in medicine. With the young people’s survival and the Pack’s future at stake, Kate and Curran know they must accept the offer—but they have little doubt that they’re heading straight into a trap…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;bestselling author Donna Grant takes you deep inside the Texas rodeo scene, where danger and desire ride side by side. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naomi Pierce isn't the type to let a cowboy sweep her off feet. It's not her first rodeo, after all. But when she returns to her Texas hometown, she can't help but be swept up again in the rough-and-tumble world of hard-riding, bronco-busting good-ol'-boys she loved as a girl. She might be here to photograph her Rodeo Queen best friend. But it's one fine-looking cowboy who really captures her eye...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brice Harper is all man, all muscle, and all heart. From the moment he rides into the stadium, he can't help but notice the beautiful stranger with a camera watching him fromthe stands. It doesn't take a zoom lens to see the sparks of instant attraction. But things really heat up when he meets Naomi up-close--and he discovers that someone is stalking her friend. Brice wouldn't be any kind ofcowboy if he didn't offer to help the ladies out. But can the rough rider keep this spirited shutterbug out of danger--without risking his heart?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Plagued by a war between magic and technology, Atlanta has never been so deadly. Good thing Kate Daniels is on the job.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Daniels may have quit the Order of Merciful Aid, but she’s still knee-deep in paranormal problems. Or she would be if she could get someone to hire her. Starting her own business has been more challenging than she thought it would be—now that the Order is disparaging her good name. Plus, many potential clients are afraid of getting on the bad side of the Beast Lord, who just happens to be Kate’s mate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Atlanta’s premier Master of the Dead calls to ask for help with a vampire on the loose, Kate leaps at the chance of some paying work. But it turns out that this is not an isolated incident. Kate needs to get to the bottom of it—and fast, or the city and everyone dear to her might pay the ultimate price…</description>

  <description>The legacy of Frankenstein’s monster collides with the sociopolitical tensions of the present-day United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein beseeched his creator for love and companionship, but in 2017, the monster has long discarded any notions of peace or inclusion. He has become the Destroyer, his only goal to eliminate the scourge of humanity from the planet. In this goal, he initially finds a willing partner in Dr. Baker, a descendant of the Frankenstein family who has lost her teenage son after an encounter with the police. While two scientists, Percy and Byron, initially believe they’re brought to protect Dr. Baker from the monster, they soon realize they may have to protect the world from the monster &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;Dr. Baker’s wrath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Written by lauded novelist Victor LaValle (&lt;i&gt;The Devil In Silver, The Ballad of Black Tom&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Destroyer&lt;/i&gt; is a harrowing tale exploring the legacies of love, loss, and vengeance placed firmly in the tense atmosphere and current events of the modern-day United States.</description>

  <description>Kate Daniels works for the Order of the Knights of Merciful Aid, officially as a liaison with the mercenary guild. Unofficially, she cleans up the paranormal problems no one else wants to handle—especially if they involve Atlanta’s shapeshifting community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she’s called in to investigate a fight at the Steel Horse, a bar midway between the territories of the shapeshifters and the necromancers, Kate quickly discovers there’s a new player in town. One who’s been around for thousands of years—and rode to war at the side of Kate’s father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foe may be too much even for Kate and Curran, the Lord of the Beasts, to handle. Because this time, Kate will be taking on family…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Every family has its rebel … and its secrets.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep in the Cascade mountains, the Rockwell family has been running historic Rocky Peak Lodge for generations. But now, that legacy is at risk of disappearing forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kai, always the rebel, would rather risk his life as a rescue paramedic than deal with his impossible father, “Mad Max” Rockwell. Only one thing could bring him home — a real threat to his family’s legacy. Especially in the form of a beautiful woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nurse Nicole Davidson never pictured herself as a spy. All she wants is security for her disabled sister. Get some inside intel for a friend’s real estate group while working for surly Max? She can do that. Until the outrageously sexy Kai Rockwell shows up and sets everything on fire — most especially her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Equally determined, equally passionate about protecting their families, Kai and Nicole don’t know if they should be enemies or lovers. All they know is they can’t resist each other… no matter the price.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From #1 New York Times bestselling author Ilona Andrews comes an enthralling new trilogy set in the Hidden Legacy world, where magic means power, and family bloodlines are the new currency of society…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world where magic is the key to power and wealth, Catalina Baylor is a Prime, the highest rank of magic user, and the Head of her House. Catalina has always been afraid to use her unique powers, but when her friend’s mother and sister are murdered, Catalina risks her reputation and safety to unravel the mystery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But behind the scenes powerful forces are at work, and one of them is Alessandro Sagredo, the Italian Prime who was once Catalina’s teenage crush. Dangerous and unpredictable, Alessandro’s true motives are unclear, but he’s drawn to Catalina like a moth to a flame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help her friend, Catalina must test the limits of her extraordinary powers, but doing so may cost her both her House–and her heart.</description>

I know this first book in their story so it is no wonder that I want more. This book left me with a boatload of questions. More thoughts to come. ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A double life with a single purpose: revenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane’s days at a Midwest insurance company are perfectly ordinary. She blends in well, unremarkably pretty in her floral-print dresses and extra efficient at her low-level job. She’s just the kind of woman middle manager Steven Hepsworth likes—meek, insecure, and willing to defer to a man. No one has any idea who Jane really is. Least of all Steven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But plain Jane is hiding something. And Steven’s bringing out the worst in her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing can distract Jane from going straight for his heart: allowing herself to be seduced into Steven’s bed, to insinuate herself into his career and his family, and to expose all his dirty secrets. It’s time for Jane to dig out everything that matters to Steven. So she can take it all away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as he did to her.</description>

  <description>Magical realism, lyrical prose, and the pain and passion of human love haunt this hypnotic generational saga.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foolish love appears to be the Roux family birthright, an ominous forecast for its most recent progeny, Ava Lavender. Ava—in all other ways a normal girl—is born with the wings of a bird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a quest to understand her peculiar disposition and a growing desire to fit in with her peers, sixteen-year old Ava ventures into the wider world, ill-prepared for what she might discover and naïve to the twisted motives of others. Others like the pious Nathaniel Sorrows, who mistakes Ava for an angel and whose obsession with her grows until the night of the Summer Solstice celebration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night, the skies open up, rain and feathers fill the air, and Ava’s quest and her family’s saga build to a devastating crescendo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First-time author Leslye Walton has constructed a layered and unforgettable mythology of what it means to be born with hearts that are tragically, exquisitely human.</description>

  <description>Maika Halfwolf is on the run from a coalition of forces determined to control or destroy the powerful Monstrum that lives beneath her skin. But Maika still has a mission of her own: to discover the secrets of her late mother, Moriko. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this second volume of &lt;i&gt;Monstress&lt;/i&gt;, collecting issues 7-12, Maika's quest takes her to the pirate-controlled city of Thyria and across the sea to the mysterious Isle of Bones. It is a journey that will force Maika to reevaluate her past, present, and future, and contemplate whether there's anyone, or anything, she can truly trust--including her own body.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The stunning conclusion to the Blood Type series finds the world in chaos and turmoil with one final battle left to determine who will survive—humans or vampires.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She had the world on her shoulders. Now she has nothing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reyna Carpenter was twenty-one when she became a live-in blood escort for the ruthless and darkly handsome vampire Beckham Anderson. She thought this was just a small price to pay for feeding her brothers back home.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But nothing went as planned. Not even her tumultuous relationship with Beckham. And now she wonders if anything will ever be the same again.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As she finds herself in the midst of a losing rebellion, she and her trusted friends must flee from a city conquered by the vampire elite. With their plans blown to pieces and everything they knew and loved gone, their future hangs in the balance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite all she has lost, Reyna must rise from the ashes, reclaim the life that was stolen—and complete her mission, once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;K. A. Linde’s addictive Blood Type novels are best enjoyed in order:&lt;br /&gt;BLOOD TYPE | BLOOD MATCH | BLOOD CURE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;b&gt;The next novel of psychological suspense and obsession from the authors of the blockbuster bestseller&lt;i&gt; The Wife Between Us.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Seeking women ages 18–32 to participate in a study on ethics and morality. Generous compensation. Anonymity guaranteed. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Jessica Farris signs up for a psychology study conducted by the mysterious Dr. Shields, she thinks all she’ll have to do is answer a few questions, collect her money, and leave. But as the questions grow more and more intense and invasive and the sessions become outings where Jess is told what to wear and how to act, she begins to feel as though Dr. Shields may know what she’s thinking…and what she’s hiding. As Jess’s paranoia grows, it becomes clear that she can no longer trust what in her life is real, and what is one of Dr. Shields’ manipulative experiments. Caught in a web of deceit and jealousy, Jess quickly learns that some obsessions can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the authors of the blockbuster bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; comes an electrifying new novel about doubt, passion, and just how much you can trust someone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; bestselling romance author Jude Deveraux makes her debut in the world of mystery with a story of old secrets, deadly grudges and an improbable group of friends who are determined to uncover the truth regardless of the consequences...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sara Medlar is a household name in romance, with millions of books sold. But lately, retirement has been boring her and she's found herself back in her hometown of Lachlan, Florida, remodeling the grand old mansion she'd admired as a child. It's much too big for her alone, but she'd die before letting anyone in town know that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Sara's niece Kate is offered a job in Lachlan--a start in what could be a very successful career in real estate. She accepts immediately, but with so little saved up, she'll have to approach her estranged yet incredibly famous aunt for a place to stay while she gets herself settled. But when she arrives at Sara's home, she finds she's not the only long-term houseguest. Jackson Wyatt already has his own room, and though it's impossible to deny his good looks and charm--he's clearly got her aunt wrapped around his finger--she's also never met anyone who irritates her quite like Jack does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when two skeletons are accidentally uncovered in the quiet town, this unlikely trio is suddenly thrust together by a common goal: to solve a mystery everyone else seems eager to keep under wraps. United by a sense of justice and the desire to right old wrongs, Sara, Kate and Jack will have to dig into Lachlan's murky past to unravel the small town's dark secrets and work to bring the awful truth to light.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A lovestruck lady charms the duke of her dreams during an expedition on the high seas in this sexy, swashbuckling novel from &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Bronwen Evans.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alexander Sylvester Bracken, Duke of Bedford, has a mission: sail to the Mediterranean and track down Lady Hestia Cary’s missing father. It is a straightforward task, but for two rather vexing complications. First, the sea holds painful memories; second, for her own safety, Hestia is to accompany him. As Alex battles the demons of his past, he must also resist Hestia’s surprisingly skillful attempts at seduction. After all, Alex has sworn to leave her untouched, and he intends to honor that vow—until he can properly ask the Earl’s blessing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ever since His Grace rescued Hestia from the arms of a Turkish pirate six long years ago, her heart has belonged to Alex. So when he agrees to help find her father, Hestia is thrilled. Although Alex tries to hide it, there’s passion in his eyes—and a frisson of desire in the air—whenever they meet. On board ship, miles from home, Alex won’t be able to deny her any longer. But with scoundrels lying in wait, she may not live to tell the tale of her conquest.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;No day is ordinary in a world where Technology and Magic compete for supremacy…But no matter which force is winning, in the apocalypse, a sword will always work.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hugh d’Ambray, Preceptor of the Iron Dogs, Warlord of the Builder of Towers, served only one man. Now his immortal, nearly omnipotent master has cast him aside. Hugh is a shadow of the warrior he was, but when he learns that the Iron Dogs, soldiers who would follow him anywhere, are being hunted down and murdered, he must make a choice: to fade away or to be the leader he was born to be. Hugh knows he must carve a new place for himself and his people, but they have no money, no shelter, and no food, and the necromancers are coming. Fast. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Elara Harper is a creature who should not exist. Her enemies call her Abomination; her people call her White Lady. Tasked with their protection, she's trapped between the magical heavyweights about to collide and plunge the state of Kentucky into a war that humans have no power to stop. Desperate to shield her people and their simple way of life, she would accept help from the devil himself—and Hugh d’Ambray might qualify. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hugh needs a base, Elara needs soldiers. Both are infamous for betraying their allies, so how can they create a believable alliance to meet the challenge of their enemies? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the prophet says: “It is better to marry than to burn.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hugh and Elara may do both. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

They have a way of building worlds, epic battle scenes, and over the top villains that I just can’t seem to get enough of. Iron and Magic is a spin-off series from the Kate Daniels series.

  <description>The hilarious and heartbreaking confessions of a figure skater turned collegiate hockey player who's terrified of checking . . . and is desperately in love with the captain of his hockey team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric Bittle is a former Georgia junior figure skating champion, vlogger extraordinaire, and amateur pâtissier. But as accomplished as he is, nothing could prepare him for his freshman year of playing hockey at the prestigious Samwell University in Samwell, Massachusetts. It's nothing like co-ed club hockey back in the South! For one? There’s checking. Second, there is Jack—his very attractive but moody captain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A collection of the first half of the mega-popular webcomic series of the same name, Check, Please!: # Hockey is the first in a hilarious and stirring two-volume coming-of-age story about hockey, bros, and trying to find yourself during the best four years of your life.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I've been watched all my life. I'm used to being stared at. Observed. Followed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fame and obsession collide in this darkly twisted novel from an incredible new voice in suspense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOMEONE IS WATCHING&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washed up teen star Liv Hendricks quit acting after her beloved younger sister inexplicably disappeared following a Hollywood party gone wrong. Liv barely escaped with her life, and her sister was never heard from again. But all this time, someone's been waiting patiently to finish what was started...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;FOUR MISSING GIRLS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now fifteen years later, broke and desperate, Liv is forced to return to the spotlight. She crowdfunds a webseries in which she'll pose as a real-life private detective--a nod to the show she starred on as a teen. When a mysterious donor challenges her to investigate a series of disappearances outside a town made famous by the horror movies filmed there, Liv has no choice but to accept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;FOLLOW THE WHITE WOLF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liv is given a cryptic first clue: Follow the white wolf. And now a darker game is about to begin. Through social media, someone is leaving breadcrumbs to follow. As Liv makes increasingly disturbing discoveries, her show explodes in popularity. A rapt internet audience is eager to watch it all--perhaps even at the cost of Liv's own life...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with provocative twists and turns as the line between plot and reality blurs in this inventive tour-de-force from breakout writer Jennifer Wolfe.</description>

  <description>The only thing about me that’s a size zero is the filter on my mouth. I’ve got a big personality, a big rack, and a big number on the scale. And I’m perfectly fine with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when some random guy suggests I might not be eating alone if I’d ordered a salad instead of a hamburger I’m shocked silent, which is a feat, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That brings us to one sexy fireman named Frankie Hartigan. He’s hot. He’s funny… And he’s just apologized for being late for our “date” then glared at the fat-shaming jerk. Next thing I know, he’s sitting down and ordering himself dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem telling him I don’t need a pity date… unless of course it’s to my high school reunion next week. Oops where did that last bit come from? And what do I do now that he’s said yes?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is no make-over story, and I think Frankie is using me for something. I just have to figure out what…</description>

      <![CDATA[I think this book was pretty good. It definitely had the cute factor going for it. I mean who doesn’t want to fall for a big hot ginger fireman. I definitely could relate to the fat girl insecurities. All in all Muffin Top was a pretty good read. ]]>

  <description>A powerful story of two people who spend years denying their scientifically-proven chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penny spends her afternoons sitting outside a sandwich shop, surrounded by ghosts. Fourteen years ago, this shop was her childhood dance studio... Now she’s a suburban housewife, dreading the moment her son departs for MIT, leaving her with an impeccably decorated McMansion and a failing marriage. She had her chance at wild, stars-in-her-eyes happiness, but that was a lifetime ago. After The Kiss. Before The Decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kiss was soulful. Magical. Earth-shattering, And it was all for a free gift card. Asked to participate in a psych study that posed the question, “Can you have sexual chemistry without knowing what the other person looks like?” Penny agreed to be blindfolded, make polite conversation with a total stranger, and kiss him. She never expected The Kiss to change her life forever and introduce her to Gavin: tattooed, gorgeous, and spontaneous enough to ask her out seconds after the blindfolds came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a year, they danced between friendship and romance—until Penny made The Decision that forced them to settle for friendship. Now, fourteen years later, both of their lives are about to radically change—and it’s his turn to decide what will become of their once-in-a-lifetime connection."</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;They came to earth—Pestilence, War, Famine, Death—four horsemen riding their screaming steeds, racing to the corners of the world. Four horsemen with the power to destroy all of humanity. They came to earth, and they came to end us all. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Pestilence comes for Sara Burn’s town, one thing is certain: everyone she knows and loves is marked for death. Unless, of course, the angelic-looking horseman is stopped, which is exactly what Sara has in mind when she shoots the unholy beast off his steed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad no one told her Pestilence can’t be killed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the horseman, very much alive and very pissed off, has taken her prisoner, and he’s eager to make her suffer. Only, the longer she’s with him, the more uncertain she is about his true feelings towards her … and hers towards him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, well, Sara might still be able to save the world, but in order to do so, she'll have to sacrifice her heart in the process.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Tess Bailey: the galaxy's Most Wanted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captain Tess Bailey is in deep trouble. She and her crew are on the run, pursued by a tyrant who'll take them dead or alive. Tess's best hope is a tall, dark, and much-too-appealing stranger, Shade Ganavan, who says he can help her. But his motivations are far from clear...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shade Ganavan: arrogance, charm...and that special something that makes you want to kick him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the dreaded Dark Watch closing in, what Tess and Shade don't know about each other might get them killed...unless they can set aside their differences and learn to trust each other before it's too late.</description>

  <description>In her twenties, Emma Blair marries her high school sweetheart, Jesse. They build a life for themselves, far away from the expectations of their parents and the people of their hometown in Massachusetts. They travel the world together, living life to the fullest and seizing every opportunity for adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On their first wedding anniversary, Jesse is on a helicopter over the Pacific when it goes missing. Just like that, Jesse is gone forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma quits her job and moves home in an effort to put her life back together. Years later, now in her thirties, Emma runs into an old friend, Sam, and finds herself falling in love again. When Emma and Sam get engaged, it feels like Emma’s second chance at happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until Jesse is found. He’s alive, and he’s been trying all these years to come home to her. With a husband and a fiancé, Emma has to now figure out who she is and what she wants, while trying to protect the ones she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is her &lt;i&gt;one true love&lt;/i&gt;? What does it mean to love truly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma knows she has to listen to her heart. She’s just not sure what it’s saying.</description>

  <description>A remote lodge in upstate New York is the perfect getaway. . . until the bodies start piling up.It's winter in the Catskills and the weather outside is frightful. But Mitchell's Inn is so delightful! The cozy lodge nestled deep in the woods is perfect for a relaxing--maybe even romantic--weekend away. The Inn boasts spacious old rooms with huge wood-burning fireplaces, a well-stocked wine cellar, and opportunities for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, or just curling up with a book and someone you love. So when the weather takes a turn for the worse, and a blizzard cuts off the electricity--and all contact with the outside world--the guests settle in for the long haul. The power's down but they've got candles, blankets, and wood--a genuine rustic experience! Soon, though, a body turns up--surely an accident. When a second body appears, they start to panic. Then they find a third body. Within the snowed-in paradise, something--or someone--is picking off the guests one by one. They can't leave, and with no cell service, there's no prospect of getting the police in until the weather loosens its icy grip. The weekend getaway has turned deadly. For some couples, it's their first time away. For others, it will be their last. And there's nothing they can do about it but huddle down and hope they can survive the storm.</description>

  <description>My twin brother’s talked me into a lot of crazy things, but taking his place on a road trip with his girlfriend so he can party with his friends is a whole new level of insanity. What’s even more insane is I somehow find myself agreeing to it—thanks, alcohol, guilt, and bribery. I’m determined to undo the arrangement, but then I meet Gwen, this sexy redheaded hurricane of energy and brains. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then she kisses me. Just like that, I’m driving her up the coast, on our way to a wedding with a mess of complications. With each hour and each stop, I’m falling harder and harder for a woman who doesn’t know my actual name. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m trying to do the right thing. Or the lesser of the wrong things. All my life I’ve had to clean up my brother’s messes, but for the first time ever, I’ve landed the upper hand in one of our switcheroo schemes. Now I’ve just got to come clean and convince Gwen that I’m the brother she should be with.</description>

  <description>As a child, Rose Franklin made an astonishing discovery: a giant metallic hand, buried deep within the earth. As an adult, she’s dedicated her brilliant scientific career to solving the mystery that began that fateful day: Why was a titanic robot of unknown origin buried in pieces around the world? Years of investigation have produced intriguing answers—and even more perplexing questions. But the truth is closer than ever before when a second robot, more massive than the first, materializes and lashes out with deadly force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now humankind faces a nightmare invasion scenario made real, as more colossal machines touch down across the globe. But Rose and her team at the Earth Defense Corps refuse to surrender. They can turn the tide if they can unlock the last secrets of an advanced alien technology. The greatest weapon humanity wields is knowledge in a do-or-die battle to inherit the Earth . . . and maybe even the stars.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bestselling author Katie McGarry’s trademark wrong-side-of-the-tracks romance is given a new twist in the gritty YA contemporary novel, &lt;i&gt;Only a Breath Apart&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say your destiny is carved in stone. But some destinies are meant to be broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only curse Jesse Lachlin believes in is his grandmother’s will: in order to inherit his family farm he must win the approval of his childhood best friend, the girl he froze out his freshman year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fortuneteller tells Scarlett she's psychic, but what is real is Scarlett’s father’s controlling attitude and the dark secrets at home. She may be able to escape, but only if she can rely on the one boy who broke her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each midnight meeting pushes Jesse and Scarlett to confront their secrets and their feelings, but as love blooms, the curse rears its ugly head…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A fierce survivor and a fearless FBI agent battle a copycat serial killer in a gripping thriller from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Katee Robert.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twelve years ago, Lei Zhang and her friend Emma Nilsson miraculously lived through the notorious Sorority Row Murders that left twenty-one of their sisters dead. Still wrestling with the trauma but finally out of the limelight, Lei and Emma are now devoted to helping other victims find closure. But most disturbing for Lei—beyond the gut-wrenching survivor guilt—is that the killer was her boyfriend. He’s behind bars, but she’ll never lower her guard again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a copycat killer targets Lei and Emma, FBI Agent Dante Young is put in charge of anticipating the sociopath’s every move. But what he doesn’t expect is his immediate and overpowering attraction to Lei. The closer they get to each other, the more desperate and terrifying the questions become: Who wants to finish what the killer started—and why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Agent Young vows to protect Lei at all costs. If they have any chance of a future together, first they have to stay alive…</description>

  <description>A missing girl on a journey of revenge. A &lt;i&gt;Serial&lt;/i&gt;―like podcast following the clues she's left behind. And an ending you won't be able to stop talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadie hasn't had an easy life. Growing up on her own, she's been raising her sister Mattie in an isolated small town, trying her best to provide a normal life and keep their heads above water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Mattie is found dead, Sadie's entire world crumbles. After a somewhat botched police investigation, Sadie is determined to bring her sister's killer to justice and hits the road following a few meager clues to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When West McCray―a radio personality working on a segment about small, forgotten towns in America―overhears Sadie's story at a local gas station, he becomes obsessed with finding the missing girl. He starts his own podcast as he tracks Sadie's journey, trying to figure out what happened, hoping to find her before it's too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtney Summers has written the breakout book of her career. Sadie is propulsive and harrowing and will keep you riveted until the last page.</description>

  <description>For two FBI agents with a past, love becomes a matter of life and death in the new Hidden Sins novel from New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Katee Robert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggie Gaines used to be an FBI agent—top of her class and one of the bright, up-and-coming stars—until she spectacularly fell apart during her first high-profile case. That was eight years ago. Now she’s a ranger at Glacier National Park, and she’s found some measure of peace. But when the body of a murdered woman is discovered, she must finally put the past behind her and work with the one man she thought she’d never see again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For months, Vic Sutherland has been hunting a killer who’s been targeting unsuspecting hikers in national parks—and now the predator has come to Glacier. Vic knows the case will bring him face-to-face with his former partner, yet nothing can prepare him for seeing Maggie again after all these years, or for the memories of passion it stirs in both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the investigation brings them closer together—and closer to the killer—Maggie and Vic fear they have only each other to trust. But even that might not be enough to make it out of Glacier alive.</description>

  <description>Experience all the feels in this unforgettable, second chance, standalone romance from #1 New York Times bestseller Lauren Blakely! I didn't break her heart, and she didn't break mine -- we broke each other's. I never stopped loving her, but time and distance played its cruel role in ripping us apart three years ago when she moved halfway around the world. Now after all those endless miles away, she's returned . . . but I'm not the guy I was before. Beautiful, kind, and loving, she's the same -- my hope. The only one who can make a day better, who can make me feel again with one kiss, one touch, one night. There's so much I have to put back in place now that I'm alone and on my own. Things I never wanted at the age of twenty-five. When I receive an unexpected letter that might hold the clues to everything I desperately need to understand about my family, I'm sure I have to follow it. But that means leaving her once more. She says she'll come with me, and having her by my side will unbreak my heart . . . or destroy it. That's the chance I have to take.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Murphy's Law&lt;/i&gt; is the captivating first entry of Rhys Bowen's New York Times bestselling Molly Murphy series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly Murphy always knew she'd end up in trouble, just as her mother predicted. So, when she commits murder in self-defense, she flees her cherished Ireland, under cover of a false identity, for the anonymous shores of late nineteenth-century America. When she arrives in New York and sees the welcoming promise of freedom in the Statue of Liberty, Molly begins to breathe easier. But when a man is murdered on Ellis Island, a man Molly was seen arguing with, she becomes a prime suspect in the crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If she can't clear her name, Molly will be sent back to Ireland where the gallows await, so using her Irish charm and sharp wit, she escapes Ellis Island and sets out to find the wily killer on her own. Pounding the notorious streets of Hell's Kitchen and the Lower East Side, Molly undertakes a desperate mission to clear her name before her deadly past comes back to haunt her new future.</description>

      <![CDATA[Murphy's Law is the first book in an historical cozy mystery series. I liked this book just okay. It definitely wasn't anything super amazing it was just a basic mystery story.

  <description>Hazel Camille Bradford knows she’s a lot to take—and frankly, most men aren’t up to the challenge. If her army of pets and thrill for the absurd don’t send them running, her lack of filter means she’ll say exactly the wrong thing in a delicate moment. Their loss. She’s a good soul in search of honest fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh Im has known Hazel since college, where her zany playfulness proved completely incompatible with his mellow restraint. From the first night they met—when she gracelessly threw up on his shoes—to when she sent him an unintelligible email while in a post-surgical haze, Josh has always thought of Hazel more as a spectacle than a peer. But now, ten years later, after a cheating girlfriend has turned his life upside down, going out with Hazel is a breath of fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that Josh and Hazel date. At least, not each other. Because setting each other up on progressively terrible double blind dates means there’s nothing between them...right?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Wake up, genius.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The genius is John Rothstein, an iconic author who created a famous character, Jimmy Gold, but who hasn’t published a book for decades. Morris Bellamy is livid, not just because Rothstein has stopped providing books, but because the nonconformist Jimmy Gold has sold out for a career in advertising. Morris kills Rothstein and empties his safe of cash, yes, but the real treasure is a trove of notebooks containing at least one more Gold novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morris hides the money and the notebooks, and then he is locked away for another crime. Decades later, a boy named Pete Saubers finds the treasure, and now it is Pete and his family that Bill Hodges, Holly Gibney, and Jerome Robinson must rescue from the ever-more deranged and vengeful Morris when he’s released from prison after thirty-five years.</description>

  <description>#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller! In a high-suspense race against time, three of the most unlikely heroes Stephen King has ever created try to stop a lone killer from blowing up thousands. “&lt;i&gt;Mr. Mercedes&lt;/i&gt; is a rich, resonant, exceptionally readable accomplishment by a man who can write in whatever genre he chooses” (&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the frigid pre-dawn hours, in a distressed Midwestern city, desperate unemployed folks are lined up for a spot at a job fair. Without warning, a lone driver plows through the crowd in a stolen Mercedes, running over the innocent, backing up, and charging again. Eight people are killed; fifteen are wounded. The killer escapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In another part of town, months later, a retired cop named Bill Hodges is still haunted by the unsolved crime. When he gets a crazed letter from someone who self-identifies as the “perk” and threatens an even more diabolical attack, Hodges wakes up from his depressed and vacant retirement, hell-bent on preventing another tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Brady Hartsfield lives with his alcoholic mother in the house where he was born. He loved the feel of death under the wheels of the Mercedes, and he wants that rush again. Only Bill Hodges, with two new, unusual allies, can apprehend the killer before he strikes again. And they have no time to lose, because Brady’s next mission, if it succeeds, will kill or maim thousands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mr. Mercedes&lt;/i&gt; is a war between good and evil, from the master of suspense whose insight into the mind of this obsessed, insane killer is chilling and unforgettable. &lt;b&gt;Now an AT&amp;amp;T Audience Original Series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; WINNER OF THE EDGAR AWARD FOR BEST NOVEL&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A “raw, relentless, and heart-poundingly real” (Ruth Ware, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author) thriller set against the harsh beauty of the Maine wilderness, &lt;i&gt;The River at Night&lt;/i&gt; charts the journey of four friends as they fight to survive the aftermath of a white water rafting accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winifred Allen needs a vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stifled by a soul-crushing job, devastated by the death of her beloved brother, and lonely after the end of a fifteen-year marriage, Wini is feeling vulnerable. So when her three best friends insist on a high-octane getaway for their annual girls’ trip, she signs on, despite her misgivings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What starts out as an invigorating hiking and rafting excursion in the remote Allagash Wilderness soon becomes an all-too-real nightmare; a freak accident leaves the women stranded, separating them from their raft and everything they need to survive. When night descends, a fire on the mountainside lures them to a ramshackle camp that appears to be their lifeline. But as Wini and her friends grasp the true intent of their supposed saviors, long buried secrets emerge and lifelong allegiances are put to the test. To survive, Wini must reach beyond the world she knows to harness an inner strength she never knew she possessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With intimately observed characters and visceral prose, &lt;i&gt;The River at Night &lt;/i&gt;“will leave you gasping, your heart racing, eyes peering over your shoulder to see what follows from behind” (Mary Kubica, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author). This is a dark exploration of creatures—both friend and foe—that you won’t soon forget.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Even the perfect marriage has its dark side… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iris and Will's marriage is as close to perfect as it can be: a large house in a nice Atlanta neighborhood, rewarding careers and the excitement of trying for their first baby. But on the morning Will leaves for a business trip to Orlando, Iris's happy world comes to an abrupt halt. Another plane headed for Seattle has crashed into a field, killing everyone on board, and according to the airline, Will was one of the passengers on this plane. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grief-stricken and confused, Iris is convinced it all must be a huge misunderstanding. But as time passes and there is still no sign of Will, she reluctantly accepts that he is gone. Still, Iris needs answers. Why did Will lie about where he was going? What is in Seattle? And what else has he lied about? As Iris sets off on a desperate quest to find out what her husband was keeping from her, the answers she receives will shock her to her very core.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a pretty good domestic thriller with a lot of twists and turns. It was easy to guess some of them but it was definitely entertaining. I still wasn't sure what was going to happen in the very end. ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A risk worth taking…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; No one would ever accuse Jace Berisha of having an easy life—considering her husband…you know…killed her. But that was then! Now she fights for mighty Viking gods with the spectacular and vicious Crows.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But things are turning very bad, very quickly because a vengeful, ancient goddess has come into the world with just one thing on her mind—ending it. And the only way they can hope to stop her is if the Crows join forces with their one-time enemies, the Protectors. A Viking Clan created to do nothing but kill every Crow they see. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Thankfully, Protector Ski Eriksen is a peace loving kind of guy. Because the woman he is desperately trying to get close to is the beautiful and not-very-chatty Jace. Battling Nordic clans? Unkillable goddesses? Jace’s mean-spirited dog? None of these things would ever get in the way of a true Viking!</description>

  <description>Gert finally realizes that being such a murderous maniac might be the reason she's not been able to find her way out of the candy-coated world of Fairyland that has been her nightmare for over forty years. She sets off on a new quest to redeem herself and tries to earn her way back home with good deeds and kindness and love and whatever other mushy, touchy-feely things she can manage. &lt;br /&gt;The epic and hilarious fantasy quest continues from fan favorite cartoonist SKOTTIE YOUNG &lt;br /&gt;Collecting issues 11 through 15. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A new romantic comedy about love, letting go, and little green men from USA Today Bestselling author Daisy Prescott.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father was abducted by aliens.&lt;br /&gt;Or so I believed for the last eighteen years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my mother's death, I moved to Roswell, capital of all things alien. I’m going to find out the truth and nothing will stop me . . . except Boone Santos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the intergalactic tinfoil hat brigade, he's a god amongst mere mortals. Too handsome for his own good (and mine), with a grumpy arrogance, and the most beautiful smile ever—he smashes my plan to pieces like a UFO crashing into the desert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a tinfoil hat for my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I believe in aliens? I’m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;What do I believe? I’m not going to fall in love with Boone. Definitely not . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A startling new vision of paranormal romance: When a human ventures into the world of vampires—a decadent milieu of blood-bonds and betrayal—she discovers that not all is what it seems.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Reyna Carpenter, giving up her body isn’t a choice. It’s survival.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a civilization laid waste by poverty and desperation, Reyna accepts a high-paying position with the wealthy and hungry vampire elite. Her new job is as the live-in blood escort for the intimidating, demanding, and devilishly handsome Beckham Anderson. He’s everything she expected from a vampire, except for one thing—he won’t feed off her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reyna soon discovers that behind Beckham’s brooding, wicked façade lies a unique and complex man. And that, in a dark and divided world, she is more valuable than she ever would have believed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For with each passing night, Reyna can’t shake the sensation that it’s Beckham who’s afraid of &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: Reyna and Beckham’s story continues in &lt;i&gt;Blood Match&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Meet the Naughty Princess Club: a brand new series from &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Tara Sivec that introduces readers to Fairytale Lane and the hilarity—and romance—that ensue when three women start a new business to make it rain.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time Cynthia was the perfect housewife. Between being the President of the PTA and keeping her home spotless without a hair (or her pearls) out of place, her life was a dream come true. Her husband was once her knight in shining armor, but now he’s run off with all their money…and the babysitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dressed as a princess at the annual Halloween block party on Fairytale Lane, she meets two other “princesses” also facing money troubles: antique store owner Ariel and librarian Isabelle. When the women are invited to wear their costumes to a party where they’re mistaken for strippers, Cindy, Ariel, and Belle realize that a career change could be the best way to make their money problems go &lt;i&gt;bippity-boppity-boo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But can structured Cindy approach a stripper pole without sanitizing wipes? And could the blue-eyed anti-prince that has been crossing her path become Cindy’s happily ever after? &lt;i&gt;At the Stroke of Midnight&lt;/i&gt; is a hilarious, empowering story where princesses can save themselves while slaying in stilettos.</description>

  <description>Dressing up as a bride once a week is all fun and games until you come face to face with your ex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penny Blake loves her job with Enchanted Bridal. She gets to model wedding gowns and help brides plan for their big day. And yet…she’s wanting a little more. Besides wishing for her own happily ever after, she has big dreams of making her own contribution to the business in the form of her own glam squad. Her bosses all think it’s a great idea, but right now she’s needed in other ways – like helping out with the groomsmen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was there any greater form of torture than having to help your sister plan her wedding?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s what Spencer Buchanan is facing and although he goes into it with a bit of an attitude, running into the girl who got away – three times! – suddenly made this whole wedding planning thing a lot more bearable. Moving back home was never part of his plan, but once Spencer sees Penny again, all bets are off. And having her help him with his fittings on his tux turn into his favorite pastime ever!</description>

  <description>I don’t know what love is anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that’s not entirely true, but I’m going to tell you a little secret: I’ve lost the spark. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the kind of spark I’m talking about? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where butterflies take flight in your stomach from two hands innocently colliding. Or catching your breath when you first meet someone attractive. Yeah, that spark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except I haven't felt that feeling in forever; there is nothing left inside of me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem--but I’m a writer on a serious deadline, and my editor is breathing down my neck for a romantic, Nicholas Sparks type love story. No pressure, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's how I find myself flying across the country to crash a wedding in the name of research, dress and heels stuffed into my small suitcase. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be the easiest book research ever. Drinking some free champagne, basking in the love of two strangers, and tapping into my romantic side. That will be a breeze. I'm a pro. I can handle this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I mistakenly end up in the wrong hotel room, naked as the day I was born, with the sexiest human I have ever met staring me down, wondering what I'm doing taking a shower in his bathroom. I don't think calling it research will get me out of this pickle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it will make for one hell of a story....</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He’s infuriating…&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dempsey Jones has been a nuisance my entire life, the straight-laced Boy Scout grown up to be a firefighter, of all things. He was the one helping kittens out of trees and old ladies cross the road while I was lighting cherry bombs with my best friend in abandoned buildings, and now that we’re all grown up—even if my Dad doesn’t agree—he’s still just as annoying. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;She’s impossible…&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Taite Ridley has been a constant my whole life, the curly haired mischievous daughter of the police chief, charming and devious and alluring. She was wild in ways I never dared to be and too big for our little town. But she’s here, a small town cop, and I can’t avoid her, even if I wanted to. &lt;br /&gt;And I don’t want to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;It’s like mixing fire and gasoline and when these two collide, someone is gonna get burned… &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Two Truths and a Lie. The girls played it all the time in their tiny cabin at Camp Nightingale. Vivian, Natalie, Allison, and first-time camper Emma Davis, the youngest of the group. The games ended when Emma sleepily watched the others sneak out of the cabin in the dead of night. The last she—or anyone—saw of them was Vivian closing the cabin door behind her, hushing Emma with a finger pressed to her lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a rising star in the New York art scene, Emma turns her past into paintings—massive canvases filled with dark leaves and gnarled branches that cover ghostly shapes in white dresses. The paintings catch the attention of Francesca Harris-White, the socialite and wealthy owner of Camp Nightingale. When Francesca implores her to return to the newly reopened camp as a painting instructor, Emma sees an opportunity to try to find out what really happened to her friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet it's immediately clear that all is not right at Camp Nightingale. Already haunted by memories from fifteen years ago, Emma discovers a security camera pointed directly at her cabin, mounting mistrust from Francesca and, most disturbing of all, cryptic clues Vivian left behind about the camp's twisted origins. As she digs deeper, Emma finds herself sorting through lies from the past while facing threats from both man and nature in the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the closer she gets to the truth about Camp Nightingale, the more she realizes it may come at a deadly price.</description>

  <description>Poppy Maysen carries a journal in her purse. Its pages were filled long ago by a man who craved adventure, lived life to the fullest and never failed to make her laugh. The journal is his birthday list—one she vows to complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’ll do the things he wanted to do most. Because maybe, just maybe, if she can finish his list, she can start to live again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy expects going through the birthday list will be hard. She expects it to hurt. But what she doesn’t expect is Cole. Could the man who watched her heart shatter be the one to put it back together again?</description>

  <description>Adalyn Sage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm thirty-seven, a mother, a divorcee, and I’m ready to date again. &lt;br /&gt;I need a man willing to love me for who I am, despite what size I am. Only finding such a guy is harder than it’s cracked up to be. Afterall, I'm a little clumsy and just a tad outspoken… that is unless I’m in front of a man so good-looking my panties melt. Then I become an absolute weirdo. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Case in point: Vice Salvatore. Stunning. Growly. And also my boss. &lt;br /&gt;Thank God his a**hole attitude put my racing heart at ease and changed my lust to hate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. I don’t care for him. Won’t. I’ll continue to ignore my ladybits and stay strong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least for a while.</description>

  <description>An unspeakable crime. A confounding investigation. At a time when the King brand has never been stronger, he has delivered one of his most unsettling and compulsively readable stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An eleven-year-old boy’s violated corpse is found in a town park. Eyewitnesses and fingerprints point unmistakably to one of Flint City’s most popular citizens. He is Terry Maitland, Little League coach, English teacher, husband, and father of two girls. Detective Ralph Anderson, whose son Maitland once coached, orders a quick and very public arrest. Maitland has an alibi, but Anderson and the district attorney soon add DNA evidence to go with the fingerprints and witnesses. Their case seems ironclad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the investigation expands and horrifying answers begin to emerge, King’s propulsive story kicks into high gear, generating strong tension and almost unbearable suspense. Terry Maitland seems like a nice guy, but is he wearing another face? When the answer comes, it will shock you as only Stephen King can.</description>

  <description>From #1 New York Times bestselling author Nora Roberts comes Shelter in Place—a powerful tale of heart, heroism . . . and propulsive suspense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a typical evening at a mall outside Portland, Maine. Three teenage friends waited for the movie to start. A boy flirted with the girl selling sunglasses. Mothers and children shopped together, and the manager at video game store tended to customers. Then the shooters arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chaos and carnage lasted only eight minutes before the killers were taken down. But for those who lived through it, the effects would last forever. In the years that followed, one would dedicate himself to a law enforcement career. Another would close herself off, trying to bury the memory of huddling in a ladies' room, helplessly clutching her cell phone--until she finally found a way to pour her emotions into her art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one person wasn't satisfied with the shockingly high death toll at the DownEast Mall. And as the survivors slowly heal, find shelter, and rebuild, they will discover that another conspirator is lying in wait--and this time, there might be nowhere safe to hide.</description>

  <description>Award-winning author Alyssa Cole’s Reluctant Royals series continues with a woman on a quest to be the heroine of her own story and the duke in shining armor she rescues along the way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York City socialite and perpetual hot mess Portia Hobbs is tired of disappointing her family, friends, and—most importantly—herself. An apprenticeship with a struggling swordmaker in Scotland is a chance to use her expertise and discover what she’s capable of. Turns out she excels at aggravating her gruff silver fox boss…when she’s not having inappropriate fantasies about his sexy Scottish burr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tavish McKenzie doesn’t need a rich, spoiled American telling him how to run his armory…even if she is infuriatingly good at it. Tav tries to rebuff his apprentice, and his attraction to her, but when Portia accidentally discovers that he’s the secret son of a duke, rough-around-the-edges Tav becomes her newest makeover project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forging metal into weapons and armor is one thing, but when desire burns out of control and the media spotlight gets too hot to bear, can a commoner turned duke and his posh apprentice find lasting love?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When life starts coming at you like a freight train, you have two options: run away screaming or lean into the hit.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first day of Fresh Meat Orientation for the Eastside Roller Girls, Jennifer and Maisie knew they’d be fast friends. But when they’re drafted to different teams, the pull of competition — and their increasingly messy personal lives — threaten to drive them apart. In roller derby you take your hits, get back up, and learn how to be a better jammer, a better blocker, a better lover, and a better friend. Derby can heal your heart...but it might break a bone or two in the process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling novelist, screenwriter, and retired Los Angeles Derby Doll Pamela Ribon (&lt;i&gt;Going In Circles, Why Girls Are Weird&lt;/i&gt;) joins artist Veronica Fish (&lt;i&gt;Archie, Silk&lt;/i&gt;) for a tale of friendship, heartbreak, and truly epic jams.</description>

  <description>All my life I looked and wondered. &lt;i&gt;Could I? Would I?&lt;/i&gt; And then, finally, I did. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I sampled a taste of that forbidden fruit, my whole world came crashing down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I’m in Edinburgh, seeking redemption with a new team and trying to rebuild my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one look at Chef Lachlan MacLeod and I’m tempted by more than what’s on the menu at his award-winning restaurant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can I? Will I? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My heart says no, but my body says yes.</description>

  <description>From #1 New York Times Bestseller, Vi Keeland, comes a sexy new standalone novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I met Chase Parker, I didn't exactly make a good impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hiding in the bathroom hallway of a restaurant, leaving a message for my best friend to save me from my awful date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He overheard and told me I was a bitch, then proceeded to offer me some dating advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I told him to mind his own damn business―his own tall, gorgeous, full-of-himself damn business―and went back to my miserable date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he walked by my table, he smirked, and I watched his arrogant, sexy ass walk back to his date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn't help but sneak hidden glances at the condescending jerk on the other side of the room. Of course, he caught me on more than one occasion, and winked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the gorgeous stranger and his equally hot date suddenly appeared at our table, I thought he was going to rat me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But instead, he pretended we knew each other and joined us―telling elaborate, embarrassing stories about our fake childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My date suddenly went from boring to bizarrely exciting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it was over and we parted ways, I thought about him more than I would ever admit, even though I knew I'd never see him again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, what were the chances I'd run into him again in a city with eight million people?Then again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What were the chances a month later he'd wind up being my new sexy boss?</description>

  <description>In 8 years, Marlon James will be one of the brightest rising stars in the music industry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bristol Gray will be his tough, no-nonsense manager. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when they first meet, she’s a college student finding her way in the world, and he’s an artist determined to make his way in it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From completely different worlds, all the things that should separate them only draw them closer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a beautiful beginning, but where will the story end? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;FLOW is the prequel chronicling the week of magical days and nights that will haunt Grip &amp;amp; Bristol for years to come. GRIP is the full-length conclusion of their story.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

I love this quote from Grip in the story, "I like the color of smart, the shade of funny, and sexy is my favorite hue.” And, wow that ending ensures I am reading Grip like ASAP.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Miss Responsibility meets Mr. Reckless&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her bridezilla friend on a DIY project rampage, bridesmaid Jane Denning will do anything to escape - even if it means babysitting the groom's troublemaker brother before the wedding. It should be a piece of cake, except the "cake" is a sarcastic former soldier who is 100% wicked hotness and absolutely off-limits.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cameron MacKinnon is ready to let loose after returning from his deployment. But first he'll have to sweet talk the ultra-responsible Jane into taking a walk on the wild side. Turns out, riling her up is the best time he's had in years. But what happens when the fun and games start to turn into something real?</description>

  <description>Written with the narrative tension of &lt;em&gt;The Road&lt;/em&gt; and the exquisite terror of classic Stephen King, &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt; is a propulsive, edge-of-your-seat horror thriller, set in an apocalyptic near-future world—a masterpiece of suspense from the brilliantly imaginative Josh Malerman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something is out there . . . &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something terrifying that must not be seen. One glimpse and a person is driven to deadly violence. No one knows what it is or where it came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years after it began, a handful of scattered survivors remain, including Malorie and her two young children. Living in an abandoned house near the river, she has dreamed of fleeing to a place where they might be safe. Now, that the boy and girl are four, it is time to go. But the journey ahead will be terrifying: twenty miles downriver in a rowboat—blindfolded—with nothing to rely on but her wits and the children’s trained ears. One wrong choice and they will die. And something is following them. But is it man, animal, or monster?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Engulfed in darkness, surrounded by sounds both familiar and frightening, Malorie embarks on a harrowing odyssey—a trip that takes her into an unseen world and back into the past, to the companions who once saved her. Under the guidance of the stalwart Tom, a motely group of strangers banded together against the unseen terror, creating order from the chaos. But when supplies ran low, they were forced to venture outside—and confront the ultimate question: in a world gone mad, who can really be trusted?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interweaving past and present, Josh Malerman’s breathtaking debut is a horrific and gripping snapshot of a world unraveled that will have you racing to the final page.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book definitely kept me guessing. I could not put it down. It wasn't a bad story. I don't know I think I wanted more. This whole story plays off the fear of the unknown. There are creatures out there walking around. If a living being sees them they will go mad. So mad that people are killing...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Holly Boldt has a secret.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, technically, she has lots of them. After a scandal uproots her entire life, she is forced to relocate to a halfway house for displaced paranormals. It’s her last shot for a fresh start. But keeping secrets isn’t easy in a town that goes through gossip faster than tissue paper, even for a powerful witch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a grisly murder rocks the small town of Beechwood Harbor, Holly finds herself unwillingly entangled in the investigation. With everyone watching, Holly must solve the case before she’s forced to abandon her new-found home and live life as a witch on the run. But with a paranormal investigator tailing her every move, a civil war brewing between her vampire and shifter roommates, and her ghostly landlord on the edge of a breakdown, she can barely think in complete sentences. How is she supposed to track down a murderer? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Holly has to make it work, or risk losing everything … again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Murder’s a Witch&lt;/i&gt; is a cozy witch mystery with a spunky twist. Come see what’s brewing in Beechwood Harbor in this first installment of &lt;i&gt;The Beechwood Harbor Magic Mystery Series&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>I couldn't have scripted a more perfect night. For one fantastic evening, at a masquerade party in the heart of Manhattan, I'm not the millionaire everyone wants a piece of. Fine-multimillionaire. But who's counting all those commas? Not me, and not the most intriguing woman I've ever met, who happens to like dancing, witty banter, and hot, passionate up-against-the-wall sex as much as I do. There's no need for names or business cards. And that's why I'm eager to get to know her more, since my mystery woman seems to like me for me, rather than for my huge...bank account. Everything's coming up aces. Until the next day when things get a little complicated. (Newsflash - a lot complicated.) *** He's charming, brilliant, an incredible lover, and right now I want to stab fate in the eyeballs. I've had one goal I've been working toward, and lo and behold, my mystery man is the very person who stands between me and my dream job. A job I desperately need since my hard-knock life has nothing in common with his star-kissed one. But it's time to put that fairytale night behind me, and focus on learning what makes him tick. Too bad it turns out his quirks are my quirks, and his love affair with New York matches mine. And as we spend our days together, I discover something else that feels like a cruel twist of fate - I'm falling for this naughty prince charming, and that's not an ending I can write to our story.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A charming British hero, the woman who tempts him, and a hands-off arrangement that's oh-so-hard to maintain.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bags are packed and I'm ready to go. All I have to do is board a plane, and I'll be on my way to fulfilling a promise I made long ago. Bonus points -- my last week in Paris looks to be even better when I meet a gorgeous, clever American woman and make plans to take her back to my flat that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before we can get together for what would surely be a fantastic final fling, my boss hits me with a double whammy. My previous client didn't pay, so there's no trip, and the new client I now desperately need is none other than the tempting American I'm about to take home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have I mentioned this timing bloody sucks? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll admit it -- I have a big weakness for a hot British accent. As in, they make me swoon, sigh, and want to toss my panties. Good thing I can avoid that kind of temptation in Paris. So it's just my luck that the man who's the key to success in my new job is the man whose voice makes me melt. Oh, and we have to spend all our days together for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot, fate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it off, I quickly learn he's witty, kind and has a heart and mind I'm falling for fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I have to do is resist him every single freaking day. That's so easy. Not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I learn that's nothing compared to the real hurdle we face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;What could go wrong with falling in love in Paris? Nearly everything, it seems...&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>When you read this book, you will make many assumptions.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume you are reading about a jealous ex-wife.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume she is obsessed with her replacement – a beautiful, younger woman who is about to marry the man they both love. &lt;br /&gt;You will assume you know the anatomy of this tangled love triangle.&lt;br /&gt;Assume nothing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twisted and deliciously chilling, Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen's &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; exposes the secret complexities of an enviable marriage - and the dangerous truths we ignore in the name of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read between the lies. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Eisner Award-nominated writer Kelly Sue DeConnick (Pretty Deadly, Captain Marvel) and Valentine De Landro (X-Factor) team up to bring you the premiere volume of Bitch Planet, a deliciously vicious riff on women-in-prison sci-fi exploitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a future just a few years down the road in the wrong direction, a woman's failure to comply with her patriarchal overlords will result in exile to the meanest penal planet in the galaxy. When the newest crop of fresh femmes arrive, can they work together to stay alive or will hidden agendas, crooked guards, and the deadliest sport on (or off!) Earth take them to their maker?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collects BITCH PLANET #1-5.</description>

  <description>It was hate at first sight...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Affton&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hated Cable James McCaffrey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was entitled, spoiled, a user…and an addict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was out of control and didn’t bother trying to hide it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He had everything anyone could want but still seemed miserable and lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every move he made, every mistake he stumbled his way through, rubbed me the wrong way. However, I couldn’t stop myself from trying to save him from himself when no one else would. In the sweltering heat of the summer, Cable taught me that having it all means nothing if you can’t have the one thing you want more than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was obsessed with Affton Reed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was rigid, uptight, and no fun. There was something about her innate goodness that called to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She acted like she was above all the normal faults and failures that clung to the rest of us like the scent of smoke after a fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was infatuated with her, but that didn’t stop me from acting like she didn’t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the scorching heat of summer, Affton taught me that there is always a way back from the brink of despair. She showed me that the trick to having it all was realizing that it was already there, in my hands. All I had to do was hold onto it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The road to recovery is full of twists and turns no matter who is in the driver’s seat.</description>

  <description>While most of the world has drowned beneath the sudden rising waters of a climate apocalypse, Dinétah (formerly the Navajo reservation) has been reborn. The gods and heroes of legend walk the land, but so do monsters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggie Hoskie is a Dinétah monster hunter, a supernaturally gifted killer. When a small town needs help finding a missing girl, Maggie is their last—and best—hope. But what Maggie uncovers about the monster is much larger and more terrifying than anything she could imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggie reluctantly enlists the aid of Kai Arviso, an unconventional medicine man, and together they travel to the rez to unravel clues from ancient legends, trade favors with tricksters, and battle dark witchcraft in a patchwork world of deteriorating technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Maggie discovers the truth behind the disappearances, she will have to confront her past—if she wants to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the Sixth World.</description>

  <description>Coming of age in a culture that demands women be as small, quiet, and compliant as possible--like a porcelain dove that will also have sex with you--writer and humorist Lindy West quickly discovered that she was anything but. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a painfully shy childhood in which she tried, unsuccessfully, to hide her big body and even bigger opinions; to her public war with stand-up comedians over rape jokes; to her struggle to convince herself, and then the world, that fat people have value; to her accidental activism and never-ending battle royale with Internet trolls, Lindy narrates her life with a blend of humor and pathos that manages to make a trip to the abortion clinic funny and wring tears out of a story about diarrhea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With inimitable good humor, vulnerability, and boundless charm, Lindy boldly shares how to survive in a world where not all stories are created equal and not all bodies are treated with equal respect, and how to weather hatred, loneliness, harassment, and loss--and walk away laughing. &lt;i&gt;Shrill&lt;/i&gt; provocatively dissects what it means to become self-aware the hard way, to go from wanting to be silent and invisible to earning a living defending the silenced in all caps.</description>

      <![CDATA[I loved this book because while it is not perfect it is what it promised a book written by and about humans and humans are definitely not perfect. I could relate to a lot of the anger in this book as a fat woman myself. It is easy to dismiss the feelings of fat people that fat shaming doesn’t exi...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"Good Morning Malibu, it’s another beautiful day on the west coast! I'm Noely Clark, your host: and I'm in the market for love…”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the publicity team of the new local restaurant, Going in Blind, began their search for a hot, local celebrity to promote the wildly popular eatery, they couldn’t have found a better person than me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Outgoing? Check.&lt;br /&gt;Single? Check.&lt;br /&gt;Open to finding love? Check. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I signed up immediately. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A hopeless romantic with an exceedingly demanding schedule, I've found it impossible to find the man of my dreams — so Going in Blind seems too good to be true! That’s until they start setting me up on dates — three very different, very attractive, very distinct blind dates — and only one thing is for certain...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m in big trouble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Good Morning Malibu,&lt;br /&gt;I'm Noely Clark, and I have a choice to make.&lt;br /&gt;The question is who will I choose; the suit, the rebel, or the jock.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>If someone were to ask Jasmine Santos to describe the last few years of her life with a single word, it would definitely be a four-letter one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seventeen years—and countless broken bones and broken promises—she knows her window to compete in figure skating is coming to a close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the offer of a lifetime comes in from an arrogant idiot she’s spent the last decade dreaming about pushing in the way of a moving bus, Jasmine might have to reconsider everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Including Ivan Lukov.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;6 hrs 24 mins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthropologist Jillian Ramsay's career has taken a turn south.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerned that technology is about to chase mythological creatures out into the open (how long can Sasquatch stay hidden from Google maps?), the League for Interspecies Cooperation is sending Jillian to Louisiana on a fact-finding mission. While the League hopes to hold on to secrecy for a little bit longer, they're preparing for the worst in terms of human reactions. They need a plan, so they look to Mystic Bayou, a tiny town hidden in the swamp where humans and supernatural residents have been living in harmony for generations. Mermaids and gator shifters swim in the bayou. Spirit bottles light the front porches after twilight. Dragons light the fires under crayfish pots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jillian's first assignment for the League could be her last. Mystic Bayou is wary of outsiders, and she has difficulty getting locals to talk to her. And she can't get the gruff town sheriff, Bael Boone, off of her back or out of her mind. Bael is the finest male specimen she's seen in a long time, even though he might not be human. Soon their flirtation is hotter than a dragon's breath, which Bael just might turn out to be....</description>

  <description>Alex Bishop is your typical cowboy.&lt;br /&gt;Charming, sexy, and wears a panty-melting smirk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working on the ranch helped build his solid eight-pack and smoking body. He's every girl's wet fantasy, and he knows it too. Alex doesn't follow the rules of your typical playboy bachelor. After wining and dining his dates and giving them the best night of their lives, he always sends flowers and calls the next day—even if it's to say, let's just be friends. His mama taught him manners after all, and his Southern blood knows how to be a gentleman. Still, that isn’t enough to tame the wildest of the Bishop brothers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;River Lancaster has finally met the man of her dreams. Too bad after six months of romantic bliss, she finds out he's married. With a broken heart and blind rage, she books herself a ticket to Key West, Florida. Tired of cheaters and liars, she’s set on escaping to forget he ever existed. Who needs a man when there's an all-you-can-drink margarita bar, anyway? That's what she tells herself until she bumps into the right guy who can make all those bad memories disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Even if it's only temporarily.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks on the beach is what they both need. No strings attached, no expectations, no broken hearts. Too bad the universe has other plans—one that'll change the entire course of their lives in just nine short months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is book 1 in the Bishop Brothers series. Each book features a different brother and can be read as a complete standalone. HEA guaranteed!&lt;br /&gt;**Not suitable for readers under 18 due to adult language and sexual content.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A new kind of love story about flipping houses, taking risks, and landing that special someone who’s move-in ready…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHE’S GOT CURB APPEAL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rian Sutter grew up with the finer things in life. Spending summers in The Hamptons was a normal occurrence for her until her parents lost everything years ago. Now Rian and her sister are getting their life, and finances, back on track through real estate. Not only do they buy and sell houses to the rich and famous, but they finally have the capital to flip their very own beachfront property. But when she inadvertently catches the attention of a sexy stranger who snaps up every house from under her, all bets are off…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HE’S A FIXER UPPER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pierce Whitfield doesn’t normally demo kitchens, install dry wall, or tear apart a beautiful woman’s dreams. He’s just a down-on-his-luck lawyer who needed a break from the city and agreed to help his brother work on a few homes in the Hamptons. When he first meets Rian, the attraction is undeniable. But when they start competing for the same pieces of prime real estate, the early sparks turn into full-blown fireworks. Can these passionate rivals turn up the heat on their budding romance — without burning down the house?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I FLIPPING LOVE YOU, set in the &lt;i&gt;Shacking Up&lt;/i&gt; world, follows two people, both working in real estate, who find themselves vying for the same properties in the Hamptons, leading to a sometimes-not-so-friendly competition.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I am fan of Helena Hunting’s romantic comedies. She writes stories that are funny, sweet, and full of heart. I Flipping Love You is no exception. The story starts out with a woman being accused of hitting a hot guy’s car all the while she has a monster wedgie from her thong. It’s this kind of rea...]]>

  <description>Curvy girl Pepper is accustomed to flying under everyone’s radar. Being a big girl hasn’t led to many dates or exciting adventures. All of that was about to change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the small-town rumor mill, Pepper learns her old teenage crush just moved back to town. Jason was the star quarterback, prom king, and also Pepper’s neighbor from across the street. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day he sees Pepper out mowing the lawn and makes her an offer of no-strings attached, no-holds barred sex that has the potential to benefit them both. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing quite turns out the way either of them thought it would. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click to look inside and find out what happens when the simple act of mowing the lawn turns into so much more… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: This story contains a plentiful amount of graphic sex scenes (over EIGHT of them…yes, I counted…including ones involving Barbeque Sauce, Pirates, Ice Cubes, and Handcuffs). They are all M/F and absolutely consensual. If you’re looking for a sick, twisted, dark tale – please go elsewhere, you will NOT find it here. All my stories come with a guarantee that you will crack a smile, find a happily-ever-after ending, and never have to deal with an annoying cliffhanger. There’s also no cheating, no love triangles, no unicorns, and no murder.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From subway to Broadway to happily ever after. Modern love in all its thrill, hilarity, and uncertainty has never been so compulsively readable as in New York Times bestselling author Christina Lauren’s romantic novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marriages of convenience are so...inconvenient. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For months Holland Bakker has invented excuses to descend into the subway station near her apartment, drawn to the captivating music performed by her street musician crush. Lacking the nerve to actually talk to the gorgeous stranger, fate steps in one night in the form of a drunken attacker. Calvin Mcloughlin rescues her, but quickly disappears when the police start asking questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the only resource she has to pay the brilliant musician back, Holland gets Calvin an audition with her uncle, Broadway’s hottest musical director. When the tryout goes better than even Holland could have imagined, Calvin is set for a great entry into Broadway—until his reason for disappearing earlier becomes clear: he’s in the country illegally, his student visa having expired years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing that her uncle needs Calvin as much as Calvin needs him, a wild idea takes hold of her. Impulsively, she marries the Irishman, her infatuation a secret only to him. As their relationship evolves and Calvin becomes the darling of Broadway—in the middle of the theatrics and the acting-not-acting—will Holland and Calvin to realize that they both stopped pretending a long time ago?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An outlaw motorcycle club sets up shop next door to Sea Haven in the dangerously sexy new series from #1 New York Times bestselling author Christine Feehan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the enforcer of the Torpedo Ink motorcycle club, Reaper lives for riding and fighting. He's a stone-cold killer who turns his wrath on those who deserve it. Feelings are a weakness he can't afford--until a gorgeous bartender gets under his skin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Near Sea Haven, the small town of Caspar has given Anya Rafferty a new lease on life. And she's desperate to hold on to her job at the biker bar, even if the scariest member of the club seems to have it out for her. But Reaper's imposing presence and smoldering looks just ratchet up the heat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anya's touch is everything Reaper doesn't want--and it brands him to the bone.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love is just around the corner . . . &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet, shy Mara Hanover is in love with her neighbor. For four years, she has secretly watched her dream man from afar. Handsome police detective Mitch Lawson is way out of her league. She's a girl from the wrong side of the tracks, and there's no way a guy like Mitch would want anything to do with her. But when Mara has a leaky faucet that she can't fix, it's Mitch who comes to her rescue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitch has been eyeing his beautiful neighbor for a long time. He jumps at the chance to help her, and soon their formerly platonic relationship gets very hot and heavy. But when Mara gets a disturbing phone call from her cousin's kids, she gets pulled back into the life she's tried so hard to leave behind. Can the hot law man convince Mara to let go of her past-and build a future with him?</description>

  <description>New York Times best selling author Gena Showalter returns with a sizzling Original Heartbreakers tale, featuring a rough, tough bad boy brought to his knees by... a kindergarten teacher? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The king of one-night stands...&lt;br /&gt;To inherit--and destroy--his father’s business at long last, Brock Hudson needs a temporary wife. The ruthless ex-military heartthrob has always avoided romantic entanglements. Women are sweet, but vengeance will be sweeter. Or so he thinks. Only one woman will do, but the vulnerable beauty is more than he bargained for—sexier, wittier, and utterly irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The queen of the deep freeze…&lt;br /&gt;After an abusive first marriage, Lyndie Scott has sworn off relationships. But still she longs for a child of her own. Turns out, the brawler who used to frighten her with only a glance is the answer to her problems. She agrees to his proposal, with a caveat: spend every night in bed with her, then walk away for good when it’s time to divorce. Even if she’s pregnant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A marriage of breathtaking inconvenience... &lt;br /&gt;As the days pass too quickly and the nights heat up, Brock battles a sense of possession and obsession. Will the former commitment-phobe convince his wife they’re better off together, or will she pack her bags and go?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Set in the same world as Faith Hunter’s New York Times bestselling Jane Yellowrock novels, the third, thrilling Soulwood novel stars Nell Ingram, who draws her powers from deep within the earth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nell Ingram has always known she was different. Since she was a child, she’s been able to feel and channel ancient powers from deep within the earth. When she met Jane Yellowrock, her entire life changed, and she was recruited into PsyLED—the Homeland Security division that polices paranormals. But now her newly formed unit is about to take on its toughest case yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A powerful senator barely survives an assassination attempt that leaves many others dead—and the house he was visiting burns to the ground. Invisible to security cameras, the assassin literally disappears, and Nell’s team is called in. As they track a killer they know is more—or less—than human, they unravel a web of dark intrigue and malevolent motives that tests them to their limits and beyond.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Two girls are forced into the woods at gunpoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One runs for her life. One is left behind . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-eight years ago, Charlotte and Samantha Quinn’s happy small-town family life was torn apart by a terrifying attack on their family home. It left their mother dead. It left their father—Pikeville’s notorious defense attorney—devastated. And it left the family fractured beyond repair, consumed by secrets from that terrible night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-eight years later, Charlie has followed in her father’s footsteps to become a lawyer herself—the ideal good daughter. But when violence comes to Pikeville again—and a shocking tragedy leaves the whole town traumatized—Charlie is plunged into a nightmare. Not only is she the first witness on the scene, but it’s a case that unleashes the terrible memories she’s spent so long trying to suppress. Because the shocking truth about the crime that destroyed her family nearly thirty years ago won’t stay buried forever . . .</description>

  <description>NOS4A2 is a spine-tingling novel of supernatural suspense from master of horror Joe Hill, the New York Times bestselling author of Heart-Shaped Box and Horns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victoria McQueen has a secret gift for finding things: a misplaced bracelet, a missing photograph, answers to unanswerable questions. On her Raleigh Tuff Burner bike, she makes her way to a rickety covered bridge that, within moments, takes her wherever she needs to go, whether it’s across Massachusetts or across the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Talent Manx has a way with children. He likes to take them for rides in his 1938 Rolls-Royce Wraith with the NOS4A2 vanity plate. With his old car, he can slip right out of the everyday world, and onto the hidden roads that transport them to an astonishing – and terrifying – playground of amusements he calls “Christmasland.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then, one day, Vic goes looking for trouble—and finds Manx. That was a lifetime ago. Now Vic, the only kid to ever escape Manx’s unmitigated evil, is all grown up and desperate to forget. But Charlie Manx never stopped thinking about Victoria McQueen. He’s on the road again and he’s picked up a new passenger: Vic’s own son.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Gena Showalter is back with a sizzling Original Heartbreakers tale about an icy war vet and the only woman capable of melting him…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With trust issues a mile long, Ryanne Wade has sworn off men.  Then Jude Laurent walks into her bar and all bets are off.  The former Army Ranger has suffered unimaginably, first being maimed in battle then losing his wife and daughters to a drunk driver. Making the brooding widower smile is priority one. Resisting him? Impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Jude, Ryanne is off limits. And yet the beautiful bartender who serves alcohol to potential motorists tempts him like no other. When a rival bar threatens her livelihood, and her life, he can’t turn away.  She triggers something in him he thought long buried, and he’s determined to protect her, whatever the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their already scorching attraction continues to heat, the damaged soldier knows he must let go of his past to hold on to his future...or risk losing the second chance he desperately needs.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;From acclaimed author Alyssa Cole comes the tale of a city Cinderella &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;and her Prince Charming in disguise . . .&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between grad school and multiple jobs, Naledi Smith doesn’t have time for fairy tales…or patience for the constant e-mails claiming she’s betrothed to an African prince. Sure. Right. &lt;em&gt;Delete! &lt;/em&gt;As a former foster kid, she’s learned that the only things she can depend on are herself and the scientific method, and a silly e-mail won’t convince her otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince Thabiso is the sole heir to the throne of Thesolo, shouldering the hopes of his parents and his people. At the top of their list? His marriage. Ever dutiful, he tracks down his missing betrothed. When Naledi mistakes the prince for a pauper, Thabiso can’t resist the chance to experience life—and love—without the burden of his crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chemistry between them is instant and irresistible, and flirty friendship quickly evolves into passionate nights. But when the truth is revealed, can a princess in theory become a princess ever after?</description>

  <description>When the new girl in town, Eliza “Izzy” Forrester decides to hit the local drinking hole, she’s not ready to meet the town’s good, solid guy. She’s definitely not prepared to engage in her very first hookup with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Izzy wakes up the next morning in Johnny Gamble’s bed and good girl Izzy finds she likes being bad for Johnny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, Izzy feels Johnny holding her at arm’s length. But Johnny makes it clear he wants more and Izzy already knows she wants as much of hot-in-bed, sweet-out-of-it Johnny Gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floating on air thinking this is going somewhere, Izzy quickly learns why Johnny holds distant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s in love with someone else. Someone who left him and did it leaving him broken. Whoever was up next would be runner up, second best. Knowing the stakes, Izzy will take what she can get from the gentleman that’s Johnny Gamble. And even knowing his heart might never mend, Johnny can’t seem to stay away from Izzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until out of nowhere, his lost love comes back to town. He’s not going back, but Johnny still knows the right thing to do is let Izzy go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Izzy knew the stakes, so she makes it easy and slips through his fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that’s before Johnny realizes Eliza moved to town to escape danger that’s been swirling around her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that’s why Johnny decides to wade in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That and the fact Eliza Forrester makes breakfast with a canary singing on her shoulder and fills out tight dresses in a way Johnny Gamble cannot get out of his head.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Get ready for your next favorite romantic comedy, THE REAL DEAL!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April Hamilton wants you to know she hasn't been on Craigslist since that time she sold her futon after college. She doesn't even spend &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; much time online. And even if she did, she would not be looking up personal ads. But going home alone for her family's summer reunion is an invitation for every single relative to butt into her personal life. She simply can't handle another blind date with the butcher, the baker or the candlestick maker from her hometown. So when she finds the Craigslist ad for a boyfriend-for-hire, she's ready to pay to play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Heading Home and Need a Buffer? I'm the REAL DEAL.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo Banks has been running from the past for years. He's &lt;i&gt;this &lt;/i&gt;close to finally settling all his debts, and one more job as a boyfriend-for-hire will do the trick. He's no gigolo. &lt;i&gt;Please&lt;/i&gt;. He's something of an actor, and he knows how to slip into any role, including pretending to be April's new beau -- the bad boy with the heart of gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it means sleeping in close quarters in that tiny little bed in her parents' inn. Even if it means spinning tales of a romance that starts to feel all too true. What neither one of them counts on is that amid the egg toss, the arm wrestling, and a fierce game of Lawn Twister that has them tangled up together, they might be feeling the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She only wanted to show her family once and for all that she had no need to settle down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He didn't expect to have the time of his life at her parent's home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They didn't plan on loving every single second of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But can a masterful game of pretend result in true love?</description>

  <description> han·gry  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;/haNGɡrē/&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;adjective informal&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;bad-tempered or irritable as a result of hunger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"I get very hangry if I miss a meal"&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From USA Today bestselling author Lily Kate comes a brand new series...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;b&gt;Ladies &amp;amp; Gents, &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I sold my soul for a &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;hamburger&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And I have no regrets. When a girl is trapped indefinitely in an elevator with a smoking hot burger and an empty stomach, even the strongest of women will crumble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The story goes like this: Bradley Hamilton, former professional hockey player and the most frustrating human alive, offered me half of his hamburger in exchange for a date. I took him up on the offer—while under duress—and now I’m stuck with the consequences. Specifically, the scorching kiss that has me drooling for more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, there’s one whopper of a problem. This man has been a thorn in my side for the last twenty years—ever since he moved next door and became my older brother’s best friend. We’ve gone head to head for years, and now, he’s trying to buy out my restaurant in order to plop one of his big fat gyms there instead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I refuse to let him ruin my business. Unfortunately, Bradley Hamilton is like an order of french fries: you just can’t have one. It appears our lips are addicted to kissing. He’s alarmingly handsome. Deliciously confident. And worst of all? Underneath that salty exterior he’s starting to show signs of sweet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Brad Hamilton is my guilty pleasure, my cheat meal, my greatest craving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Which is why he’ll be one habit that’s hard to kick. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a full-length, standalone romantic comedy with an HEA. It is intended for audiences 18+ due to mature content including romance, language, and ridiculously fun times.</description>

  <description>At Twin Oaks Country Club, there are the fortunate ones, and then there are the rest of us: the waiters, the caddies, the valets, and in my case, the cabana girls. Most days, I’m poolside in a pleated skirt, dishing out margaritas to tycoons and titans. It’s not exactly my dream job, but it does come with one perk…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;James Ashwood.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s my silver lining in a custom black suit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides being a legacy member at the club, he’s a tech mogul and Austin’s most eligible bachelor. Oh, and those dimples? &lt;i&gt;Yeah&lt;/i&gt;, they make my stomach dip too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On good days, I catch his sleek Porsche winding down the tree-lined drive. On better days, I steal a glimpse of his handsome profile as we pass in the hall. And on the absolute best day, I find him alone at the bar, looking for company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Come have a seat.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those four little words set me down a path I never could have imagined. Private planes, penthouse suites, and temptations around every corner make it impossible to keep my distance. His world feels decadent and wild—but overindulgence comes with a cost. Every kiss comes with strings. Every erotic encounter is a promise I’m not ready to keep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I pump the brakes, he hits the gas. James doesn’t want to go slow—he wants a commitment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the thing about the fortunate ones?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re used to getting what they want.</description>

  <description>After the death of her beloved grandmother, a Cuban-American woman travels to Havana, where she discovers the roots of her identity--and unearths a family secret hidden since the revolution...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Havana, 1958. The daughter of a sugar baron, nineteen-year-old Elisa Perez is part of Cuba's high society, where she is largely sheltered from the country's growing political unrest--until she embarks on a clandestine affair with a passionate revolutionary...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miami, 2017. Freelance writer Marisol Ferrera grew up hearing romantic stories of Cuba from her late grandmother Elisa, who was forced to flee with her family during the revolution. Elisa's last wish was for Marisol to scatter her ashes in the country of her birth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving in Havana, Marisol comes face-to-face with the contrast of Cuba's tropical, timeless beauty and its perilous political climate. When more family history comes to light and Marisol finds herself attracted to a man with secrets of his own, she'll need the lessons of her grandmother's past to help her understand the true meaning of courage.</description>

  <description>This is an alternate cover for ISBN: 9781458095190&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Douglas Ashton is the cold and unfeeling owner of the gothic Victorian Mansion, Sommersgate House. Julia Fairfax is his stubborn American sister-in-law. After tragedy strikes, Douglas and Julia are forced to live together at Sommersgate and raise their newly orphaned nieces and nephew. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Douglas has no desire to raise his dead sister’s children nor does he want the distraction of the tempting Julia living under his roof. Julia is struggling with grief and trying to make a go in a new country without much help from impossibly handsome but even more impossibly remote Douglas. Not to mention, she has to deal with the active hostility of Douglas’s frosty, Attila-the-Hun-in-a-skirt mother, Monique. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Douglas decides the best way to give the children what they need, get his mother to behave and give himself what he wants is to marry Julia. When he tells her (yes, tells her) she will be his wife, Julia thinks Douglas is (probably) insane. And anyway, she’s decided if she ever has another husband (since the last one wasn’t so great), he was going to be short, balding, have a paunch and worship the ground she walks on (none of these characteristics define Douglas in the slightest). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, Sommersgate House is haunted by the ghosts of the man who built the house and the woman who was the love of his life. They both died mysteriously at Sommersgate months after it was finished. When they did, a curse settled on the house making it seem strangely alive. And the only way for the beautiful but frightening house to rid itself of this curse is for its owner to find true love.</description>

      <![CDATA[More 3.5 stars and I rounded up. I liked this story it was cute and cheesy. It was also full of feisty heroines and the alpha males who think they are in control. But, maybe it was just me but I didn't really like the whole story being told in a third person POV. Just a little thing I guess. It j...]]>

  <description>Have you ever felt like you were living your life for a future that was predetermined? Like there was some bigger picture you just prayed you would someday see clearly? That picture has been crystal clear to me since I was old enough to recognize it for just what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Or I should say recognize him for who he was.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve loved Cohen Cage since I was a small child. He’s been my everything for the last twenty-two years. I’ve loved him through every girlfriend he’s ever brought home. Through his college years and then mine. I’ve loved him through two deployments. And ever since the day I told him how I felt, he’s acted like I’m a stranger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;My name is Danielle Reid, and it’s time for me to get my man. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our future is an unexpected fate, and no matter what our parents, siblings, and friends say…it’s going to be worth every second of the fight to make it happen.</description>

  <description>Three years ago, Madison Culver disappeared when her family was choosing a Christmas tree in Oregon’s Skookum National Forest. She would be eight years old now—if she has survived. Desperate to find their beloved daughter, certain someone took her, the Culvers turn to Naomi, a private investigator with an uncanny talent for locating the lost and missing. Known to the police and a select group of parents as &lt;i&gt;The Child Finder,&lt;/i&gt; Naomi is their last hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naomi’s methodical search takes her deep into the icy, mysterious forest in the Pacific Northwest, and into her own fragmented past. She understands children like Madison because once upon a time, she was a lost girl too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Naomi relentlessly pursues and slowly uncovers the truth behind Madison’s disappearance, shards of a dark dream pierce the defenses that have protected her, reminding her of a terrible loss she feels but cannot remember. If she finds Madison, will Naomi ultimately unlock the secrets of her own life?</description>

  <description>Violet Winters once had it all but lost it when her husband was murdered by a criminal madman. During a cold winter night Violet has to leave her warm bed to tell her neighbor to turn the music down. And that’s when she meets sinister, scarred, scarily attractive security specialist, Joe Callahan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She wants to deny it, but Violet can’t beat back the hunger she feels for Joe so she gives in again and again. Feeling it himself, Joe feeds Vi’s hunger, breaking his own rules to keep her in his bed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though Violet had only one man in her life, she’s sure Joe is giving her the signals and Vi decides she’s ready to take a second chance at life and, maybe, love. But Violet doesn’t know the dark secrets in Joe’s past, secrets so soul-wrenching, they’ve drained him dry. With nothing left to give, Joe’s determined to live his life alone and he breaks Violet’s heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crushed by Joe’s betrayal, Violet comes to terms with the fact that, no matter what signals he gave, Joe was not theirs to win. But Violet’s husband’s murderer is obsessed with her and heartbreak again haunts the door of the Winters home. When it does Joe is forced to face the knowledge that he can’t fight Violet’s pull, she’s under his skin and filled him full to bursting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe needs to win her back and put his life on the line to keep Violet safe. But, having had it all once, can Violet endure losing Joe?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He’s been a bad, bad rake—and it takes a governess to teach him a lesson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The accidental governess.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her livelihood slips through her fingers, Alexandra Mountbatten takes on an impossible post: transforming a pair of wild orphans into proper young ladies. However, the girls don’t need discipline. They need a loving home. Try telling that to their guardian, Chase Reynaud: duke’s heir in the streets and devil in the sheets. The ladies of London have tried—and failed—to make him settle down. Somehow, Alexandra must reach his heart... without risking her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The infamous rake.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any self-respecting libertine, Chase lives by one rule: no attachments. When a stubborn little governess tries to reform him, he decides to give her an education—in pleasure. That should prove he can’t be tamed. But Alexandra is more than he bargained for: clever, perceptive, passionate. She refuses to see him as a lost cause. Soon the walls around Chase’s heart are crumbling... and he’s in danger of falling, hard.</description>

  <description>A last minute decision throws two people together who never should have met and has the potential to spin their lives in a whole new direction...if they're bold enough to take a chance on love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the top collegiate shortstop in the country, Ryan O’Donnell’s life is about discipline. But a growing restlessness causes him to bail on his baseball team over spring break to join his buddies at a singles resort. He just needs one week to escape his life, and then he’ll get back on track. But moments after arriving he meets HER, and the world as he knows it changes irrevocably. It should only be a hookup—that’s what spring break’s all about—but one taste of this sexy, vibrant woman isn’t enough. He has to have her. Even if it’s only for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie Valentine—yes, that Valentine—just found out her siblings want to sell off Crazy Hearts—the Peeps of the Valentine’s Day world. Upset, she takes off with her friends on their spring break vacation. She only wanted an escape—she never imagined meeting HIM. But he’s about to start a Major League Baseball career, and she’s launching a fight for her family legacy. They have no future. It’s just…she’s never felt this way for anyone before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are they really going to walk away from this kind of connection…this passion?</description>

  <description>On her way to Utah to see her dying mother, college student Darby Thorne gets caught in a fierce blizzard in the mountains of Colorado. With the roads impassable, she’s forced to wait out the storm at a remote highway rest stop. Inside, are some vending machines, a coffee maker, and four complete strangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to find a signal to call home, Darby goes back out into the storm . . . and makes a horrifying discovery. In the back of the van parked next to her car, a little girl is locked in an animal crate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is the child? Why has she been taken? And how can Darby save her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no cell phone reception, no telephone, and no way out. One of her fellow travelers is a kidnapper. But which one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped in an increasingly dangerous situation, with a child’s life and her own on the line, Darby must find a way to break the girl out of the van and escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But who can she trust?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Every time Gwen closed her eyes, she saw him in her nightmares. Now her eyes are open, and he’s not going away.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gwen Proctor won the battle to save her kids from her ex-husband, serial killer Melvin Royal, and his league of psychotic accomplices. But the war isn’t over. Not since Melvin broke out of prison. Not since she received a chilling text…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;You’re not safe anywhere now.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her refuge at Stillhouse Lake has become a trap. Gwen leaves her children in the protective custody of a fortified, well-armed neighbor. Now, with the help of Sam Cade, brother of one of Melvin’s victims, Gwen is going hunting. She’s learned how from one of the sickest killers alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what she’s up against is beyond anything she feared—a sophisticated and savage mind game calculated to destroy her. As trust beyond her small circle of friends begins to vanish, Gwen has only fury and vengeance to believe in as she closes in on her prey. And sure as the night, one of them will die.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Gena Showalter returns with an irresistible Original Heartbreakers story about a woman who's never felt desired and the man who wants her more than air to breathe…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bullied in high school, Dorothea Mathis's past is full of memories she'd rather forget. But there's one she can't seem to shake—her long-standing crush on former army ranger Daniel Porter. Now that the sexy bad boy has started using her inn as his personal playground, she should kick him out…but his every heated glance makes her want to join him instead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel returned to Strawberry Valley, Oklahoma, to care for his ailing father and burn off a little steam with no strings attached. Though he craves curvy Dorothea night and day, he's as marred by his past as she is by hers. The more he desires her, the more he fears losing her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But every sizzling encounter leaves him desperate for more, and soon Daniel must make a choice: take a chance on love or walk away forever.</description>

  <description>Gladiator meets Game of Thrones: a royal woman becomes a skilled warrior to destroy her murderous cousin, avenge her family, and save her kingdom in this first entry in a dazzling fantasy epic from the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of the Elemental Assassin series—an enthralling tale that combines magic, murder, intrigue, adventure, and a hint of romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a realm where one’s magical power determines one’s worth, Lady Everleigh’s lack of obvious ability relegates her to the shadows of the royal court of Bellona, a kingdom steeped in gladiator tradition. Seventeenth in line for the throne, Evie is nothing more than a ceremonial fixture, overlooked and mostly forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But dark forces are at work inside the palace. When her cousin Vasilia, the crown princess, assassinates her mother the queen and takes the throne by force, Evie is also attacked, along with the rest of the royal family. Luckily for Evie, her secret immunity to magic helps her escape the massacre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forced into hiding to survive, she falls in with a gladiator troupe. Though they use their talents to entertain and amuse the masses, the gladiators are actually highly trained warriors skilled in the art of war, especially Lucas Sullivan, a powerful magier with secrets of his own. Uncertain of her future—or if she even has one—Evie begins training with the troupe until she can decide her next move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the bloodthirsty Vasilia exerts her power, pushing Bellona to the brink of war, Evie’s fate becomes clear: she must become a fearsome gladiator herself . . . and kill the queen.</description>

  <description>After a painful loss, Cady Moreland is coming to Magdalene to start the next chapter of her life. A chapter that began eighteen years ago but had a heartbreaking ending. The time in between was full of family and friendship, but Cady could never get the man she fell in love with all those years ago out of her heart.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Coert Yeager has learned to live without the girl who entered his life right when she shouldn’t and exited delivering a crippling blow he never would have suspected. The time in between was full of failing to find what he was missing…and life-altering betrayal.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when that girl shows up in Magdalene and buys the town’s beloved lighthouse, even if Coert wants to avoid her, he can’t. A fire in town sparks a different kind of flame that won’t be ignored.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Cady and Coert question the actions of the two young adults they once were thrown into earth-shattering circumstances, can they learn from what came in between and find each other again?</description>

  <description>Beth’s life hasn’t been the same since her sister died. Her parents try to lock her down, believing they can keep her safe by monitoring her every move. When Beth sneaks out to a party one night and meets the new guy in town, Chase, she’s thrilled to make a secret friend. It seems a small thing, just for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Beth doesn’t know how big her secret really is…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh out of juvie and determined to start his life over, Chase has demons to face and much to atone for, including his part in the night Beth’s sister died. Beth, who has more reason than anyone to despise him, is willing to give him a second chance. A forbidden romance is the last thing either of them planned for senior year, but the more time they spend together, the deeper their feelings get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Beth has a choice to make—follow the rules, or risk tearing everything apart…again.</description>

  <description>Lord Alaric Wilde, son of the Duke of Lindow, is the most celebrated man in England, revered for his dangerous adventures and rakish good looks. Arriving home from years abroad, he has no idea of his own celebrity until his boat is met by mobs of screaming ladies. Alaric escapes to his father’s castle, but just as he grasps that he’s not only famous but notorious, he encounters the very private, very witty, Miss Willa Ffynche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willa presents the façade of a serene young lady to the world. Her love of books and bawdy jokes is purely for the delight of her intimate friends. She wants nothing to do with a man whose private life is splashed over every newspaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alaric has never met a woman he wanted for his own . . . until he meets Willa. He’s never lost a battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a spirited woman like Willa isn’t going to make it easy. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this thrilling and suspenseful fantasy, set in the world of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Others series, Vicki DeVine and her lodger, the shapeshifter Aggie Crowe, stumble onto a dead body . . . and find themselves enmeshed in danger and dark secrets.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Human laws do not apply in the territory controlled by the Others–vampires, shapeshifters, and paranormal beings even more deadly. And this is a fact that humans should never, ever forget . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her divorce, Vicki DeVine took over a rustic resort near Lake Silence, in a human town that is not human controlled. Towns like Vicki’s have no distance from the Others, the dominant predators that rule most of the land and all of the water throughout the world. And when a place has no boundaries, you never really know what’s out there watching you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vicki was hoping to find a new career and a new life. But when her lodger, Aggie Crowe–one of the shapeshifting Others–discovers a dead body, Vicki finds trouble instead. The detectives want to pin the man’s death on her, despite the evidence that nothing human could have killed the victim. As Vicki and her friends search for answers, things get dangerous–and it’ll take everything they have to stay alive.</description>

  <description>A teen werewolf finally meets her destined soulmate only to discover that he's not quite what she expected in this steamy debut romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's met her mate . . . and he's met his match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Megan Ross has been waiting her whole life for her mate to come and sweep her off her feet.

Instead, he's a warrior, one whose suffering has led him to lock his heart away in a prison as cold and hard as a diamond, who fights to resist the bond and their deep sexual attraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far from home, with a soulmate who is still a stranger, Megan learns that the path to true love isn't quite as straight and easy as she thought . . .</description>

  <description>Early in her life, Josephine Malone learned the hard way that there was only one person she could love and trust: her grandmother, Lydia Malone. Out of necessity, unconsciously and very successfully, Josephine donned a disguise to keep all others at bay. She led a globetrotting lifestyle on the fringes of the fashion and music elite, but she kept herself distant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Josephine was trotting the globe, retired boxer Jake Spear was living in the same small town as Lydia. There was nothing disguised about Jake. Including the fact he made a habit of making very bad decisions about who to give his love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for Josephine and Jake, there was one person who adored them. One person who knew how to lead them to happiness. And one person who was intent on doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if she had to do it as her final wish on this earth.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;9 hrs 46 mins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve Dallas is a New York police lieutenant hunting for a ruthless killer. In over 10 years on the force, she's seen it all - and knows that her survival depends on her instincts. And she's going against every warning telling her not to get involved with Roarke, an Irish billionaire - and suspect in Eve's murder investigation. But passion and seduction have rules of their own, and it's up to Eve to take a chance in the arms of a man she knows nothing about - except the addictive hunger of needing his touch.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Only two can keep a secret if one of them is dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s said that the only people who really know what goes on in a marriage are the couple themselves. But what if even they don’t know the truth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David and Adele seem like the ideal pair. He’s a successful psychiatrist, she is his picture-perfect wife who adores him. But why is he so controlling? And why is she keeping things hidden?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louise, David’s new secretary, is intrigued. But as Louise gets closer to each of them, instead of finding answers she uncovers more puzzling questions. The only thing that is crystal clear is that something in this marriage is very, very wrong. But Louise could never have guessed how wrong things really are and just how far someone might go to hide it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Gina Royal is the definition of average—a shy Midwestern housewife with a happy marriage and two adorable children. But when a car accident reveals her husband’s secret life as a serial killer, she must remake herself as Gwen Proctor—the ultimate warrior mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her ex now in prison, Gwen has finally found refuge in a new home on remote Stillhouse Lake. Though still the target of stalkers and Internet trolls who think she had something to do with her husband’s crimes, Gwen dares to think her kids can finally grow up in peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just when she’s starting to feel at ease in her new identity, a body turns up in the lake—and threatening letters start arriving from an all-too-familiar address. Gwen Proctor must keep friends close and enemies at bay to avoid being exposed—or watch her kids fall victim to a killer who takes pleasure in tormenting her. One thing is certain: she’s learned how to fight evil. And she’ll never stop.</description>
