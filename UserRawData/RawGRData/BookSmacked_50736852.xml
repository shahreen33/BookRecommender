  <description>The light had been snuffed out of Xander Caine’s world a long time ago, leaving him to suffer in darkness. After a tremendous loss, he closed himself off from anyone and everyone, content to live alone in the shadows. Then a woman blew into town with the force of a hurricane and shook everything up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sage Winthrop was looking to start over. She didn’t have a plan for what her new life would look like, but when she landed in Hope Valley, she knew it was the place she wanted to call home. Then one chance encounter outside of the best coffee shop in town set her world spinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sage and Xander hated each other on sight. However, when they’re forced to work together, that hate eventually turns into something neither of them expected. Their attraction proves too strong to ignore. But when secrets from Sage’s past are revealed and her life is threatened, Xander has no choice but to let go of his demons and step out of the darkness in order to save the woman he loves.</description>

  <description>FROM THE #1 'NEW YORK TIMES' BESTSELLING AUTHOR COMES AN UNEXPECTED LOVE STORY OF FAMILY, SECRETS, AND THE MOST INTIMATE OF DECEPTIONS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My estranged twin brother, Julian, was always the wonder boy - and soon-to-be CEO of our ruthless father's corporation. My mother and me? Left behind. Now, years after tearing our family apart, my father dares to ask "me" for a favor? Pretend to be Julian while he fights to survive a tragic accident. It can save the company. Nobody will be the wiser. It'll be our secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can play Dad's favorite. I'll do anything for Julian. And for my mother, who'll want for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this double life comes with a beauty of a hitch: my very real feelings for Julian's fiancée, Isobel. Not only am I betraying Julian, I'm deceiving a woman I love. She doesn't suspect a thing. As lies compound, lines are crossed and loyalties tested, all I can ask myself is. . .what have I done?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because sooner or later something's got to give. There's no way I'm giving up Isobel. But once the truth is exposed, it might not be my choice at all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Eliahn&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Getting pregnant after a booze cruise hookup was not what any parent wanted to hear, so I picked up my entire life and moved to Paris to start over. Six years later, I was ready to go home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was a single mom and the only thing I knew about my son’s dad was his name—Luca. I didn’t need to know anything else. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The universe had other ideas because on our second day back home, the man came crashing back into my life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Luca&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Attending a welcome back party for my boss's daughter wasn’t how I wanted to spend my Sunday. But walking in and seeing my hookup from a cruise six years ago knocks me on my ass. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was a weekend of fun and now I'm seeing a pair of eyes, identical to mine, staring right at me. The boy standing next to her is my son. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now we’re living next door to each other and attempting to co-parent something that would be easy to do if the pull that brought us together wasn’t still there making things more complicated. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For six years she haunted my dreams, now she's haunting my every waking moment. &lt;br /&gt;I let her get away once, now I want to make her mine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This time, permanently. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only one thing left to do. I have to tempt the hookup.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NETFLIX NEWS! The 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN series is being adapted into a steamy Netflix dramedy series called SEX/LIFE, coming soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"SKIN is a sophisticated, edgy, authentic, five-star read, and I HIGHLY recommend it." - L.J. Shen, &lt;/i&gt;USA Today &lt;i&gt;Bestselling Author&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Because BB Easton had so much fun writing her best-selling, award-winning memoir, 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN, she decided to give each of her four men his own steamy stand-alone. SKIN is Knight's book--a gritty, taboo,forbidden love story overflowing with '90s nostalgia, dark humor, and heart-wrenching teenage angst. It is based on a true story.&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1997, Ronald “Knight” McKnight was the meanest, most misunderstood boy at Peach State High School ... perhaps on the entire planet. Knight hated everyone, except for me, BB—the perky, quirky punk chick with the locker next to his. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, on the other hand, liked everybody … except for Knight. I was scared sh*tless of him, actually. All I wanted was to marry Prince Eric-lookalike and king of the Peach State High punk scene, Lance Hightower, and have a million of his babies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, Knight was even better at getting his way than I was, and once he got under my skin, my life would never be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;*SKIN is Book 1 in the 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN spin-off series but can be read as a complete standalone. Go in with an open mind, and prepare to have it blown.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>From Wall Street Journal &amp;amp; USA Bestselling Author M. Robinson. A coming of age, enemies to lovers, contemporary romance filled with angst and all the feels. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t remember a time before her... Harley Jameson. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before she owned me.&lt;br /&gt;Hated Me.&lt;br /&gt;Needed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I hated her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things were simple. &lt;br /&gt;We had an understanding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bully. Fight. Hate. It’s what we did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind. Body. Soul. It’s how we loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought nothing would ever change that, until everything did. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She was mine. &lt;br /&gt;Always had been. &lt;br /&gt;Always would be. &lt;br /&gt;Nothing altered that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not how much I hated her.&lt;br /&gt;Not how much she hated me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially, not how much I hated… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That I LOVED her.</description>

  <description>Rory Hightower had a good life. She had a loving family, great friends, and a job she adored, running Hope Valley’s local watering hole, The Tap Room. But there was just one thing missing. Ever since she was a little girl she knew there was one special guy out there just for her. Her dream man. And when Cord walked into her bar, she knew instantly it was him. Which made losing him all the more painful.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cord Paulson had only ever had one person he could depend on. And that bond ran deep. But when he moved to Hope Valley and met the breathtaking bartender with the bright blue eyes and stunning smile, he felt an instant connection. He wanted Rory from the moment he laid eyes on her. But when his past came back and his loyalties were put to the test, he made the biggest mistake of his life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then one night changes everything. After avoiding him for months, Rory has no choice but to lower her guard and let him back in. And Cord plans to use that to his full advantage. He’s determined to repair the damage he caused to her heart and win her back. He may have lost the love of his life once already, but there’s no way he’ll make the same mistake twice.</description>

  <description>She's ready for the ride of her life . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren Grahame is looking to reinvent herself. After leaving her cheating husband, Lauren moves to Carnal, Colorado, and gets a job as a waitress in a biker bar called Bubba's. It's a nothing job in a nowhere joint . . . until Tatum Jackson walks in. Lauren has never seen a man with such good looks, muscles, and attitude. But when he insults her, Lauren doesn't want anything to do with him. Too bad for Lauren he's also the bar's part owner and bartender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the rough-around-the-edges Tate meets the high-class Lauren, he thinks she won't fit in at Bubba's. Yet there's more to Lauren than meets the eye, and Tate soon sets his mind on claiming her as his own. Before long, the desire burning between them is heating up the cold mountain air. But when violence strikes the town, Tate must reveal a dark secret to Lauren-one that may put an end to their sweet dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;205,764 words</description>

  <description>Love is the greatest gamble of all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina Sheridan desperately needs a timeout vacation. With a fiancé who can't even remember how she takes her coffee, Nina wants some distance to rethink her engagement. Flying halfway around the world from England to a mountain town in Colorado should do the trick. But when she finds a gorgeous man at her rental cabin, Nina's cold, lonely adventure suddenly heats up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owner of the house, Holden "Max" Maxwell is surprised by the beautiful woman who turns up at his door. But when Nina becomes ill, Max spends days nursing her back to health. A private man with a broken heart, Max finds himself drawn to the strong-willed woman. Soon it becomes impossible for Nina and Max to deny their growing attraction to one another. Yet even as these two wounded lovebirds think about taking a chance on a relationship, a dangerous secret from Max's past emerges-and threatens to end their love for good.</description>

  <description>The former Tin Gypsy motorcycle club has everyone in Clifton Forge, Montana convinced they’ve locked their clubhouse doors and ripped off their patches. Everyone but Bryce Ryan. There’s more happening at the club’s garage than muscle car restorations and Harley rebuilds. Her instincts are screaming there’s a story—one she’s going to tell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the new owner of the small town’s newspaper, Bryce is hungry for more than birth announcements and obituaries. When a woman is brutally killed and all signs point to the Tin Gypsies, Bryce is determined to expose the club and their leader, Kingston “Dash” Slater, as murderers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bryce bests Dash match after match, disappointed her rugged and handsome opponent turns out to be an underwhelming adversary. Secrets are exposed. Truths defeat lies. Bryce is poised to win this battle in a landslide. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then Dash breaks all the rules and tips the scales. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One kiss, and she’s fighting to save more than just her story. She’s fighting to save her heart from the Gypsy King.</description>

  <description>Not all love stories are written the same way. Ours had torn chapters, missing paragraphs, and a bittersweet ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luna Rexroth is everyone’s favorite wallflower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Caring.&lt;br /&gt;Charitable.&lt;br /&gt;Quiet.&lt;br /&gt;Fake.&lt;br /&gt;Underneath the meek, tomboy exterior everyone loves (yet pities) is a girl who knows exactly what, and who, she wants—namely, the boy from the treehouse who taught her how to curse in sign language.&lt;br /&gt;Who taught her how to laugh.&lt;br /&gt;To live.&lt;br /&gt;To love.&lt;br /&gt;Knight Cole is everyone’s favorite football hero.&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;Athletic.&lt;br /&gt;Rugged.&lt;br /&gt;Popular.&lt;br /&gt;Liar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This daredevil hell-raiser could knock you up with his gaze alone, but he only has eyes for the girl across the street: Luna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Luna is not who she used to be. She doesn’t need his protection anymore.&lt;br /&gt;When life throws a curveball at All Saints’ golden boy, he’s forced to realize not all knights are heroes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, the greatest love stories flourish in tragedy.</description>

This book was emotional, it was angsty, it was so amazing and I found myself up until 3 am completely engrossed in this story. <br /><br />I'm a sucker for coming of age romances and throw in some angst and I'm in heaven.

  <description>Strike One-My mother named me Theodore after her favorite chipmunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not cool, Mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I‘ve spent most of my life answering to Teddy, because I couldn’t make Theo work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for here. College. The place where all bets are off, and I’ve managed to redeem myself.&lt;br /&gt;There’s only one problem, my new roommate, Troy, is football royalty and looks like he stepped off the set of an Abercrombie shoot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn’t matter, I cook a mean breakfast for his panty parade, and we get along well.&lt;br /&gt;And anyway, this year I got the girl. And she’s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s right. Theodore Houseman, former band geek, now marching band rock star has finally landed the girl of his dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until Troy takes a good look at her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not going down without a fight. As a matter of fact, I’m not going down at all. As glorious as these days may be for my all-star roommate, Laney is my end game. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may not know much about play strategy, but I’ve been the good guy my whole life. I’ve been listening and I know exactly what women want. Framed in a picture standing next to me, Troy may seem like Mr. Perfect, but he’s underestimating the guy on the right.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoiler alert: In this story, the underdog is going to win.</description>

  <description>Gareth Black is drawn to December Mayson the moment he spots her across the room at her cousin’s wedding. When he approaches the beautiful woman, she captivates him with her shyness and wit, making him crave her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a pull so strong it’s impossible to ignore, December knows there’s something between her and Gareth. She just hopes they’re capable of jumping the hurdles ahead of them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two boys, an ex, a surprise that will change everything, and a disgruntled co-worker, guarantee these two will have their work cut out for them if they are going to find their happily ever after.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Too hot to handle...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabitha Allen grew up in the thick of Chaos--the Chaos Motorcycle Club, that is. Her father is Chaos' leader, and the club has always had her back. But one rider was different from the start. When Tabby was running wild, Shy Cage was there. When tragedy tore her life apart, he helped her piece it back together. And now, Tabby's thinking about much more than friendship...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabby is everything Shy's ever wanted, but everything he thinks he can't have. She's beautiful, smart, and as his friend's daughter, untouchable. Shy never expected more than friendship, so when Tabby indicates she wants more--&lt;i&gt;much &lt;/i&gt;more&lt;i&gt;--&lt;/i&gt;he feels like the luckiest man alive. But even lucky men can crash and burn...</description>

  <description>*please note the age gap is 15 years &lt;br /&gt;*the female is 16 throughout the "relationship"&lt;br /&gt;*it is a standalone novel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Age is just a number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like he's just a boy and I'm just a girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that's not true, is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because fifteen may be a number, but it's bigger than that. Bigger than us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a number that separates us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excuse that keeps us apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I'm not willing to give in until I get what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, how many other girls can bring a grown man to his knees with one little smile?</description>

  <description>Ally Nightingale has secrets. Secrets she doesn't even share with the Rock Chicks. But two men know what she's up to. One has her back. The other has her heart, but he doesn't know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Ally rewinds the last year of her life, she knows two things. One, she’s never going to get what every Rock Chick should have—her own Hot Bunch guy. And two, she’s a Nightingale through and through. She just isn’t sure what to do about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as her secrets are revealed, the men in her life react. Darius Tucker, a lifelong friend, as usual takes her back. Ren Zano, the man she loves, isn’t quite so sure. The Rock Chicks, Hot Bunch and the entire gang at Fortnum’s weigh in, and a Rock Chick Revolution starts brewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s up to Ally to control it and prove what she knows down to her bones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s a Rock Chick, she deserves her hot guy and she’s going to keep the one she wants…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because she’s a Nightingale.</description>

  <description>Jules has got a score to settle against the drug dealers of Denver. Vance has made it his mission that Jules won’t get dead while dishing out vigilante justice. Jules doesn’t have time for romance, she’s too busy saving the world and she enlists Zip (the gunstore owner), Heavy (an ex-PI) and Frank (a mysterious recluse) to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rock Chicks of Fortnum’s Bookstore get involved to provide romantic advice and guidance, none of which Jules accepts at first. The Hot Bunch of Nightingale Investigations adopt Jules as one of their own. Even though Jules tries to hang on to her inner Head Crackin’ Mamma Jamma, the Rock Chicks; Hot Bunch; Jules’s long-suffering Uncle Nick; Jules’s friend the rotund, African-American, Jackie-O wannabe, May; and especially Vance will stop at nothing to wear her down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Jules makes some bad guys pretty angry and one is dedicated to taking her out. Vance and the Hot Bunch have to pull out all the stops to keep her alive. At the same time, Jules and Vance learn the true meaning of home but once they find this precious entity they’ve been searching for all their lives, will Jules’s enemies tear it away?</description>

  <description>Roxie’s on the run from a bad boyfriend who will not catch the hint that it is o-v-e-r. She’s in no mood for love at first sight, but when her eyes fall on Hank, it’s trouble from the get-go. Roxie tries to hold Hank at arms length but Hank wants to be a closer (as in, a lot closer). Roxie’s trouble catches up with her and Hank wants to help but Roxie knows in her heart that she’s no good for a white hat guy. The problem is no one agrees with her, especially her crazy hippie best friend Annette or her parents; the even crazier small-Indiana-town Herb and Trish. Toss into the mix the gang from Rock Chick and Rock Chick Rescue and Roxie finds herself totally outnumbered. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Climb in for another Rock Chick wild ride through Rock Chick Redemption. As the odds stack up against Roxie, she has no choice but to hold on and just ride it out through the kidnappings, car chases, society parties, a riot at the strip club, Hank getting “Mom Bombed” and one crazy night at the Haunted House.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During all this Hank works at convincing her she really wants to stay and he, along with the Hot Bunch, go all out to make her safe. Hank also needs to work on showing Roxie that her past decisions don’t mean her future can’t include something as downright delicious as… normal.</description>

  <description>Jet McAlister has a secret. Eddie Chavez has the hots for Jet (not to mention Eddie’s just plain hot). Jet has too many problems to realize that Eddie’s interested. Eddie loses patience when Jet ends her waitressing shift at a strip club with a knife at her throat. Since Eddie’s a cop, he figures he can help. Since Jet’s used to solving everyone’s problems she doesn’t want Eddie’s help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throw in a Dolly Parton look-alike, a gruff but lovable strip club owner, Jet’s ne’er do well father, his ne’er do well friend, Bear, Bear’s long-suffering, chain-smoking wife Lavonne and the crew from Rock Chick and you’ve got Rock Chick Rescue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rock Chick Rescue takes you on a wild ride with Jet, Eddie and the gang as they wrestle bad guys in a bagel shop, hit Denver’s backstreet poker tables (with big hair), and help the strippers at Smithie’s take down a would-be murderer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through this, Jet’s got to learn that even when life made you give up your dreams, you can still end up with the (hot) guy. Eddie’s got to rescue Jet from a bad man (so he can do better things with her) and teach her that some dreams can come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Word Count: 129,350&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>It's hard to believe it's almost over. &lt;br /&gt;After three years of living in the wildest apartment in the craziest neighborhood, the clock is ticking down. &lt;br /&gt;College is ending. &lt;br /&gt;My friends and I, known around Violent Circle as the Frat Hell Guys, have managed to make it to graduation without a major injury or arrest record. It was a close call. &lt;br /&gt;My career path as a video game designer is laid out clearly before me, but I have one more objective to achieve before the school year is over; show the beautiful, stubborn, infuriating woman I’m in love with that she’s mine. &lt;br /&gt;She just doesn’t know it yet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>Indy Savage, cop's daughter, rock chick and used bookstore owner, has been in love with Lee Nightingale, once bad boy, now the man behind Nightingale Investigations, since she was five years old. No matter what ingenious schemes Indy used to capture his attention, Lee never showed an interest and Indy finally gave up. Now Indy's employee, Rosie, has lost a bag of diamonds and bad guys are shooting at him. When Indy gets involved, Lee is forced to help. Complicting matters, Lee has decided he's interested, Indy's decided she's not. But she can't seem to keep Lee out of her life when she's repeatedly stun gunned, kidnapped and there are car bombs exploding (not to mention she's finding dead bodies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indy's best bet is to solve the mystery of the diamonds before Lee. Lee's challenge is to keep Indy alive and, at the same time, win back her heart.</description>

  <description>Lars Bradby was supposed to be my forever.&lt;br /&gt;That was before we found out he would become a father at the tender age of eighteen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, he’d watched me.&lt;br /&gt;For months, he’d wanted me.&lt;br /&gt;For weeks, he’d chased me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relentless and infuriating, he turned my stubborn heart into something pliable and weak. &lt;br /&gt;Sly and honest, he worked his way into my life as though he’d always planned to be the focal point of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In love and naive, even when our future seemed bleak, I believed in us. &lt;br /&gt;Heartbroken and desperate, I tore my bleeding heart from my chest, wanting only the best for him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In doing so, our forever wasn’t just interrupted. It was chased away with one irreversible decision after another. &lt;br /&gt;And now, we could no longer see it beneath the heaping piles of debris we’d left in our wake.</description>

  <description>Gypsy Bradbury was never destined for great things. Or at least that’s what she’d convinced herself of. Growing up on the wrong side of the tracks, she had learned that hoping for more was a waste of time. Then Marco forced his way into her life and gave her a glimpse of a future brighter than any she could have imagined. But if her past taught her anything, it was that if something seemed too good to be true... it probably was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The promise of a quiet, simple life was what drew Marco Castillo to Hope Valley. After experiencing war and death first hand, he was looking for something easy. Then he met a woman with guarded eyes and the most beautiful smile he’d ever seen. The only problem was she came with more baggage than a 747. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing easy about Gypsy, but Marco knows without a doubt that the promise of her is well worth the effort. She’s the strongest, bravest woman he’s ever met, and when the life she’s fought to build for her and her family is threatened, Marco is determined to win that battle for her. Whether Gypsy wants his help or not</description>

  <description>A Romantic Comedy by S.K. Rose - Coming 8.22.19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Scarlett Mavis. I have a sweet tooth, no filters, and video games are my life. &lt;br /&gt;Let me clarify that last part: They’re not a hobby; they’re not a way to kill the time; They. Are. My. LIFE. &lt;br /&gt;Where family, men, and humans, in general, have failed me, video games are always there waiting for me to return to their warm and accepting embrace.&lt;br /&gt;In real life I may be a heartbroken geek, but put a controller in my hands and I become an indestructible warrior. &lt;br /&gt;What else does a girl really need?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter player two, Kane Decker.&lt;br /&gt;Handsome, nerdy, incredible kisser, and just my type. Our first date was perfect in every way. &lt;br /&gt;Then, like always, reality came crashing down with one simple truth. &lt;br /&gt;He wasn’t my teammate; he was the enemy. And there’s nothing I’m better at than taking out a rival player. &lt;br /&gt;But this isn’t a game, and the stakes are all too real. &lt;br /&gt;For the first time in my life, I may have met my match. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Game on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18+</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love breaks the offside rule in &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Rachel Van Dyken’s irresistibly sexy Red Card romance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Successful, high-profile sports agent Matt Kingston thinks he can handle anything. Then soccer player Parker Speedman shows up at his door. She is young and gorgeous, has natural talent, and is looking for a team. She’s also a hothead with a punchy past who floored her last coach on live TV. Despite his misgivings, Matt agrees to be both her agent and her coach. Professional common sense says she’s off-limits. But what can he say about the raw attraction between them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parker plays soccer with her heart and soul. But after the events of the last year, she’s shaken. She’s already seen what a powerful man can do to a female athlete’s career. And her beloved dream is in the hands of a sexy, gorgeous man with the uncanny ability to slip past her defenses…and into her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Matt and Parker are about to learn that when it comes to love, the only way to win is by breaking every rule they know. And by playing nice. Real nice.</description>

  <description>I asked for his criteria for bed buddies-that's the PG version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He swore at me and said he didn't do groupies. And just like that, our friendship was off to a great start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reese Forster was the starting point guard for the Seattle Thunder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous. Cocky. Loved by the nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's also attending preseason basketball training camp where I used to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Correction: where I work again, because I was fired from my last job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And dumped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I might have a tiny bit of baggage, but that's normal. Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reese and I shouldn't have become friends. We shouldn't have become roommates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we really shouldn't have started sleeping together ... (Except we did.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm adorably psychotic. He's in the NBA.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a disaster waiting to happen, at all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Choose Me&lt;/i&gt;, RC Boldt brings us an unforgettable, heart-wrenching coming-of-age romance...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wearing the nicest suit I own, I stand in the very back with a flask full of whiskey in my inner pocket. I put on a brave face as I watch her walk down the aisle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Because it’s too late.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I refuse to be the bastard who makes her cry on her wedding day, but I’m dying to tell her what I’ve always known. She’s my best friend, but she doesn’t realize she owns my f*cking heart and soul, too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Each step down that aisle takes her farther away from me and brings her closer to him, forcing me to face the truth: I’ve fallen in love with someone who can’t be mine. If she’d just turn around, maybe she’d realize I love her more than he ever could. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won’t ruin her perfect day, but my broken heart begs me to try and convince her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Choose me.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the best selling series, &lt;i&gt;Something So&lt;/i&gt; comes the spin-off &lt;i&gt;This is...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zara Stone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my life, I’ve said I will never date a hockey player. I know better because I’ve seen and lived it all. My father is a hockey god, my brother is the captain of the most successful NHL team in the world, and my brother-in-law also plays in the league. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their lives are complicated, so I went in the opposite direction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love with a scholar. But instead of proposing marriage, he broke up with me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Three months later, I saw his engagement picture on Instagram. I couldn’t let him get away with that. No, it didn’t matter what, I was going to make that man see that I did not need him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evan Richards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in the running to pass my point record from last year, ready to claim the number one spot in the league. On top of my game, I was riding my career high wave. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, Hockey’s Princess, Zara Stone tweeted me. She wanted me to crash her ex’s wedding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst that could happen? A PR nightmare. The best? A fun night with a beautiful woman. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started out as a game—something I’m good at. Her crazy idea twisted into something I wasn’t looking for, something neither of us wanted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When push comes to shove, one thing runs through my mind: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Crazy. Also, this is crazy right.</description>

  <description>It wasn’t hard for Nona Fanning to fall for Trick. He was strong, kind-hearted, loyal, and unbelievably handsome. He was the man of her dreams, and all it took was one night to give her a taste of the beauty he had to offer. But while she’d been opening her heart to him, he’d kept his under lock and key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Patrick “Trick” Wanderly’s wife left him, ripping away their picture-perfect life, he convinced himself that she’d taken the best pieces of him with her. He wasn’t ready to move on and give his heart to someone else. Then his whole world flipped upside down after spending one night with Nona.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took awhile for him to see what he had standing right in front of him, but now Trick’s eyes are open, and he’s determined to fix what he broke. But when danger threatens to tear Nona’s world apart, it’s up to Trick to help hold those pieces together while fighting to protect the woman and the new life he’s come to cherish.</description>

  <description>There were rules in the cash-for-beauty game. The money held the power. The beauty followed the rules and jumped through the hoops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE BRIDE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew what everyone would think if they knew the truth about my marriage. They'd be shocked and appalled. And rightly so. I was a young, modern, independent woman, and I'd done the unthinkable. I'd sold my virginity to a spoiled, rich boy. To a stranger who didn’t love me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I'd done it all for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE GROOM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bride was as gorgeous as she was unwelcome. As desirable as she was unwanted. I wanted nothing to do with her, but that didn’t seem to matter exactly the second she got close enough to touch. I wanted her to hate me more than she loved the millions she’d sold herself for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to spurn her, but unfortunately, I wanted to fuck her more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ARRANGED is a standalone erotic romance.</description>

  <description>Behind the "lights, camera, action" of Hollywood lies a world of deception, love, and seduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you ready for Hollywood Royalty?&lt;br /&gt;Carter&lt;br /&gt;A blonde, a brunette, a redhead…he can have his pick of them all on any given night and he knows it. They wait, hoping he looks up and gives them his signature smirk, choosing them over the others because that’s his game. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except now he's signed the contract of a lifetime, one with a pesky little clause that says his zipper must stay up and his playboy image has got to tamp down. It'll be fine—a piece of cake, even—he can do this and he’s almost convinced himself of that … and then she walks in the room &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new PR girl whom they’ve hired to change his image, she's the star of all his dreams, but there’s one tiny little problem … she can't stand him and all of his player ways. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He knows he only has thirty days to show her why they call him Hollywood’s Prince. He’s up for the challenge, so game on.</description>

  <description>Talk about an embarrassing introduction. On her first day of law school, Kailyn ran - quite literally - into the actor she crushed on as a teenager, ending with him sprawled on top of her. Mortified to discover &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; Daxton Hughes was also a student in her class, her embarrassment over their meet-cute quickly turned into a friendship she never expected. Of course, she never saw his betrayal coming either...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, eight years later, Dax is in her office asking for legal advice. Despite her anger, Kailyn can't help feeling sorry for the devastated man who just became sole guardian to his thirteen-year-old sister. But when her boss gets wind of Kailyn's new celebrity client, there's even more at stake than Dax's custody issues: if she gets Dax to work at their firm, she'll be promoted to partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more time Kailyn spends with Dax and his sister, the more she starts to feel like a family, and the more she realizes the chemistry they had all those years ago is as fresh as ever. But will they be able to forgive the mistakes of the past, or will one betrayal lead to another?</description>

  <description>I’m a motherless son to a father who hates me. Fury has lived and breathed in my black heart for so long, it’s a part of my soul now. The only thing that’s ever mattered to me is protecting my twin sister, Sabella, from my father’s temper.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So when the chance to join a secret society presents itself, there’s no question I’ll do whatever it takes to become a member and earn my place in the ranks of only the most Elite.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With a taste for the deviant, I’m drawn to the darkest of desires, and no one ever leaves my bed unscathed. &lt;br /&gt;My task: seduce Patience Noelle, St. Augustine’s sweetheart and the mayor’s beloved daughter—then break her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sinning is what I live for, and deviance is my passion. Failing has never been an option.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But what happens when my sin becomes my curse—when destroying the only woman I’ve ever wanted is my key to protecting my sister?&lt;br /&gt;Accept your sin wisely, for the tasks given to earn your place are not for the weak...they’re for The Elite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn’t just my chance, it’s my legacy and reckoning.&lt;br /&gt;I am Samuel Gunner.&lt;br /&gt;I am WRATH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Elite Seven Series&lt;br /&gt;Lust (The Elite Seven, #1) by Ker Dukey &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Wm4mnB" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://amzn.to/2Wm4mnB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pride (The Elite Seven, #2) by J.D.

  <description>The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But who said the devil was a he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my world, she was out to cause havoc on all our lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’ll use the one thing I care most about to control me—force me into her Elite world, filled with sin, deceit, and power. And under her spell, I’ll lead a sinister brotherhood of seven at one of the most prestigious universities in New Orleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven tasks set forth by the devil herself, promising nothing less than the forbidden fruit of power. What they don’t understand is it will all end in bloodshed and regret. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They call me the alpha. The one in charge. The one with pride bigger than any task I could be given. And my pride won’t let me be anywhere but at the top of the food chain until she gives me what I truly want. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My task is Meghan Benedict. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s too pure for me to touch, too good for me to ruin—and the only thing standing in my way to freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accept your sin wisely, for the tasks given to earn your place are not for the weak...they’re for The Elite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they say, pride comes before the fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Mason Blackwell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Pride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;The Elite Seven Series&lt;br /&gt;Lust (The Elite Seven, #1) by Ker Dukey &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Wm4mnB" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://amzn.to/2Wm4mnB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pride (The Elite Seven, #2) by J.D.

  <description>In the de la Rosa family, old grudges run deeper than loyalty, and betrayal is a three-letter word: war. But this feud isn’t between enemies. It’s between brothers. And I’m the prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was born a princess among criminals. An untouchable among thieves. Heiress to a life others have killed for, and one I'm prepared to trade for my freedom. I vowed not to leave without Diego, my first love and best friend, but if his ruthless brother has his way, I won’t leave at all. Cristiano de la Rosa is a man as big and bold as his legend. Once upon a time, he was our cartel’s best soldier . . . until he became my family’s worst enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man like Cristiano will bend fate to his will to get what he wants. Even if it means dragging me to hell—and tearing me from his brother's arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“She is mine.” Three words from two different men.&lt;br /&gt;A life, future, and love I don’t get to choose.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Courtney Jane Salinger...&lt;br /&gt;and I'm sick of games.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sick of the Friday night bar-scene-cum-meat-market. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sick of the boy-girl, man-woman, mars-venus, flirtation-without-expectation, game-playing nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sick of awful dates and one-night stands, booty calls and guys who don’t call back, mixed messages or NO messages and—and—and...I'm sick of all of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m done.&lt;br /&gt;I just can't do it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It's too hard, and worse: little by little, it's making &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; hard.&lt;br /&gt;It's breaking my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; I want?&lt;br /&gt;That's easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want a house in suburbia with a white picket fence.&lt;br /&gt;I want babies to buckle into a minivan.&lt;br /&gt;But most of all, I want to be married.&lt;br /&gt;I want a husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I've made an important decision: I'm making my escape from the dating world and the single life.&lt;br /&gt;I've filled out my application on ArrangeMe.com and I'm putting my fate into the hands of experts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a little scary?&lt;br /&gt;Sure.&lt;br /&gt;I mean, I have no idea who I'll end up with. &lt;br /&gt;After all, I'm planning to marry a complete stranger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But between you and me?&lt;br /&gt;I can't wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being arranged can't possibly be worse than being single.&lt;br /&gt;Can it?</description>

  <description>British ad exec Dylan Locke isn't looking for love. He isn't looking for fate. He's definitely not looking for Audrey Lind. She's pretty, far too young, and overly romantic--in short, exhausting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the girl, young enough to be his daughter, literally lands in his lap and asks for his expertise, he'd be lying if he said he wasn't interested. In her body, in her innocence, in her philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the kind of kismet that starts with kisses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Audrey isn't looking for love either--she's looking for lessons, and she's certain Dylan knows everything she needs to learn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If he agrees to play the teacher can he keep his heart? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course he can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, he might be lying.</description>

  <description>“Love is savage, love is blind, love is something they may not find…”&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time, there was a young girl who lived in a battered trailer, a girl from the wrong side of the tracks. &lt;br /&gt;One day, she fell down The Elite Kings’ rabbit hole. Sucked into a dark vortex of lies, hate, and deceit, and spat out by money, glitz, and power.&lt;br /&gt;There were things this little girl didn’t know, things she was about to find out and secrets that have been kept from her. Those secrets were guarded by the boys that were about to smash her world open and tear it all apart…&lt;br /&gt;He may be a Malum, but she is a Stuprum, born into this world but neglected by the choice of her mother. Her eyes may not glisten with stars, but they roar with fire, and when she finally reaches her peak, it’s that same fire that will burn. &lt;br /&gt;Them. &lt;br /&gt;All. &lt;br /&gt;Down. &lt;br /&gt;My name is Tillie Stuprum, and my story is not like the rest.&lt;br /&gt;Everything she thought she knew is a fabricated version of the truth. I’m Nate Riverside-Malum, the one your girl whispers about to her friends and whose initials are scratched down your back. Her story is not like the rest of them, because her story is dead.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Adriana Locke comes a witty romance about first love and second chances.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being burned by her dream job in New York City, sports journalist Neely Kimber suddenly finds herself jobless and paying a long-overdue visit to her hometown in Tennessee. Her plan? Relax, reset, and head back up the corporate ladder. There’s just one unexpected step. Neely’s back in Dogwood Lane for barely a day when she sees the man she ran from nine years ago: the bad boy next door who was her first kiss, her first love, and her first heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devoted single dad Dane Madden knows he hurt Neely in the worst way. He’s got a lot to make up for. And as passionate as their reconnection is, it’s a lot to hope for. Having her back in his arms feels so right. But falling in love all over again with a woman who wants to live a world away is bound to go so wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s it going to take for Neely to give him—and Dogwood Lane—just one more chance?</description>

  <description>DUKEY's DARK, DELIGHTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STALK HER&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ever get that feeling you’re being watched?&lt;br /&gt;You probably are. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her sad eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Her thick lips.&lt;br /&gt;Her long dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;Her quickening of breath.&lt;br /&gt;Her hurried footsteps.&lt;br /&gt;Her undiluted fear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The anxiety a woman has when she knows she’s being followed does something to the sadistic animal inside me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all have issues, mine just run a little deeper than most.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My sister and I had our childhood tarnished by an abusive parent. We grew up two very different breeds of our mothers’ creation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I discover the beautiful, yet broken, Alice Young. She’s seeking advice, a place to unburden her thoughts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What she gets is a dangerous, callous predator who wants to quench his thirst with her tears. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My precious, Alice, feels so alone, but she’s not alone. I’m watching her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erik Ross feeds on the fear of others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice Young may prove to be too damaged, for even his appetite.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;A sexy standalone novel from New York Times and international bestselling author Elle Kennedy. THE RISK takes you back to the world of hot hockey players, feisty heroines, bro banter, and steamy scenes... &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone says I’m a bad girl. They’re only partly right—I don’t let fear rule me, and I certainly don’t care what people think. But I draw the line at sleeping with the enemy. As the daughter of Briar’s head hockey coach, I’d be vilified if I hooked up with a player from a rival team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that’s who Jake Connelly is. Harvard’s star forward is arrogant, annoying, and too attractive for his own good. But fate is cruel—I require his help to secure a much-coveted internship, and the sexy jerk isn’t making it easy for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need Connelly to be my fake boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For every fake date…he wants a real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which means this bad girl is in big trouble. Nothing good can come from sneaking around with Jake Connelly. My father would kill me, my friends will revolt, and my post-college career is on the line. But while it’s getting harder and harder to resist Jake’s oozing sex appeal and cocky grin, I refuse to fall for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s the one risk I’m not willing to take.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Even one-night stands deserve a second chance in &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Rachel Van Dyken’s novel of sporting desire.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else can a virgin do when she’s ditched at the altar? Seattle heiress Mackenzie Dupont is treating herself to a single-girl honeymoon in Mexico and a desire to relinquish her innocence to a gorgeous one-night stand. Fake names. True pleasure. But when she wakes up alone, Mackenzie realizes just how much anger is left in her broken heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suffering a tragic personal loss, pro soccer player Slade Rodriguez has his reasons for vanishing without a goodbye. Right or wrong, he’s blaming the beautiful and infuriating stranger he never wants to see again. They’re both in for a shock when Mackenzie shows up as his new personal assistant. And they both have a lot to learn about each other. Because they share more than they could possibly know, including a common enemy who’s playing his own games. And he’s not afraid to get dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there’s only one way Mackenzie and Slade can win: to trust in each other and to stop hiding from the lies they’ve told, the secrets they’ve kept, the mistakes they’ve made, and the attraction that still burns between them.</description>

  <description>Temperance Levine had her entire world ripped away from her at eighteen. What had once been a life full of light and happiness was torn to shreds in the blink of an eye. With nothing left but a broken heart and painful memories, she ran away from the only home she’d ever had and tried to start over somewhere else. But the grass isn’t always greener on the other side, and sometimes all you can do to heal old wounds is come back home again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day Temperance left him was the worst day of Hayes Walker’s life, and he’d spent every one since then merely existing. The future he’d imagined had gone up in smoke, and all he could do was take life one step at a time. But when tragedy brings Tempie back to Hope Valley, he knows this is the only shot he’ll have at getting his happiness back, and there’s no way he’ll let this chance go to waste. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years apart, Tempie and Hayes are finally starting over and looking toward the future. But when their sleepy little town is rocked to its core, Hayes will be forced into a battle he never saw coming. Now he’s not only fighting for the future he always dreamed of, but also trying to protect the only woman he’s ever loved.</description>

  <description>I was born with wealth, athletic ability, and looks that could melt the panties off a nun. I had a clear path to success. Until fate dealt me a cruel blow, leaving me empty and in need of purpose. My only focus now is to become part of The Elite—a secret society in one of the most prestigious colleges in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everything comes at a price, and with The Elite, you have to earn your place. Lucky for me, being sinful is in my DNA. The only obstacle to full initiation is my task: seduce the un-seducible, the forbidden, and lure her with the sins of the flesh. Easy for a man like me…in theory. She started as my task, but what happens when the lines between lust and love blur, and the need for power rages war with the need for her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accept your sin wisely, for the tasks given to earn your place are not for the weak—they’re for The Elite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my life, my chance, my legacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Rhett Masters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Lust.</description>

  <description>“Things you should know about me from the very beginning:&lt;br /&gt;I was born to true love, witnessed the destruction it causes, and vowed never to let such agony happen to me. I am not a story-teller like my father. I am not a writer like my mother. I am just a son—their son.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy being alone.&lt;br /&gt;And that is all I ever want to be.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;JACOB&lt;br /&gt;The day he was born, Jacob learned his hardest and longest lesson.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t a lesson a boy should learn so young, but from his earliest memories he knew where happiness lives, so does tragedy. Where love exists, so does heartbreak. And where hope resides, so does sorrow.&lt;br /&gt;That lesson carved him from the kid to the teen to the man.&lt;br /&gt;And nothing and no one could change his mind.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;HOPE&lt;br /&gt;I first met him when he was fourteen at a movie premiere of all places. A movie based on his parent’s life.&lt;br /&gt;He was stoic, strong, suspicious, and secretive.&lt;br /&gt;I was only ten, but I felt something for him. A strange kind of sorrow that made me want to hug and heal him.&lt;br /&gt;I was the daughter of the actor hired to play his father.&lt;br /&gt;We shared similarities.&lt;br /&gt;I recognized parts of him because they were parts of me.&lt;br /&gt;But no matter how many times we met. No matter how many times I tried.&lt;br /&gt;He stayed true to his vow to never fall.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An all-the-feels novel of fierce love overcoming a dark past from the author of the #1 New York Times bestselling THIS MAN series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Izzy White knows of the darkness in this world. After all, she escaped it long ago. Determined not to let her past beat her, Izzy has a secure, stable life with a job she loves in nursing. But one act of kindness will completely upend everything she's so carefully built-putting her right back in the crosshairs of danger she's been so desperate to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Theo Kane shows up like a knight in shining armor, Izzy can't help thinking she's been saved from one threat and exposed to another. His imposing physique, the harsh lines of his face, and the wariness of everyone who comes close are just a few clues to Theo Kane's notorious reputation. The man is positively terrifying. But with Izzy, he's tender and a complete gentleman, and her fascination with the mysterious beast of a man becomes too powerful for her to walk away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Theo's demons come to light, running becomes even more impossible. And yet staying together could doom them both.</description>

  <description>He’s known as Father Anton to his teammates—the brooding, sexy captain of the NHL’s Chicago Blaze has a reputation for…not having a reputation. Just like his diet and sleep routines, celibacy is part of Anton Petrov’s on-ice mojo. Or so they say. Anton stays mum on the subject. If the world thinks he chooses to abstain from sex, so be it. Better that than the truth getting out: there is a woman he burns for, but he can never have her. She’s his teammate’s wife, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mia Marceau is finally on her own. Now that she and her husband are living apart, she’s finding the peace she was desperate for. She spends her days in classes and late nights bartending, making her own way in the world at last. After what she’s been through, as long as her husband leaves her alone, she doesn’t plan to rock the boat. He still has the power to hurt those dearest to her, and she can’t demand a divorce with such a high cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A chance encounter with Mia has Anton hoping for a shot he never thought he’d get. And while she’s drawn to the intense, serious hockey center, Mia’s leery about playing with fire. That’s all Anton has ever known for Mia, though—a living, burning desire that won’t be denied—no matter the cost.</description>

  <description>“You don’t belong.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No words whispered in anger have ever rung more true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re the Kings of Brayshaw with the world at their feet, destined for greatness and in need of control. &lt;br /&gt;I’m the girl from the ghetto with nothing to offer and as defiant as they come. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say it doesn’t matter, that I’m one of them now, and nothing could ever change that. Not even me, should I dare try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they’re wrong.&lt;br /&gt;They underestimate how far I’ll go to protect them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trouble is coming...and they have no idea.&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trouble At Brayshaw High is the the highly anticipated follow up to Boys of Brayshaw High, and should be read only after having read book one. &lt;br /&gt;Find book one, Boys of Brayshaw High, here: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/BOBHUniversal" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://bit.ly/BOBHUniversal&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Meagan Brandy's followup to Boys of Brayshaw High hits all the marks.

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author K Webster, comes a new taboo romance standalone novel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenna’s grown up in the system.&lt;br /&gt;Forced to be tough, wary, and hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s only been able to count on herself. &lt;br /&gt;Until Enzo.&lt;br /&gt;He’s much older and responsible for looking after her.&lt;br /&gt;What should be a job to him, evolves into much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late night phone calls. &lt;br /&gt;Lingering touches. &lt;br /&gt;A forbidden fire that burns brighter each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything about him exudes strength. &lt;br /&gt;His will to protect her is more than she could ever ask for.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, though, even heroes have their limitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she doesn’t need a hero.&lt;br /&gt;She just needs him.</description>

  <description>He’s That Guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, the hero in almost every romance novel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The super-rich, powerful CEO who is beyond sexy. Lives in a penthouse. Is wicked in bed. Has massive…feet. Is kind of a jerk, but really he’s not because he harbors some major secret that, once revealed, explains why he is the way he is—therefore completely redeeming himself and making all the readers who hated to love him swoon….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. That one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I found him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a writer who has spent years searching for the perfect muse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I know he exists, I have a mission. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make him fall in love with me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be easy. I mean, I have issues, but above all, I’m a great catch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, I did a stupid thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now he hates me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for him, he’s my That Guy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he’s going to love me…. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether he wants to or not.</description>

  <description>A new town. A new identity. Pregnant and alone. &lt;br /&gt;And far away from a past that can never find me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;River Wild.&lt;br /&gt;Moody. Sullen. A-hole.&lt;br /&gt;And my new neighbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no interest in befriending River. And he definitely doesn’t want to be befriended by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, he helps me rescue an abandoned dog. And, that day, I see something in his eyes that reflects back in my own. Sadness. Pain. Loneliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know all of those things well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unwanted and unexpected friendship that somehow works. Then, without warning, it turns into something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;River and I both have our secrets, and that’s okay. Because I understand him. And he understands me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in my life, I have something I never thought I would have—happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But happiness isn’t forever. Not for people like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially not when my past is waiting just around the corner, ready to come and take it all away.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Behind the "lights, camera, action" of Hollywood lies a world of deception, love, and seduction. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are you ready for Hollywood Royalty?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessica&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An entertainment journalist was the last thing I thought I would be doing.&lt;br /&gt;I thought once I got my degree, I would be reporting on stories that made a difference, but now all I do is report on who broke up with who and who is dating who.&lt;br /&gt;I was over it.&lt;br /&gt;Then I got my next assignment. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s Hollywood’s bad boy.&lt;br /&gt;He works hard, and he plays even harder.&lt;br /&gt;He’s rude, he’s condescending, and he’s made it known he doesn’t want me on the tour.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With one month on the road with him, two things might happen&lt;br /&gt;One, I may never work in this industry again.&lt;br /&gt;Two, I may just be like everyone else and fall for Hollywood’s Playboy.</description>

  <description>When Solène Marchand, the thirty-nine-year-old owner of a prestigious art gallery in Los Angeles, takes her daughter, Isabelle, to meet her favorite boy band, she does so reluctantly and at her ex-husband’s request. The last thing she expects is to make a connection with one of the members of the world-famous August Moon. But Hayes Campbell is clever, winning, confident, and posh, and the attraction is immediate. That he is all of twenty years old further complicates things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What begins as a series of clandestine trysts quickly evolves into a passionate relationship. It is a journey that spans continents as Solène and Hayes navigate each other’s disparate worlds: from stadium tours to international art fairs to secluded hideaways. And for Solène, it is as much a reclaiming of self, as it is a rediscovery of happiness and love. When their romance becomes a viral sensation, and both she and her daughter become the target of rabid fans and an insatiable media, Solène must face how her new status has impacted not only her life, but the lives of those closest to her.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Don't miss a beat with the fourth and final novel in the &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling Stage Dive series from Kylie Scott.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Positive. With two little lines on a pregnancy test, everything in Lizzy Rollins' ordinary life is about to change forever. And all because of one big mistake in Vegas with Ben Nicholson, the irresistibly sexy bass player for Stage Dive. So what if Ben's the only man she's ever met who can make her feel completely safe, cherished, and out of control with desire at the same time? Lizzy knows the gorgeous rock star isn't looking for anything more permanent than a good time, no matter how much she wishes differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben knows Lizzy is off limits. Completely and utterly. She's his best friend's little sister now, and no matter how hot the chemistry is between them, no matter how sweet and sexy she is, he's not going to go there. But when Ben is forced to keep the one girl he's always had a weakness for out of trouble in Sin City, he quickly learns that what happens in Vegas, doesn't always stay there. Now he and Lizzie are connected in the deepest way possible... but will it lead to a connection of the heart?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The lead singer of Stage Dive, Jimmy is used to getting whatever he wants, whenever he wants it whether it's booze or women. However, when a PR disaster serves as a wake-up call about his life and lands him in rehab, he finds himself stuck with a new assistant hired by the record company to keep him out of trouble. He doesn't need or want a babysitter. Especially one that looks like Lena. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lena's not willing to take any shit from the sexy rocker she's been hired to assist and is determined to keep their relationship completely professional, despite the sizzling chemistry that sparks between them every time they're in the same room. But when Jimmy pushes her too far and Lena leaves, he realizes that he may just have lost the best thing to ever happen to him. Readers won't want to miss the third book in this New Adult series about ordinary young women who fall in love with rock stars.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Waking up in Vegas was never meant to be like this.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evelyn Thomas’s plans for celebrating her twenty-first birthday in Las Vegas were big. Huge. But she sure as hell never meant to wake up on the bathroom floor with a hangover to rival the black plague, a very attractive half-naked tattooed man, and a diamond on her finger large enough to scare King Kong. Now if she could just remember how it all happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is for certain, being married to rock and roll’s favourite son is sure to be a wild ride.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Kylie Scott returns with the highly anticipated follow-up to international bestseller &lt;i&gt;Lick&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mal Ericson, drummer for the world famous rock band Stage Dive, needs to clean up his image fast—at least for a little while. Having a good girl on his arm should do the job just fine. Mal doesn't plan on this temporary fix becoming permanent, but he didn't count on finding the one right girl. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Rollins never thought she'd ever meet the rock god who plastered her teenage bedroom walls—especially not under these circumstances. Anne has money problems. Big ones. But being paid to play the pretend girlfriend to a wild life-of-the-party drummer couldn't end well. No matter how hot he is. Or could it?</description>

While Lick, Book 1 had a bit more of a serious tone, Play injects a bunch of funny and highly amusing moments. <br /><br />I found myself laughing at Mal's antics and fully enjoying the hell out of this book.

  <description>Thea Landry has always known her place in modern-day society. It’s somewhere just above the trash can her mother dumped her in as a newborn but below the class where much comes easy. With her tattered shoes and bargain-bin clothes, her life has never been full of glamour. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when a rich and charismatic man takes interest, she doesn’t fool herself into thinking their encounter is anything more than a one-night stand. Months later, she’s kicking herself for not getting his phone number. Or his last name. She’s given up hope of seeing him ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one day, years later, Logan Kendrick waltzes into her life once more and turns everything she’s built upside down. This time around, she won’t make the same mistake. She’s going to fight to keep him in her life—not for herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for their daughter.</description>

  <description>Hollywood is a temptress, a trickster, a soul-stealing devil. I married an A-list player, knowing I come second place to his craft. But Lucas and I are a golden couple, a modern-day fairy tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve never doubted what we built...until the sudden death of Lucas’s best friend has scandal rocking the Hills and shaking the foundation of our relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose Lucas as my safe haven...he chose the role of a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the next three months, I’ll share my nights with a stranger, watching as he buries his pain, immersed in his role and living as someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’ve done this before. I tell myself it’s just another movie, and he’ll return to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should’ve known this time would be different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get my husband back, I’ll need the strength of ten men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, I’ll have to go through two.</description>

  <description>The Law of Henna and Bodhi: &lt;br /&gt;When love breaks, fall inward, fall together, and fall hard. Then let time pick up the pieces. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everything feels temporary when you’ve experienced tragedy—until Henna Lane meets Bodhi at a music festival. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Young and spontaneous, they have a lust for seizing the moment, falling hard and fast. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Bodhi is forced to leave without a goodbye, Henna thinks she’ll never get over him. But then she meets Mr. Malone, her sexy, new guidance counselor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They are reckless. &lt;br /&gt;They are forbidden. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When their secret is discovered, Henna has to choose between finishing school—banned from seeing Mr. Malone—or dropping out to follow her nomad dreams. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Henna chooses her dreams. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Over time, she learns that life is not a destination or a journey, some things are more than temporary, and the forbidden can never be ignored. But if she returns for him, will he still be hers? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A Place Without You is an emotional story of young love, shattered dreams, and impossible decisions.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Aurora Rose Reynolds comes a flirty romantic comedy of big love and second chances.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtney Williams wanted forever. She got six years of empty promises, a divorce, and a well-deserved settlement that’s paid her way to Manhattan. She has a new home under renovation, a new job, and a do-over as a happy “single in the city”—until she meets an architect with designs on more than her beams. He’s also a devoted single dad, a great cook, and has dark lashes to die for. Too good to be true. Now all Courtney can do is whisper, &lt;i&gt;Oh no, not again.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divorced Lucas Fremont isn’t looking to get swept away. But how can he &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; with a woman this sweet and sexy? She’s making his broken heart beat fast. His sister-in-law, Fawn, says go for it. But as cautious as Courtney is, Lucas has to do more than that. He has to fight for it. Now all he can do is think, &lt;i&gt;Don’t let this one get away&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Courtney comes with a secret. And Lucas comes with a bitter ex. If love is to stand a chance, they’re going to have to &lt;i&gt;take&lt;/i&gt; a chance.</description>

  <description>*Warning: 18+, Cliffhanger*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Darkness isn't all one shade, sweetheart."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three centuries ago, Molly Darling’s ancestors signed a contract in blood—daemon blood—to protect themselves from harm. On the eve she turns nineteen, Molly leaves for her birthday party against her parent’s wishes, sick of their warnings about her “betrothal to a demon.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that she’s very much betrothed, and he’s very much a demon—one who’s only agreed to the nuptials to steal Molly’s ancient daemon powers. Brash, arrogant, and built like a Greek god, Tensley Knight keeps showing up to save Molly from otherworldly attacks, only to insult her a moment later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Molly learns more about the demon world, she realizes two things: that her family’s safety depends on a successful marriage, while any chance of freedom she’ll ever have calls for Tensley’s demise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet sometimes Molly spots a tortured soul beyond those liquid grey eyes, and there’s no denying the way her skin tingles when Tensley touches it. In Vein of Love, safety requires sacrifice, foe becomes lover, and one must decide whether to kiss...or to kill.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“The feeling I have in this very moment, after not seeing her for so long, will haunt me forever, reminding me why I left to begin with.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as I can remember, Easton Crews has been off-limits. As much as it kills me, that’s never going to change. &lt;br /&gt;After his little disappearing act three years ago, then suddenly showing up out of nowhere, I shouldn't want anything to do with him. &lt;br /&gt;It doesn’t matter how beautiful he still is. Or how close we once were. It shouldn’t matter that my entire body lights on fire with need whenever he gets close. &lt;br /&gt;He chose the worst possible time to leave without so much as a goodbye. &lt;br /&gt;However, just like the first day he walked into our home, I'm drawn to him, needing him near me just as badly as I need air to breathe, and I can't stand it. &lt;br /&gt;I want to hate him. I know I should hate him. But hating him is the last thing he'll let me do. &lt;br /&gt;I push, he pulls harder, until I'm completely wrapped up in him, my mind lost in the one person who is forbidden—the one person I’ve always loved, even when he belonged to someone else. &lt;br /&gt;Easton was never meant to be mine. It took me years to come to terms with that and now that I finally have, he's here, right in front of me, more irresistible than ever. &lt;br /&gt;The part I fear the most about that—he’s the one person capable of completely wrecking my world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“I’m not leaving until you take all of your hate out on me. Let me feel it. All of it. Every dirty look. Every nasty fucking word. I will have it all before I leave. Stop hiding from me.”&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;There’s a thin line between love and hate . . . and it cuts right through the middle of their office.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad boys? They run right over good girls like Georgina Keller. But after a confidence-shattering breakup, she’s determined not to let anyone at her new workplace push her around—least of all the brooding creative director, a “bad boy of publishing” who’s made it clear she’s enemy #1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian Quinn's taste for fast cars, late nights, and beautiful women may have gotten him to the top of a leading New York magazine, but the reputation that made him is suddenly threatening to end his career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgina can help Modern Man shed its bad reputation, but in order to do that, she’ll have to start at the top—and no amount of rakish charm or inconvenient attraction will distract her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because if Sebastian gets her right where he wants her, it means she’s going down.</description>

  <description>Dashiell Thane wasn’t a nice guy.&lt;br /&gt;He was an abrasive, demanding, conniving, intolerable brat. &lt;br /&gt;Yet somehow, we’d been best friends our whole lives. &lt;br /&gt;Until our senior year when I finally decided to dip my toes into the dating pool. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All it took was one kiss for jealousy, lies, and betrayal to sweep in and propel us heart first into dizzying, hostile depths. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’re not supposed to kiss your best friend. &lt;br /&gt;You’re definitely not supposed to kiss your best friend while you’re dating someone else. &lt;br /&gt;And the absolute worst thing you could do is fall for your best friend.&lt;br /&gt;Unless, of course, you want to ruin everything.</description>

      <![CDATA[Kiss and Break Up was a storyline that had me engaged the entire way through. I have a soft spot for romance books that have characters that have known each other forever. Throw in the fact that they are best friends and it's the perfect recipe for an angsty read full of emotions. <br /><br />I loved Dash an...]]>

  <description>It had been six years since my world was turned upside down.&lt;br /&gt;He exposed me to the darker side of life and I could never go back to the person I was.&lt;br /&gt;I had been through more things the average person couldn’t even relate to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had the chance to go back and do things differently though?&lt;br /&gt;Not a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d pick him a thousand times. A million times. For eternity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess not much has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Alexa Ballentine, and I am still in love with my stalker.</description>

  <description>Erin has had a crush on her brother’s best friend Ward for as long as she can remember. But eleven years ago he disappeared from their lives – breaking Erin’s trust, and her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the person they both love most – Erin’s brother Tommy – is nearly killed in a terrible crash, she and Ward are thrown back together for the first time. Their lives couldn’t be further apart. Erin still lives at home, working two jobs and dealing with a series of family disasters. Ward, now a multimillionaire entrepreneur and a household name, seems determined to make amends – but it may be just too little too late. And while Erin can’t deny feeling a spark at the sight of Ward, is it a spark of love or burning resentment?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At odds with one another but forced to share their heartache, have Erin and Ward really drifted apart forever, or have they finally found the anchor they both so desperately need?</description>

  <description>Falling for your best friend's sister has never felt so bad yet so damn right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From USA Today Bestselling author BJ Harvey comes the third and final standalone in the Chance series, this time it's the much anticipated story of Drew and Ashley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;I have a long history of acting first and thinking it through later. In fact, I'm the definition of a screw up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Case in point - I’m having a baby with a woman I can’t stand, my ex is now my best friend’s wife, and I’m in love with a woman I can never have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest secret is falling for my best friend’s sister twelve years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest mistake is thinking I could live without her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now my biggest regret is the look on her face the moment I tell everyone I’m already married to the woman they hate most.</description>

  <description>After years of war, Lincoln Sheppard thought he’d left the violence and ugliness behind. He was content with the life he built for himself. Then the woman down the street came in and shook everything up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Eden Brenner ever wanted was to have a place to call home. She finally found that in Hope Valley. Then she went and fell in love with the man a few houses down the first time she laid eyes on him. There was just one problem. Women like her didn’t catch the attention of men like him. He was totally and completely out of her league. And to make matters worse, when her past comes knocking, the beautiful world she’s built for herself is at risk of crumbling to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When danger forces Eden into his arms, Lincoln begins to see her in a whole new light, and he suddenly finds himself wanting things he never expected. And he wants them all with the shy, clumsy woman from down the street. But when the truth comes out, that proves nearly impossible. Now he’s fighting the hardest battle of his life, and the stakes are higher than ever. Protect the woman he’s falling for while trying to win her heart at the same time.</description>

  <description>If you knew love would hurt you, would you fall? If you knew love would leave you, would you let it go? If you knew love could never be, would you try? From bestselling author Randi Cooley Wilson comes a love story about heartbreak, second chances, and letting go. The ifs that linger between the pages of this novel will break your heart and stay with you long after the final chapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emerson Shaw thought she’d left her old life behind her, but when she returns home for her best friend’s wedding, she has no idea her past is waiting to reclaim her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lincoln Daniels never wanted to find love. But when he met straight-laced Emerson, he fell. Hard. The only thing they seemed to have in common was an undeniable mutual attraction, but from the moment he laid eyes on her, there was something about her that called to him. Until he lost her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when Emerson is finally ready to let go and stop existing in a past full of pain and regret, Lincoln returns, turning her life upside down. What begins as a tentative friendship quickly escalates, and the two soon realize that all the ifs lingering between them no longer matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when two broken people meet, fall in love, and realize they can never be? What happens when all the what ifs no longer make sense? If you knew your heart would break, would you still fall? This book is intended for mature audiences.</description>

I’ve picked up and put down so many books that I was ready to cry and I’m positive that it had nothing to do with the books themselves, I’ve just been in a funk. <br /><br />And while I will admit that even going into this one...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Everyone knows the girl is off limits. But it's so good to be bad. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There's this girl...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heidi and I have been trading hungry looks all year, and everything she does makes me smile. But I don't do girlfriends, and I certainly can't get involved with the league commissioner's daughter. I need shots on goal, not a hookup and a widely misunderstood paparazzi photo.&lt;br /&gt;Can I resist her, though? The way she teases me should be a game penalty for interference with my libido.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There's this guy...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason wants me, but he won't admit it. That man looks at me the way a hockey player eyes the lunch buffet after practice--and I love it. &lt;br /&gt;But when victory is finally within my grasp, I blow it and humiliate myself. Even then I can't even avoid him--as the team intern, I'm in constant view of his hard body and cocky smile. &lt;br /&gt;I need another chance. Jason Castro is about to learn the true meaning of an overnight sensation.</description>

  <description>This isn’t the life I want. &lt;br /&gt;Trapped in one random hotel room after another by a screaming crowd of fans and paparazzi. No friends or family nearby. Nothing that really makes me happy, except my music. &lt;br /&gt;Music is my only love, the only thing that makes my heart beat fast and my blood run hot, until her. Kinley Matthews, the owner of the Foxhaven Resort, is nothing like the women I’m accustomed to dating, but she’s everything I need. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And she hates the sight of me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everything I’ve done has been for family. &lt;br /&gt;That’s what I tell myself when the memory of her laugh seeps into my day. &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t have a choice. &lt;br /&gt;That’s my excuse when her devastated expression haunts my nights. &lt;br /&gt;The truth is, every second of pain and heartache I suffer, I deserve it. &lt;br /&gt;She loved me, and I destroyed her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*This is the conclusion of Kinley and Holt's story. It's a full length novel with no cliffhanger.</description>

  <description>Gabby&lt;br /&gt;I’m a Monroe. &lt;br /&gt;My last name has defined me for as long as I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;How I loved. How I lived. Who I am. &lt;br /&gt;As proud as I am to be a Monroe and as much as I love my family, I need to break free from their sometimes-stifling protection. &lt;br /&gt;It’s time to find out who I am, apart from being the youngest of this strong, tight-knit family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brandon&lt;br /&gt;I’m a broken man. &lt;br /&gt;But I didn't get here completely on my own. &lt;br /&gt;I was pushed into this hell I live in. Now, I’m determined to make my greatest enemy and former friend, Michael Monroe, pay.&lt;br /&gt;And I know exactly how to do it. I will break him. And I’ll go through her to do it, even if it kills me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***This is technically the final book in the Monroe Family series. Although it can be read as a standalone, I strongly urge you to read Unbreakable and Unbroken (at least) to better connect with this story.</description>

And the sister of Mercy, an infamous assassin.We fell for each other, hard. Until forces outside of our control intervened. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now, she's a prisoner, doing everything she can to keep her family safe. And I'm her guard, doing everything I can to set her free.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; I'd take a bullet for her. Hell, I'd take a few. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In this dark, twisted world, we only have each other. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'd take a bullet for her. Hell, I'd take a few.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But I have to wonder, is that enough? &lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Love is ugly and secrets will destroy you. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;KAT &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t beg. &lt;br /&gt;I don’t cry. &lt;br /&gt;And I don’t give second chances. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ream, the lead guitarist of the rock band Tear Asunder, deserves a gold medal for best dick move ever when he ran the moment he discovered my secret after two days of hot sex. Then he brings some chick to my coming home party from the hospital—after being shot. &lt;br /&gt;I hate him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Until … &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ream’s six foot two frame unfolds out of the car after being gone on tour for eight months. I stared. And in my defense, any girl would stare. It would almost be rude not to because Ream was the type of guy who stood out. Not because he was loud and obnoxious. No, it was because he was the complete opposite. Subtle and dangerously quiet. If he spoke, you’d better hope he liked you because otherwise you’d be falling at his feet begging for mercy. Except me … I don’t beg—ever. &lt;br /&gt;But when our eyes locked, it was Ream’s steady confidence that had my nerves shooting off like jet sprinklers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Then… &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ream told me he didn't need a second chance because he was still working on his first. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;REAM &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sex is ugly. It’s using someone for your own narcissistic pleasure. I did it, but hated it—until her. She was unexpected. Then I had to wreck our beginning with my screwed up past. I don’t deserve her, but I’m selfish and I’m taking her anyway. This is who I am and it’s too late to change me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;******Warning contains violence, sexual content, and coarse language. Some scenes may be triggers.

  <description>Kip Carmichael is no pretty boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's a rough. Dirty. Giant. Hair so unruly, and a beard so thick, his friends on the team call him Sasquatch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time Sasquatch lays eyes on Theodora "Teddy" Johnson across the keg at a party one night on Jock Row, she'd been relegated to the sidelines by her jock hungry "friends."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week-after-week, he watches beautiful but bashful Teddy getting overshadowed, and overlooked. Sasquatch finally broad shoulders his way through the crowd, offering to to be her hairy godmother. But the minute their eyes meet? He's a goner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teaching her the RULES for winning a jock will be the easy part. Not falling in love with her is going to be a losing game.</description>

  <description>A second chance romance &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when you fall for the boy next door?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bea Norwood had the market on normal.&lt;br /&gt;Drama free life? Check.&lt;br /&gt;A single-mother who doubled as her confidant and partner in crime? Check.&lt;br /&gt;A neighbor and best friend she trusted more than anyone? Check.&lt;br /&gt;But that was until the day her mother remarried. The day that changed everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her best friend's cousin, Liam Falcon, is sent to live with his aunt and uncle to clean up his act, Bea finds herself falling for the boy next door. With their hearts so infinitely entwined, Bea turns to Liam as her only escape from her new step-brother's daily torment at home. Bea thought their love could conquer anything. But she was wrong. Love was for fools, and she was the biggest fool of them all. When Liam left Lakeport, he took her heart with him, shattering the organ to pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six years later, Liam takes a trip back to Lakeport to visit his family, and to see HER.&lt;br /&gt;His first love.&lt;br /&gt;The girl who holds his heart.&lt;br /&gt;The same girl who shattered it six years ago without looking back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liam is hell-bent on seeing Bea again after six years, but what he finds tears his heart in half. Bea Norwood is a shell of the girl he fell in love with. Underneath the baggy clothes, and pale skin, he knows she's still in there somewhere, he just needs to find her. &lt;br /&gt;Liam will stop at nothing to win his girl back, but sometimes, ignorance is bliss, and Liam isn't prepared for Bea's truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Contains themes of abuse. May cause triggers.</description>

  <description>***Author Note: This is not a love story. This is a story of love gone wrong.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up the way I did, you’d think I’d be more screwed up than what I actually am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon as I turned sixteen, I left that bump in the road I called home and took my chances on the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best decision I ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, at the age of twenty six, I’m educated, employed and damn good at my job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends have become my family. Like me, they know what it’s like to grow up unloved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the saying is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world makes way for those who know where they are going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know where I’m going and I’ll get there eventually. On my own terms and at my own pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then there’s him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel his eyes on me. I see him hiding in plain sight. He watches me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He makes me feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s unconventional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it’s real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m sure you’re wondering how a person falls in love with their stalker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So am I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn’t a story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my life.</description>

  <description>From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp; USA Today bestselling author Nashoda Rose, comes a new, sexy standalone romance novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was one night together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t supposed to see him again. &lt;br /&gt;I never thought I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, the six foot three cement graffiti wall of badass strides back into my life, and does it full force.&lt;br /&gt;Now he’s protecting me from his past and I’m protecting myself against the heated chaos he erupts in my body. It doesn’t help that he can do playful and sweet, when he’s not doing bossy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the overly confident, playboy Deaglan Kane is danger, has no boundaries, and is totally off limits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I know behind his walls there’s a man with a dark and damaged past.&lt;br /&gt;A man more dangerous. A man who may be the greatest threat of all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Irish Crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*May contain triggers. 18+</description>

  <description>Cobi Mayson knows exactly who Hadley is to him the moment he sees her for the very first time. That doesn’t mean it will be easy for him to convince her to take a chance on him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hadley Emerson knows she could fall hard and fast for a guy like Cobi. A man who seems to show up every time she needs him, but she knows better than to just hand over her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing his future with Hadley is on the line, Cobi begins to tie their lives together. As the invisible rope that connects them tightens and things between them heat up, an unknown threat emerges threatening to to take away their happily ever after and send them both into darkness.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Jesse Lee is the worst!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s a multi-millionaire, triple-platinum-selling, Grammy-Award-winning man-slut—a worldly, self-indulgent heathen. I wouldn’t sleep with him if he were our last chance to ensure survival of the human race. The only reason I put up with him is because he’s my boss’s brother. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whatsherface is one of those holier-than-thou types.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s bossy, has a horrific singing voice, and she’s so ordinary, she practically blends in with the eggshell-colored walls—the complete opposite of anyone I’d bang. The only reason I put up with her is because my career is on the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Playing by Heart&lt;/i&gt; is an enemies-to-lovers romance where opposites not only attract, they ignite.</description>

  <description>Haley Brandt isn’t the one-night-stand type, but too much tequila and a man with two sinfully black eyes left her breathless and willing to break her own rules. Her only solace was the fact that she’d never see him again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the next morning when she finds out he’s her ride out of town and back to the ranch where she grew up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nixon Holt works with Haley’s father, so Haley makes her position clear—she doesn’t get involved with ranch employees. Ever. At nineteen, she’d learned her lesson the hard way, and it became her one unbreakable rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Nixon makes his position clear, too: He’s going to wear down Haley’s defenses and he won’t stop until she breaks all her rules for him. He’s well on his way when Haley finds out the one thing that could make her hate him. Nixon is left with two choices: walk away or break all his rules for her.</description>

  <description>Remington Badd…he’s just as big, just as BADD, just as foul-mouthed and filthy-minded as his brother Roman. But under that rough and wild exterior lies a secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juneau Isaac, a Yup’ik Inuit, is the daughter of a hiking guide father and a mother who creates works of art and sells it to the tourists. The first to go to college—the first to leave her family’s ancestral home near Ketchikan—Juneau feels a deep sense of obligation to her family, to ignore the real passion that beats inside her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A roughneck smokejumper with an artist’s soul hidden deep inside. An artist living a false life, harboring secrets and fostering forbidden passions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can these two find their way to living their truths while navigating the tumultuous waters of a whirlwind romance? In a battle between familial obligation and secret dreams, will there be room for love—not to mention the wild intensity of uncontrollable lust—in these closed-off hearts?</description>

  <description>Fresh out of college and headed straight for my dream job, I didn’t think things could get any better.&lt;br /&gt;Then I met my dream man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an instant, my happy ever after had begun.&lt;br /&gt;The life I’d stumbled into was beautiful, and the man I loved was perfect. &lt;br /&gt;But perfection comes at a cost, and I’d slumbered through all the alarms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I met my nightmare. &lt;br /&gt;The man whose bright eyes held untamed darkness. &lt;br /&gt;The man who disarmed me with his peculiar behavior. &lt;br /&gt;The man whose cold, merciless hands shook me awake. &lt;br /&gt;In an instant, questions started to dismantle my happy ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But whoever said the truth would set you free was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t going to repair the cracks in my naive heart. &lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t going to caress my face with comforting hands and reassure me it was all just a dream.&lt;br /&gt;No, the truth shoved me down a rabbit hole, and I landed in the lair of a real-life monster.</description>

  <description>Sutton Briar has lived the past several years doing everything in her power to remain invisible. &lt;br /&gt;Boxy skirts? &lt;br /&gt;Oversized tops in muted colors? &lt;br /&gt;Yes please! &lt;br /&gt;She learned the hard way that gaining the attention of the opposite sex could lead down a very dangerous path. She’s content to blend in with the wallpaper, but then her boss makes a request she can’t refuse for fear of losing her job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretend to be the girlfriend of legendary musician, Camden Knight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s just one problem. She can’t stand him… and the feeling is mutual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camden Knight spent years burying a crucial part of himself from the public eye. But when a one-night stand gone horribly wrong blows the lid off his secret, the only hope of repairing the damage to his reputation comes at the hands of a woman he despises. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re complete opposites in every way, but what starts as a fake relationship quickly turns into something neither of them expected. And what was supposed to be only one night leaves them both wanting so much more.</description>

  <description>Sophia Cova lived a quiet, normal life, shadowed in sadness after the loss of her parents in a tragic airline accident. With her older brother being her only living relative and her anchor, Sophia is sure she’s destined for a brighter future. But that was until she was taken. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Stolen from her mundane, orderly life, she was drugged, and woke to every woman’s worst nightmare.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With only four grimy basement walls and a rancid mattress, she loses her sense of time, and preserves what’s left of her dignity by hurtling herself into the safety of her mind. The men, the beatings, they come and go with no reaction, until she hears one word that sends an arctic chill through her body. Sold.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the eve of Sophia’s bidding, at one of the largest sexual slavery rings in the world, all hell breaks loose in the mansion of horrors. Gunfire and screams erupt all around her, as panic rises. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Snatched by one monster only to be taken by another, Sophia slowly starts to learn that not everything is as it seems. When secrets unravel, and the twisted game of cat and mouse ensues, The Puppeteer pulls his favorite strings and chaos brews. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lives are lost while the clock ticks, and only time will tell who will be killed next…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WARNING: This book contains very disturbing situations, dubious content, strong language, and graphic violence. May contain triggers for abuse victims.&lt;br /&gt;*Cliffhanger*&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>We thought the games were over, but they've only just begun... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She was the puppet. &lt;br /&gt;He pulled the strings. &lt;br /&gt;Now the death toll is rising, what could this mean? &lt;br /&gt;It was all a game. &lt;br /&gt;Of feelings. &lt;br /&gt;Of pain. &lt;br /&gt;Death is just an illusion, or so they say. &lt;br /&gt;She was just a pawn on a piece of his demented board. But there's only one question left to settle the score…Can dead people really stay dead?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Rachel van Dyken’s scorching series, revenge is a justified pleasure…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isla made one &lt;i&gt;teeny&lt;/i&gt; little mistake. Now she and her PI company, Dirty Exes, are being targeted by one seriously angry and furiously sexy ex-quarterback. &lt;i&gt;Jessie freakin’ Beckett.&lt;/i&gt; But there’s no way some NFL superhunk is going to take her business away. If only he didn’t make her so hot—and bothered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessie wants payback for a ruined reputation. His plan? Top secret. His hard-to-hide arousal for Isla? Not so much. Especially when they let down their guards and sneak a kiss. Like any juicy scandal, it goes so viral, so fast, that only a good lie can combat the bad press. Mortal enemies in a fling? No way. &lt;i&gt;Um&lt;/i&gt;…this is love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually…could it be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isla’s not faking it. Jessie can’t. As the game of let’s pretend gets real, Jessie forgets all about revenge. That’s the problem. His plan is already out of his control. Now it could undo everything they’ve been trying to build. Coming clean may be the only thing that can save it.</description>

  <description>My name is Oliver Arsen, but my mates call me Ollie. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I live hard and love harder, and it’s love that usually gets me in the most trouble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;According to the greater population, &lt;b&gt;I’m the ultimate jerk.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My affection tends to be short-lived—a quality I’ve been assured multiple times by the fairer sex isn’t becoming—and the &lt;i&gt;leaving&lt;/i&gt; part of &lt;i&gt;loving and leaving&lt;/i&gt; has always come natural. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At least, it used to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Luciana Wright.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s an American bombshell and my sister’s best friend—a woman so wrong for &lt;br /&gt;me, it’s written in the waves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And she’s the reason we’re all here. &lt;br /&gt;The reason I have to go back to explain how it all went wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;To the day the jerk started falling.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>From bestselling author K Webster and Nikki Ash comes Heath: a modern telling of a classic tale &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn’t a typical love story. This is a story of what happens when love is so powerful and all-consuming that it has the ability to destroy everyone involved. It’s definitely not pretty and it’s certainly not a fairytale, but it’s their story and it couldn’t be told any other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heath is a full-length standalone romance.</description>

  <description>Phillip&lt;br /&gt;My life is golden. I truly have it all. Women, a fast paced racing career, fame, a massive house, and plenty of money.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, life is sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, since I’m an Adamson the smooth ride is over as my past comes crashing through making everything complicated.&lt;br /&gt;Easy is my comfort zone. Difficult is my nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillian&lt;br /&gt;My life has been anything but simple. I’ve seen things that will haunt me for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;Still, I refuse to let fear control me. I will face every challenge head on and find a way to prove everyone wrong. It may be difficult, but I will make the world better.&lt;br /&gt;Taking the easy way out is not an option.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Rule number one: don't fall for jerks.&lt;br /&gt;Rule number two: don't fall for your best friend's brother.&lt;br /&gt;Oops. Too late.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m Luciana Wright.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone calls me Lucky, but when it comes to love, I’m anything but.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a &lt;i&gt;long&lt;/i&gt; history of dating the wrong men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the ones I’m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;The beautiful, charming guys who are quite literally too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;The ones who are impulsive in love and prefer short flings over long-term relationships.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m talking about &lt;i&gt;the jerks&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guys who taste &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; good, but are &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; very bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through the most ridiculous breakup in the history of breakups, I thought I’d learned my lesson. I officially put myself into jerk rehab and committed to changing my ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, let’s be real here, love is never &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially when an arrogant, charming, he-devil of a sexy alpha man gets involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aussie accent.&lt;br /&gt;Tanned skin.&lt;br /&gt;Muscular, surfer bod.&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous brown eyes.&lt;br /&gt;And the kind of sexy smile that brings women to their knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, did I mention that he’s also my best friend’s brother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. This story, &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; story, it’s a real doozy you guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The day I stopped falling for jerks, I met Oliver Arsen—the biggest jerk of all.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Two season tickets. &lt;br /&gt;One genius idea. &lt;br /&gt;Zero interest in a relationship. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The plan is simple: a brand new, hot, preferably funny, definitely single male will fill one of those seats for every Bears game at Soldier Field. And I’ll fill the other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can’t think of a better way to use the season passes I’d bought for my ex-husband. I am a woman of plans, and this one’s foolproof. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until Zach Bowen offers to be my practice round. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s infuriating. Presumptuous and overbearing. And absolutely, undeniably gorgeous. Any woman with a heartbeat would be attracted to him, and mine picks up speed every time he speaks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But as I said, I’m a woman of plans — and I’m not backing down on this one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One night. One game. And then, his time’s up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He can try to change the rules, but here’s the truth: he can’t win if he’s playing the wrong game. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; The Wrong Game is a stand-alone, angsty, enemies-to-lovers sports romance. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Millie Morris has always been one of the guys. A UC Santa Barbara professor, she’s a female-serial-killer expert who’s quick with a deflection joke and terrible at getting personal. And she, just like her four best guy friends and fellow professors, is perma-single.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when a routine university function turns into a black tie gala, Mille and her circle make a pact that they’ll join an online dating service to find plus-ones for the event. There’s only one hitch: after making the pact, Millie and one of the guys, Reid Campbell, secretly spend the sexiest half-night of their lives together, but mutually decide the friendship would be better off strictly platonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But online dating isn’t for the faint of heart. While the guys are inundated with quality matches and potential dates, Millie’s first profile attempt garners nothing but dick pics and creepers. Enter “Catherine”—Millie’s fictional profile persona, in whose make-believe shoes she can be more vulnerable than she’s ever been in person. Soon “Catherine” and Reid strike up a digital pen-pal-ship...but Millie can’t resist temptation in real life, either. Soon, Millie will have to face her worst fear—intimacy—or risk losing her best friend, forever.</description>

  <description>I have loved Channing Monroe all my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In first grade, he asked for my Trapper Keeper. &lt;br /&gt;I hit him in the head with it. &lt;br /&gt;Third grade, we were best friends. We kissed in seventh grade. &lt;br /&gt;Eighth grade, he turned into a bad boy and the rest was a tumultuous storm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up, the problem was never love for us. &lt;br /&gt;Bad times. Good times. There were times when I felt our love in every inch of my body, vibrating, making me feel like it could bring me back to life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem was us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that we’re living in two different worlds now. &lt;br /&gt;Fallen Crest and its millionaires for me. Roussou and their criminals for him. I was thriving in mine and he was running his. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there were nights I felt we couldn’t be further apart than we were, and there were nights I felt we shared the same heartbeat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When was it time? &lt;br /&gt;When was it time to either sacrifice, make a change, or walk away from the boy I grew up with?</description>

      <![CDATA[To say I devoured this book is a gross understatement. I'm a huge fan of this series already. <br /><br />I love books that have storylines depicting relationships over time and this one does that.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Never again would I allow my heart to become the plaything of someone else. &lt;br /&gt;Never again would I let a man (or men) come between me and my goals. &lt;br /&gt;Never again would I love without feeling the fullness of that love in return. &lt;br /&gt;Not until I knew it was real. And if that took me a lifetime to find, so be it.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Those were my vows, and after all that had happened with Connor and Weston, I was determined to keep them. To protect my heart. &lt;br /&gt;And then he came home, and my vows became his promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He held my heart in his hands with reverence and care. &lt;br /&gt;He helped me find my soul’s greatest purpose in life. &lt;br /&gt;He loved me with a love so pure and vibrant, I knew I’d never feel anything like it in a hundred lifetimes. &lt;br /&gt;It was real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until it wasn’t. &lt;br /&gt;Until it all came crashing down when I discovered the deep love I thought I’d found was nestled in a web of lies—so soft and silken I hadn’t noticed it was there.&lt;br /&gt;Until it was too late. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********&lt;br /&gt;Long Live the Beautiful Hearts is the emotional, heart-wrenching conclusion to the Beautiful Hearts Duet by bestselling author, Emma Scott, and is inspired by the classic tale, Cyrano de Bergerac. (Roxanne) THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL LOVE TRIANGLE #confusedhearts #notamenage &lt;br /&gt;THIS BOOK IS NOT A STANDALONE. It should not be read without first reading &lt;i&gt;Bring Down the Stars&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Never trust a man who gets paid to take off his clothes for a living and then uses it as a pick-up line to get girls in bed with him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That should’ve been enough for me to call in sick that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve worked with male cover models like him before and they’re all the same—smooth-talking, sexy as sin, egotistical know-it-alls who think they’re God’s gift to women—all traits I know to steer clear of. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assisting authors comes with many perks—reading on the job, using my organizing skills on a daily basis, drinking coffee by the gallons—but Maverick Kingston barges into my life and demands more than I can handle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we’re forced to road trip across the country together, he pushes every boundary I have and rearranges my thoughts on playing it safe. And when he “accidentally” drops his towel, he makes it very clear what he’s offering and proves he’s packing more than abs of steel under his clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working with him was brutal, but falling for him was unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;And playing by the rules will be impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**This is a complete STANDALONE novel — filled with plenty of humor, steam, &amp;amp; romance! 18 &amp;amp; up only due to explicit sexual content, language, and adult content.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>I saw her first.&lt;br /&gt;Blonde. Gorgeous. Feisty.&lt;br /&gt;I was &lt;i&gt;smitten.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it didn’t matter because she chose him and he was my best friend and roommate. I’d never be able to compete with that, so I pushed her away instead. It was easy when she lived hours away, and I didn’t have to see her every day, but then she moved in with us. &lt;br /&gt;Now, I’m &lt;i&gt;screwed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To her singing in the shower every morning, dancing in the kitchen while she makes coffee, and doing yoga in our living room, I can’t stop thinking about her in all the wrong ways. She’s not mine and never will be, but that doesn’t stop me from wanting to push her against a wall and claim her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s constantly on me for making messes, bringing chicks home every weekend, and being a smartass when their PDA gets on my nerves. Considering neither of them know how I feel, it’s not fair for the way I act toward them. I should move out so I can get over her for good; however, the selfish part of me can’t let go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the unthinkable happens... &lt;br /&gt;When my best friend dies in a motorcycle accident, the two of us are left to grieve our loss together. Instead of pushing her away, I pull her closer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as we come to terms with our new reality, she finds out she’s pregnant with his baby. &lt;br /&gt;And I’m left to make the &lt;i&gt;hardest&lt;/i&gt; decision of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**BABY MINE is an angsty, emotional, slow-burn romance wrapped up in a heartbreakingly delicious love story. It's book 1 in the Hunter &amp;amp; Lennon duet of the Roommate Duet Series and must be read first.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>For never was there a story of more woe than that of Holland Brooks and her Romeo...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as I can remember, London Sinclair was the boy who was forbidden. It didn’t matter that he made my heart skip a beat. Our surnames fated us to be sworn enemies. But when the truth was finally revealed, my life changed forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lies have shaped our past, leaving London and me to pick up the pieces. But through the chaos, one thing is certain—I love London, and he loves me, and we won’t allow anyone to tear us apart again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, life has a funny way of proving us wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we attempt to make amends for the past ten years, we soon discover that the ghosts of our past will do anything to drive us apart. We are once again surrounded by deceit and betrayal, testing us in ways we never imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I’m faced with a proposition to end this heartache once and for all, I blindly agree. That decision changes everything, and I soon learn that those who act in haste create their own destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does love really triumph all? Or will London and I succumb to what was always written in the stars?</description>

  <description>Dear Mister...**strike out** no, too formal.&lt;br /&gt;Hey there sweet cheeks *strike out* no, too forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To whom it may concern,&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure; before we move forward with this email, I would like it to be known that I have consumed an adequate amount of alcoholic beverages to intoxicate myself tonight. Three margaritas, two shots, and one beer—because it was free.&lt;br /&gt;I think it’s important to be open and honest with your co-workers, don’t you?&lt;br /&gt;So here I am, being honest. Drunk but honest. Or just drunk with lust? You decide.&lt;br /&gt;I like you so much it’s clouding my judgment and making me do things I never would sober. Like write this letter.&lt;br /&gt;I have a hopeless, foolish, schoolgirl crush on you when you are the last person on earth I should be falling for. Did you know people around the office call you a sadist? An egomaniac. An insensitive, arrogant prick. Your bark is worse then your bite, and you don’t scare me. The fact is, I’d love that bite of yours to nip at my bare skin while we’re both wearing nothing but sheets.&lt;br /&gt;For once I want you to look at me as more than one of your employees. &lt;br /&gt;And as long as we're being honest, that navy blue suit you wear? With the crisp white shirt? It really makes me want to loosen your tie and show you who’s boss. &lt;br /&gt;Love,&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Yours.</description>

Terror.&lt;br /&gt;She was off-limits, but it didn’t stop me from wanting her.&lt;br /&gt;My life was empty. My thoughts were dark. My heart was stone.&lt;br /&gt;Feeling unwanted for most of my life, I didn’t know where I belonged or what my purpose was. He was all I had until she came along and brought out emotions I never knew were possible. She was innocent. Pure. Untouched. She was the daughter of a rival club member, but that didn’t stop us. It only heightened the desire, the passion we felt. We were happy…until someone she trusted made a move that no one saw coming…&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Rachel Van Dyken had my heart racing with this romance. <br /><br />Marlo and Ray’s story was exhilarating, she took the ever iconic romance Dirty Dancing and put her spin on it.

  <description>Briggs,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember when we parted ways in Germany? It was the day I broke your heart. What you didn't know was that I was breaking mine too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought they’d be enough–my husband and my son. That I’d get home and everything would go back to the way it was . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the war. &lt;br /&gt;Before the ambush. &lt;br /&gt;Before you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, no matter how hard I try, I can’t erase the trauma we shared. I can’t seem to forget the way my heart beat in time with yours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is I’m lost without you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the nightmare was over when they pulled us from that hole in the ground, but nothing could have prepared me for the war I’d face at home.&lt;br /&gt;I know it’s selfish of me to ask, but, please, I have to see you one last time. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my love, &lt;br /&gt;Scottie</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Jake &lt;br /&gt;I know she’s lying the moment I see her. &lt;br /&gt;That her name is as fake as her story. She’s barged into my life like a beautiful nightmare, turning everything upside down. &lt;br /&gt;It hasn’t stopped me from trying to help her. Protect her. Save her from the threats that seem to come out of nowhere. &lt;br /&gt;She’s put my entire world at risk. My reputation. My business. My livelihood. &lt;br /&gt;But Mia brought me back to life. And I will do anything to save hers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mia &lt;br /&gt;I was running for my life the night I met Jake. &lt;br /&gt;Broken down on the road to nowhere. Lost. Homeless. Scared out of my mind. &lt;br /&gt;I don't care. I’m willing to risk it all to start over. Desperate to hide and never be found again. &lt;br /&gt;But it doesn't take much for Jake to break down my defenses. A soft word. A gentle touch. He becomes mine, but more importantly, I become his. &lt;br /&gt;Until the nightmare of my past shows up, pissed off as hell… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*This book contains material that might be offensive for some or elicit a strong emotional response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The world famous lead singer of the hard rock group, Jilted, has moved into the Presidential Suite of my hotel. His reputation precedes him and none of it is positive. Considering his past exploits, drunken fights, and fondness for destroying hotel rooms, I don’t expect the next four months to be easy. For the sake of Foxhaven Resort, I’m going to make it work. Hosting an A-list celebrity will draw affluent guests and solidify the future success of the resort recently left to me by my late father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have enormous shoes to fill and no rude, womanizing rock god is going to distract me. With his powerful voice, gorgeous face, and lean body, he may be accustomed to getting his way, especially with women, but I know better.&lt;br /&gt;So, he can flash that charming smile in another direction.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Revenge is a dish best served cold.&lt;br /&gt;Which is a real problem when the attraction runs red-hot.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ice-cream store owner Raelynn Fortune has everything but her last name—fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite living in a Floridian hotspot for tourists, she just can’t get her business back off the ground. And she knows why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her rival store next door is run by nobody other than her ex, and with his fancy-schmancy concoctions, he’s taking all the clients two generations of her family cultivated. Never mind that Raelynn taught him all he knows, and his revenge for her breaking up with him was putting her plans into reality—and her almost out of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, she has a plan. The height of the season is just two weeks away, and she’s tired of playing second fiddle to her ex. She’s going to take back her crown as the queen of ice cream, even if it means getting close to Chase once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, all is fair in love and war, and you know what they say about keeping your enemies close… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although maybe Chase is a little too close…</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;There was a time when I was a princess with no power. I had no choice but to run, because I wanted control over my own life. However, when you spend your life planning your next escape, you forget to do the living stuff. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At least until the past comes back to remind you why you ran in the first place. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aside from my brother, there's only one other person from my past who could hold any power over me now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I...just wasn't expecting him to have gotten so batshit crazy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rush... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The boy prospect who grew up into a scary killer with very little morality left inside him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I should be a little more terrified about how obsessed he seems to be with me, but...I'm just warped enough to overlook the crazy. Mostly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's not a real romance unless it starts with a kidnapping, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yeah, my life has always been a crazy house. The more things change, the more they stay the same... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***Warning: This is a dark romance and not a healthy, wholesome relationship. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Violence warning &lt;br /&gt;**Language warning &lt;br /&gt;**Can be read as a stand-alone.</description>

  <description>IMOGEN: Jesse says you better know what you’re doing with Franco.  &lt;br /&gt;ME: Dude, I’m scared.&lt;br /&gt;IMOGEN: !! What? Tell me!&lt;br /&gt;ME: He makes me FEEL THINGS. It’s icky and I don’t like it. &lt;br /&gt;IMOGEN: You’ve known him what, a few hours? &lt;br /&gt;ME: I’m telling you, he scares the sh*t out of me. But he’s so good I can’t stop myself.&lt;br /&gt;IMOGEN: Audra, seriously. Chill. It’s been a couple hours. It’s just insta-lust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I send Imogen another selfie, this one of my face—I'm biting my lower lip, eyes wide, glancing to the side at Franco laying next to me—his mouthwatering and lust-inducing body is on full display from the waist up. I send a caption a second later:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ME: YOU DONT UNDERSTAND!!! HE’S GOT A MAGICAL D*CK AND I’M FEELING THINGS!!! &lt;br /&gt;ME: Uh-oh. He’s waking up. Time for round…3? 4? I’ve lost count. Tell me I’m a cold-hearted man-eating b*tch with no soul. Tell ME!&lt;br /&gt;IMOGEN: You’re a cold-hearted man-eating bi*ch with no soul? Only, you’re not. So…you’re on own with this one. Except if you need me of course. I’ve got All Thai’d Up on speed dial, three bottles of Josh in the rack.   &lt;br /&gt;ME: if this goes south—or anywhere except nowhere, you’d better make it four. Or six. Because we’re either going to be incredible together, or we’ll destroy each other. There will be no in between. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set the phone aside as Franco’s stunning blue eyes open and fix hungrily on me. He reaches for me, and all thoughts are banished except one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God, I hope I know what I'm doing… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I laugh internally at that, because does anyone know what they’re doing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I sure as hell don’t.</description>

  <description>Milo sold his soul to the devil to save an angel. &lt;br /&gt;Now he’s after revenge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are worse prisons than the lush estate of a notorious drug smuggler in Mexico. Mercy lives out her days alone and hidden from the world, but her sleep is riddled with nightmares of the muti and all the boys and girls just like her who weren’t lucky enough to get away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the people who kept her as a child are in Mexico, is it possible she could find them? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What starts as vigilante justice unravels a web of human trafficking deeper and darker than Milo and Mercy could’ve imagined. When she comes face-to-face with the people she once considered family, she proves she is far from the Angel they raised her to be.</description>

  <description>She’s beautiful yet scarred beyond repair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s powerful and lethal, in and out of the ring. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One act of kindness brought Sophie Parish far more danger than she could have ever imagined. Now she’s on the run, leaving behind her family and the only dream she’s ever had. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Retired EFC fighter Kolan Slade’s life has been one endless battle after another. He has a dark past with an even darker desire—the only one he’s ever known. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until he meets Sophie. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Intrigued by her raw beauty and the secrets she’s trying to hide, Kolan craves to know who she is and what she’s running from. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Protecting her becomes his obsession and he’ll sacrifice it all to save her. But in the end her love will have him questioning himself and everything he thought he knew. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is book three in the Acts Of Honor series, the spin-off series to Men Of Honor. Kolan and Sophie’s story is told in dual POV, has an HEA with no cliffhanger, and can be read as a standalone. However, I recommend reading prior books in both series, as characters play recurring roles throughout. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Due to mature subject matter, such as explicit sexual situations and coarse language, this story is not suitable for anyone under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>Sometimes two broken pieces make a whole. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s the one she’s always loved. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s the one he could never have. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A forbidden night of passion resulted in years of heartbreak when he walked away. Now she’s in danger and needs his help. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trust doesn’t come easy for FBI Agent Nick Stone, especially when it comes to love, but he’ll risk it all for Katelyn Slade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Including his heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bullets fly, betrayals are exposed, and the flames from their past ignite. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His protection might be what saves her but in the end she will be his salvation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is Book two in the Acts Of Honor series, the spin-off series to Men Of Honor. It’s Nick and Katelyn’s story and is told in dual POV, has an HEA with no cliffhanger and it can be read as a standalone. However, I highly recommend that you read the Men Of Honor series prior, as characters play recurring roles in both series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Due to mature subject matter, such as explicit sexual situations and coarse language, this story is not suitable for anyone under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>It was supposed to just be a quick trip to Manhattan.&lt;br /&gt;My best friend was heartbroken. She needed support, and I needed inspiration.&lt;br /&gt;I hoped to love the city. Bustling. Crazy. Inspiring New York.&lt;br /&gt;But I ended up at the airport, heading home in the same condition that I arrived.&lt;br /&gt;In a rut.&lt;br /&gt;Add to all that, missing my flight and losing my laptop—the laptop, where the Best Love Story Ever sat on my hard drive.&lt;br /&gt;Enter Noah Steele. Eerily familiar. Movie star. Heartthrob. Sultry romeo with bedroom eyes.&lt;br /&gt;(But we’re not going there.)&lt;br /&gt;He missed his flight too.&lt;br /&gt;Noah is so smoldering, lip-bitingly hot, he’s not taken seriously as an actor, and is struggling to launch his career in New York.&lt;br /&gt;He’s only ever had superficial girlfriends, so he’s having trouble showing true passion in his acting—the same challenge I’m having with this book.&lt;br /&gt;When we met, we didn’t know that our connection would bring us the change we’d been craving.&lt;br /&gt;That we’d be the very thing the other needed and didn’t know.&lt;br /&gt;Each other’s muse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;** MUSE is a complete standalone, no previous reading is necessary to enjoy.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The first time I met Jax Blackwood things went a little sideways. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In my defense, I didn’t know he was Jax Blackwood—who expects a legendary rock star to be shopping for groceries? More importantly, a blizzard was coming and he was about to grab the last carton of mint-chocolate chip. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Still, I might have walked away, but then he smugly dared me to try and take the coveted ice cream. So I kissed him. And distracted that mint-chip right out of his hands. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Okay, it was a dirty move, but desperate times and all that. Besides, I never expected he’d be my new neighbor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An annoying neighbor who takes great pleasure in reminding me that I owe him ice cream but would happily accept more kisses as payment. An irresistible neighbor who keeps me up while playing guitar naked–spectacularly naked–in his living room. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Clearly, avoidance is key. Except nothing about Jax is easy to ignore—not the way he makes me laugh, or that his particular brand of darkness matches mine, or how one look from him melts me faster than butter under a hot sun. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Neither of us believes in love or forever. Yet we’re quickly becoming each other’s addiction. But we could be more. We could be everything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All we have to do is trust enough to fall. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>7 hours, 9 minutes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He’s a Wall Street wolf. She’s been hired to tame him. From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lauren Layne comes a wildly sexy novel of business and pleasure.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-eight and filthy rich, Matt Cannon is the youngest broker on Wall Street. He may be a “boy wonder,” but he’s every inch a man. Ask any woman—any night. But when Matt’s latest fling makes scandalous headlines, his clients get anxious, and his bosses at Wolfe Investments level an ultimatum: keep his assets zipped, get a “real” girlfriend, and clean up his act. Only one woman can help Matt with something this hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For PR genius Sabrina Cross, the best fixer in Manhattan, playing Matt’s steady is going to be a challenge, even if it’s just for show. They already have an explosive history, she can’t stand the cocky party boy, and worse—she can’t stop thinking about him. So who’ll dare to break her “no touching” rule first? Because when that happens, Matt and Sabrina’s game of &lt;i&gt;let’s pretend&lt;/i&gt; will get so hot it could set both their reputations on fire.</description>

  <description>A struggling antiques collector finds herself falling in love with a millionaire playboy; but can she ever be a part of his world?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet the Naughty Princess Club, a series from &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Tara Sivec that brings readers to Fairytale Lane and the hilarity—and romance—that three women fall into once they decide to strut their stuff and bring on their own happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While her friends have broken free of their insecurities, Ariel Waters is struggling to come out of her shell. Her ex-husband took away her voice and her self-confidence, and Ariel is drowning under a sea of debt to afford the alimony she has to pay him. She refuses to ever fall for a man’s charms again, and is determined to make her own way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her house and her beloved antiques are taken by the bank after too many missed payments, Ariel finds herself adrift until the infuriatingly charming Eric Sailor comes to her rescue. Although she can’t stand the millionaire playboy, Eric’s kindness and unconditional support reveal hidden depths and a love that Ariel never imagined she could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are outside influences who will stop at nothing to keep them apart; can Ariel and Eric weather the storm and find a way to be together?</description>

  <description>They say your first kiss should be earned. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mine was stolen by a devil in a masquerade mask under the black Chicago sky. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say the vows you take on your wedding day are sacred. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mine were broken before we left church. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say your heart only beats for one man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mine split and bled for two rivals who fought for it until the bitter end. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was promised to Angelo Bandini, the heir to one of the most powerful families in the Chicago Outfit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then taken by Senator Wolfe Keaton, who held my father’s sins over his head to force me into marriage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say that all great love stories have a happy ending. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I, Francesca Rossi, found myself erasing and rewriting mine until the very last chapter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One kiss. &lt;br /&gt;Two men. &lt;br /&gt;Three lives. &lt;br /&gt;Entwined together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And somewhere between these two men, I had to find my forever.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>To survive where I live, you have two options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can be a Normal--a cheerleader, jock, member of the debate team, or on the yearbook committee. You pretend everything is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or you can be crew.&lt;br /&gt;You insult us? We hurt you.&lt;br /&gt;You hurt us? We really hurt you.&lt;br /&gt;And if you screw with us, we will end you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Bren.&lt;br /&gt;I'm the only female in the Wolf Crew--the best, fiercest, and most dangerous crew there is--and we have a rule: There's no falling in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well... too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This book contains mature young adult situations.&lt;br /&gt;*Full-length novel. First book in a series.&lt;br /&gt;*Book ends at 95%. Two bonus chapters are at the end.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Book 1:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Star-crossed lovers. A debutante ball. A billion dollar fraud. Manhattan royals turned bitter rivals.&lt;br /&gt;This enemies-to-lovers novella/novel duet will scorch your screens!&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was called a prodigal son. &lt;br /&gt;A scion of Midas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I believed it. Why wouldn’t I? &lt;br /&gt;Everything my father touched turned to gold. &lt;br /&gt;The proof was all around me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Luxury cars. &lt;br /&gt;Elite schools. &lt;br /&gt;A billion-dollar business. &lt;br /&gt;Even my girlfriend, a Park Avenue Princess. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I reigned from a throne of lies. &lt;br /&gt;My fall from grace . . . wasn’t graceful at all.</description>

  <description>He's a rock star with a secret; she's a pop princess with a painful past, can their forbidden romance survive, or will their lies destroy them both?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've earned my bad reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, I was New York City's hottest classical music prodigy. But I wanted something else, something more. So I chased my real dream, and now... I'm rock royalty. Dax Hughes, lead guitarist of Nothing but Trouble. But to my family and former Juilliard classmates, I'm an outcast. A misfit. A rebel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're not entirely wrong. I don't give a damn what other people think, and I'm all for breaking the rules... except when it comes to our new opening act, Verity Moore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rock gods don't tour with pop princesses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not personal. Actually, under that fallen diva reputation, Verity's incredibly talented. And her fiery redheaded personality is... intriguing. But I'm convinced the skeletons in Verity's closet are as scandalous as my own, and when we're not sparring, she has a way of drawing out all those secrets I'm determined to keep hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. Verity Moore is definitely off-limits . . .&lt;br /&gt;But since when do I give a damn about the rules?</description>

  <description>Finian Kelley and Tate Jennings met at a wedding…&lt;br /&gt;…but that doesn’t mean they had romance in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since meeting Finian Kelley at a wedding last fall, where they agreed to be physical with no strings attached, Tate Jennings can’t get him out of her head. So when an invitation arrives at her Florida condo, inviting Tate to spend St. Patrick’s Weekend back at Summerhaven where Finian works, she can’t resist heading up to New Hampshire for the festivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having just gotten out of an awesomely bad relationship, Finian Kelley has sworn off romance, which is why it’s good that hottie Tate Jennings lives far away in the Florida Keys. They may have fooled around at Rory’s wedding, but at least they have no future together, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong. When an annual celebration brings Tate back to New Hampshire, will Finian be able to stay away from the woman who’s already made an unwanted impression on his heart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Return to Summerhaven one last time for this sweet, sultry, summer novella!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(available in the SKINNY DIPPING OPTIONAL collection)</description>

  <description>Secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Everyone has one. &lt;br /&gt;Some are bigger than others. &lt;br /&gt;And when secrets are revealed, &lt;br /&gt;Some will heal you ... &lt;br /&gt;And some will end you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kate Sedgwick’s life has been anything but typical. She’s endured hardship and tragedy, but throughout it all she remains happy and optimistic (there’s a reason her best friend Gus calls her Bright Side). Kate is strong-willed, funny, smart, and musically gifted. She’s also never believed in love. So when Kate leaves San Diego to attend college in the small town of Grant, Minnesota, the last thing she expects is to fall in love with Keller Banks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They both feel it. &lt;br /&gt;But they each have a reason to fight it. &lt;br /&gt;They each have a secret. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And when secrets are revealed, &lt;br /&gt;Some will heal you … &lt;br /&gt;And some will end you. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[So I’ve had people telling me to read this one some of them insisting in fact. And I knew that this storyline would be emotional without reading the blurb.

  <description>A brand new romantic comedy from your favorite snort-laughing duo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment Sadie Matthews walks through the daycare center door, I feel my world tilt in her direction. Again. I fell for her when I was fourteen, and I'm still not over her. Problem: she still thinks of me as a teen she used to babysit. But I've learned a few things about pleasing a woman in the last fifteen years. I can't wait to show her how good it could be. I need to move quickly before I lose her again. This is more than a game to me, but I still plan to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've just survived the worst year of my life. As a single mom of twin toddlers, I don't have time for a man. I barely have time to finish a thought. Who knew that Liam McAllister would grow up to be so devastating? He's everything my husband was not: tall, built, and willing to have a tea party with my girls. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't possibly get involved with him. He's too young for me. Too handsome. But he's so persuasive...</description>

  <description>A former star who turned his back on fame...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trick Williams understands celebrity. He was a Broadway star by age 10, had his own hit TV show by age 12, a platinum record by 16, and multiple movies well into his 20’s. A superstar with everything until he nearly destroyed his life and the person most dear to him. Trick made the only choice he could to survive… he walked away from stardom and started something bigger than himself, something better. Trick started Pawtown, a place where neglected four-legged friends can find their forever home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Legend looking for her star…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophia Legend grew up unclaimed by her famous father. She lived in the shadow of her two well-known half siblings. Now all the secrets are out and Sophia is focused on her own personal success. Beautiful, ambitious, and looking out for number one, Sophia courts celebrity and superstar status. She is well on the way, when her own fear and a foolish decision put everything she desires at risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two people who want completely different lives…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trick Williams wants to stay in the middle of the desert at Pawtown saving his four-legged friends. He has no need for his former fame or public life. Sophia Legend wants only one thing, to shine in this world like the star she knows she is. How could two people who want such different lives find their happily ever after?</description>

  <description>Losing it all... is a new beginning. Amanda Legend grew up rich and privileged. Anything was hers for the asking, thanks to her superstar father. That is until Amanda's honesty about bad behavior from her soon-to-be-new Step Mom, a former school chum, lands Amanda on the outs with her beloved father. No Trust fund. No rarified world. Even if Amanda never wanted the LA lifestyle, she now must survive on her own. A come-back takes heart... Ryan Sinclair was nearing the pinnacle of his movie career when he drove his Porsche off Malibu Canyon Road. Lucky to be alive, post rehab he's ready to start the long climb back to the top. But to prove to Hollywood that he won't relapse, he's required to get a sober companion. A job she never wanted with the man who helped destroy her life... Amanda Legend may loathe the entertainment world, but she understands the rules. She also knows Ryan Sinclair, understands alcoholics (she grew up around a few) and now, after being banished from her posh lifestyle, needs a paycheck to get to New York. Amanda accepts the job as sober companion to Ryan Sinclair for his first film post rehab. But Amanda must learn to ignore her attraction to Ryan, because falling for a guy like him would pull her back into a world she desperately wants to escape.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A promise to keep...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honoring her mother's last wish, Lane Channing vows to follow her dreams. She takes the 'big risk' and leaves her small Kansas town behind and heads to LA, the city of dreams. She's got a stellar job lined up, an old jeep, and 20 bucks to last her to her first paycheck. Her hopes shatter when she arrives to find her job's been given to someone else. Now she's broke and if she doesn't do something fast will soon be living on the streets. Welcome to cutthroat -- Lane is most certainly not in Kansas anymore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the cusp of success...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dillon MacAvoy has one goal -- to become a star -- whatever it takes. Even if it means honing his bad-boy can't-be-tamed-and-forever-single image. Besides the image isn't far from the truth. Dillon cares only about his younger brother and his career. He's on the brink of superstardom if he can just decide on the next right script. But for that, he needs a script reader he can trust. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In a strange twist of fate...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lane Channing is Dillon's last chance. If Lane lasts the summer without becoming MacAvoy's latest conquest, she's guaranteed a job in entertainment. No problem, as long as she can ignore the heat that pulses through her every time Dillon is in the room. After all, love and commitment with a sweet, hometown girl would only ruin the Dillon MacAvoy brand.</description>

  <description>Returning home for her father’s wedding was never going to be easy for Adele. If being sent away at eighteen hadn’t been bad enough, the mess she left behind when she made a pass at her dad’s business partner sure was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen years older than her, Pete had been her crush for as long as she could remember. But she’d misread the situation—confusing friendliness for undying love. Awkward. Add her father to the misunderstanding, and Pete had been left with a broken nose and a business on the edge of ruin. The man had to be just as glad as everyone else when she left town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven years on, things are different. Adele is no longer a kid, but a fully grown adult more than capable of getting through the wedding and being polite. But all it takes is seeing him again to bring back all those old feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes first loves are the truest.</description>

  <description>A modern way of finding love. One deserted island of luxury. Two people. Three out cards. And a whole lot of possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melinda takes the advice of her best friend, Chris. She signs up to a new dating service that pairs you statistically to the one you’re supposed to love. Finding it — love that is — using the more conventional methods, has not been a successful venture for Mindy, and with her biological clock ticking, she uses a more desperate method and takes the plunge into a possible happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, when she boards the boat to a secret location, she doesn’t realise the man waiting for her is someone she’s previously met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chance encounters occur more frequently than we realise. Being blind to them is part of a bustling world. But, being faced with them can lead to a hilarious three weeks between two opposites who might just attract.</description>

  <description>The breathtaking conclusion of The Smoke &amp;amp; Mirrors Duology. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A beautiful, defiant princess. A renowned, sinfully gorgeous Hollywood actor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A love affair that is sure to rock the British Monarchy…and the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their love affair began intensely and passionately. Princess Adeline and Josh Jameson knew any future together was impossible—her status as a princess and his standing as a Hollywood heartthrob dictated that. But the heights of pleasure they could take each other to were wildly unanticipated by them both. Josh’s absolute disregard for Adeline’s status quickly drew her into his hedonistic world. And her perfectly worn mask and false façade captivated Josh to the point of obsession. The boundaries became blurred. The physical became emotional. Their hearts became entwined. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;But a cruel turn of events rips their worlds apart and Adeline is more bound than ever by the protocol and expectations her title commands. The army of royal advisors who guard the secrets and scandals of the Monarchy will go to unthinkable lengths to keep the smoke and mirrors in place…and Josh away from Adeline. She knows the power she possesses comes with agonizing sacrifices. Walking away from Josh devastates her…but it keeps him safe from the corrupt institution that has ruled her life. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Yet Josh refuses to lose the woman who has consumed him so completely, distorted his boundaries, and stripped him of all sensibility. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Will the power of the British Monarchy triumph? Or will their fierce love for each other change the course of history?</description>

  <description>Just when you thought we had run out of Badd…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Roman Badd, one of a set of triplets, each bigger and badder than the last. If you thought the original Badd brothers were sexy, foul-mouthed alphas, just wait till you meet these three sexy-as-sin, long-lost Badd cousins…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roman is a smokejumper, an elite member of the US Forest Service who parachutes into the most rugged and remote terrain to combat out-of-control wildfires unreachable even by hotshots. He’s brash, domineering, and an expert at seduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kitty Quinn is the exact opposite. The head server at Badd’s Bar and Grille, she’s the daughter of a philosophy professor and a kindergarten teacher: sweet and kind, and with a persona of innocence and purity—catnip for the ravenous lion that is Roman Badd. She knows she’s in way over her head with him, but this good girl has enough inner strength and confidence to stand up to Roman’s hard-charging, take-what-he-wants attitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can she get past his foul mouth and unapologetically rapacious sexual appetite to the good, kind man she wants to believe lurks beneath, or is Roman Badd as wild and untamable as the fires he fights?</description>

  <description>Spoiled Princess is what he used to call me.&lt;br /&gt;We were an inferno of hate and passion wound up with a dash of chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For four years I watched him mow my lawn.&lt;br /&gt;For four years I watched my friends make fun of him.&lt;br /&gt;For four years I hated myself for wanting him, but even more for the way I treated him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I had him.&lt;br /&gt;For one night, we put all labels away and I spent the best night of my life in his arms.&lt;br /&gt;Then the next day, with my secret night under lock and key, I looked the other way while my friends shamed him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now the jokes on me, because the scrawny lawn boy who I secretly loved from afar is now the director of Hollywoods most exclusive summer camp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I'm on his staff.&lt;br /&gt;Now it's his turn to punish me.&lt;br /&gt;His turn to make me pay.&lt;br /&gt;His turn to take his revenge after years of humiliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's no longer a boy you can ridicule.&lt;br /&gt;But a college graduate who can have any woman he wants.&lt;br /&gt;I want him to look at me the way he did that one night we had together, but right now&lt;br /&gt;the look in his eyes tells me he's going to enjoy having me under him for two straight months.&lt;br /&gt;I don't know where his hatred ends, his passion begins.&lt;br /&gt;All I know is he wants revenge.&lt;br /&gt;And I'm his lucky target.</description>

  <description>Callum Welsh perfected the art of hating me when we were two kids who believed we’d be forced into marriage.&lt;br /&gt;He thought I wanted it, but my only wish had been for him to leave me alone.&lt;br /&gt;Then one afternoon, he stole my first kiss.&lt;br /&gt;Despite all he’d done, everything changed after that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the years passed, our hearts thawed, and he no longer hated me. &lt;br /&gt;In fact, he loved me enough to make me his wife.&lt;br /&gt;Until I ruined everything with one stupid mistake. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That hatred returned in the form of cruel words and even crueler deeds. &lt;br /&gt;But we weren’t kids anymore. &lt;br /&gt;I could handle his brand of venom. &lt;br /&gt;He would be mine again, even if it cost me the remains of my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; contains cheating and an anti-hero who might make you throw your kindle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Each book in the Gray Springs world can be read as a standalone.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A brand new contemporary romance from New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today bestselling author Katy Evans. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It started as a game. &lt;br /&gt;We flirted. We played. Most importantly—we won. &lt;br /&gt;Then I discovered who he was: Gambler. Famous playboy. Silver-eyed player who never plays to lose. &lt;br /&gt;…And my best friend’s soon-to-be brother in law, Cullen Carmichael. &lt;br /&gt;He needed a good luck charm, I needed a distraction. &lt;br /&gt;So we made a gamble and set off for Vegas—but pretty soon—I was in too deep. &lt;br /&gt;My heart, soul, and body weren't supposed to be part of the deal. &lt;br /&gt;But somewhere between big wins and long nights, my house of cards started to tumble. &lt;br /&gt;What was this devil with those piercing eyes doing to me? &lt;br /&gt;I’d given up on love, but the wicked, all-in Cullen Carmichael was upping the ante and wouldn’t stop until he’d won it all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*This book contains characters from the Manwhore series but can be read as a complete standalone.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Is it love, or is she just his good luck charm?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Helena Hunting absolutely delights with this witty and fun standalone contemporary romance.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lilah isn't sure what hurt worse: the day Ethan left her to focus on his hockey career, or the day he came back eight years later. He might think they can pick up just where they left off, but she's no longer that same girl and never wants to be again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan Kane wants his glory days back. And that includes having Lilah by his side. With her, he was magic. They were magic. All he has to do is make her see that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when Lilah might finally be ready to let him in, though, she finds out their reunion has nothing to do with her and everything to do with his game. But Ethan's already lost her once, and even if it costs him his career, he'll do anything to keep from losing her again.</description>

  <description>This isn’t how fairy tales typically begin, but it’s where mine starts…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No money, no phone, and abandoned on the streets of Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my baby in my arms, I wander into a bar in a shady neighborhood and ask to use their phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my father turns us away and completely disowns me, the bar owner, and total hottie, offers us a place to stay…no strings attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m leery at first.&lt;br /&gt;Hot alpha guy.&lt;br /&gt;Down on her luck single mother.&lt;br /&gt;I mean, who wouldn’t be wary?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucio Gallo isn’t like most men, though. He’s fiercely protective, loyal, and did I mention he’s covered in nothing but muscle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all else, he’s everything I need but never knew I wanted.</description>

  <description>The first time I met Ian Kemp in the sparkling blue waters of St. Thomas, I was six years old and we shared a summer beneath the stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I met Ian Kemp, he was a shell of the boy I once knew. Turbulent and infuriating, he refused my friendship at every turn. Like me, he was a casualty of life’s cruelty, but we were planets apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’d both sought refuge on the island, hoping to find our anchor. Instead, we found each other and managed to reclaim our stars...until we both got swept away.</description>

  <description>Men of Courage: A brotherhood bound by courage, honor, and sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Hard work and dedication brought Austin Hawke up the ranks at his department, eventually earning him Lieutenant position. He was more than ready to lead his fellow brothers but one fatal call leads to tragedy and a danger they never saw coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Meanwhile, his personal life is just as destructive. All thanks to the gorgeous sports bar owner he shared an unforgettable night with only to have her slip out on him before the morning sun. Zoey thought she could escape him without a fight but what she fails to realize is Austin doesn’t give up when he wants something, and he wants Zoey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Zoey Anderson had dreams of exploring the world, capturing its beauty behind a lens, but all that changed the moment her disabled sister was born. Due to their loveless home, Zoey dropped her dreams and took on the role of caring for her younger sister. A decision she could never regret. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Taking her life by storm, Austin Hawke crashes through all the barriers she placed around her carefully guarded heart. When passion burns and devastation strikes, Zoey quickly learns that love doesn't come without sacrifice.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A standalone romantic comedy of epically awkward proportions, from New York Times bestselling author, Emma Hart.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine this. You’re ready to leave after a one-night stand, and you’re figuring out how to—shock horror—leave your number and ask him to be your fake boyfriend for your sister’s wedding this weekend. When he wakes up. Well, that happened to me. And over coffee and omelets, I found myself a date. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which was how I ended up arriving at the wedding with a guy I knew nothing about. I didn’t know his last name, or how we met, or how long we’d been dating. I didn’t know where he grew up, what he’d majored in in college, or how many siblings he had. I sure as hell didn’t know he was Adam Winters, hotshot hockey player—and not only my father’s favorite player, but my little nephew’s freakin’ idol. Which means I’m in trouble. Big, big trouble. My mother is suspicious, my sister is bridezilla on crack, and my grandpa will tell anyone who’ll listen about his time in Amsterdam’s Red Light District. Four days. I have to keep this up for four days, and then Adam and I can return to our regular lives, where we don’t have sex whenever we’re alone and my family aren’t interrogating him over his intentions with me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;At least, that’s the plan. And we all know what happens to those.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Dani&lt;br /&gt;It was supposed to be a job, plain and simple.&lt;br /&gt;But it became so much more than that. I fell hard for Michael Monroe and ruined my life in the process.&lt;br /&gt;I lost everything I cared about. But in the end, I did what I came to do. &lt;br /&gt;He's back with his family, starting to heal. And I’m left with a crippling addiction to that same charming, damaged boy-turned-man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael &lt;br /&gt;I have my family back, but I lost her.&lt;br /&gt;I let her in more than anyone before. And now, she's gone, taking my secrets with her.&lt;br /&gt;Part of me is happy she’s far away from me. The other part aches to be near her again. &lt;br /&gt;When it comes to Dani, I don't mind this crippling addiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Unbroken is part 2 of Michael and Dani's story. It's recommended that you read part 1, Unbreakable before reading this one.</description>

  <description>Confusion. Lust. Fear. Passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started the moment she passed out in my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seduction. Vile. Depraved. Desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She couldn’t remember her past but looked to me like I was her future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My walls were built. My heart was cold. My emotions vacant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being alone for five years with only my motorcycle club at my side, she was who I had been searching for. The one I had needed all along to light up the darkness surrounding my life. Just when I thought I had her, just when I thought I could finally allow myself that happiness I didn’t think I deserved. She was ripped from my hands…</description>

  <description>Hadley Jacobs is over Machlan Gibson. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, she’ll always be a little weak to the dimple in his right cheek and the way his five o’clock shadow makes him ruggedly handsome. But that’s not enough to cover every other thing about him because they all drive her nuts. Like how he won’t admit he’s wrong even when he knows it and how he drives his stupid car a million miles an hour on wet asphalt. As she rolls back into town and takes a seat at Crave, she won’t take the bait. She’s over him. Mostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Machlan isn’t over her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not because he hasn’t tried. He reminds himself over and over that she’s not the girl for him. After all, she drives him insane with her sassy attitude and the way she calls him out on everything. She beats him at poker, even though she doesn’t know the difference between a straight and a flush, and when she looks at him with her bright, blue eyes, it’s unnerving. When she climbs onto that bar stool and orders a drink, he puts it in front of her and ignores the sparkle in her eyes. He’s not over her, but she won’t know that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she does know that. And he knows she’s not as over him as she’s pretending to be. When life forces their hand this time, there’s more on the line than a pile of poker chips. It’s their forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crave is a standalone romance in a new small town, blue-collar series from USA Today bestselling author Adriana Locke. Join readers everywhere as they fall in love with the delicious Gibson Boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming October 1, 2018</description>

  <description>I did something I had never done before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a one-night stand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then in true me fashion, I left my phone at his house during my desperate venture to escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried hard to ignore the texts sent to my best friend’s phone...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Amethyst: Sup, these selfies are cute as shit, but your lips looked better wrapped around my…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did NOT text him back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID vow to never speak of him, or that night again... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m Amethyst Lily Tatum, and up until this point, I’d managed to maintain a fairly low-key life. I’m what you would call a socially unacceptable hot mess. Instead of partying, I’m skating, flipping ollie’s over guys who loved to underestimate me. Then I started college, met a wild girl who I would soon call my best-friend, had my first drunk one-night stand, left my phone at his house, and then, when I finally managed to meet my mom’s new boyfriend, I found out that my one-night stand, was now my new stepbrother. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*this is a standalone novel*</description>

  <description>From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Rachel Van Dyken comes a new story in her Eagle Elite series… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every family has rules, the mafia just has more....&lt;br /&gt;Do not speak to the bosses unless spoken to. &lt;br /&gt;Do not make eye contact unless you want to die. &lt;br /&gt;And above all else, do not fall in love. &lt;br /&gt;Renee Cassani's future is set.&lt;br /&gt;Her betrothal is set. &lt;br /&gt;Her life, after nannying for the five families for the summer, is set&lt;br /&gt;Somebody should have told Vic Colezan that. &lt;br /&gt;He's a man who doesn't take no for an answer. &lt;br /&gt;And he only wants one thing. &lt;br /&gt;Her. &lt;br /&gt;Somebody should have told Renee that her bodyguard needed as much discipline as the kids she was nannying. &lt;br /&gt;Good thing Vic has a firm hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Every 1001 Dark Nights novella is a standalone story. For new readers, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.**</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sexy agent hounds Wall Street’s hottest new wolf in an exhilarating novel from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lauren Layne.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ian Bradley is the definition of a Wall Street hotshot: seven-figure salary, designer suits, and a corner office. His drive &lt;i&gt;off&lt;/i&gt; the floor is just as potent. Every woman who knows him has felt the rush. But now he’s met his match in Lara McKenzie—a woman with the power to bring Ian to &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ambitious, whip-smart daughter of FBI agents, Lara is a rising star in fighting white-collar crime. Her latest case—the investigation of Ian Bradley for insider trading—could make her career. She knows a scoundrel when she sees one. Ian fits the bill: a cocky, ridiculously handsome bad boy with a slick swagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’ll do anything to prove he’s guilty. He’ll do anything to prove he’s not. But it’s only a matter of time before their fierce battle of wits gets &lt;i&gt;oh so hot&lt;/i&gt; and personal. Now, taking down Ian has become more than business for Lara. It’s become a pleasure—and there’s more at risk than she ever dreamed.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Elena is too young for me, not to mention she's my boss's daughter and my babysitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's beyond complicated. And I'm not even looking for a relationship — but I can't deny the attraction that sizzles between us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to ignore it. A single dad, all I want is to take care of my little girl, do my job, and enjoy my friends. Anything more is asking for complications I can't afford. Asking to be hurt again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trouble is, I want her, too. And when out flirty sparks turn to flames, I give in to temptation. Our secret fling is scorching hot, better than I'd ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But secrets get out, and I could lose my job and my reputation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I am starting to realize she's the one thing I'm not willing to lose.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A YA novel from USA Today bestselling author Sarina Bowen.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Never ask a question unless you’re sure you want the truth.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve been listening to my father sing for my whole life. I carry him in my pocket on my mp3 player. It’s just that we’ve never met face to face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My mother would never tell me how I came to be, or why my rock star father and I have never met. I thought it was her only secret. I was wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When she dies, he finally appears. Suddenly I have a first class ticket into my father’s exclusive world. A world I don’t want any part of – not at this cost.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only three things keep me going: my a cappella singing group, a swoony blue-eyed boy named Jake, and the burning questions in my soul.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s a secret shame that comes from being an unwanted child. It drags me down, and puts distance between me and the boy I love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My father is the only one alive who knows my history. I need the truth, even if it scares me.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Jameson&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I let her slip through my fingers…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, that’s a lie. I was reckless and pushed her away. &lt;br /&gt;I was never supposed to fall for her. She was my tutor. My best friend. My fantasy. I tried to stay away. I failed. &lt;br /&gt;Then we graduated and everything changed. All I needed was a step back. A moment to breathe… And by the time I came up for air, she was in the arms of another man.&lt;br /&gt;Four years later, everything is different. And when I see her again, I remember why I should have never let her go in the first place. But second chances don't always come easy. Even when you're determined to get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Lyric&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;It started on day one…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;New school. New life. And there he was, the boy I grew up with, walking up the steps of my very first class. Except now, the boy from my memories was gone, and his place was an Adonis of a man. &lt;br /&gt;It didn’t take much for me to fall for him. Even though I knew we were doomed from the start. But when you find something that perfect, you don't second guess it. &lt;br /&gt;Until it ends. &lt;br /&gt;Four years later, he’s back. Steamrolling through my life like he never broke my heart to begin with. Only this time, I’m older, wiser and know that second chances are the stuff of fairytales. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*A standalone contemporary romance!*</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Samantha:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the perfect life; a husband who loved me, and two kids who were my world. &lt;br /&gt;Until someone else answered his phone and my perfect life shattered. &lt;br /&gt;When he died, I was left with answers he couldn't give me and a box full of lies. &lt;br /&gt;He left me broken. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Blake:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love when I was fifteen, knowing she was the one. &lt;br /&gt;For five years, she was my everything—my every breath, every heartbeat, every thought. &lt;br /&gt;She made me promise to move on, promise to find love again, but I broke those promises because I can't move on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Two broken souls brought together by tragedy and heartbreak. &lt;br /&gt;Can a broken love story be fixed?&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>Everyone knows the rumors about Violet Circle and the crazy inhabitants, but becoming a resident was my best option. These are the kind of decisions you’re faced with when you have a baby at eighteen, and your knight in shining armor turns out to be a deadbeat dad in saggy boxers. &lt;br /&gt; Don’t get me wrong, my five-year-old son, Aiden, is the love of my life, even when he’s telling random strangers I’m constipated, or lecturing his preschool friends on the differences in their anatomy. I wouldn’t trade him for anything, but raising him as a single parent while cleaning motel rooms for a living is like walking a balance beam made of sand. One wrong slip, and we’re homeless. &lt;br /&gt; It doesn’t take us long to adjust to our new home with all its eccentric people, and Aiden is happy here, but danger lurks right across the street. Not in the apartment of the odd woman who always wears a floppy sun hat and trench coat, or the crazy apartment full of college kids. I wish it were that simple. &lt;br /&gt; Neal Chambers, the single father who is ten years my senior, sets off alarms in my head. &lt;br /&gt; Mainly because he sets off other things in my panties.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Can the best of enemies become the hottest of lovers? &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Aurora Rose Reynolds proves that opposites can be compatible—and twice as combustible…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Libby Reed is over it. Or that’s what she tells herself. She’s lusted after one of New York’s bravest for years, but firefighter Antonio Moretti has doused her interest for the last time. As much as she wants the arrogant jerk (in a bad, bad way), they can’t even be in the same room without setting each other off…which might be a problem now that she’s volunteered to help out in his family’s restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Antonio’s been burned before. Now he knows better than to trust a pretty face and follow another pair of long, beautiful legs into heartbreak. But while Libby might rub him the wrong way, he can’t deny the heat between them. And it only burns hotter when she steps up in his time of need. The closer they get, the more he realizes he may have misjudged her. Then again, he doesn’t know the secret Libby’s keeping that could send their relationship up in flames before it’s even begun.</description>

  <description>Hannah Donovan is not my type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intellectual and career-focused, she’s a lawyer, and an intimidatingly beautiful one, at that. I’d rather pump iron than open a book, and the only reason I’d go to court would be for a traffic ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s the most gorgeous woman I’ve ever seen. So how can I turn down her plea that I pretend to be her fiancé for one weekend?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I never expected our pretend kisses to feel so real … or for it to lead to a wild night in bed that will forever stand out as the highlight of my sex life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our performance convinces everyone, but it was never meant to be more than a fantasy. A short term gig before reality sets back in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t imagine ever being good enough for her, but I’m hooked. And now I’m determined to do whatever it takes to make this fake engagement real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Each novel in the series is a STANDALONE romance with a guaranteed HEA!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don’t miss &lt;i&gt;Bar Bites: A Man of the Month&lt;/i&gt; cookbook featuring recipes, slices of life, and an all new short story!&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>I wear designer suits on my body by day and gorgeous women on my arm at night. Some might call me arrogant, with my chiseled jaw and my dark blue eyes. Add in my money and I can get any woman I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I want her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night I spent with Selma has lived in my most erotic dreams. And ever since she swept back into my life, with her flashing eyes and delicious body, I want nothing more than to make sultry new memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with an election coming up, and an office I want to fill, it isn’t the right time to get involved with a free-spirited girl with a wild streak. A girl who doesn’t abide by the rules. A girl who could get me noticed in all the wrong ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A girl who makes me crazy … in all the right ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I’m going to have to decide: Walk the straight and narrow? Or have the hottest, wildest affair of my life with the sexiest woman I’ve ever known?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Meet Mr. September – &lt;br /&gt;He's got the moves to make a woman blush.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each book in the series is a STANDALONE novel with NO cliffhanger and a guaranteed HEA!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Dad Bod Contracting—for ALL your domestic contracting needs. Have a leaky faucet or clogged disposal? Need a new patio with intricate brickpaving designs? Want your garage transformed into a yoga studio? Dad Bod Contracting has you COVERED. Our clean, well-mannered, and friendly professionals pride themselves on attention to detail. Every job comes with a 100% customer SATISFACTION guarantee. No job is too small. Hand us your “honey-do” list and we’ll get it done, and we’ll look good doing it! A good job well done is one phone call away, so call Dad Bod Contracting today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started with a window that was jammed shut. Pretty simple, right? All I wanted was to open the windows while I tidied the house. I’d been after my no-good husband to do it for months, but he never did. And then he shacked up with his secretary, leaving me with a pile of bills, husband-free for the first time in ten years, and with a house that was falling apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ad popped up on the side of my social media feed—a local contracting agency willing to do pretty much anything. Since I don’t really know a screwdriver from a ratchet, I gave them a call. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let me tell you, the ad was NOT lying. Jesse O’Neill can do it ALL…and looks amazing doing it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He fixed my window, so I called him back to fix the sagging, splintery front steps. Which led to him fixing my kitchen sink. And then he recarpeted my stairs. And then fixed the squeak in my bed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was supposed to fix my house, not my rusty, sputtering libido. And certainly not my broken heart.</description>

  <description>The life goals have stacked up since I started this journey as a sad, lonely little ghost. I’m not sure how things escalated so quickly from trying to be seen and heard, to bearing the weight of the world on my vain little shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;As a result, my goals have gotten a little more serious…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goal #14: Learn to take a hit without breaking or suffering some type of death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goal #15: Decide once and for all if I’m going to save or destroy the world. I’m not sure why people put this sort of responsibility on hell-spawn like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goal #16: Practice my evil laugh, because all hell-spawn need a good evil laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goal #17: Find and kill all the unicorns. Mwahahahahaha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goal #18: Live to enjoy forever with the guys I sacrificed all my memories to save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goal #19: No matter what, they don’t get to die. Or I really will be THE Apocalypse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’re the most screwed up collection of antiheroes the world has ever seen, because the only thing that makes me want to save the world is knowing I could lose my boys forever if I don’t. It’s one HELL of a love story, you know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Sexual Content.&lt;br /&gt;**Language Warning.&lt;br /&gt;**Dark humor.&lt;br /&gt;**Reverse Harem.&lt;br /&gt;**Series FINALE. (Read in order: Four Psychos, Three Trials, Two Kingdoms, and One Apocalypse. This book cannot be read as a stand-alone.)</description>

  <description>Irresistible attraction. Unimaginable danger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew from the moment Noah Williamson walked into the diner that he was haunted—deeply haunted—but I couldn’t resist the lure of him. He was gorgeous and fascinating and mysterious, and like a delicate moth to a brilliant blue flame, I was drawn to him. Drawn to his fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if I’d known about his job, about what happened to his wife, I’d have run the other way. Before I got caught up in the red-hot blaze of his life. Before everything in my world got burned to the ground. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s too late to run now. I hesitated and that was it. I fell. I fell for him before I knew there was danger in loving him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noah once told me that this is the way we burn—together or not at all. At the time, I didn’t know what that meant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I do.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Available in audio first, New York Times best-selling author Laurelin Paige's newest red-hot romance!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weston King knows how to play. But wild nights and owning an extensive collection of women's panties don't carry the thrill they once did, so when his business partner Donovan suggests an outrageous plan to allow them to take over their competition, Wes takes him up on the offer. The crazy idea? Marry the competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Dyson, the bride-to-be in question, is on board with the plan. She wants access to her trust fund and can only get it once she marries. Each has something the other wants - all they have to do is pretend to like each other well enough to tie the knot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only trouble is, playing fiancé to Elizabeth isn't quite that simple. Wes finds her sexy and brilliant...and soon wishes their engagement wasn't fake at all. Not that he'd ever tell her that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a lover boy like Wes can only stand an empty bed for so long...and even the best of players has to put down his cards eventually.</description>
