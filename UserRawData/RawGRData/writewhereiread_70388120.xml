  <description>&lt;b&gt;Princes have pomp and glory—not crushes on commoners.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing gets the tongues of London’s high society wagging like a good scandal. And when the personal secretary of the visiting Prince Sebastian of Alucia is found murdered, it’s all anyone can talk about, including Eliza Tricklebank. Her unapologetic gossip gazette has benefited from an anonymous tip about the crime, prompting Sebastian to take an interest in playing detective—and an even greater interest in Eliza.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a trade deal on the line and mounting pressure to secure a noble bride, there’s nothing more salacious than a prince dallying with a commoner. Sebastian finds Eliza’s contrary manner as frustrating as it is seductive, but they’ll have to work together if they’re going to catch the culprit. And when things heat up behind closed doors, it’s the prince who’ll have to decide what comes first—his country or his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"London’s observations of gender roles are keen, and her protagonists are eminently likable in their dogged pursuit of their own goals despite societal expectations and political pressures." -Publishers Weekly on THE PRINCESS PLAN</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;He’s tantalizing trouble she can’t resist…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Parrish has always wanted a certain kind of man: someone responsible, settled, &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt;. Bad boys need not apply. But when her car leaves her stranded and a mysterious stranger with brooding eyes and a protective streak comes to her rescue, she can’t deny how drawn she is to him. In town searching for family he’s never met, Mitch is everything she never thought she wanted—and suddenly everything she craves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding his half brothers after all these years is more than Mitch Crews has allowed himself to wish for. Finding love never even crossed his mind…until he meets Charlotte. She’s sweet, warmhearted, sexier than she knows—and too damn good for an ex-con like him. But when his past comes back to haunt him, putting Charlotte—and the family he’s come to care for—in danger, Mitch isn’t playing by the rules. He’s already surrendered his heart, but now he’ll risk his life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I’m a twenty-two-year-old Black introvert who overthinks everything, can’t get a date, yet somehow managed to graduate from Harvard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My story is probably not like yours. I’m a Black boy from the Midwest. I’ve never been kissed. I'm desperately in love with two women: Aretha and Whitney. I struggle with a mild form of social anxiety. I sing to myself almost everywhere I go. I'm an ex-chitlins (with hot sauce and ketchup) lover. I’ve been called an Oreo. I’ve been stopped by the police while walking home. I’m the descendant of slaves, and a Harvard graduate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though our stories may not be the same, the universal themes explored in this poignant and personal literary collection—love, identity, hope, social justice, and coming of age—bond us together. &lt;i&gt;Timestamp: Musings of an Introverted Black Boy &lt;/i&gt;is many things: It’s one Black boy’s journey through college and into adulthood. It’s a compilation of intimate musings, short and long. It’s an anthology of reflections linked to distinct moments in time. It’s a series of meditations on life, love, and the lack thereof. It’s not simply a “Black” book, or even a “millennial” one. It’s a &lt;i&gt;human &lt;/i&gt;book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote it for everyone—and that includes you.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;If you're going through hell...keep going.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old coder Jinx Marshall grew up spending weekends drilling with her paranoid dad for a doomsday she’s sure will never come. She’s an expert on self-heating meal rations, Krav Maga and extracting water from a barrel cactus. Now that her parents are divorced, she’s ready to relax. Her big plans include making it to level 99 in her favorite MMORPG and spending the weekend with her new hunky stepbrother, Toby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all that disaster training comes in handy when an explosion traps her in a burning building. Stuck leading her headstrong stepsister, MacKenna, and her precocious little brother, Charles, to safety, Jinx gets them out alive only to discover the explosion is part of a pattern of violence erupting all over the country. Even worse, Jinx’s dad stands accused of triggering the chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a desperate attempt to evade paramilitary forces and vigilantes, Jinx and her siblings find Toby and make a break for Mexico. With seemingly the whole world working against them, they’ve got to get along and search for the truth about the attacks—and about each other. But if they can survive, will there be anything left worth surviving for?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Love may be blind, but obsession’s a real killer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nora Holliday is not that kind of woman. Not the kind who has an illicit affair with a married man. But Josh Landon is everything Nora’s alcoholic husband isn’t. And now she and Josh are so infatuated, they can’t stay away from one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abby Landon, Josh’s daughter, is home from college nursing a broken heart. She’s seeking solace, not more scandal, so when she catches her dad kissing Nora, she vows to take the homewrecker down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for Abby’s mother and Josh’s wife, Gwen? To anyone on the outside looking in, the mother of two appears to be living the ideal suburban life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she winds up dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serene seaside town of Shoreham has always been the perfect place to raise a family—not somewhere housewives are brutally murdered. So who killed Gwen Landon, and how many twisted secrets will be exposed as the vindictive plot comes undone?</description>

  <description>Who knew death could be so eclectic? Relish this mesmerizing murder mystery mash-up of short stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stories include the 2019 SIA Award-Winning Murder Mystery Short Story ‘The Rose Slayer.’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murder and mystery have been the staple of literature and films for years. This anthology of short stories will thrill and entertain you. Some will also make you laugh out loud. Others will stop and make you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of this murder mystery short story anthology as a book version of appetizers or starters, hors d'oeuvre, meze, or antipasti. It can be read as fillers between books or, as is the case in some countries, as a bookish meze - in its own right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These stories come from an international cast of authors; some with bestselling books, others are emerging or new talents. Their roots, cultures, and life experiences are as diverse as their writing styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one thing binds them together: they know how to tell a story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s murder mystery styles and locations to suit all tastes: detective fiction, serial killers, scifi, histfic, LA, England, The Great Lakes, Las Vegas, the Nevada desert and more in an exquisite exposition of the art of short story telling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ten authors who have contributed to the anthology are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen Bentley&lt;br /&gt;Greg Alldredge&lt;br /&gt;Kelly Artieri&lt;br /&gt;Robbie Cheadle&lt;br /&gt;Michael Spinelli&lt;br /&gt;L. Lee Kane&lt;br /&gt;Kay Castaneda&lt;br /&gt;Aly Locatelli&lt;br /&gt;Justin Bauer&lt;br /&gt;&amp;amp; 'G' Posthumously&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each author introduces his or her stories and the theme that lies behind them.By the time you finish the book, you will agree the result is a mesmerizing murder mystery mash-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it now.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;He’s tantalizing trouble she can’t resist…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Parrish has always wanted a certain kind of man: someone responsible, settled, &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt;. Bad boys need not apply. But when her car leaves her stranded and a mysterious stranger with brooding eyes and a protective streak comes to her rescue, she can’t deny how drawn she is to him. In town searching for family he’s never met, Mitch is everything she never thought she wanted—and suddenly everything she craves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding his half brothers after all these years is more than Mitch Crews has allowed himself to wish for. Finding love never even crossed his mind…until he meets Charlotte. She’s sweet, warmhearted, sexier than she knows—and too damn good for an ex-con like him. But when his past comes back to haunt him, putting Charlotte—and the family he’s come to care for—in danger, Mitch isn’t playing by the rules. He’s already surrendered his heart, but now he’ll risk his life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A propulsive new thriller about the obsessive nature of love when an intensifying relationship between best friends is disrupted by a kidnapping.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up as best friends in small-town New Hampshire, Jon and Chloe are the only ones who truly understand each other, though they can never find the words to tell one another the depth of their feelings. When Jon is finally ready to confess his feelings, he's suddenly kidnapped by his substitute teacher who is obsessed with H.P. Lovecraft and has a plot to save humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mourning the disappearance of Jon and facing the reality he may never return, Chloe tries to navigate the rites of entering young adulthood and "fit in" with the popular crowd, but thoughts of Jon are never far away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jon finally escapes, he discovers he now has an uncontrollable power that endangers anyone he has intense feelings for. He runs away to protect Chloe and find the answers to his new identity—but he's soon being tracked by a detective who is fascinated by a series of vigilante killings that appear connected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whisking us on a journey through New England and crashing these characters' lives together in the most unexpected ways, Kepnes explores the complex relationship between love and identity, unrequited passion and obsession, self-preservation and self-destruction, and how the lines are often blurred between the two.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In 1970s New York, a neurotic Italian-American man is inspired to write a novel about his love affair with a quirky Broadway actress who inspires him to pursue his life-long dream.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Michael Coniglio is at his wit's end. His girlfriend, Angela, announces in front of the local coffee shop crowd that she has a new lover. The emotional fallout leads him to lose his office job, giving his boss the long-awaited excuse to fire him. Michael goes home to his parents looking for support and professes his childhood dream only for his father to remind Michael that he will never amount to anything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just as Michael is about to give up on life, he meets a woman who changes everything. The chatty and quirky Elvira Vaughn brings flavor to his world. The innocent, bright eyed, artsy young woman ran from an abusive home to become a Broadway actress in crime-riddled New York City. Suffering from the depression of her past, the now thirty-year-old looks to a higher power for an answer. Can Michael and Elvira overcome the demons of their past and find their way into each other’s hearts? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Finding Forever&lt;/i&gt; is the humorous love story of two old souls that finally collide, reminding us that love exists even in the darkest of times.</description>

  <description>Alexi Littrell hasn't told anyone what happened to her over the summer. Ashamed and embarrassed, she hides in her closet and compulsively scratches the back of her neck, trying to make the outside hurt more than the inside does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Bodee Lennox, the quiet and awkward boy next door, comes to live with the Littrells, Alexi discovers an unlikely friend in "the Kool-Aid Kid," who has secrets of his own. As they lean on each other for support, Alexi gives him the strength to deal with his past, and Bodee helps her find the courage to finally face the truth.</description>

  <description>Billy Sloat and Lydia Lemon don’t have much in common, unless you count growing up on the same (wrong) side of the tracks, the lack of a mother, and a persistent loneliness that has inspired creative coping mechanisms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the lives of these two loners are thrust together, Lydia’s cynicism is met with Billy’s sincere optimism, and both begin to question their own outlook on life. On top of that, weird happenings including an impossible tornado and an all-consuming fog are cropping up around them—maybe even because of them. And as the two grow closer and confront bigger truths about their pasts, they must also deal with such inconveniences as a narcissistic rock star, a war between unicorns and dragons, and eventually, of course, the apocalypse.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Paige has everything she thinks she wants.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick might be the one thing she really needs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sometimes the best dreams are the ones you didn't know you had.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Dr. Paige Ellis has worked hard to make her dreams come true. But somewhere along the way, she lost something important--herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, her dead grandmother is still looking out for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Paige returns home to fulfill her Nana's last request, she comes face-to-face with an annoying blast from her past. Not only does Nick Collins know just which buttons to push to make Paige crazy, but he also might be the one thing Paige has convinced herself she doesn't need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Nana and Nick persuade an overachieving workaholic that love might be the best medicine after all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you enjoy enemies-to-lovers RomComs, you'll fall for &lt;b&gt;TURN THE PAIGE&lt;/b&gt;. Because love hurts. But it's kind of funny.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When Kellan Ayrwick returns home for his father’s retirement from Braxton College, he finds a dead body in Diamond Hall’s stairwell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Kellan has a connection to the victim, and so do several members of his family. Could one of them be guilty of murder? Soon after, the college's athletic program receives mysterious donations, a nasty blog denounces his father and someone attempts to change students' grades. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Someone is playing games on campus, but none of the facts add up. With the help of his eccentric and trouble-making nana, Kellan tries to stay out of the sheriff’s way. And if that wasn't enough already, his own past comes spiraling back to change his life forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the debut novel in the Braxton Campus Mysteries Series, you'll discover a cozy, secluded Pennsylvania village full of quirky, sarcastic and nosy residents.</description>

  <description>Ailsa Rae is learning how to live.&lt;br /&gt;She's only a few months past the heart transplant that - just in time - saved her life. Life should be a joyful adventure. But . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her relationship with her mother is at breaking point.&lt;br /&gt;She knows she needs to find her father.&lt;br /&gt;She's missed so much that her friends have left her behind.&lt;br /&gt;She's felt so helpless for so long that she's let polls on her blog make her decisions for her. And now she barely knows where to start on her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there's Lennox. Her best friend and one time lover. He was sick too. He didn't make it. And now she's supposed to face all of this without him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her new heart is a bold heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She just needs to learn to listen to it . . .</description>

  <description>Men have gone missing before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The village of Krume is plagued by a haunted wood and a hungry witch. It’s been that way for as long as Hans and Greta can remember, though they have never seen the witch themselves; no one has. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When men start to disappear once again in the cover of night - their bloody hearts turning up on doorsteps - the village falls into frenzied madness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hans and Greta, two outcast orphans, find themselves facing accusations of witchcraft and are met with an ultimatum: burn at the stake, or leave the village forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With nowhere else to go, they abandon their only home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they venture into the strange forest, their path is fraught with horrific creatures, wild and vivid hallucinations, and a mysterious man tied to the witch's past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shrike is watching, just beyond the deep darkness of the woods.</description>

  <description>The planet Jupiter has 79 known moons. 79 moons... that’s complete chaos within an atmosphere. But I have moons too. Moons that cause so much more than chaos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My moons each have a different name. Sadness, anger, grief, addiction, and each one is in a constant orbit around me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, my moons didn’t show up until I was 18. Before them, I was happy. I had great friends, a loving father and a boy with the most perfect green eyes who loved me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t have asked for anything more, but then tragedy struck and my life started to spiral. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrown into a new world of drugs, sex, and alcohol, not caring about anyone who tried to save me. I took on a new persona, I abandoned everyone who loved me, I pushed until I couldn’t push anymore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Jupiter. Let me tell you about my moons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: &lt;br /&gt;Reader discretion is advised. This book contains mature content and themes some may find offensive, distressing and a potential trigger. Recommended for 18+.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What happens when America's First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius—his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casey McQuiston's Red, White &amp;amp; Royal Blue proves: true love isn't always diplomatic.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Steffi doesn't talk, but she has so much to say.&lt;br /&gt;Rhys can't hear, but he can listen.&lt;br /&gt;Their love isn't a lightning strike, it's the rumbling roll of thunder.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steffi has been a selective mute for most of her life - she's been silent for so long that she feels completely invisible. But Rhys, the new boy at school, sees her. He's deaf, and her knowledge of basic sign language means that she's assigned to look after him. To Rhys, it doesn't matter that Steffi doesn't talk, and as they find ways to communicate, Steffi finds that she does have a voice, and that she's falling in love with the one person who makes her feel brave enough to use it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Beautiful Broken Things&lt;/i&gt; comes a love story about the times when a whisper is as good as a shout.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Seven students. Seven (deadly) sins. One secret.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paloma High School is ordinary by anyone’s standards. It’s got the same cliques, the same prejudices, the same suspect cafeteria food. And like every high school, every student has something to hide—from Kat, the thespian who conceals her trust issues onstage, to Valentine, the neurotic genius who’s planted the seed of a school scandal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When that scandal bubbles over, and rumors of a teacher-student affair surface, everyone starts hunting for someone to blame. For the seven unlikely allies at the heart of it all, the collision of their seven ordinary-seeming lives results in extraordinary change.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A deliciously disturbing, compulsively readable debut domestic suspense—prepare to meet &lt;i&gt;The Other Woman&lt;/i&gt;: there’s nothing she won’t do to keep you away from her son...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily thinks Adam’s perfect; the man she thought she’d never meet. But lurking in the shadows is a rival; a woman who shares a deep bond with the man she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily chose Adam, but she didn’t choose his mother Pammie. There’s nothing a mother wouldn’t do for her son, and now Emily is about to find out just how far Pammie will go to get what she wants: Emily gone forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Other Woman&lt;/i&gt; is an addictive, fast-paced psychological thriller about the destructive relationship between Emily, her boyfriend Adam, and his manipulative mother Pammie.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There was something quite endearing to me about her geekiness. It was a world I had no experience with, outside my purview, and something that, admittedly, excited me greatly. I wanted to know more about her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A stressful job in finance and investing has made it impossible for Netty to have any semblance of a functional love life. The long hours are taking their toll and as a huge new project falls in her lap, Netty is just about at her wit’s end. Late one Friday night at work, however, life brightens when a knock on her office door unveils adorably geeky Henrietta, her company’s computer consultant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry — computer geek, gamer, sweetheart — takes Netty on a ride that makes her question her notions of life and love, work and play, and acceptance of herself and others. Always the pretty popular girl, Netty finds herself irrevocably changing as she gets intimate with nerdy Henry, prompting her to wonder whether the path she’s been on has actually been the right one for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Netty be able to shrug off the negativity around her relationship at work, navigate the conflict of interest in getting involved with her company’s consultant, and finally start living true to herself? Or will this lesbian love affair end like all the rest?</description>

  <description>A thrillingly reimagined fairy tale from the truly magical combination of author Neil Gaiman and illustrator Chris Riddell – weaving together a sort-of Snow White and an almost Sleeping Beauty with a thread of dark magic, which will hold readers spellbound from start to finish. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the eve of her wedding, a young queen sets out to rescue a princess from an enchantment. She casts aside her fine wedding clothes, takes her chain mail and her sword and follows her brave dwarf retainers into the tunnels under the mountain towards the sleeping kingdom. This queen will decide her own future – and the princess who needs rescuing is not quite what she seems. Twisting together the familiar and the new, this perfectly delicious, captivating and darkly funny tale shows its creators at the peak of their talents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavishly produced, packed with glorious Chris Riddell illustrations enhanced with metallic ink, this is a spectacular and magical gift.</description>

  <description>After moving to Mexico with her parents, Winter Gutan had been hoping the local alternative medicine doctor would cure her mother’s illness. When her mother does not survive his controversial treatments, Winter’s life spirals in despair. Her father, a software engineer, insists his computer program, Fractalistic, will enable them to communicate with her mother’s spirit. But as his sanity begins to slip, Winter confides in her friend Rafa, a computer wizard, who tells her he’s found information about using fractal technology to treat false memories—nothing paranormal about it, leaving Winter confused and without hope. Will she lose her mother forever?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Suspecting her dad is hiding a deep secret, Winter runs Fractalistic behind his back, unveiling a sea of computer-generated imagery swirling on the screen. Her mother appears to her…begging for help! But is this all just Winter’s imagination?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fractalistic may enable Winter to communicate with her deceased mother, but it might also unleash more mysterious memories buried within Winter’s mind. To figure it all out, Winter must hack into her father’s system to uncover a horrifying truth...or remain in the dark forever.</description>

  <description>The Breakfast Club meets Grimm's Fairy Tales in the lair of an adolescent psych ward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milly’s evil stepmother commits her to a pediatric psych ward. That’s just what the wolf wants. With bunk mates like Red, who’s spiraling out of control; Pig, a fire-bug who claims Milly as her own—but just wants extra dessert—Vanet, a manic teen masquerading as a fairy godmother with wish-granting powers as likely to kill as to help; and the mysterious Wolfgang, rumored to roam for blood at night; it doesn’t take long for Milly to realize that only her dead mother’s book of tales can save her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Milly’s spells of protection weaken as her wolf stalks the hospital corridors. The ward’s a Dark Wood, and she’s not alone. As her power crumbles, she must let go of her magic and discover new weapons if she is to transform from hunted to hunter.</description>

  <description>Aristotle is an angry teen with a brother in prison. Dante is a know-it-all who has an unusual way of looking at the world. When the two meet at the swimming pool, they seem to have nothing in common. But as the loners start spending time together, they discover that they share a special friendship—the kind that changes lives and lasts a lifetime. And it is through this friendship that Ari and Dante will learn the most important truths about themselves and the kind of people they want to be.</description>

  <description>What sixteen-year-old Elizabeth has lost so far: forty pounds, four jean sizes, a boyfriend, and her peace of mind. As a result, she’s finally a size zero. She’s also the newest resident at Wallingfield, a treatment center for girls like her—girls with eating disorders. Elizabeth is determined to endure the program so she can go back home, where she plans to start restricting her food intake again. She’s pretty sure her mom, who has her own size 0 obsession, needs treatment as much as she does. Maybe even more. Then Elizabeth begins receiving mysterious packages. Are they from her ex-boyfriend, a secret admirer, or someone playing a cruel trick?</description>

  <description>THEN&lt;br /&gt;She was fifteen, her mother's golden girl. She had her whole life ahead of her. And then, in the blink of an eye, Ellie was gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW &lt;br /&gt;It’s been ten years since Ellie disappeared, but Laurel has never given up hope of finding her daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then one day a charming and charismatic stranger called Floyd walks into a café and sweeps Laurel off her feet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before too long she’s staying the night at this house and being introduced to his nine year old daughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy is precocious and pretty - and meeting her completely takes Laurel's breath away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Poppy is the spitting image of Ellie when she was that age. And now all those unanswered questions that have haunted Laurel come flooding back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened to Ellie? Where did she go? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who still has secrets to hide?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Keeping secrets is a very bad idea.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former teenage runaway and new single mother Nadia Armstrong moves to Kingston to turn her life around. But six months after she rents a low-end apartment, her body is found on a concrete slab at an isolated construction site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Major Crimes begins piecing together her last days, uncertain if this is a case of suicide or murder. To make matters more difficult, a member of the team is leaking information to reporter Marci Stokes, putting Staff Sergeant Rouleau in a precarious position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Officer Kala Stonechild’s niece, Dawn, is secretly corresponding with her father, who’s out on early parole. Dawn’s friend Vanessa is also keeping a dangerous secret — her relationship with an older man named Leo, who preys on young girls. And it’s not long before he has Dawn in his sights.</description>

  <description>A grumpy yet loveable man finds his solitary world turned on its head when a boisterous young family moves in next door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Ove. He's a curmudgeon, the kind of man who points at people he dislikes as if they were burglars caught outside his bedroom window. He has staunch principles, strict routines, and a short fuse. People call him &lt;i&gt;the bitter neighbor from hell&lt;/i&gt;, but must Ove be bitter just because he doesn't walk around with a smile plastered to his face all the time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind the cranky exterior there is a story and a sadness. So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in next door and accidentally flatten Ove's mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul. All of which will change one cranky old man and a local residents' association to their very foundations.</description>

  <description>Sylvia Plath's shocking, realistic, and intensely emotional novel about a woman falling into the grip of insanity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Esther Greenwood is brilliant, beautiful, enormously talented, and successful, but slowly going under—maybe for the last time. In her acclaimed and enduring masterwork, Sylvia Plath brilliantly draws the reader into Esther's breakdown with such intensity that her insanity becomes palpably real, even rational—as accessible an experience as going to the movies. A deep penetration into the darkest and most harrowing corners of the human psyche, &lt;em&gt;The Bell Jar&lt;/em&gt; is an extraordinary accomplishment and a haunting American classic.</description>

  <description>It’s difficult taking care of a delusional father by yourself. Sixteen-year-old Shaleigh Mallet would rather explore and photograph dilapidated buildings than cater to her father’s dark episodes. But when she’s kidnapped by a creature who carries her atop a flying bicycle into another world, she realizes this wasn’t the escape she wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a kingdom known as the Garden, where minotaurs pull carriages and parties are held in hot air balloons, Madam Cloom and her faerie servant, Teagan, rule over the land with incredible but terrifying magic. Shaleigh must prove that she is the reincarnation of a long-dead ruler, not because she believes it, but because it’s her only chance to survive. With the help of a trespassing faerie, a stoatling, and a living statue, Shaleigh hopes to outwit everyone. She aims to break the bonds of servitude and finally make her way home. What she doesn’t realize, however, is that she’s playing right into the hands of a far worse enemy...</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Stevie is trapped. In her life. And now in an eating-disorder treatment center on the dusty outskirts of the New Mexico desert.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Life in the center is regimented and intrusive, a nightmare come true. Nurses and therapists watch Stevie at mealtime, accompany her to the bathroom, and challenge her to eat the foods she’s worked so hard to avoid.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her dad has signed her up for sixty days of treatment. But what no one knows is that Stevie doesn't plan to stay that long. There are only twenty-seven days until the anniversary of her brother Josh’s death—the death &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; caused. And if Stevie gets her way, there are only twenty-seven days until she too will end her life.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;You can’t stop the future. &lt;br /&gt;You can’t rewind the past.&lt;br /&gt;The only way to learn the secret . . . is to press play.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clay Jensen returns home from school to find a strange package with his name on it lying on his porch. Inside he discovers several cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker–his classmate and crush–who committed suicide two weeks earlier. Hannah’s voice tells him that there are thirteen reasons why she decided to end her life. Clay is one of them. If he listens, he’ll find out why. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clay spends the night crisscrossing his town with Hannah as his guide. He becomes a firsthand witness to Hannah’s pain, and as he follows Hannah’s recorded words throughout his town, what he discovers changes his life forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two struggling teenagers find an unexpected connection just when they need it most.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sometimes a new perspective is all that is needed to make sense of the world.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;KIT:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;I don’t know why I decide not to sit with Annie and Violet at lunch. It feels like no one here gets what I’m going through. How could they? I don’t even understand.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DAVID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;In the 622 days I’ve attended Mapleview High, Kit Lowell is the first person to sit at my lunch table. I mean, I’ve never once sat with someone until now. “So your dad is dead,” I say to Kit, because this is a fact I’ve recently learned about her. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an unlikely friendship is sparked between relatively popular Kit Lowell and socially isolated David Drucker, everyone is surprised, most of all Kit and David. Kit appreciates David’s blunt honesty—in fact, she finds it bizarrely refreshing. David welcomes Kit’s attention and her inquisitive nature. When she asks for his help figuring out the how and why of her dad’s tragic car accident, David is all in. But neither of them can predict what they’ll find. Can their friendship survive the truth?</description>

Still young and inexperienced with men, she is shocked when she meets Luke, her handsome, womanizing neighbor, who leads a hedonistic lifestyle as a music producer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite their differences, the two strike up an unlikely friendship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milky’s new world changes when she overhears a conversation that leads her to make a rash decision. Giving up her virginity to a friend seems like the easy option, but when she finds out what Luke has given up for her in return, she realizes just how big a risk she’s taking.</description>

  <description>Ellingham Academy is a famous private school in Vermont for the brightest thinkers, inventors, and artists. It was founded by Albert Ellingham, an early twentieth century tycoon, who wanted to make a wonderful place full of riddles, twisting pathways, and gardens. "A place" he said, "where learning is a game."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after the school opened, his wife and daughter were kidnapped. The only real clue was a mocking riddle listing methods of murder, signed with the frightening pseudonym, Truly Devious. It became one of the great unsolved crimes of American history. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True-crime aficionado Stevie Bell is set to begin her first year at Ellingham Academy, and she has an ambitious plan: She will solve this cold case. That is, she will solve the case when she gets a grip on her demanding new school life and her housemates: the inventor, the novelist, the actor, the artist, and the jokester. But something strange is happening. Truly Devious makes a surprise return, and death revisits Ellingham Academy. The past has crawled out of its grave. Someone has gotten away with murder.</description>

  <description>Charlotte Davis is in pieces. At seventeen she’s already lost more than most people lose in a lifetime. But she’s learned how to forget. The broken glass washes away the sorrow until there is nothing but calm. You don’t have to think about your father and the river. Your best friend, who is gone forever. Or your mother, who has nothing left to give you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every new scar hardens Charlie’s heart just a little more, yet it still hurts so much. It hurts enough to not care anymore, which is sometimes what has to happen before you can find your way back from the edge.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this moving story two teens fall in love with just one minor complication—they can’t get within five feet of each other without risking their lives.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can you love someone you can never touch?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Grant likes to be in control—even though her totally out of control lungs have sent her in and out of the hospital most of her life. At this point, what Stella needs to control most is keeping herself away from anyone or anything that might pass along an infection and jeopardize the possibility of a lung transplant. Six feet apart. No exceptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing Will Newman wants to be in control of is getting out of this hospital. He couldn’t care less about his treatments, or a fancy new clinical drug trial. Soon, he’ll turn eighteen and then he’ll be able to unplug all these machines and actually go see the world, not just its hospitals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will’s &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what Stella needs to stay away from. If he so much as breathes on Stella she could lose her spot on the transplant list. Either one of them could die. The only way to stay alive is to stay apart. But suddenly six feet doesn’t feel like safety. It feels like punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if they could steal back just a little bit of the space their broken lungs have stolen from them? Would five feet apart really be so dangerous if it stops their hearts from breaking too?</description>

  <description>Meet Pat. Pat has a theory: his life is a movie produced by God. And his God-given mission is to become physically fit and emotionally literate, whereupon God will ensure a happy ending for him—the return of his estranged wife, Nikki. (It might not come as a surprise to learn that Pat has spent time in a mental health facility.) The problem is, Pat's now home, and everything feels off. No one will talk to him about Nikki; his beloved Philadelphia Eagles keep losing; he's being pursued by the deeply odd Tiffany; his new therapist seems to recommend adultery as a form of therapy. Plus, he's being hunted by Kenny G!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this enchanting novel, Matthew Quick takes us inside Pat's mind, showing us the world from his distorted yet endearing perspective. As the award-winning novelist Justin Cronin put it: "Tender, soulful, hilarious, and true, &lt;i&gt;The Silver Linings Playbook&lt;/i&gt; is a wonderful debut."</description>

  <description>Beauty knows the Beast’s forest in her bones—and in her blood. Though she grew up with the city’s highest aristocrats, far from her father’s old lodge, she knows that the forest holds secrets and that her father is the only hunter who’s ever come close to discovering them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when her father loses his fortune and moves Yeva and her sisters back to the outskirts of town, Yeva is secretly relieved. Out in the wilderness, there’s no pressure to make idle chatter with vapid baronessas…or to submit to marrying a wealthy gentleman. But Yeva’s father’s misfortune may have cost him his mind, and when he goes missing in the woods, Yeva sets her sights on one prey: the creature he’d been obsessively tracking just before his disappearance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deaf to her sisters’ protests, Yeva hunts this strange Beast back into his own territory—a cursed valley, a ruined castle, and a world of creatures that Yeva’s only heard about in fairy tales. A world that can bring her ruin or salvation. Who will survive: the Beauty, or the Beast?</description>

  <description> 
  &lt;b&gt;Some nightmares never end&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In his sleep, Louie starts visiting a magical world where he meets his father, who died when Louie was still a baby. But nothing turns out to be what it seems, and great horrors loom very close by ...&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;b&gt;Welcome to Dreamland&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A mysterious teen ghost story about fear and loss and losing yourself in dreams, &lt;b&gt;Dreamland&lt;/b&gt; was originally published in Danish to great reviews, and is now available in English.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; BOOK BLOGGERS ON DREAMLAND &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Really awesome, well thought out and creepy.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;★★★★★ &lt;i&gt;Sabrina&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“A thrilling ride down into the subconscious … I can only recommend it!”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;★★★★ &lt;i&gt;Eva Lucia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Incredibly compelling.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;★★★★ &lt;i&gt;Pernille&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“I loved the concept of Dreamland—more than once I held my breath as Louie went there.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;★★★★ &lt;i&gt;Cecilie&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“It is hard not to get dragged into Dreamland.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;★★★★ &lt;i&gt;Regitze&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; EXCERPT &lt;p&gt;“Dreamland is merely a small part of the dreamworld,” his dad said. “All around us is this. I call it the outskirts. That’s where nightmares come from.”&lt;br /&gt;     Louie stared out into the wasteland and felt a growing discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;     “Something lives out there,” his dad went on, his eyes searching the horizon. “Once in a while they come close enough to the border to be glimpsed. And if you listen carefully, you can hear their voices.”&lt;br /&gt;     Louie held his breath and listened. The silence on this side of the edge was deep and calm, only interrupted by bird song now and then. On the other side a cold wind howled.&lt;br /&gt;     “Do you hear them?” his dad asked.&lt;br /&gt;     “I only hear the wind.” But as he said it, he realized the wind &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the voices. It was a chanting choir of faint fragments; whispering, giggling, alluring.&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;i&gt;“… hi, Louuuuie …”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;i&gt;“… how sweet he is …”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;i&gt;“… come out here …”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;i&gt;“… we’ve been waiting for you …”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;i&gt;“… visit us, Louuuuie …”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     They kept saying his name. The sound made him shiver. The voices seemed to rise and fall with the wind, but at the same time it seemed like they came from &lt;i&gt;inside&lt;/i&gt; his head. There was something drawing, almost hypnotic about them. Louie wanted to step closer, just so he could hear them a little more clearly …&lt;br /&gt;     “Louie?”&lt;br /&gt;     Dad’s voice pulled him back, and he looked up.&lt;br /&gt;     “Don’t listen anymore. If you listen for too long, you end up taking the bait. The reason I show you this is so that you can understand where the voice you heard is coming from.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In April 1942, Lale Sokolov, a Slovakian Jew, is forcibly transported to the concentration camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau. When his captors discover that he speaks several languages, he is put to work as a &lt;i&gt;Tätowierer&lt;/i&gt; (the German word for tattooist), tasked with permanently marking his fellow prisoners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imprisoned for more than two and a half years, Lale witnesses horrific atrocities and barbarism—but also incredible acts of bravery and compassion. Risking his own life, he uses his privileged position to exchange jewels and money from murdered Jews for food to keep his fellow prisoners alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day in July 1942, Lale, prisoner 32407, comforts a trembling young woman waiting in line to have the number 34902 tattooed onto her arm. Her name is Gita, and in that first encounter, Lale vows to somehow survive the camp and marry her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A vivid, harrowing, and ultimately hopeful re-creation of Lale Sokolov's experiences as the man who tattooed the arms of thousands of prisoners with what would become one of the most potent symbols of the Holocaust, &lt;i&gt;The Tattooist of Auschwitz&lt;/i&gt; is also a testament to the endurance of love and humanity under the darkest possible conditions.</description>

  <description>Tanzy Hightower is not crazy. At least, that’s what she tells herself. Crazy looks more like her mother, who studies each sunrise with the same fascination other women give tabloid magazines in the grocery store checkout line. Crazy sounds like the woman on the radio claiming there’s a whole separate world existing parallel to our own. Still, Tanzy can’t deny the tingle of recognition she feels each time she sees her mother standing at the kitchen window, or hears the panic in the woman’s voice coming through the speakers of her father’s truck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tanzy intends to follow her father’s footsteps into the professional horse world. But the moment she watches him die on the back of a horse in an accident she feels responsible for, everything changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first anniversary of his death, a fight with her mother drives her back to her father’s farm in the middle of a stormy night. Neither Tanzy nor life as she knows it escapes unchanged when she is struck by lightning and introduced to a world... unseen, and receives proof her father’s death was no accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two strangers seem too willing to help her navigate her new reality: Vanessa Andrews, a psychiatrist who believes lightning chooses who it strikes, and Lucas, a quiet, scarred stable hand with timing that borders on either perfect or suspect. But Tanzy has secrets of her own. Desperate for answers and revenge, Tanzy must put her faith in their hands as her past comes calling, and her father’s killer closes in.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From beloved award-winning actor, Neil Patrick Harris, comes the magical first book in a new series with plenty of tricks up its sleeve.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When street magician Carter runs away, he never expects to find friends and magic in a sleepy New England town. But like any good trick, things change instantly as greedy B.B. Bosso and his crew of crooked carnies arrive to steal anything and everything they can get their sticky fingers on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a fateful encounter with the local purveyor of illusion, Dante Vernon, Carter teams up with five other like-minded kids. Together, using both teamwork and magic, they'll set out to save the town of Mineral Wells from Bosso's villainous clutches. These six &lt;i&gt;Magic Misfits&lt;/i&gt; will soon discover adventure, friendship, and their own self-worth in this delightful new series.</description>

  <description>Goodreads Choice Award-winning poet and USA TODAY bestselling author Amanda Lovelace presents the mermaid’s voice returns in this one — the third and final installment in her “women are some kind of magic” series, featuring a foreword from Lang Leav and 13 guest poems from leading voices in poetry such as Nikita Gill, KY Robinson, and Orion Carloto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mermaid is known for her siren song, luring bedroom-eyed sailors to their demise. However, beneath these misguided myths are tales of escapism and healing, which Lovelace weaves throughout this empowering collection of poetry, taking you on a journey from the sea to the stars. They tried to silence her once and for all, but the mermaid’s voice returns in this one.</description>

  <description>When Lauren and Ryan’s marriage reaches the breaking point, they come up with an unconventional plan. They decide to take a year off in the hopes of finding a way to fall in love again. One year apart, and only one rule: they cannot contact each other. Aside from that, anything goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren embarks on a journey of self-discovery, quickly finding that her friends and family have their own ideas about the meaning of marriage. These influences, as well as her own healing process and the challenges of living apart from Ryan, begin to change Lauren’s ideas about monogamy and marriage. She starts to question: When you can have romance without loyalty and commitment without marriage, when love and lust are no longer tied together, what do you value? What are you willing to fight for?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The next novel of psychological suspense and obsession from the authors of the blockbuster bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seeking women ages 18–32 to participate in a study on ethics and morality. Generous compensation. Anonymity guaranteed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jessica Farris signs up for a psychology study conducted by the mysterious Dr. Shields, she thinks all she’ll have to do is answer a few questions, collect her money, and leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #1: Could you tell a lie without feeling guilt?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the questions grow more and more intense and invasive and the sessions become outings where Jess is told what to wear and how to act, she begins to feel as though Dr. Shields may know what she’s thinking… and what she’s hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #2: Have you ever deeply hurt someone you care about?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jess’s paranoia grows, it becomes clear that she can no longer trust what in her life is real, and what is one of Dr. Shields’ manipulative experiments. Caught in a web of deceit and jealousy, Jess quickly learns that some obsessions can be deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #3: Should a punishment always fit the crime?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the authors of the blockbuster bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; comes an electrifying new novel about doubt, passion, and just how much you can trust someone.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Erin Kelly, the masterful author of &lt;i&gt;He Said/She Said&lt;/i&gt;, delivers another irresistible, unputdownable novel of psychological suspense. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can't keep &lt;b&gt;the secret.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;You can't tell &lt;b&gt;the truth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;You can't escape &lt;b&gt;the past&lt;/b&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marianne was seventeen when she fled her home in Nusstead – leaving behind her family, her boyfriend, Jesse, and the body they buried. Now, thirty years later, forced to return to in order to help care for her sick mother, she can feel the past closing around her. And Jesse, who never forgave her for leaving in the first place, is finally threatening to expose the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marianne will do anything to protect the life she's built, the husband and daughter who must never know what happened all those years ago. Even if it means turning to her worst enemy for help... But Marianne may not know the whole story – and she isn't the only one with secrets they'd kill to keep.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Everyone in Shaker Heights was talking about it that summer: how Isabelle, the last of the Richardson children, had finally gone around the bend and burned the house down. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is meticulously planned – from the layout of the winding roads, to the colours of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Mia Warren – an enigmatic artist and single mother – who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenage daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than just tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the alluring mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past, and a disregard for the rules that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Richardsons' friends attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town and puts Mia and Mrs. Richardson on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Mrs. Richardson becomes determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs to her own family – and Mia's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Little Fires Everywhere&lt;/i&gt; explores the weight of long-held secrets and the ferocious pull of motherhood-and the danger of believing that planning and following the rules can avert disaster, or heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Kay Donovan may have skeletons in her closet, but the past is past, and she's reinvented herself entirely. Now she's a star soccer player whose group of gorgeous friends run their private school with effortless popularity and acerbic wit. But when a girl's body is found in the lake, Kay's carefully constructed life begins to topple. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dead girl has left Kay a computer-coded scavenger hunt, which, as it unravels, begins to implicate suspect after suspect, until Kay herself is in the crosshairs of a murder investigation. But if Kay's finally backed into a corner, she'll do what it takes to survive. Because at Bates Academy, the truth is something you make...not something that happened.</description>

  <description>Classic movie buff Bailey “Mink” Rydell has spent months crushing on a witty film geek she only knows online by “Alex.” Two coasts separate the teens until Bailey moves in with her dad, who lives in the same California surfing town as her online crush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faced with doubts (what if he’s a creep in real life—or worse?), Bailey doesn’t tell Alex she’s moved to his hometown. Or that she’s landed a job at the local tourist-trap museum. Or that she’s being heckled daily by the irritatingly hot museum security guard, Porter Roth—a.k.a. her new arch-nemesis. But life is whole lot messier than the movies, especially when Bailey discovers that tricky fine line between hate, love, and whatever-it-is she’s starting to feel for Porter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as the summer months go by, Bailey must choose whether to cling to a dreamy online fantasy in Alex or take a risk on an imperfect reality with Porter. The choice is both simpler and more complicated than she realizes, because Porter Roth is hiding a secret of his own: Porter is Alex…Approximately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this delightfully charming teen spin on You’ve Got Mail, the one guy Bailey Rydell can’t stand is actually the boy of her dreams—she just doesn’t know it yet.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summoned to Evelyn's luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the '80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn's story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique's own in tragic and irreversible ways. &lt;i&gt;The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo&lt;/i&gt; is a mesmerizing journey through the splendor of old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means--and what it costs--to face the truth.</description>

  <description>The first ten lies they tell you in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Speak up for yourself—we want to know what you have to say." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first moment of her freshman year at Merryweather High, Melinda knows this is a big fat lie, part of the nonsense of high school. She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether. Only her art class offers any solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Laurie Halse Anderson's powerful novel, an utterly believable heroine with a bitterly ironic voice delivers a blow to the hypocritical world of high school. She speaks for many a disenfranchised teenager while demonstrating the importance of speaking up for oneself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Speak&lt;/i&gt; was a 1999 National Book Award Finalist for Young People's Literature.</description>

  <description>Sloane isn't expecting to fall in with a group of friends when she moves from New York to Florida—especially not a group of friends so intense, so in love, so all-consuming. Yet that's exactly what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sloane becomes closest to Vera, a social-media star who lights up any room, and Gabe, Vera's twin brother and the most serious person Sloane's ever met. When a beloved painting by the twins' late mother goes missing, Sloane takes on the responsibility of tracking it down, a journey that takes her across state lines—and ever deeper into the twins' lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with intense and important friendships, a wonderful warts-and-all family, shiveringly good romantic developments, and sharp, witty dialogue, this story is about finding the people you never knew you needed.</description>

  <description>A riotously funny, emotionally raw novel about love, marriage, divorce, family, and the ties that bind—whether we like it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The death of Judd Foxman’s father marks the first time that the entire Foxman family—including Judd’s mother, brothers, and sister—have been together in years. Conspicuously absent: Judd’s wife, Jen, whose fourteen-month affair with Judd’s radio-shock-jock boss has recently become painfully public. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simultaneously mourning the death of his father and the demise of his marriage, Judd joins the rest of the Foxmans as they reluctantly submit to their patriarch’s dying request: to spend the seven days following the funeral together. In the same house. Like a family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the week quickly spins out of control, longstanding grudges resurface, secrets are revealed, and old passions reawakened. For Judd, it’s a weeklong attempt to make sense of the mess his life has become while trying in vain not to get sucked into the regressive battles of his madly dysfunctional family. All of which would be hard enough without the bomb Jen dropped the day Judd’s father died: She’s pregnant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Is Where I Leave You is Jonathan Tropper's most accomplished work to date, a riotously funny, emotionally raw novel about love, marriage, divorce, family, and the ties that bind—whether we like it or not.</description>

  <description>In case you’re wondering, this is not a love story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Tori Spring. I like to sleep and I like to blog. Last year – before all that stuff with Charlie and before I had to face the harsh realities of A-Levels and university applications and the fact that one day I really will have to start talking to people – I had friends. Things were very different, I guess, but that’s all over now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there’s Solitaire. And Michael Holden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t know what Solitaire are trying to do, and I don’t care about Michael Holden.&lt;br /&gt;I really don’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This incredible debut novel by outstanding young author Alice Oseman is perfect for fans of John Green, Rainbow Rowell and all unflinchingly honest writers.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Charlie, a highly-strung, openly gay over-thinker, and Nick, a cheerful, soft-hearted rugby player, meet at a British all-boys grammar school. Friendship blooms quickly, but could there be something more...?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie Spring is in Year 10 at Truham Grammar School for Boys. The past year hasn't been too great, but at least he's not being bullied anymore, and he's sort of got a boyfriend, even if he's kind of mean and only wants to meet up in secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Nelson is in Year 11 and on the school rugby team. He's heard a little about Charlie - the kid who was outed last year and bullied for a few months - but he's never had the opportunity to talk to him. That is, until the start of January, in which Nick and Charlie are placed in the same form group and made to sit together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They quickly become friends, and soon Charlie is falling hard for Nick, even though he doesn't think he has a chance. But love works in surprising ways, and sometimes good things are waiting just around the corner...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Solitaire&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Radio Silence&lt;/i&gt; comes a bind up of the first two chapters of Heartstopper, an &lt;a href="http://heartstoppercomic.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;ongoing webcomic&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

  <description>Rev Fletcher is battling the demons of his past. But with loving adoptive parents by his side, he’s managed to keep them at bay...until he gets a letter from his abusive father and the trauma of his childhood comes hurtling back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma Blue spends her time perfecting the computer game she built from scratch, rather than facing her parents’ crumbling marriage. She can solve any problem with the right code, but when an online troll’s harassment escalates, she’s truly afraid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rev and Emma meet, they both long to lift the burden of their secrets and bond instantly over their shared turmoil. But when their situations turn dangerous, their trust in each other will be tested in ways they never expected. This must-read story will once again have readers falling for Brigid Kemmerer’s emotional storytelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*While this book exists in the same universe as &lt;i&gt;Letters to the Lost&lt;/i&gt;, it is a standalone title.*</description>

  <description>When a beautiful, aspiring writer strides into the East Village bookstore where Joe Goldberg works, he does what anyone would do: he Googles the name on her credit card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one Guinevere Beck in New York City. She has a public Facebook account and Tweets incessantly, telling Joe everything he needs to know: she is simply Beck to her friends, she went to Brown University, she lives on Bank Street, and she’ll be at a bar in Brooklyn tonight—the perfect place for a “chance” meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Joe invisibly and obsessively takes control of Beck’s life, he orchestrates a series of events to ensure Beck finds herself in his waiting arms. Moving from stalker to boyfriend, Joe transforms himself into Beck’s perfect man, all while quietly removing the obstacles that stand in their way—even if it means murder.</description>

  <description>“Lewis Carroll didn’t get it right?” &lt;br /&gt;“No, my dear. I don’t think anyone truly will.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far away and down a rabbit hole sits the magical world known as Wonderland. A safe haven for the souls who lived less than ideal lives in the waking world get to experience peace in their afterlife. Jessica is the newest member of this enchanted land, but after eating a cookie that took away her memories of who she was, she doubts herself at every turn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessica participates in The Looking Glass Ceremony to find her new role in the afterlife, but fate has different plans. As the Queen of Hearts takes Jessica under her royal wing, plots of regicide bubble up from the depths of Wonderland. With the help of new and eccentric friends, Jessica might be able to stop the treasonous threats and bring true peace to Wonderland. But only if she heeds the cryptic words of the Caterpillar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Familiar faces take on new roles in this fantasy retelling with a dark and romantic LGBT twist This isn’t the Wonderland you’ve experienced before, and you definitely don’t want to be late for it.</description>

  <description>In the most explosive and twisted psychological thriller since &lt;i&gt;The Woman in the Window&lt;/i&gt;, a beautiful marriage turns beautifully bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Things that make me scared: When Charlie cries. Hospitals and lakes. When Ian drinks vodka in the basement. ISIS. When Ian gets angry... That something is really, really wrong with me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddie and Ian's romance began with a chance encounter at a party overseas; he was serving in the British army and she was a travel writer visiting her best friend, Jo. Now almost two decades later, married with a beautiful son, Charlie, they are living the perfect suburban life in Middle America. But when a camping accident leaves Maddie badly scarred, she begins attending writing therapy, where she gradually reveals her fears about Ian's PTSD; her concerns for the safety of their young son, Charlie; and the couple's tangled and tumultuous past with Jo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Balkans to England, Iraq to Manhattan, and finally to an ordinary family home in Kansas, sixteen years of love and fear, adventure and suspicion culminate in The Day of the Killing, when a frantic 911 call summons the police to the scene of a shocking crime.</description>

  <description>A muse. Me. The motorcycle riding, ass-kicking, concert t-shirt wearing chick from Las Vegas, is a world-renowned French artist’s muse. For a month. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had no idea when I took the escort job with Exquisite Escorts I would be standing naked in front of a blank canvas in a Seattle warehouse. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Love on Canvas” he calls his exhibit, a combination of photographic stills and paint entwined to create the most awe-inspiring pieces the world will ever see. Except every last one of them features me and a moment in time where I was vulnerable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alec Dubois played on those vulnerabilities, teaching me lessons about love and life that would stay with me through the rest of my days. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt;Mia Saunders continues her mission to bail out her comatose father whose life is on the line to a dangerous loan-shark who happens to be Mia’s ex-boyfriend. For this journey, she serves as a high-priced escort to French artist named Alec Dubois in Seattle, Washington. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Each installment in the Calendar Girl Serial will release every month throughout 2015. The stories will feature Mia, told from her perspective as she continues her journey as an escort to twelve clients in twelve different locations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: This book is designed for audiences 18+ due to language and graphic sexual content. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When Lady Katherine's father is killed for being an illegally practicing Catholic, she discovers treason wasn't the only secret he's been hiding: he was also involved in a murder plot against the reigning Queen Elizabeth I. With nothing left to lose, Katherine disguises herself as a boy and travels to London to fulfill her father's mission, and to take it one step further--kill the queen herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katherine's opportunity comes in the form of William Shakespeare's newest play, which is to be performed in front of Her Majesty. But what she doesn't know is that the play is not just a play--it's a plot to root out insurrectionists and destroy the rebellion once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mastermind behind this ruse is Toby Ellis, a young spy for the queen with secrets of his own. When Toby and Katherine are cast opposite each other as the play's leads, they find themselves inexplicably drawn to one another. But the closer they grow, the more precarious their positions become. And soon they learn that star-crossed love, mistaken identity, and betrayal are far more dangerous off the stage than on.</description>

  <description>Mila Flores and her best friend Riley have always been inseparable. There's not much excitement in their small town of Cross Creek, so Mila and Riley make their own fun, devoting most of their time to Riley's favorite activity: amateur witchcraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Riley and two Fairmont Academy mean girls die under suspicious circumstances, Mila refuses to believe everyone's explanation that her BFF was involved in a suicide pact. Instead, armed with a tube of lip gloss and an ancient grimoire, Mila does the unthinkable to uncover the truth: she brings the girls back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Riley, June, and Dayton have no recollection of their murders, but they do have unfinished business to attend to. Now, with only seven days until the spell wears off and the girls return to their graves, Mila must wrangle the distracted group of undead teens and work fast to discover their murderer...before the killer strikes again.</description>

  <description>It’s really simple. I needed money. A lot of money. One million dollars to be exact. The amount didn’t matter. All that mattered is that at the end of that price tag held my father’s life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No money. No life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time limit was one year. On January 1st I had to pay up or my Father was going to be killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you’re faced with an ultimatum like this, you do whatever you have to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that’s exactly what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The job…Exquisite Escorts. My role, serve as high priced arm candy to anyone that can afford the $100,000 price tag for a month of my company. Sex is optional (for me) and a 20% increase on the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;Mia Saunders just barely escaped a paltry life back home in Las Vegas until she gets the call that her Father has been beaten to within an inch of his life for not paying his gambling debt. Problem is, the lone shark is her lousy, ruthless ex-boyfriend. Another guy in a long line of men she’d fallen head over heels for. Not anymore. Mia’s mission is simple. Serve as a high-priced escort for her Aunt’s company and pay monthly against her Father’s bad debt. A month with a rich man who she doesn’t have to sleep with if she doesn’t want to? Easy money. At least that’s the way it was supposed to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stories will feature Mia, told from her perspective as she continues her journey as an escort to twelve clients in twelve different locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This book is designed for audiences 18+ due to language and graphic sexual content.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the latest Tea Shop Mystery from &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Laura Childs, Theodosia Browning attends a “Rat Tea,” where the mice will play...at murder.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Indigo Tea Shop owner Theodosia Browning is invited by Doreen Briggs, one of Charleston’s most prominent hostesses, to a “Rat Tea,” she is understandably intrigued.  As servers dressed in rodent costumes and wearing white gloves offer elegant finger sandwiches and fine teas, Theo learns these parties date back to early twentieth-century Charleston, where the cream of society would sponsor so-called rat teas to promote city rodent control and better public health.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But this party goes from odd to chaotic when a fire starts at one of the tables and Doreen’s entrepreneur husband suddenly goes into convulsions and drops dead. Has his favorite orange pekoe tea been poisoned? Theo smells a rat.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The distraught Doreen soon engages Theo to pursue a discreet inquiry into who might have murdered her husband. As Theo and her tea sommelier review the guest list for suspects, they soon find themselves drawn into a dangerous game of cat and mouse...&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;INCLUDES RECIPES AND TEA TIME TIPS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Echo Ridge is small-town America. Ellery's never been there, but she's heard all about it. Her aunt went missing there at age seventeen. And only five years ago, a homecoming queen put the town on the map when she was killed. Now Ellery has to move there to live with a grandmother she barely knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The town is picture-perfect, but it's hiding secrets. And before school even begins for Ellery, someone's declared open season on homecoming, promising to make it as dangerous as it was five years ago. Then, almost as if to prove it, another girl goes missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellery knows all about secrets. Her mother has them; her grandmother does too. And the longer she's in Echo Ridge, the clearer it becomes that everyone there is hiding something. The thing is, secrets are dangerous--and most people aren't good at keeping them. Which is why in Echo Ridge, it's safest to keep your secrets to yourself.</description>

  <description>A NEW SECOND CHANCE ROMANCE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve completely had it with men. I’m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in case you were wondering, book boyfriends aren’t real. I should know because I write them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Greer Hanson. I think I’ve lost my mojo. After having my heart broken, I can’t seem to write about romance or love. When my best friend and publisher recommends an inspiration vacation, I decide to give it a whirl. What’s the worst that could happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the perfect stranger. Patrick Fisher knocks me off my feet with his rugged good looks and charm. After one night with him, the words begin to flow. Since I know I’ll never see him again, I use him as my muse. But what do I do when my fantasy comes to life and that man steps right out of the pages of my book? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book Boyfriends can’t be real. At least, that’s what I keep telling myself. Am I willing to risk having my heart broken all over again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this time reality will be better than fiction.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Rust &amp;amp; Stardust&lt;/i&gt; comes this heartbreaking story, inspired by true events, of how far one mother must go to protect her daughter. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dover, Massachusetts, 1969. Ginny Richardson's heart was torn open when her baby girl, Lucy, born with Down Syndrome, was taken from her. Under pressure from his powerful family, her husband, Ab, sent Lucy away to Willowridge, a special school for the “feeble-minded." Ab tried to convince Ginny it was for the best. That they should grieve for their daughter as though she were dead. That they should try to move on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But two years later, when Ginny's best friend, Marsha, shows her a series of articles exposing Willowridge as a hell-on-earth--its squalid hallways filled with neglected children--she knows she can't leave her daughter there. With Ginny's six-year-old son in tow, Ginny and Marsha drive to the school to see Lucy for themselves. What they find sets their course on a heart-racing journey across state lines—turning Ginny into a fugitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, Ginny must test her own strength and face the world head-on as she fights Ab and his domineering father for the right to keep Lucy. Racing from Massachusetts to the beaches of Atlantic City, through the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia to a roadside mermaid show in Florida, &lt;i&gt;Keeping Lucy&lt;/i&gt; is a searing portrait of just how far a mother’s love can take her.</description>

  <description>A sci-fi thriller and the first in a series of novels by Antony Botting.&lt;br /&gt;The discovery of a hidden extraterrestrial craft on Earth attracts attention from those who would seek to possess and learn from it.&lt;br /&gt;As the casualties mount, nobody is safe in this action packed story of deception and violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pebble lay lost and undisturbed for millennia, harbouring answers to eternal questions. &lt;br /&gt;Five sealed auction invitations, sent to heads of state to ensure that the Pebble does not fall into the hands of a clandestine organisation by the name of Onyx, trigger an unforeseen sequence of events. &lt;br /&gt;The residence of Ambassador Francis Sunderland is the venue for a celebration in honour of Wasyl Bohdanov, which takes a turn for the sinister. The Ambassador is contacted by an old friend, but it isn’t a social call. &lt;br /&gt;A young woman will stop at nothing to deliver the Pebble to Onyx. The organisation which took her in and protected her from a terrible past. &lt;br /&gt;The stage is set for humanity’s ultimate struggle for knowledge and power.</description>

  <description>There’s a first time for everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time playing quarters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time spinning the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First totally hot consensual truck hookup with a superhot boy whose digits I forgot to get. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time getting pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprised you with that one, didn’t I?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprised me, too. I’d planned to spend senior year with my bestie-slash-wifey, Devi Abrams, graduating at the top of my class and getting into an Ivy League college. Instead, Mom and I are moving in with my battle-ax of a grandmother and I’m about to start a new school and a whole new life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know what’s more fun than being the new girl for your senior year? Being the pregnant new girl. It isn’t awesome. There is one upside, though—a boy named Leaf Leon. He’s cute, an amazing cook and he’s flirting me up, hard-core. Too bad I’m knocked up with a stranger’s baby. I should probably mention that to him at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems I’ve got a lot more firsts to go.</description>

  <description>Homeless people are vanishing from the streets of Chicago. No one gives the disappearances a second thought, until a powerful CEO, Charles Pearson, pretending to be homeless in order to gather information for his company, is found to be one of the missing individuals. A local search ensues, which leads to the discovery of extensive wrongdoings within Pearson's company. The local search quickly becomes a nationwide investigation that begins to turn society on its end, pitting large corporations against each other and leaving a frantic government to uncover the reasons behind an increasing number of missing people. Meanwhile, the CEO awakens in an unfamiliar room, strapped to a metal table, incapable of even the smallest movement while emotionless strangers attach him to whining machines. The mysterious man placing electrodes to Pearson's chest is supposedly a doctor with good intentions, though his actions become increasingly perverse, increasingly violent. The investigation into numerous disappearances, and the CEO's incarceration in a strange, dangerous facility, converge in the most unexpected way as the world discovers the truth behind Soul Suites.</description>

And pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A search for the truth. A lifetime of lies.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the small hours of the morning, Abi Knight is startled awake by the phone call no mother ever wants to get: her teenage daughter Olivia has fallen off a bridge. Not only is Olivia brain dead, she’s pregnant and must remain on life support to keep her baby alive. And then Abi sees the angry bruises circling Olivia’s wrists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the police unexpectedly rule Olivia’s fall an accident, Abi decides to find out what really happened that night. Heartbroken and grieving, she unravels the threads of her daughter’s life. Was Olivia’s fall an accident? Or something far more sinister?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christina McDonald weaves a suspenseful and heartwrenching tale of hidden relationships, devastating lies, and the power of a mother’s love. With flashbacks of Olivia’s own resolve to uncover family secrets, this taut and emotional novel asks: how well do you know your children? And how well do they know you?</description>

  <description>Nick and June were best friends for years, until their relationship suddenly turned into something more. Now, June is coping with a new diagnosis of schizophrenia, a secret she asked Nick to keep for too long. Between managing her symptoms and her parents, June is just trying to keep it together. Nick is a reluctant car thief, supporting his aunt with the money and focusing on his art whenever he can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when June's condition sends her to the hospital and Nick's latest crime threatens to land him in prison, the two decide to run away. When the world is trying to tear them apart, can Nick and June find a way to stay together? \</description>

  <description>Melville Heights is one of the nicest neighbourhoods in Bristol, England; home to doctors and lawyers and old-money academics. It’s not the sort of place where people are brutally murdered in their own kitchens. But it is the sort of place where everyone has a secret. And everyone is watching you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the headmaster credited with turning around the local school, Tom Fitzwilliam is beloved by one and all—including Joey Mullen, his new neighbor, who quickly develops an intense infatuation with this thoroughly charming yet unavailable man. Joey thinks her crush is a secret, but Tom’s teenaged son Freddie—a prodigy with aspirations of becoming a spy for MI5—excels in observing people and has witnessed Joey behaving strangely around his father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of Tom’s students, Jenna Tripp, also lives on the same street, and she’s not convinced her teacher is as squeaky clean as he seems. For one thing, he has taken a particular liking to her best friend and fellow classmate, and Jenna’s mother—whose mental health has admittedly been deteriorating in recent years—is convinced that Mr. Fitzwilliam is stalking her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, twenty years earlier, a schoolgirl writes in her diary, charting her doomed obsession with a handsome young English teacher named Mr. Fitzwilliam…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heartwarming and refreshing debut novel that proves one thing: there's not enough data in the world to predict what will make your heart tick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Lane thinks math is the only thing that unites the universe. She comes up with algorithms to predict customer purchases--a job that has given her more money than she knows what to do with, and way less experience in the dating department than the average thirty-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't help that Stella has Asperger's and French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth cleaned by pilot fish. Her conclusion: she needs lots of practice--with a professional. Which is why she hires escort Michael Phan. The Vietnamese and Swedish stunner can't afford to turn down Stella's offer, and agrees to help her check off all the boxes on her lesson plan--from foreplay to more-than-missionary position...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Stella not only learns to appreciate his kisses, but crave all of the other things he's making her feel. Their no-nonsense partnership starts making a strange kind of sense. And the pattern that emerges will convince Stella that love is the best kind of logic...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Three friends, two love stories, one convention: this fun, feminist love letter to geek culture is all about fandom, friendship, and finding the courage to be yourself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie likes to stand out. She’s a vlogger and actress promoting her first movie at SupaCon, and this is her chance to show fans she’s over her public breakup with co-star Reese Ryan. When internet-famous cool-girl actress Alyssa Huntington arrives as a surprise guest, it seems Charlie’s long-time crush on her isn’t as one-sided as she thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor likes to blend in. Her brain is wired differently, making her fear change. And there’s one thing in her life she knows will never change: her friendship with her best guy friend Jamie—no matter how much she may secretly want it to. But when she hears about a fan contest for her favorite fandom, she starts to rethink her rules on playing it safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Queens of Gee&lt;/i&gt;k by Jen Wilde, chosen by readers like you for Macmillan's young adult imprint Swoon Reads, is an empowering novel for anyone who has ever felt that fandom is family.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Adam Silvera reminds us that there’s no life without death and no love without loss in this devastating yet uplifting story about two people whose lives change over the course of one unforgettable day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On September 5, a little after midnight, Death-Cast calls Mateo Torrez and Rufus Emeterio to give them some bad news: They’re going to die today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mateo and Rufus are total strangers, but, for different reasons, they’re both looking to make a new friend on their End Day. The good news: There’s an app for that. It’s called the Last Friend, and through it, Rufus and Mateo are about to meet up for one last great adventure—to live a lifetime in a single day.</description>

  <description>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before is the story of Lara Jean, who has never openly admitted her crushes, but instead wrote each boy a letter about how she felt, sealed it, and hid it in a box under her bed. But one day Lara Jean discovers that somehow her secret box of letters has been mailed, causing all her crushes from her past to confront her about the letters: her first kiss, the boy from summer camp, even her sister's ex-boyfriend, Josh. As she learns to deal with her past loves face to face, Lara Jean discovers that something good may come out of these letters after all.</description>

  <description>Cassie Hanwell was born for emergencies. As one of the only female firefighters in her Texas firehouse, she's seen her fair share of them, and she's excellent at dealing with other people's tragedies. But when her estranged and ailing mother asks her to uproot her life and move to Boston, it's an emergency of a kind Cassie never anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tough, old-school Boston firehouse is as different from Cassie's old job as it could possibly be. Hazing, a lack of funding, and poor facilities mean that the firemen aren't exactly thrilled to have a "lady" on the crew, even one as competent and smart as Cassie. Except for the handsome rookie, who doesn't seem to mind having Cassie around. But she can't think about that. Because she doesn't fall in love. And because of the advice her old captain gave her: &lt;i&gt;don't date firefighters. &lt;/i&gt;Cassie can feel her resolve slipping...but will she jeopardize her place in a career where she's worked so hard to be taken seriously?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katherine Center's &lt;i&gt;Things You Save in a Fire&lt;/i&gt; is a heartfelt, affecting novel about life, love, and the true meaning of courage.</description>

  <description>A girl, a band and a dream. And another girl. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fran Worth is just another girl trying to make it through senior year in Aberdeen, Washington. But it's 1993 and Fran is gay. Her comfortably off the radar life turns vividly public when a student nominates Fran for prom queen. When confronted by angry parents Fran refuses to back down, promising to deliver her hometown heroes in hopes of winning prom queen votes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fran heads out on a 24 hour road trip to Daily City, California with four friends, including her crush who may or may not be gay. Their plan? To sneak backstage to ask Kurt Cobain and Nirvana to come home and play prom. No problem. Unless something goes wrong.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I expected more of a reaction the first time I hit her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oliver Ryan, handsome, charismatic, and successful, has long been married to his devoted wife, Alice. Together they write and illustrate award-winning children’s books; their life together one of enviable privilege and ease—until, one evening after a delightful dinner, Oliver delivers a blow to Alice that renders her unconscious, and subsequently beats her into a coma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the aftermath of such an unthinkable event, as Alice hovers between life and death, the couple’s friends, neighbours, and acquaintances try to understand what could have driven Oliver to commit such a horrific act. As his story unfolds, layers are peeled away to reveal a life of shame, envy, deception, and masterful manipulation.</description>

  <description>At twenty-three, Kayli Stollak, like most starry-eyed twentysomethings, assumed that she and her boyfriend, Charlie, would be together forever. Besides a rockin’ sex life, they shared a passion for motorcycle adventures, hedonistic European music festivals, and wearing matching glittery spandex to the disco. What more could a gal ask for? She envisioned their love burning well into their sixties. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;And then he dumped her. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Heartbroken, Kayli turned to her seventy-five-year-old granny for support. And this ain’t no ordinary granny. Granny Gail is a ball-busting, sh*t-talking, gossipy yenta with an anecdote or piece of unsolicited advice for every situation. Granny didn’t sugarcoat the truth or let Kayli dwell on her failed relationship. No, Granny told her to cut the crap and snap out of it. Why didn’t Kayli give “one of those dating websites” a shot? With her ego on the line, Kayli threw the dare right back at her—if it was so wonderful, why didn’t single Granny join her in the world of cyber romance? &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Granny Is My Wingman&lt;/i&gt; chronicles Kayli’s and Granny’s misadventures in online dating. What ensues is a hilarious tour through the obstacles of modern love: drunken hookups, late-night Facebook stalking, breathy phone calls with geriatric suitors, and the occasional rude dude. While Kayli powers through a marathon of OkCupid dates—the corporate drone married to his BlackBerry, the nail-biting thirty-three-year-old who still lives at home with his mom, the serial online dater—we learn about Granny’s romantic past and the bittersweet affair she carried on, even while married, for more than thirty years. The two women cheer each other on and become even closer as they share their dating exploits, learning that the hunt for happiness is the same whether you’re twenty-five or seventy-five. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Fresh, funny, and honest, &lt;i&gt;Granny Is My Wingman&lt;/i&gt; is a book for anyone who has ever found love, lost it, and been crazy enough to do it all over again. &lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt; Sophie Honeywell always wondered if Thomas Gordon was the one she let get away. He was the perfect boyfriend, but on the day he was to propose, she broke his heart. A year later he married his travel agent, while Sophie has been mortifyingly single ever since. Now Thomas is back in her life because Sophie has unexpectedly inherited his aunt Connie's house on Scribbly Gum Island -- home of the famously unsolved Munro Baby mystery. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sophie moves onto the island and begins a new life as part of an unconventional family where it seems everyone has a secret. Grace, a beautiful young mother, is feverishly planning a shocking escape from her perfect life. Margie, a frumpy housewife, has made a pact with a stranger, while dreamy Aunt Rose wonders if maybe it's about time she started making her own decisions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As Sophie's life becomes increasingly complicated, she discovers that sometimes you have to stop waiting around -- and come up with your own fairy-tale ending. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As she so adroitly did in her smashing debut novel, &lt;i&gt;Three Wishes&lt;/i&gt;, the incomparable Liane Moriarty once again combines sharp wit, lovable and eccentric characters, and a page-turning story for an unforgettable &lt;i&gt;Last Anniversary&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>They say Delia burned herself to death in her stepfather’s shed. They say it was suicide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But June doesn’t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June and Delia used to be closer than anything. Best friends in that way that comes before everyone else—before guys, before family. It was like being in love, but more. They had a billion secrets, binding them together like thin silk cords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one night a year ago, everything changed. June, Delia, and June’s boyfriend Ryan were just having a little fun. Their good time got out of hand. And in the cold blue light of morning, June knew only this—things would never be the same again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, a year later, Delia is dead. June is certain she was murdered. And she owes it to her to find out the truth…which is far more complicated than she ever could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sexy, dark, and atmospheric, &lt;i&gt;Suicide Notes from Beautiful Girls&lt;/i&gt; will keep you guessing until the very last page.</description>

  <description>Alice Love is twenty-nine, crazy about her husband, and pregnant with her first child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So imagine Alice’s surprise when she comes to on the floor of a gym and is whisked off to the hospital where she discovers the honeymoon is truly over — she’s getting divorced, she has three kids and she’s actually 39 years old. Alice must reconstruct the events of a lost decade, and find out whether it’s possible to reconstruct her life at the same time. She has to figure out why her sister hardly talks to her, and how is it that she’s become one of those super skinny moms with really expensive clothes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, Alice must discover whether forgetting is a blessing or a curse, and whether it’s possible to start over.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lisa Gardner's runaway &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller--a fast-paced thrill ride featuring Detective D. D. Warren.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven years ago, carefree college student Flora Dane was kidnapped while on spring break. For 472 days, Flora learned just how much one person can endure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miraculously alive after her ordeal, Flora has spent the past five years reacquainting herself with the rhythms of normal life, working with her FBI victim advocate, Samuel Keynes. She has a mother who's never stopped loving her, a brother who is scared of the person she's become, and a bedroom wall covered with photos of other girls who've never made it home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Boston detective D. D. Warren is called to the scene of a crime--a dead man and the bound, naked woman who killed him--she learns that Flora has tangled with three other suspects since her return to society. Is Flora a victim or a vigilante? And with her firsthand knowledge of criminal behavior, could she hold the key to rescuing a missing college student whose abduction has rocked Boston? When Flora herself disappears, D.D. realizes a far more sinister predator is out there. One who's determined that this time, Flora Dane will never escape. And now it is all up to D. D. Warren to&lt;i&gt; find her.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In this New York Times bestselling sequel to Kerri Maniscalco's haunting #1 debut Stalking Jack the Ripper, bizarre murders are discovered in the castle of Prince Vlad the Impaler, otherwise known as Dracula. Could it be a copycat killer...or has the depraved prince been brought back to life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the grief and horror of her discovery of Jack the Ripper's true identity, Audrey Rose Wadsworth has no choice but to flee London and its memories. Together with the arrogant yet charming Thomas Cresswell, she journeys to the dark heart of Romania, home to one of Europe's best schools of forensic medicine...and to another notorious killer, Vlad the Impaler, whose thirst for blood became legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her life's dream is soon tainted by blood-soaked discoveries in the halls of the school's forbidding castle, and Audrey Rose is compelled to investigate the strangely familiar murders. What she finds brings all her terrifying fears to life once again.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Nora Pennington and her fiction loving friends in small-town Miracle Springs, North Carolina, encounter a young woman desperately in need of a new beginning . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Nora Pennington, owner of Miracle Books, believes that a well-chosen novel can bring healing and hope. But she and the other members of the Secret, Book, and Scone Society know that sometimes practical help is needed too. Such is the case with the reed-thin girl hiding in the fiction section of Nora's store, wearing a hospital ID and a patchwork of faded bruises. She calls herself Abilene but won't reveal much else. And when a customer is found dead in an assumed suicide, Nora uncovers a connection that points to Abilene as either a suspect--or another target. After a second death hits town, Nora and her intrepid friends must help the new, greenhorn sheriff discern fact from fiction--and stop a killer intent on bringing another victim's story to a close . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"A love letter to reading, with sharp characterizations and a smart central mystery."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt;, Shakespeare creates a violent world, in which two young people fall in love. It is not simply that their families disapprove; the Montagues and the Capulets are engaged in a blood feud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this death-filled setting, the movement from love at first sight to the lovers’ final union in death seems almost inevitable. And yet, this play set in an extraordinary world has become the quintessential story of young love. In part because of its exquisite language, it is easy to respond as if it were about all young lovers.</description>

  <description>What if you were the missing piece in one of the world’s most epic legends?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being an art history student, Summer isn’t thrilled to be stuck with her archeologist family all summer in Greece. While the rest of her college friends are posting a million selfies by the pool together, Summer is stuck alone, trying to entertain herself alone in a place where she doesn’t even speak the language. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon her arrival to Greece, strange dreams and even stranger shadows seem to haunt Summer, leaving her to ponder the meaning of pomegranate seeds and twisted, darkened faces. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, her stay abroad leads to tragic twists, leaving Summer in the arms of a dark stranger, who claims to be the god, Hades, whom she feels like she knows from another life. In a whirlwind through the busy streets of Athens, Summer is seduced to the lowest point of Greece where Hades’ lair awaits…the Underworld. Determined to find out who she is and where she belongs in an age-old myth, Summer joins Hades to discover that the secrets about her past life are beyond anything she could have ever imagined.</description>

  <description>Presented by James Patterson's new children's imprint, this deliciously creepy horror novel has a storyline inspired by the Ripper murders and an unexpected, blood-chilling conclusion...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Audrey Rose Wadsworth was born a lord's daughter, with a life of wealth and privilege stretched out before her. But between the social teas and silk dress fittings, she leads a forbidden secret life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against her stern father's wishes and society's expectations, Audrey often slips away to her uncle's laboratory to study the gruesome practice of forensic medicine. When her work on a string of savagely killed corpses drags Audrey into the investigation of a serial murderer, her search for answers brings her close to her own sheltered world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story's shocking twists and turns, augmented with real, sinister period photos, will make this dazzling, #1 New York Times bestselling debut from author Kerri Maniscalco impossible to forget.</description>

  <description>For the first time, ten years after her abduction from her Salt Lake City bedroom, Elizabeth Smart reveals how she survived and the secret to forging a new life in the wake of a brutal crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On June 5, 2002, fourteen-year-old Elizabeth Smart, the daughter of a close-knit Mormon family, was taken from her home in the middle of the night by religious fanatic, Brian David Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee. She was kept chained, dressed in disguise, repeatedly raped, and told she and her family would be killed if she tried to escape. After her rescue on March 12, 2003, she rejoined her family and worked to pick up the pieces of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the first time, in her memoir, MY STORY, she tells of the constant fear she endured every hour, her courageous determination to maintain hope, and how she devised a plan to manipulate her captors and convinced them to return to Utah, where she was rescued minutes after arriving. Smart explains how her faith helped her stay sane in the midst of a nightmare and how she found the strength to confront her captors at their trial and see that justice was served.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the nine years after her rescue, Smart transformed from victim to advocate, traveling the country and working to educate, inspire and foster change. She has created a foundation to help prevent crimes against children and is a frequent public speaker. In 2012, she married Matthew Gilmour, whom she met doing mission work in Paris for her church, in a fairy tale wedding that made the cover of &lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt; magazine.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Named to &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews'&lt;/i&gt; Best Books of 2018&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner 2019 International Book Awards (General Fiction and Inspirational Fiction Categories)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner, 2019 New York City Big Book Award (General Fiction)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Between Doubt and Belief&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Reluctant Healer&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of a young attorney who is torn between mounting evidence that he has the spiritual ability to heal others and his life-long skepticism of alternative views. Will Alexander is cautious and conventional. But when he meets Erica, a beautiful, intense energy healer, he becomes troubled not only by her unorthodox endeavors but also by the limitations of his own existence. Amidst this turmoil, Will is startled to discover that he may possess metaphysical gifts of healing that confront the narrow doctrines of his regulated life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;​The Reluctant Healer &lt;/i&gt;paints a portrait of a reasonable man who traces a path between skepticism and belief. Flawed, funny, and agnostic, Will distrusts much of the alternative world, even as he struggles internally with phenomena that challenge both his sense of self and his orderly perspective. Will’s love for Erica, the exposure to her world, and his newfound powers place his life in a state of uncertainty, teetering between disruption and liberation.</description>

This isn't normally the kind of book I would pick up right away and read, so this is a new experience for me. Basically, a lawyer named Will Alexander meets this woman named Erica,...]]>

  <description>Princess Lira is siren royalty and the most lethal of them all. With the hearts of seventeen princes in her collection, she is revered across the sea. Until a twist of fate forces her to kill one of her own. To punish her daughter, the Sea Queen transforms Lira into the one thing they loathe most—a human. Robbed of her song, Lira has until the winter solstice to deliver Prince Elian’s heart to the Sea Queen or remain a human forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ocean is the only place Prince Elian calls home, even though he is heir to the most powerful kingdom in the world. Hunting sirens is more than an unsavory hobby—it’s his calling. When he rescues a drowning woman in the ocean, she’s more than what she appears. She promises to help him find the key to destroying all of sirenkind for good—But can he trust her? And just how many deals will Elian have to barter to eliminate mankind’s greatest enemy?</description>

  <description>Anna Fox lives alone—a recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times . . . and spying on her neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, a mother, their teenage son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn’t, her world begins to crumble—and its shocking secrets are laid bare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one—and nothing—is what it seems.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I didn't ask for any of this. I didn't ask to be some kind of hero.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when your whole life gets swept up by a tornado—taking you with it—you have no choice but to go along, you know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, I've read the books. I've seen the movies. I know the song about the rainbow and the happy little bluebirds. But I never expected Oz to look like this. To be a place where Good Witches can't be trusted, Wicked Witches may just be the good guys, and winged monkeys can be executed for acts of rebellion. There's still a yellow brick road—but even that's crumbling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happened? Dorothy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say she found a way to come back to Oz. They say she seized power and the power went to her head. And now no one is safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;My name is Amy Gumm—and I'm the other girl from Kansas.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been recruited by the Revolutionary Order of the Wicked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been trained to fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And I have a mission.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Five Brides–One Dress &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kate Winton-Jones is marrying one of America’s most eligible bachelors. Edward Carnarvon III is rich, handsome and hers. But at the final fitting of her wedding gown, one of the seamstresses pricks her and a tiny blood spot appears on the outrageously expensive gown. Its famous designer fires the clumsy seamstress on the spot, whereupon the girl puts a curse on the dress and storms out. Kate doesn't believe in curses. She’s modern, American and in love with the perfect guy. What could go wrong? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But that very evening she meets a man who makes her question her future. And then she discovers that Edward has been hiding a secret or two… and before you can say, “This dress is so cursed,” she’s on the run from Edward, his family, her mother, the paparazzi and the person she thought she was. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the man who discovers her hiding place turns out to be the last man she should trust, it’s time to throw her cautious good sense out with the satin shoes she won’t be wearing. Playing it safe hasn’t done her much good. Maybe it’s time to play by a new set of rules. Her rules. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes Prince Charming is the one who turns out to be the frog, and true love appears in the most unexpected places. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Follow the cursed dress through five sets of bridal hands as four more women join The Almost Wives Club. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These are complete novels. Watch for: &lt;br /&gt;Secondhand Bride coming in April, 2015 &lt;br /&gt;Bridesmaid for Hire coming in May, 2015 &lt;br /&gt;The Wedding Flight in June, 2015 &lt;br /&gt;If the Dress Fits in July 2015 &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Gripping, emotional, and wire-taut, Not Her Daughter raises the question of what it means to be a mother—and how far someone will go to keep a child safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Emma Townsend. Five years old. Gray eyes, brown hair. Missing since June.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma is lonely. Living with her cruel mother and clueless father, Emma retreats into her own world of quiet and solitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sarah Walker. Successful entrepreneur. Broken-hearted. Kidnapper.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah has never seen a girl so precious as the gray-eyed child in a crowded airport terminal. When a second-chance encounter with Emma presents itself, Sarah takes her—far away from home. But if it’s to rescue a little girl from her damaging mother, is kidnapping wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Amy Townsend. Unhappy wife. Unfit mother. Unsure whether she wants her daughter back.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy’s life is a string of disappointments, but her biggest issue is her inability to connect with her daughter. And now Emma is gone without a trace.&lt;p&gt;As Sarah and Emma avoid the nationwide hunt, they form an unshakeable bond. But what about Emma’s real mother, back at home?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[So, the gist of the story is this woman sees how Emma is mistreated by her mother and instead of calling the police, or child services...she kidnaps her.

  <description>It’s the end of summer. Just before I start senior year with my two best friends in the whole world. Dustin and Emily are everything to me. We’ve been inseparable since middle school, and when we’re together, nothing can go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things aren’t always what they seem. Em’s turned into a drunken mess who parties too much. Dustin and I have hooked up a few times—and now he’s ready to take our relationship to the next level. Yet I’m not sure I want things to change. I’m scared if I take it any further with Dustin, our friendship will be ruined forever. Then there’s Ryan. The new guy. He’s hot. He flirts way too much. And Em has totally set her sights on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when my best friend betrays me in the worst possible way, guess who’s there to help me pick up the pieces of my broken heart? Ryan. But he’s so confusing. Annoying. Sweet. Sexy. I want to trust him, yet he makes it so hard. What I really want is for everything to go back to the way it was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I found out that best friends make the worst kind of enemies.</description>

  <description>Anthony Beretta inherited the family winery at the tender age of twenty-four. It’s a struggle to keep it up, but he loves it and is determined to make it work even if it kills him. That is, if a motorcyclist doesn’t kill him first. He initially judges the man, attractive as he may be, on the basis of his appearance and apparently limited vocabulary. He soon discovers he’s wrong, but by then Oscar Kennett has already judged Anthony on his appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oscar thinks Tony Beretta is uptight and snobbish, and Tony’s speech for the charity they’re working on together reinforces that, even when he finds out Tony did it just to push his buttons. His adorable curls and sexy glasses might not be enough to change his mind, but maybe there’s more to Tony than meets the eye.</description>

  <description>Georgie McCool knows her marriage is in trouble; it has been in trouble for a long time. She still loves her husband, Neal, and Neal still loves her, deeply — but that almost seems beside the point now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that was always beside the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days before they’re supposed to visit Neal’s family in Omaha for Christmas, Georgie tells Neal that she can’t go. She’s a TV writer, and something’s come up on her show; she has to stay in Los Angeles. She knows that Neal will be upset with her — Neal is always a little upset with Georgie — but she doesn't expect him to pack up the kids and go home without her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her husband and the kids leave for the airport, Georgie wonders if she’s finally done it. If she’s ruined everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night, Georgie discovers a way to communicate with Neal in the past. It’s not time travel, not exactly, but she feels like she’s been given an opportunity to fix her marriage before it starts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is that what she’s supposed to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or would Georgie and Neal be better off if their marriage never happened?</description>

  <description>The road in front of Dr. Louis Creed's rural Maine home frequently claims the lives of neighborhood pets. Louis has recently moved from Chicago to Ludlow with his wife Rachel, their children and pet cat. Near their house, local children have created a cemetery for the dogs and cats killed by the steady stream of transports on the busy highway. Deeper in the woods lies another graveyard, an ancient Indian burial ground whose sinister properties Louis discovers when the family cat is killed.&lt;br /&gt;source: stephenking.com</description>

  <description>Pen Lupo is sick and tired of hiding who she is. On the outside, Pen is popular, quiet, and deferential to her boyfriend. On the inside, however, Pen is honest, opinionated—and not quite sure that she's like other girls. Do they have urges like she does?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His classmates may consider him a nerd, but Benedict Pendleton knows he's destined for great things. All he has to do is find a worthy girlfriend, and his social station will be secured. Sure, Benedict is different--but that's what he likes about himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When fate intervenes, both Pen and Benedict end up at the same vacation resort for winter break. Despite their differences, the two are drawn together. But is there such a thing as happily ever after for a nympho and a nerd?</description>

  &lt;b&gt;"We were all heading for each other on a collision course, no matter what. Maybe some people are just meant to be in the same story."&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, Jude and her twin brother Noah, are inseparable. Noah draws constantly and is falling in love with the charismatic boy next door, while daredevil Jude wears red-red lipstick, cliff-dives, and does all the talking for both of them. Years later, they are barely speaking. Something has happened to change the twins in different yet equally devastating ways . . . but then Jude meets an intriguing, irresistible boy and a mysterious new mentor. The early years are Noah's to tell; the later years are Jude's. But they each have only half the story, and if they can only find their way back to one another, they'll have a chance to remake their world. This radiant, award-winning novel from the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;The Sky Is Everywhere&lt;/i&gt; will leave you breathless and teary and laughing—often all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Printz Award Winner Stonewall Honor Book.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

These moving, relatable poems encourage resilience and embolden women to take control of their own stories.

  <description>Meet Dexter Morgan, a polite wolf in sheep's clothing. He's handsome and charming, but something in his past has made him abide by a different set of rules. He's a serial killer whose one golden rule makes him immensely likeable: he only kills bad people. And his job as a blood splatter expert for the Miami police department puts him in the perfect position to identify his victims. But when a series of brutal murders bearing a striking similarity to his own style start turning up, Dexter is caught between being flattered and being frightened—of himself or some other fiend.</description>

  <description>It all begins with a fugitive billionaire and the promise of a cash reward. &lt;i&gt;Turtles All the Way Down&lt;/i&gt; is about lifelong friendship, the intimacy of an unexpected reunion, Star Wars fan fiction, and tuatara. But at its heart is Aza Holmes, a young woman navigating daily existence within the ever-tightening spiral of her own thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his long-awaited return, John Green shares Aza's story with shattering, unflinching clarity.</description>

  <description>A story of love, hot chocolate, and one little girl's wish for her mother that will make your heart swell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At twenty-seven, Penelope Dalton is quickly ticking off items on a bucket list. Only the list isn’t hers. After her eight year-old daughter Ella is given just six months to live thanks to an inoperable brain tumor, Penelope is determined to fill Ella’s remaining days with as many new experiences as she can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With an endless supply of magical gifts and recipes from the hot chocolate café Penelope runs alongside her mother in a small town nestled in the Appalachian Mountains, she is able to give her daughter almost everything she wants. The one sticking point is Ella’s latest addition to her list: get a dad. And not just any dad. Ella has her sights set on Noah Gregory, her biological father and the only person Penelope knows to have proved her true love hot chocolate wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Noah’s back in town for a few months—and as charming as ever—and the part of her that dreamed he was her fate in the first place wonders if she made the right decision to keep the truth of their daughter from him. The other, more practical part, is determined to keep him from breaking Ella’s heart too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Ella’s health declines, Penelope must give in to her fate or face a future of regrets.</description>

  <description>'The Erotic Muse' is the story of K, a young porn-addicted college-dropout who shies away from relationships and harbors dreams of becoming a writer. Full of anguish, he is given to self-abuse. One evening, while masturbating to his favorite erotic muse, Fanny Leone, sprawled on the cover of an underground porn magazine, K finds himself magically transported to a parallel world where all sexual desires and perversions are fulfilled, although with the price that he might remain trapped in this unique pleasure-hell all his life – unless he can find a way out. This 'way out' is his redemption, a journey studded with heart-stopping adventure, life-threatening danger, nerve-wracking horror, and a brush with true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;*Warning:&lt;/b&gt; This book contains graphic descriptions of a sexual nature, some of them involving rape fantasies. Readers who are bothered by such scenes may choose to skip it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Universal Book Link (Amazon/Kobo/Nook/Apple/Angus &amp;amp; Robertson/24 Symbols):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://books2read.com/u/3k0aDR" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://books2read.com/u/3k0aDR&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Allie Navarro can't wait to show her best friends the app she built at CodeGirls summer camp. CLICK'D pairs users based on common interests and sends them on a fun (and occasionally rule-breaking) scavenger hunt to find each other. And it's a hit. By the second day of school, everyone is talking about CLICK'D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching her app go viral is amazing. Leaderboards are filling up! Everyone's making new friends. And with all the data Allie is collecting, she has an even better shot at beating her archenemy, Nathan, at the upcoming youth coding competition. But when Allie discovers a glitch that threatens to expose everyone's secrets, she has to figure out how to make things right, even if that means sharing the computer lab with Nathan. Can Allie fix her app, stop it from doing any more damage, and win back the friends it hurt-all before she steps on stage to present CLICK'D to the judges?</description>

  <description>When you read this book, you will make many assumptions.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume you are reading about a jealous ex-wife.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume she is obsessed with her replacement – a beautiful, younger woman who is about to marry the man they both love. &lt;br /&gt;You will assume you know the anatomy of this tangled love triangle.&lt;br /&gt;Assume nothing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twisted and deliciously chilling, Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen's &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; exposes the secret complexities of an enviable marriage - and the dangerous truths we ignore in the name of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read between the lies. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Let me just start off by saying that once in a blue moon, I will put on my big girl pants and read a horror story. Sure, I have read a couple of Stephen King novels. Christine which was more boring and confusing than creepy or scary, and Misery (which I never finished) which was just downright cr...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;My name is Amber Reynolds. There are three things you should know about me:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;1. I’m in a coma.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;2. My husband doesn’t love me anymore.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;3. Sometimes I lie.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amber wakes up in a hospital. She can’t move. She can’t speak. She can’t open her eyes. She can hear everyone around her, but they have no idea. Amber doesn’t remember what happened, but she has a suspicion her husband had something to do with it. Alternating between her paralyzed present, the week before her accident, and a series of childhood diaries from twenty years ago, this brilliant psychological thriller asks: Is something really a lie if you believe it's the truth?</description>

And when it comes to girls named Katherine, Colin is always getting dumped. Nineteen times, to be exact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a road trip miles from home, this anagram-happy, washed-up child prodigy has ten thousand dollars in his pocket, a bloodthirsty feral hog on his trail, and an overweight, Judge Judy-loving best friend riding shotgun--but no Katherines. Colin is on a mission to prove The Theorem of Underlying Katherine Predictability, which he hopes will predict the future of any relationship, avenge Dumpees everywhere, and finally win him the girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, friendship, and a dead Austro-Hungarian archduke add up to surprising and heart-changing conclusions in this ingeniously layered comic novel about reinventing oneself.</description>

  <description>My disease is as rare as it is famous. It’s a form of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, but basically, I’m allergic to the world. I don’t leave my house, have not left my house in fifteen years. The only people I ever see are my mom and my nurse, Carla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then one day, a moving truck arrives. New next door neighbors. I look out the window, and I see him. He’s tall, lean and wearing all black—black t-shirt, black jeans, black sneakers and a black knit cap that covers his hair completely. He catches me looking and stares at me. I stare right back. His name is Olly. I want to learn everything about him, and I do. I learn that he is funny and fierce. I learn that his eyes are Atlantic Ocean-blue and that his vice is stealing silverware. I learn that when I talk to him, my whole world opens up, and I feel myself starting to change—starting to want things. To want out of my bubble. To want everything, everything the world has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe we can’t predict the future, but we can predict some things. For example, I am certainly going to fall in love with Olly. It’s almost certainly going to be a disaster.</description>

  <description>As a direct descendant of the 19th century vigilante gang, the Bald Knobbers, Ezekiel Woods, Jr. has been indoctrinated into a world ruled by violence and a literal interpretation of the bible his entire life. Now, over a hundred years later, Zeke continues his ancestors’ crusade, spending his days camouflaged as an aloof middle-aged grocery store sacker and his nights in a farmhouse cellar, preparing captives’ souls for their ultimate destiny: redemption or death. His latest abductee, an indomitable Texan working her way through a third-life crisis, chooses another option: escape. Zeke must recapture this lost sheep or face a consequence far worse than any worldly fate: that God has forsaken him.</description>

All is not what it seems at Scarborough Fair, a world of illusion, thrills and danger…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1899:&lt;/b&gt; Seeking sanctuary in the seaside resort of Scarborough, Alice discovers she is not safe from her fiancé’s jealous clutches. She jumps at the chance to run away with a man she truly loves, but when a plot to help Alice escape goes dreadfully wrong, she finds herself in terrible danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2016:&lt;/b&gt; Forced to spend the summer in Scarborough with her mother and grandmother, Rose doesn’t think her holiday is going to be much fun. Especially when she’s almost killed by a Ferrari driver on the first day. Things start to look up when she meets Dan and he asks her to go to the fair with him. But Dan’s father is mixed up with a criminal gang and Rose and Dan find themselves drawn into a life and death situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For both Alice and Rose, the fun of Scarborough Fair soon turns into the nightmare of a Victorian lunatic asylum. They must both escape if they are going to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scarborough Fair is the first in an exciting new young adult series blending historical and contemporary thriller. &lt;em&gt;Are you going to Scarborough Fair?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>When Dorothy and her little dog Toto are caught in a tornado, they and their Kansas farmhouse are suddenly transported to Oz, where Munchkins live, monkeys fly and Wicked Witches rule. Desperate to return home, and with the Wicked Witch of the West on their trail, Dorothy and Toto - together with new friends the Tin Woodsman, Scarecrow and cowardly Lion - embark on a fantastic quest along the Yellow Brick Road in search of the Emerald City. There they hope to meet the legendary, all-powerful Wizard of Oz, who alone may hold the power to grant their every wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as captivating as it was a hundred years ago, this is a story that all ages will love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“I’ve had a most amazing time....”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins the Time Traveller’s astonishing firsthand account of his journey 800,000 years beyond his own era—and the story that launched H.G. Wells’s successful career and earned him his reputation as the father of science fiction. With a speculative leap that still fires the imagination, Wells sends his brave explorer to face a future burdened with our greatest hopes...and our darkest fears. A pull of the Time Machine’s lever propels him to the age of a slowly dying Earth.  There he discovers two bizarre races—the ethereal Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks—who not only symbolize the duality of human nature, but offer a terrifying portrait of the men of tomorrow as well.  Published in 1895, this masterpiece of invention captivated readers on the threshold of a new century. Thanks to Wells’s expert storytelling and provocative insight, &lt;b&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/b&gt; will continue to enthrall readers for generations to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>Abraham Lincoln warned the country that a house divided against itself could not stand, but Erin Murphy never realized his words would hit so close to home! When it comes to the work/life seesaw, Erin is a balancing-act expert. True, she works for Democrats while her husband Jack is a spokesman for Republicans, but at home they’re in sync. Their jobs stay at the office. Their children -- 13-year-old animal-nut Jessica and 8-year-old Batman-obsessed Michael – come first. And her career is just as important as his. But on Election Day 2014, everything changes. Suddenly, Erin is out of a job … and Jack is the new star of The Right Choice TV network! As Erin searches frantically for her next position, Jack begins to practice what he preaches. Their house turns into a battlefield: What’s wrong with saying “Merry Christmas” to their Jewish neighbors? How can there be global warming when it’s cold outside? Jessica takes her mother’s side (her father is a “disgusting planet murderer”), while Michael just thinks it’s cool that Dad’s on TV and he’s making a million dollars. And Michael’s not the only one impressed with the family’s new money: Who are all these new people floating around Jack, and what do they want? As Erin’s friends take sides about what she should do with Jack 2.0, the only person who understands is a fellow stay-at-home parent: Scott. Scott is easy to look at, and just as frustrated with his marriage as Erin is… But the biggest battle is Erin’s alone: Should she keep pounding the pavement? Or become a perfect trophy wife and mother that Jack now wants her to be? Without a title and a salary, how can Erin figure out who she really is?</description>

  <description>Terror follows those who let it into their hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wrathbone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests of President Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln, Major Henry Rathbone and Clara Harris attend a showing of Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre on April 14, 1865. On that fateful night, a great man falls, but he is not alone. For Henry and Clara, the night is only the beginning of lives wrought with jealousy, madness, and horror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Only Good Lawyer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bradley is a savvy defense attorney with no scruples. Under his representation, many a guilty man has gone free.

Every guy wants to be him, and every girl wants to be with him. He would trade all he has to make his looks last forever, but bargaining with the devil may leave him short a soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the Birds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nev's best friend is his parrot. In fact, it's his only friend… and his only ally when his home is invaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revenge is a Dish&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maurice has landed a dream job, chef for a rich couple on their yacht.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An FBI agent goes undercover to catch a thief who turns out to be too hot to handle.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darke Davis destroyed evidence to give his partner-in-crime time to flee with thirty-nine million dollars— and Special Agent Flare Greene is determined to get that money back. Hooking up with Darke at a popular gay roadhouse seems like a brilliant way to insinuate his way into Darke's life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Flare didn't plan on the two of them stumbling over a body and finding themselves on the run from charges of first-degree murder. It's the perfect opportunity to bond with Darke, but if they can't work together to solve these crimes, they may find themselves locked up together for longer than just one night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This 72,000-word romantic suspense mystery novel includes a troubled ex-cop, an undercover FBI agent, and a gay wedding resort town full of secrets beneath the cupcakes. This novel features gay male/male romantic and sexual relationships in a modern out-and-proud setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cliffhangers, and you may expect the killer to find justice. However, because Darke and Flare are at the beginning of their journey together, they reach a happy for now ending with relationship challenges remaining ahead of them.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The Owens sisters confront the challenges of life and love in this bewitching novel from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Alice Hoffman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more than two hundred years, the Owens women have been blamed for everything that has gone wrong in their Massachusetts town. Gillian and Sally have endured that fate as well: as children, the sisters were forever outsiders, taunted, talked about, pointed at. Their elderly aunts almost seemed to encourage the whispers of witchery, with their musty house and their exotic concoctions and their crowd of black cats. But all Gillian and Sally wanted was to escape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One will do so by marrying, the other by running away. But the bonds they share will bring them back—almost as if by magic...&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How Do You Search for Happiness?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you feel there is something you need in order to be happy but that it’s always just out of your reach? Do you move from job to job and relationship to relationship always feeling unsatisfied, yet still convinced that this type of change will solve all your problems? Are you looking for a new approach? If so, I think this book may be exactly what you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Does Happiness Really Work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happiness is something we all desire but very few study and train for it directly. We are often convinced that our accomplishments will make us happy so we devote all our energy towards achieving them. We don’t take the time to look at happiness and suffering directly. How does happiness and suffering really work? Why are some people happy in unfortunate circumstances and others unhappy in fortunate ones? Could it be that happiness has more to do with the person than the circumstances? What is it about some people that allows them to be so happy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book answers these questions and more by describing:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✦ How we lost the natural happiness of our childhood and how we can get it back&lt;br /&gt;✦ How we can use our mental suffering to pin-point the false beliefs that cause us unhappiness&lt;br /&gt;✦ How a correct self-image can liberate our natural happiness within&lt;br /&gt;✦ How a clear, positive mental state can see through objections to happiness&lt;br /&gt;✦ How practical exercises can be used to effectively deal with depression and anxiety&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ancient Wisdom in a Modern Message&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The methods presented in this book are not untested theories. They are practical, tried and true gems the author has collected and developed after years of searching and struggling with depression and anxiety. He has surveyed the vast self-help / religious landscape and combined its wisdom with his own insights to form a concise modern message that can speak to everyone and provide a path to peace and happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;True Happiness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading this book, you will hopefully no longer see “true happiness comes from within” as a catchy slogan but as a profound, ancient, and life-changing truth.</description>

  <description>Nestled in a small Tennessee town is Camp Arthur, a summer camp with mountains of possibility. At least that’s how the new owners see it. Penelope has dreamed of being a counselor at Camp Arthur ever since she was a young camper herself. And this July finally brings her chance: an opportunity to be a counselor in training with a cabin full of campers under her watchful eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things get complicated when a fellow counselor jogs right into her life and takes her eyes off her job, and if that wasn’t challenging enough, news from her parents knock her even further off course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was supposed to be a fun summer transition between childhood and her adult years turns into something altogether unexpected. Can Penelope balance a budding summertime romance against the drama of a jealous ex and her own family troubles, or will she really have her last July at Camp Arthur?</description>

  <description>Adorkable (ah-dor-kuh-bul): Descriptive term meaning to be equal parts dorky and adorable. For reference, see Sally Spitz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Sally Spitz is done with dating. Or at least, she's done with the horrible blind dates/hookups/sneak attacks her matchmaking bestie, Hooker, sets her up on. There's only so much one geek girl and Gryffindor supporter can take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her solution: she needs a fake boyfriend. And fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Becks, soccer phenom, all-around-hottie, and Sally's best friend practically since birth. When Sally asks Becks to be her F.B.F. (fake boyfriend), Becks is only too happy to be used. He'd do anything for Sal--even if that means giving her PDA lessons in his bedroom, saying she's "more than pretty," and expertly kissing her at parties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem: Sally's been in love with Becks all her life--and he's completely clueless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book features two best friends, one special edition Yoda snuggie, countless beneath-the-ear kisses and begs the question:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who wants a real boyfriend when faking it is so much more fun?</description>

  <description>When you’re a thief trying to get by on the scraps of your labor, life is anything but easy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lexa Blackmoon is a low-end magical thief with a penchant for taking things others won’t miss. An orphan haunted by the memory of her murdered parents, she lives her life just trying to get by, only looking out for herself. When a shadow mage unexpectedly confronts her and tells her she’s meant for something greater, she can’t help but feel he’s telling the truth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Taken to a secret resistance camp outside the city, Lexa learns that not only is she a mage, but she possesses the Mark of Merlin, a magical power greater than she’s ever dreamt of. She joins the resistance, training her powers to infiltrate the ranks of M.A.G.I.C., a magical police force tasked with cleaning up the streets from crime and keeping the magical realm a secret from normal humans. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when the sinister president-turned-dictator, Kiren Nightstorm, attempts to take over the realm, Lexa knows she has to hit him where it hurts: by defeating his secret crime syndicate aimed at enslaving the magical race. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is an urban fantasy novel with some new adult aspects, including some language and violence. This is the first in a five book series.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>When twenty-six-year-old Lucy Mitchell loses her job, she momentarily loses her mind too and agrees to take part in a reality TV show. Before she knows it she’s jetting off to a piece of paradise on a beautiful Spanish island. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to her surprise, Lucy makes new friends and has the time of her life, even indulging in a behind-the-scenes romance with a hunky cameraman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced the production will never make it to the screen, Lucy returns home on cloud nine, but soon finds that things are not always as they seem.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What would it take to make you intervene?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ella Longfield overhears two attractive young men flirting with teenage girls on a train, she thinks nothing of it—until she realises they are fresh out of prison and her maternal instinct is put on high alert. But just as she’s decided to call for help, something stops her. The next day, she wakes up to the news that one of the girls—beautiful, green-eyed Anna Ballard—has disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, Anna is still missing. Ella is wracked with guilt over what she failed to do, and she’s not the only one who can’t forget. Someone is sending her threatening letters—letters that make her fear for her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then an anniversary appeal reveals that Anna’s friends and family might have something to hide. Anna’s best friend, Sarah, hasn’t been telling the whole truth about what really happened that night—and her parents have been keeping secrets of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone knows where Anna is—and they’re not telling. But they are watching Ella.</description>

  <description>A Legend, &lt;br /&gt;A Magical Shell &lt;br /&gt;A Girl Who Dreamed Of Something More... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lena, a Merrow girl, lives in the Skagerrak sea with her father, Carrick and her brother, Javelin who tells her of the legend of the Merrow Queen murdered by her human lover when greed takes over. But what’s worth spilling the queen’s blood? Gifted from Poseidon, himself, a magic shell gives any human the ability to control both land and sea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Javelin is called to join a clan of Merrow soldiers bent on protecting their waters from human invasion, Lena resists Merrow law and ventures to the shore with no choice but to swim to land. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With newfound legs, Lena is whisked away on a new adventure with new friends and new trouble. Everyone seems to want something from her as intrigue lurks around every corner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trying her best to hide who she is and remain safe from the dangers of the human world, will Lena finally find where she belongs, or will she be swept into a strong and stormy current by lust, greed, and jealousy?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;If you could read my mind, you wouldn't be smiling.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Samantha McAllister looks just like the rest of the popular girls in her junior class. But hidden beneath the straightened hair and expertly applied makeup is a secret that her friends would never understand: Sam has Purely-Obsessional OCD and is consumed by a stream of dark thoughts and worries that she can't turn off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second-guessing every move, thought, and word makes daily life a struggle, and it doesn't help that her lifelong friends will turn toxic at the first sign of a wrong outfit, wrong lunch, or wrong crush. Yet Sam knows she'd be &lt;i&gt;truly&lt;/i&gt; crazy to leave the protection of the most popular girls in school. So when Sam meets Caroline, she has to keep her new friend with a refreshing sense of humor and no style a secret, right up there with Sam's weekly visits to her psychiatrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caroline introduces Sam to Poet's Corner, a hidden room and a tight-knit group of misfits who have been ignored by the school at large. Sam is drawn to them immediately, especially a guitar-playing guy with a talent for verse, and starts to discover a whole new side of herself. Slowly, she begins to feel more "normal" than she ever has as part of the popular crowd . . . until she finds a new reason to question her sanity and all she holds dear.</description>

  <description>Self-proclaimed fat girl Willowdean Dickson (dubbed “Dumplin’” by her former beauty queen mom) has always been at home in her own skin. Her thoughts on having the ultimate bikini body? Put a bikini on your body. With her all-American beauty best friend, Ellen, by her side, things have always worked…until Will takes a job at Harpy’s, the local fast-food joint. There she meets Private School Bo, a hot former jock. Will isn’t surprised to find herself attracted to Bo. But she is surprised when he seems to like her back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of finding new heights of self-assurance in her relationship with Bo, Will starts to doubt herself. So she sets out to take back her confidence by doing the most horrifying thing she can imagine: entering the Miss Clover City beauty pageant—along with several other unlikely candidates—to show the world that she deserves to be up there as much as any twiggy girl does. Along the way, she’ll shock the hell out of Clover City—and maybe herself most of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With starry Texas nights, red candy suckers, Dolly Parton songs, and a wildly unforgettable heroine—&lt;i&gt;Dumplin’&lt;/i&gt; is guaranteed to steal your heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;IN THE YEAR 2044, reality is an ugly place.&lt;/b&gt; The only time teenage Wade Watts really feels alive is when he's jacked into the virtual utopia known as the OASIS. Wade's devoted his life to studying the puzzles hidden within this world's digital confines, puzzles that are based on their creator's obsession with the pop culture of decades past and that promise massive power and fortune to whoever can unlock them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Wade stumbles upon the first clue, he finds himself beset by players willing to kill to take this ultimate prize. The race is on, and if Wade's going to survive, he'll have to win—and confront the real world he's always been so desperate to escape.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The hole they dug was not deep. A white flour bag encased the little body. Three small faces watched from the window, eyes black with terror. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The child in the middle spoke without turning his head. &lt;i&gt;I wonder which one of us will be next?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a woman’s body is discovered in a cathedral and hours later a young man is found hanging from a tree outside his home, Detective Lottie Parker is called in to lead the investigation. Both bodies have the same distinctive tattoo clumsily inscribed on their legs. It’s clear the pair are connected, but how? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail leads Lottie to St. Angela’s, a former children’s home, with a dark connection to her own family history. Suddenly the case just got personal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Lottie begins to link the current victims to unsolved murders decades old, two teenage boys go missing. She must close in on the killer before they strike again, but in doing so is she putting her own children in terrifying danger? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lottie is about to come face to face with a twisted soul who has a very warped idea of justice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fans of Rachel Abbott, Karin Slaughter and Robert Dugoni will be gripped by this page-turning serial killer thriller, guaranteed to keep you reading late into the night.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>When Claudia accidentally eavesdrops on the epic breakup of Paige and Iris, &lt;i&gt;the &lt;/i&gt;it-couple at her school, she finds herself in hot water with prickly, difficult Iris. Thrown together against their will in the class production of &lt;i&gt;A Midsummer Night's Dream, &lt;/i&gt;along with the goofiest, cutest boy Claudia has ever known, Iris and Claudia are in for an eye-opening senior year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart, funny, and thoroughly, wonderfully flawed, Claudia navigates a world of intense friendships and tentative romance in &lt;i&gt;Foolish Hearts&lt;/i&gt;, a YA novel about expanding your horizons, allowing yourself to be vulnerable, and accepting--and loving--people for who they really are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A contemporary young adult novel by Emma Mills about a girl whose high school production of &lt;i&gt;A Midsummer Night's Dream&lt;/i&gt; leads her to new friends--and maybe even new love.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Award-winning actress Drew Barrymore shares funny, insightful, and profound stories from her past and present told from the place of happiness she's achieved today.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wildflower&lt;/i&gt; is a portrait of Drew's life in stories as she looks back on the adventures, challenges, and incredible experiences of her earlier years. It includes tales of living on her own at 14 (and how laundry may have saved her life), getting stuck in a gas station overhang on a cross country road trip, saying goodbye to her father in a way only he could have understood, and many more adventures and lessons that have led her to the successful, happy, and healthy place she is today. It is the first book Drew has written about her life since the age of 14.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;For fans of Emily Barr &amp;amp; Rosamund Lupton...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helen has had to leave everything she’s ever known behind; her home, her family, even her own name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, returning to the UK as Ellen Newman, she moves to a small coastal village, working as a nanny for Donovan, a criminal psychologist. Attractive, caring and protective, this single father and his sweet daughter are a world away from Ellen’s brutal past. She thinks she’s escaped. She thinks she’s safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ellen can’t shake the feeling that something’s wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strange incidents begin to plague her new family, and their house of calm is about to become one of suspicion and fear. Who can be trusted? Who is the target? Who is closing in?</description>

  <description>One viral photo.&lt;br /&gt;Four expelled teens.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone's a suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo Foster's Twitter account used to be anonymous--until someone posted a revealing photo that got him expelled. No final grade. No future. No fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo's resigned to a life of misery working at the local mini-mart when a miracle happens: Sasha Ellis speaks to him. Sasha Ellis knows his name. She was also expelled for a crime she didn't commit, and now he has the perfect way to get her attention: find out who set them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To uncover the truth, Theo has to get close to the suspects: the hacker, the quarterback, the mean girl, the vice principal, and his own best friend. What secrets are they hiding? And how can Theo catch their confessions on camera?</description>

  &lt;em&gt;"When I met Oliver Perry, I had no clue he was the lead singer for The Heartbreakers. And he had no idea that I was the only girl in the world who hated his music."&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stella will do anything for her sick sister, Cara—even stand in line for an autographed Heartbreakers CD...for four hours. She's totally winning best birthday gift this year. At least she met a cute boy with soft brown hair and gorgeous blue eyes while getting her caffeine fix. Too bad she'll never see him again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except, Stella's life has suddenly turned into a cheesy love song. Because Starbucks Boy is Oliver Perry – lead singer for the Heartbreakers. And even after she calls his music crap, Oliver still gives Stella his phone number. And whispers quotes from her favorite Disney movie in her ear. OMG, what is her life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how can Stella even think about being with Oliver — dating and laughing and pulling pranks with the band — when her sister could be dying of cancer?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the unforgettable &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;We Were Liars&lt;/i&gt; comes a masterful new psychological suspense novel--the story of a young woman whose diabolical smarts are her ticket into a charmed life. But how many times can someone reinvent themselves? You be the judge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imogen is a runaway heiress, an orphan, a cook, and a cheat.&lt;br /&gt;Jule is a fighter, a social chameleon, and an athlete. &lt;br /&gt;An intense friendship. A disappearance. A murder, or maybe two. &lt;br /&gt;A bad romance, or maybe three.&lt;br /&gt;Blunt objects, disguises, blood, and chocolate. The American dream, superheroes, spies, and villains. &lt;br /&gt;A girl who refuses to give people what they want from her.&lt;br /&gt;A girl who refuses to be the person she once was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for E. Lockhart's &lt;i&gt;We Were Liars&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Haunting, sophisticated. . . . Twisty and well-told." --&lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"[It] will leave you dying to talk about the book with a pal or ten." --Parade.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You're going to want to remember the title. &lt;i&gt;Liars&lt;/i&gt; details the summers of a girl who harbors a dark secret, and delivers a satisfying but shocking twist ending." --&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"An ambitious novel with an engaging voice, a clever plot and some terrific writing." --&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Thrilling, beautiful, and blisteringly smart, &lt;i&gt;We Were Liars&lt;/i&gt; is utterly unforgettable." --John Green, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Fault in Our Stars&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>HER PERFECT LIFE IS A PERFECT LIE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a teenager at the prestigious Bradley School, Ani FaNelli endured a shocking, public humiliation that left her desperate to reinvent herself. Now, with a glamorous job, expensive wardrobe, and handsome blue blood fiancé, she’s this close to living the perfect life she’s worked so hard to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ani has a secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s something else buried in her past that still haunts her, something private and painful that threatens to bubble to the surface and destroy everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a singular voice and twists you won’t see coming, Luckiest Girl Alive explores the unbearable pressure that so many women feel to “have it all” and introduces a heroine whose sharp edges and cutthroat ambition have been protecting a scandalous truth, and a heart that's bigger than it first appears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question remains: will breaking her silence destroy all that she has worked for—or, will it at long last, set Ani free?</description>

  <description>Cash Carter is the young, world famous lead actor of the hit television Wiz Kids. When four fans jokingly invite him on a cross-country road trip, they are shocked that he actually takes them up on it. Chased by paparazzi and hounded by reporters, this unlikely crew takes off on a journey of a lifetime--but along the way they discover that the star they love has deep secrets he's been keeping. What they come to learn about the life of the mysterious person they thought they knew will teach them about the power of empathy and the unbreakable bond of true friendship.</description>

  <description>“I’ve left some clues for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you want them, turn the page.&lt;br /&gt;If you don’t, put the book back on the shelf, please.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins the latest whirlwind romance from the bestselling authors of &lt;i&gt;Nick &amp;amp; Norah’s Infinite Playlist&lt;/i&gt;. Lily has left a red notebook full of challenges on a favorite bookstore shelf, waiting for just the right guy to come along and accept its dares. But is Dash that right guy? Or are Dash and Lily only destined to trade dares, dreams, and desires in the notebook they pass back and forth at locations across New York? Could their in-person selves possibly connect as well as their notebook versions? Or will they be a comic mismatch of disastrous proportions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel Cohn and David Levithan have written a love story that will have readers perusing bookstore shelves, looking and longing for a love (and a red notebook) of their own.</description>

  <description>High school junior Charlie Blake has never seen anyone quite like Micah Jacobs in her small town of Grand Lakes. With his carefree spirit, rough-around-the-edges personality, and handsome grin, Charlie is transfixed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Charlie's been burned before with her first crush, at the hands of an ex-friend and a cruel joke. Because of those scars, Charlie keeps her guard up when it comes to boys. But a class project - that may or may not involve kissing for the camera! - forces her to not only confront Micah, but her true feelings. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While prepping for the assignment, Charlie finds herself in Micah's car accompanied by the music of Journey, Elvis, The Cars, and Peter Gabriel. Between slushies, burning rafts, pizza, and great music, Charlie and Micah bond as she learns the importance of letting go of the past and opening herself to new people. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When their project comes to an end, Charlie wonders if she should finally confess everything she's been denying before she loses the chance. When words fail, will the songs in her heart be enough?</description>

  <description>When young lawyer Lily marries Ed, she’s determined to make a fresh start and leave the secrets of the past behind. But then she takes on her first murder case and meets Joe, a convicted murderer to whom Lily is strangely drawn—and for whom she will soon be willing to risk almost anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Lily is not the only one with secrets. Her next-door neighbor Carla may be only nine, but she has already learned that secrets are powerful things. That they can get her whatever she wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lily finds Carla on her doorstep twelve years later, a chain of events is set in motion that can end only one way.</description>

  <description>Master storyteller Stephen King presents the classic #1 national bestseller of the ultimate vehicle of terror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“This is the story of a lover’s triangle…It was bad from the start. And it got worse in a hurry.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It’s love at first sight for high school student Arnie Cunningham when he and his best friend Dennis Guilder spot the dilapidated 1958 red-and-white Plymouth Fury for sale—dubbed “Christine” by its original cantankerous owner—rusting away on a front lawn of their suburban Pennsylvania neighborhood. Dennis knows that Arnie’s never had much luck in the looks or popularity department, or really taken an interest in owning a car . . . but Christine quickly changes all that. Arnie suddenly has the newfound confidence to stick up for himself, going as far as dating the most beautiful girl at Libertyville High—transfer student Leigh Cabot—even as a mysteriously restored Christine systematically and terrifyingly consumes every aspect of Arnie’s life. Dennis and Leigh soon realize that they must uncover the awful truth behind a car with a horrifying and murderous history. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, and heaven help anyone who gets in Christine’s way…</description>

She's found new friends and has even started to fall for mysterious outsider Ollie Larsson. But her past isn't far behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, one by one, the students of Osborne Hugh begin to die in a series of gruesome murders, each with increasingly grotesque flair. As the terror grows closer and her feelings for Ollie intensify, Makani is forced to confront her own dark secrets.</description>

  <description>Natasha: I’m a girl who believes in science and facts. Not fate. Not destiny. Or dreams that will never come true. I’m definitely not the kind of girl who meets a cute boy on a crowded New York City street and falls in love with him. Not when my family is twelve hours away from being deported to Jamaica. Falling in love with him won’t be my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel: I’ve always been the good son, the good student, living up to my parents’ high expectations. Never the poet. Or the dreamer. But when I see her, I forget about all that. Something about Natasha makes me think that fate has something much more extraordinary in store—for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Universe: Every moment in our lives has brought us to this single moment. A million futures lie before us. Which one will come true?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I wonder if for the rest of my life, I’ll be haunted by beautiful days.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one cloudless, radiant summer afternoon, Lake Devereaux lost everything. The car crash claimed the lives of her best friend and boyfriend, the people who had become her family after her own fell apart. But she doesn’t have to lose them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The development of resurrection technology has changed the world. Under the new laws regulating the process, each person gets one resurrection to be used or forfeited on their eighteenth birthday. Mere weeks away from turning eighteen, Lake faces an impossible choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Envisioning life without one of the people she loves most is shattering enough, but Lake carries an additional burden: years ago, under family pressure, Lake secretly—and illegally—promised her resurrection to someone who isn’t even dead yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search for answers about her future draws Lake more deeply into the secrets of her past until she begins to question everything about those closest to her. Betrayals and hurts both new and old threaten to eclipse the memories she once cherished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Lake meets a boy unlike anyone she’s encountered before, who unflinchingly embraces the darkest parts of her life . . . and who believes that all resurrections are wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which path is the right one? And how can Lake start to heal when she can't move on?</description>

It’s the perfect time for him to break out of his shell…to be the person he really, really wants to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth #2: Liam, Rob’s boyfriend, is nothing short of perfect. He’s everything Rob could have wanted. They’re perfect together. Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth #3: Mia has been Liam’s best friend for years…long before Rob came along. They get each other in a way Rob could never, will never, understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth #4: Galen, Mia’s boyfriend, is sweet, handsome, and incredibly charming. He’s the definition of a Golden Boy…even with the secrets up his sleeve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of these truths is a lie…and not everyone will live to find out which one it is.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Riley Collins has grown up in some of the world’s most dangerous cities, learning political strategies from her ambassador dad and defensive skills from his security chief. The only thing they didn’t prepare her for: life as an American teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an incident forces her to leave her Pakistani home, Riley is recruited by the State Department to attend Harrington Academy, one of the most elite boarding schools in Connecticut. The catch: she must use her tactical skills to covertly keep an eye on Hayden Frasier, the daughter of a tech billionaire whose new code-breaking spyware has the international intelligence community in an uproar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disturbing signs begin to appear that Riley’s assignment wasn’t the walk in the park she’d been promised. Now, Riley must fight for her life and Hayden’s, as those around her reveal themselves to be true friends or the ultimate betrayers.</description>

  <description>In 1984 Connecticut, sixteen-year-old Hannah Zandana feels cursed: She has wild, uncontrollable hair and a horrid complexion that she compulsively picks, and as if that weren't bad enough, her emotionally unavailable parents mercilessly ridicule her appearance and verbally shame her. &lt;br /&gt; Wanting to change her pathetic life, Hannah attempts to impress a group of popular girls--an ill-fated effort, except that it gets her the attention of Deacon, a handsome and mysterious boy who also happens to be her school's resident drug dealer. Suddenly, Hannah's life takes an unexpected detour into Deacon's dangerous and seductive world--but when her relationship and family unravel around her, she is forced to reexamine what she believes about herself and the people she trusts the most. First book in a duology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bronze recipient of the 2017 Moonbeam Children’s Book Awards and a USA Best Book Awards Finalist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Disclaimer: this book includes material that could be sensitive to some, including drugs/alcohol, emotional abuse, explicit language and sexual content.</description>

  <description>When the police started asking questions, Jean Taylor turned into a different woman. One who enabled her and her husband to carry on, when more bad things began to happen...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that woman’s husband died last week. And Jean doesn’t have to be her anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s a lot Jean hasn’t said over the years about the crime her husband was suspected of committing. She was too busy being the perfect wife, standing by her man while living with the accusing glares and the anonymous harassment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there’s no reason to stay quiet. There are people who want to hear her story. They want to know what it was like living with that man. She can tell them that there were secrets. There always are in a marriage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth—that’s all anyone wants. But the one lesson Jean has learned in the last few years is that she can make people believe anything…</description>

  <description>Juliet Young always writes letters to her mother, a world-traveling photojournalist. Even after her mother's death, she leaves letters at her grave. It's the only way Juliet can cope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Declan Murphy isn't the sort of guy you want to cross. In the midst of his court-ordered community service at the local cemetery, he's trying to escape the demons of his past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Declan reads a haunting letter left beside a grave, he can't resist writing back. Soon, he's opening up to a perfect stranger, and their connection is immediate. But neither Declan nor Juliet knows that they're not actually strangers. When life at school interferes with their secret life of letters, sparks will fly as Juliet and Declan discover truths that might tear them apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;First kisses sometimes wake slumbering princesses, undo spells, and spark happily ever afters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine broke Bale.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Snow has spent her life locked in Whittaker Psychiatric—but she isn’t crazy. And that’s not the worst of it. Her very first kiss proves anything but innocent…when Bale, her only love, turns violent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite Snow knowing that Bale would never truly hurt her, he is taken away—dashing her last hope for any sort of future in the mental ward she calls home. With nowhere else to turn, Snow finds herself drawn to a strange new orderly who whispers secrets in the night about a mysterious past and a kingdom that’s hers for the taking—if only she can find her way past the iron gates to the Tree that has been haunting her dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the Tree lies Algid, a land far away from the real world, frozen by a ruthless king. And there too await the River Witch, a village boy named Kai, the charming thief Jagger, and a prophecy that Snow will save them all.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I'm not crazy. I don't see what the big deal is about what happened. But apparently someone does think it's a big deal because here I am. I bet it was my mother. She always overreacts.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen-year-old Jeff wakes up on New Year's Day to find himself in the hospital. Make that the psychiatric ward. With the nutjobs. Clearly, this is all a huge mistake. Forget about the bandages on his wrists and the notes on his chart. Forget about his problems with his best friend, Allie, and her boyfriend, Burke. Jeff's perfectly fine, perfectly normal, not like the other kids in the hospital with him. Now they've got problems. But a funny thing happens as his forty-five-day sentence drags on: the crazies start to seem less crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compelling, witty, and refreshingly real, &lt;i&gt;Suicide Notes&lt;/i&gt; is a darkly humorous novel from award-winning author Michael Thomas Ford that examines that fuzzy line between "normal" and the rest of us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Flat-Out Love&lt;/i&gt; is a warm and witty novel of family love and dysfunction, deep heartache and raw vulnerability, with a bit of mystery and one whopping, knock-you-to-your-knees romance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's not what you know—or when you see—that matters. It's about a journey.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something is seriously off in the Watkins home. And Julie Seagle, college freshman, small-town Ohio transplant, and the newest resident of this Boston house, is determined to get to the bottom of it. When Julie's off-campus housing falls through, her mother's old college roommate, Erin Watkins, invites her to move in. The parents, Erin and Roger, are welcoming, but emotionally distant and academically driven to eccentric extremes. The middle child, Matt, is an MIT tech geek with a sweet side... and the social skills of a spool of USB cable. The youngest, Celeste, is a frighteningly bright but freakishly fastidious 13-year-old who hauls around a life-sized cardboard cutout of her oldest brother almost everywhere she goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there's that oldest brother, Finn: funny, gorgeous, smart, sensitive, almost emotionally available. Geographically? Definitely unavailable. That's because Finn is traveling the world and surfacing only for random Facebook chats, e-mails, and status updates. Before long, through late-night exchanges of disembodied text, he begins to stir something tender and silly and maybe even a little bit sexy in Julie's suddenly lonesome soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Julie, the emotionally scrambled members of the Watkins family add up to something that ... well... doesn't quite add up. Not until she forces a buried secret to the surface, eliciting a dramatic confrontation that threatens to tear the fragile Watkins family apart, does she get her answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Flat-Out Love comes complete with emails, Facebook status updates, and instant messages.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Once Upon a Time…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the kingdom of Tranen, a king makes a promise to his dying wife that he'll only remarry a woman who possesses her golden hair. In time, the king's eyes are turned by his daughter. Realizing her father’s intentions, Princess Aurelia tries to trick him by requesting impossible gifts: dresses created by the sun, moon and stars, and a coat made of a thousand furs. But when he is successful, Aurelia sacrifices her privileged life and flees her kingdom, disguised by the cloak and a new name, Allerleirauh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She enters the safe haven of Saarland der Licht, where the handsome and gentle Prince Klaus takes her under his care. Hoping not to be discovered by her father’s courtiers, Allerleirauh tries to remain hidden under her new identity when she finds unexpected love with Prince Klaus, even though his arranged marriage to the princess of a neighboring kingdom approaches. Risking everything, Allerleirauh must face her troubled past and her fears of the future along her journey to self-acceptance in this triumphant retelling of the classic Grimm Fairy Tale.</description>
