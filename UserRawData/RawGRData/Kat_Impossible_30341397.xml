  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the show's creators comes the groundbreaking novel inspired by the Broadway smash hit &lt;i&gt;Dear Evan Hansen&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Evan Hansen, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Today's going to be an amazing day and here's why...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a letter that was never meant to be seen by anyone draws high school senior Evan Hansen into a family's grief over the loss of their son, he is given the chance of a lifetime: to belong. He just has to stick to a lie he never meant to tell, that the notoriously troubled Connor Murphy was his secret best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, Evan isn't invisible anymore--even to the girl of his dreams. And Connor Murphy's parents, with their beautiful home on the other side of town, have taken him in like he was their own, desperate to know more about their enigmatic son from his closest friend. As Evan gets pulled deeper into their swirl of anger, regret, and confusion, he knows that what he's doing can't be right, but if he's helping people, how wrong can it be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No longer tangled in his once-incapacitating anxiety, this new Evan has a purpose. And a website. He's confident. He's a viral phenomenon. Every day is amazing. Until everything is in danger of unraveling and he comes face to face with his greatest obstacle: himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple lie leads to complicated truths in this big-hearted coming-of-age story of grief, authenticity and the struggle to belong in an age of instant connectivity and profound isolation.</description>

      <![CDATA[I am not 100% sure how to feel about this book. It was a very fast and easy read for me (which is disconcerting considering the theme of it all) and I enjoyed it overall, but I also understand why it wasn't for everyone. I think I connected to Evan's anxiety early on and liked the idea that this...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The hilarious and heartwarming new memoir from James Acaster: cult comedian, bestselling author, undercover cop, receiver of cabbages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January, 2017.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Acaster wakes hungover and alone in New York, his girlfriend having just left him. Thinking this is his rock bottom, little does James know that by the end of the year he will have befouled himself in a Los Angeles steakhouse and disrespected a pensioner on television. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, there is one thing he can rely on for comfort – music. In true Acaster fashion, this ends up with a completely unnecessary mission: to buy as much music as he can released in 2016, the year before everything went wrong (for James, at least). Some albums are life-changing masterpieces, others are ‘Howdilly Doodilly’ by Okilly Dokilly, a metalcore album devoted to The Simpsons character Ned Flanders. But all of them play a part in the year that James gets his life back on track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In PERFECT SOUND WHATEVER, James takes us through the music of 2016, the bullshit of 2017, and how the beauty of one defeated the ugliness of the other. He will also reveal how he stole a cookie from Clint Eastwood and attempted to complete his musical odyssey by reforming one of Kettering’s most overlooked bands.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The repercussions of an illicit affair unfold in this short story by bestselling author Taylor Jenkins Reid.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear stranger…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A desperate young woman in Southern California sits down to write a letter to a man she’s never met—a choice that will forever change both their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;My heart goes out to you, David. Even though I do not know you…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The correspondence between Carrie Allsop and David Mayer reveals, piece by piece, the painful details of a devastating affair between their spouses. With each commiserating scratch of the pen, they confess their fears and bare their souls. They share the bewilderment over how things went so wrong and come to wonder where to go from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told entirely through the letters of two comforting strangers and those of two illicit lovers, &lt;i&gt;Evidence of the Affair&lt;/i&gt; explores the complex nature of the heart. And ultimately, for one woman, how liberating it can be when it’s broken.</description>

  <description>James Acaster has been nominated for the &lt;b&gt;Edinburgh Comedy Award five times&lt;/b&gt; and has appeared on prime-time TV shows like &lt;b&gt;MOCK THE WEEK&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;LIVE AT THE APOLLO&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;RUSSELL HOWARD'S STAND UP CENTRAL&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But behind the fame and critical acclaim is a man perpetually getting into trouble. Whether it's disappointing a skydiving instructor mid-flight, hiding from thugs in a bush wearing a bright red dress, or annoying the Kettering Board Games club, a didgeridoo-playing conspiracy theorist and some bemused Christians, James is always finding new ways to embarrass himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearing on Josh Widdicombe's radio show to recount these stories, the feature was christened 'James Acaster's classic scrapes'. Here, in his first book, James recounts these tales (including never-before-heard stories) along with self-penned drawings, in all their glorious stupidity.</description>

      <![CDATA[I think James is hilarious and even though I knew some of the stories already, it was overall still a lot of fun to listen to. I enjoyed that James narrated the book himself and only spaced out very rarely (but it always happens with audiobooks, although I am getting better at paying attention).]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“A psychological thriller that captivated me from page one. What unfolds makes for a wild, page-turning ride! It’s the perfect beach read!”—Reese Witherspoon (Reese’s Book Club x Hello Sunshine book pick)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A shocking discovery on a honeymoon in paradise changes the lives of a picture-perfect couple in this taut psychological thriller debut--for readers of Ruth Ware, Paula Hawkins, and Shari Lapena.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you could make one simple choice that would change your life forever, would you? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erin is a documentary filmmaker on the brink of a professional breakthrough, Mark a handsome investment banker with big plans. Passionately in love, they embark on a dream honeymoon to the tropical island of Bora Bora, where they enjoy the sun, the sand, and each other. Then, while scuba diving in the crystal blue sea, they find something in the water. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Could the life of your dreams be the stuff of nightmares?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly the newlyweds must make a dangerous choice: to speak out or to protect their secret. After all, if no one else knows, who would be hurt? Their decision will trigger a devastating chain of events. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have you ever wondered how long it takes to dig a grave?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonder no longer.

      <![CDATA[This was an interesting first experience with an audiobook and I am not sure I am exactly made for it. However, Catherine Steadman is a fantastic narrator (it shines through that she is also an actress) and there were a couple nice twists and turns in the story. I did feel a little frustrated wit...]]>

  <description>"The body you are wearing used to be mine." So begins the letter Myfanwy Thomas is holding when she awakes in a London park surrounded by bodies all wearing latex gloves. With no recollection of who she is, Myfanwy must follow the instructions her former self left behind to discover her identity and track down the agents who want to destroy her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She soon learns that she is a Rook, a high-ranking member of a secret organization called the Chequy that battles the many supernatural forces at work in Britain. She also discovers that she possesses a rare, potentially deadly supernatural ability of her own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her quest to uncover which member of the Chequy betrayed her and why, Myfanwy encounters a person with four bodies, an aristocratic woman who can enter her dreams, a secret training facility where children are transformed into deadly fighters, and a conspiracy more vast than she ever could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with characters both fascinating and fantastical, &lt;i&gt;The Rook&lt;/i&gt; is a richly inventive, suspenseful, and often wry thriller that marks an ambitious debut from a promising young writer.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;K. Ancrum's &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;The Legend of the Golden Raven &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;novella, part fairy tale and part gritty reality, follows a boy as he descends into madness.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;August and Jack weren’t meant to be friends. One is a misfit with a pyro streak and the other a golden boy on the rugby team. But as their relationship intensifies, Jack slowly begins to lose his mind—taking readers on an intimate journey into the fantasy kingdom creeping into the edges of his world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the novella moves back and forth between a medieval legend and our own, contemporary world, nothing is as it seems. The boys alienate everyone around them as they struggle with their sanity and as Jack’s quest to fulfill a dark prophecy begins to consume them both . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devour this companion novella to &lt;i&gt;The Wicker King&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;An ImprintBook&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>When August learns that his best friend, Jack, shows signs of degenerative hallucinatory disorder, he is determined to help Jack cope. Jack’s vivid and long-term visions take the form of an elaborate fantasy world layered over our own—a world ruled by the Wicker King. As Jack leads them on a quest to fulfill a dark prophecy in this alternate world, even August begins to question what is real or not. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August and Jack struggle to keep afloat as they teeter between fantasy and their own emotions. In the end, each must choose his own truth.</description>

      <![CDATA[Actual rating: 3.5 stars<br /><br />Aside from the beautiful aesthetic this book offers, the story hurt and was so soft at the same time. I can't give this a higher rating because there were just parts that I couldn't connect to more (it's a me thing), but I am still glad I read it.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;With starry Texas nights, red candy suckers, and Dolly Parton songs, &lt;i&gt;Dumplin'&lt;/i&gt; is guaranteed to steal your heart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Self-proclaimed fat girl Willowdean Dickson (dubbed "Dumplin'" by her former beauty queen mom) has always been at home in her own skin. Her thoughts on having the ultimate bikini body? Put a bikini on your body. With her all-American-beauty best friend, Ellen, by her side, things have always worked . . . until Will takes a job at Harpy's, the local fast-food joint. There she meets Private School Bo, a hot former jock. Will isn't surprised to find herself attracted to Bo. But she &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; surprised when he seems to like her back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of finding new heights of self-assurance in her relationship with Bo, Will starts to doubt herself. So she sets out to take back her confidence by doing the most horrifying thing she can imagine: entering the Miss Clover City beauty pageant--along with several other unlikely candidates--to show the world that she deserves to be up there as much as any girl does. Along the way, she'll shock the hell out of Clover City--and maybe herself most of all.</description>

  <description>Abends in Alis Kiez-Späti, wenn das Spiel läuft und Ben im Kreise seiner Freunde ist, scheint die Welt in Ordnung, aber an allen anderen Fronten muss der junge Berliner Rückschläge einstecken. Bens IT-Job ist eine Sackgasse, seine eigentliche Leidenschaft, das Zeichnen, bereitet ihm auch keine Freude mehr und wegen seiner chronisch trüben Laune hat seine Freundin das Weite gesucht. Wie der ewig gestrafte Sisyphos, der in jedem von Bens Bildern auftaucht, müht er sich mit seinem ziellosen Alltag ab, bis jede Pore sei­nes Körpers nach Veränderung schreit. Aber sich selbst neu zu erfinden, ist selbst in Berlin, wo die Inspiration an jeder Ecke wartet, keine leichte Aufgabe ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mit viel Selbstironie und einem virtuosen Strich erzählt der deutsch-iranische Zeichner Hamed Eshrat in seinem Deutschland-Debüt eine char­mante, beinah alltägliche Großstadtgeschichte, die nicht nur wegen plattensammelnder Kiezhelden und gebrochener Herzen an Nick Horn­bys High Fidelity erinnert. Zeitgleich ist Eshrats Venustransit ein elegantes Portrait des modernen Berlins, das zwischen Easyjet-Touristen und Gentrifizierung um seine Freiräume kämpft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Man will den Comic nicht mehr aus der Hand geben, bevor man ihn zu Ende gelesen hat."&lt;br /&gt;(David Basler, Verlag Edition Moderne und Juror des Comicbuchpreises der Berthold Leibinger Stiftung)</description>

  <description>In a small French town, an unusual kind of mass is held: the local priest, Dunant, describes it as “faith healing”, promising those who are suffering will be healed of their ailments with just a single touch of his hands. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ionel, a pianist with albinism, seeks out Dunant‘s miraculous touch. He struggles with his failing eyesight, a condition that could potentially put an end to his career. Something about the priest’s blessing soon strikes him as odd, and so Ionel begins investigating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ionel uncovers several clues that draw him deeper into the mystery surrounding Dunant. As he starts to slowly befriend the priest, he finds himself delving further into a world of miracles and curses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written and drawn by the artist-/illustrator-duo Eli Baum and Viv Tanner, the comic has been self-published since 2016.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Longlisted for the National Book Award for Young People's Literature!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;USA Today &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author of the Shatter Me series comes a powerful, heartrending contemporary novel about&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; fear, first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; love, and the devastating impact of prejudice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s 2002, a year after 9/11. It’s an extremely turbulent time politically, but especially so for someone like Shirin, a sixteen-year-old Muslim girl who’s tired of being stereotyped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirin is never surprised by how horrible people can be. She’s tired of the rude stares, the degrading comments—even the physical violence—she endures as a result of her race, her religion, and the hijab she wears every day. So she’s built up protective walls and refuses to let anyone close enough to hurt her. Instead, she drowns her frustrations in music and spends her afternoons break-dancing with her brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then she meets Ocean James. He’s the first person in forever who really seems to want to get to know Shirin. It terrifies her—they seem to come from two irreconcilable worlds—and Shirin has had her guard up for so long that she’s not sure she’ll ever be able to let it down.</description>

  <description>Echo Alkaev’s safe and carefully structured world falls apart when her father leaves for the city and mysteriously disappears. Believing he is lost forever, Echo is shocked to find him half-frozen in the winter forest six months later, guarded by a strange talking wolf—the same creature who attacked her as a child. The wolf presents Echo with an ultimatum: If she lives with him for one year, he will ensure her father makes it home safely. But there is more to the wolf than Echo realizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his enchanted house beneath a mountain, each room must be sewn together to keep the home from unraveling, and something new and dark and strange lies behind every door. When centuries-old secrets unfold, Echo discovers a magical library full of books-turned-mirrors, and a young man named Hal who is trapped inside of them. As the year ticks by, the rooms begin to disappear, and Echo must solve the mystery of the wolf’s enchantment before her time is up, otherwise Echo, the wolf, and Hal will be lost forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NICK HORNBY'S HILARIOUS INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER IS NOW A MAJOR FILM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'A comic delight'&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Evening Standard &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_____________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie's put fifteen years into safe, slightly obsessive Duncan, and now she'd like her money back, please. It's time to move on. But she lives in Gooleness, the north's answer to a question nobody asked. Is she really going to find real, proper, feel-it-deep-down-in-your-boots love on a damp and windy seafront? Or perhaps she should follow her heart and pursue Tucker, the reclusive American rock star, who keeps emailing her his smart advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But between Annie and her second chance lie a few obstacles. There's Malcolm, the world's most judgemental therapist, and Barnesy, the north's most extrovert dancer. There's what men and women will do and won't do for love. And, of course, there's Tucker. . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hilarious and tender, this bestselling novel will move you in ways both profound and surprising. It's Nick Hornby at his brilliant best. If you like David Nicholls, David Sedaris and Jonathan Coe you will love this book. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Ingenious, funny and moving' &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Sharply funny, touching'&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Pitch-perfect' &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Observer&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Overall this was a very average read. I liked some of the themes discussed in the book and I think it's great to show that people who have messed up big time don't necessarily have to be evil or crazy. But still, the story could have been a lot more. Maybe I expected too much, but the ending felt...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Branches and stones, daggers and bones,&lt;br /&gt;They locked the Beast away.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the death of her sister, seventeen-year-old Violet Saunders finds herself dragged to Four Paths, New York. Violet may be a newcomer, but she soon learns her mother isn't: They belong to one of the revered founding families of the town, where stone bells hang above every doorway and danger lurks in the depths of the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justin Hawthorne's bloodline has protected Four Paths for generations from the Gray—a lifeless dimension that imprisons a brutal monster. After Justin fails to inherit his family's powers, his mother is determined to keep this humiliation a secret. But Justin can't let go of the future he was promised and the town he swore to protect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since Harper Carlisle lost her hand to an accident that left her stranded in the Gray for days, she has vowed revenge on the person who abandoned her: Justin Hawthorne. There are ripples of dissent in Four Paths, and Harper seizes an opportunity to take down the Hawthornes and change her destiny-to what extent, even she doesn't yet know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gray is growing stronger every day, and its victims are piling up. When Violet accidentally unleashes the monster, all three must band together with the other Founders to unearth the dark truths behind their families' abilities—before the Gray devours them all.</description>

  <description>Five years ago, Evelyn and Philippa Hapwell cowered from air strikes in a London bomb shelter. But that night took a turn when the sisters were transported to another realm called the Woodlands. In a forest kingdom populated by creatures out of myth and legend, they found temporary refuge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they finally returned to London, nothing had changed at all—nothing, except themselves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Ev spends her days sneaking into the woods outside her boarding school, wishing for the Woodlands. Overcome with longing, she is desperate to return no matter what it takes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philippa, on the other hand, is determined to find a place in this world. She shields herself behind a flawless exterior and countless friends, and moves to America to escape the memory of what was. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Evelyn goes missing, Philippa must confront the depth of her sister’s despair and the painful truths they’ve been running from. As the weeks unfold, Philippa wonders if Ev truly did find a way home, or if the weight of their worlds pulled her under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Content Warnings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Light Between Worlds portrays characters dealing with depression, self-harm, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation, illness and disordered eating, and the loss of a loved one. It refers to possible suicide, contains scenes of violence and war, and brief mentions may be unsettling to readers with emetophobia. If you have any questions about these warnings, or require more details, please don’t hesitate to get in touch via the contact page on the author's website.</description>

  <description>When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed. Something alarming enough to make her parents lock her in the garage and call the police. Something that gets her sent to Thurmond, a brutal government “rehabilitation camp.” She might have survived the mysterious disease that’s killed most of America’s children, but she and the others have emerged with something far worse: frightening abilities they cannot control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now sixteen, Ruby is one of the dangerous ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the truth comes out, Ruby barely escapes Thurmond with her life. Now she’s on the run, desperate to find the one safe haven left for kids like her—East River. She joins a group of kids who escaped their own camp. Liam, their brave leader, is falling hard for Ruby. But no matter how much she aches for him, Ruby can’t risk getting close. Not after what happened to her parents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they arrive at East River, nothing is as it seems, least of all its mysterious leader. But there are other forces at work, people who will stop at nothing to use Ruby in their fight against the government. Ruby will be faced with a terrible choice, one that may mean giving up her only chance at a life worth living.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;**THE BRILLIANT &amp;amp; IRREVERENT DEBUT FROM AWARD-WINNING COMEDIAN JOE LYCETT (&lt;i&gt;8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Taskmaster&lt;/i&gt;), NOW IN PAPERBACK**&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;'Joe is nothing short of hilarious' SARAH MILLICAN&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;'I Lycett, I Lycett a lot' HARRY HILL&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;'We were snorting with laughter like a happy pig throughout. Lots more of the same please Joe! 5*s' &lt;i&gt;HEAT &lt;/i&gt;MAGAZINE&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;* * * * * *&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Dear Reader,&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Life is hard. We are a bombarded generation: Facebook, billboards, Twitter, Instagram, taxes, newspapers, watches monitoring our sleep, apps that read our pulse, terrorism. There's such an onslaught to the senses these days it's a marvel any of us manage to get out of bed. I love bed.&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;While we are overwhelmed and confused by the miasmic cloud of information, there are those that seek to take advantage: there are parking fines, hate Tweets, Nigerian email scams and Christmas newsletters from old school friends about their ugly kids. And just as we're getting round to doing something about it, we're distracted again.&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I, Joe Lycett, comedian, wordsmith, and professional complainer, am here to help. During my short life of doing largely nothing I've discovered solutions to many of life's problems, which I impart to you, dear Reader. Containing a centurion of complaint letters to unsuspecting celebrities, companies and anyone brave enough to clog up my phone, as well as illustrations, one-liners , jokes and life hacks, this little gem offers you a collection of tips and advice* for all manner of modern woe. By the time you have finished reading this book you will have learnt how to:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;- Reverse a parking fine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;- Manipulate the tabloid press&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;- Navigate social media&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;- Respond to hate mail&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;- Out-weird internet trolls&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;- Contest a so-called ripe avocado&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;- Send the perfect Christmas newsletter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;- Defeat ISIS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;- Take down multi-national companies&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;AND MUCH, MUCH MORE!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Joe Lycett x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* If you are looking for guidance with taxes, quitting smoking, moving house, love, divorce, education, healthcare or anything actually important may I recommend speaking to friends or family members and not consulting a book by a comedian who eats halloumi at least twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Jenny Cavanaugh, the ghostly lady of 926 Augur Lane, has enlisted the investigative services of her fellow residents to solve a decade-old murder—her own. Abigail Rook and her eccentric employer, Detective R. F. Jackaby, dive into the cold case, starting with a search for Jenny’s fiancé, who went missing the night she died. But when a new, gruesome murder closely mirrors the events of ten years prior, Abigail and Jackaby realize that Jenny’s case isn’t so cold after all, and her killer may be far more dangerous than they suspected.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fantasy and folklore mix with mad science as Abigail’s race to unravel the mystery leads her across the cold cobblestones of nineteenth-century New England, down to the mythical underworld, and deep into her colleagues’ grim histories to battle the most deadly foe she has ever faced.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Valiant's most demanded hero steps out of &lt;i&gt;Harbinger&lt;/i&gt; and into an all-new miniseries adventure!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orphaned at a young age, Faith Herbert - a psionically gifted "psiot" discovered by the Harbinger Foundation - has always aspired to greatness. But now this once ordinary teenager is taking control of her destiny and becoming the hard-hitting hero she's always known she can be - complete with a mild-mannered secret identity, unsuspecting colleagues, and a day job as a reporter that routinely throws into her harms way! Well, at least she thought it would When she's not typing up listicles about cat videos, Faith makes a secret transformation to patrol the night as the City of Angels' own leading superhero - the sky-soaring Zephyr!&lt;br /&gt;But flying solo is going to be tougher than she ever thought when Zephyr uncovers a deep-rooted alien conspiracy. Two-bit burglars and car thieves are one thing, but when the world needs a hero to stave off an full-blown extraterrestrial invasion, will Faith find herself in over her head or ready for her biggest challenge yet?&lt;br /&gt;Rising star Jody Houser (&lt;i&gt;Orphan Black&lt;/i&gt;) and explosive artists Francis Portela (&lt;i&gt;Green Lantern&lt;/i&gt;) and Marguerite Sauvage (&lt;i&gt;DC Comics Bombshells&lt;/i&gt;) pilot a new chapter for the high-flying hero that People Magazine calls "a superhero we can all admire."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Collecting&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Faith&lt;/i&gt; 1-4</description>

But his murderous past is about to catch up with him, and there are a few things about Marcus that even his friends don’t know. Secrets that threaten the lives of everyone around him.

  <description>It’s 1987. Marcus Lopez hates school. His grades suck. The jocks are hassling his friends. He can’t focus in class. But the jocks are the children of Joseph Stalin’s top assassin, the teachers are members of an ancient league of assassins, the class he's failing is “Dismemberment 101,” and his crush has a double-digit body count. Welcome to the most brutal high school on earth, where the world’s top crime families send the next generation of assassins to be trained. Murder is an art. Killing is a craft. At Kings Dominion School for the Deadly Arts, the dagger in your back isn’t always metaphorical. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collecting the first arc of the most critically acclaimed new series of 2014, by writer RICK REMENDER (BLACK SCIENCE, Fear Agent) and rising star artist WESLEY CRAIG (Batman). Experience the 1980s underground through the eyes of the world’s most damaged and dangerous teenagers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collects DEADLY CLASS #1-6.</description>

  <description>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before is the story of Lara Jean, who has never openly admitted her crushes, but instead wrote each boy a letter about how she felt, sealed it, and hid it in a box under her bed. But one day Lara Jean discovers that somehow her secret box of letters has been mailed, causing all her crushes from her past to confront her about the letters: her first kiss, the boy from summer camp, even her sister's ex-boyfriend, Josh. As she learns to deal with her past loves face to face, Lara Jean discovers that something good may come out of these letters after all.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I've found very little about private detective R. F. Jackaby to be standard in the time I've known him. Working as his assistant tends to call for a somewhat flexible relationship with reality . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1892, New Fiddleham, New England, things are never quite what they seem, especially when Abigail Rook and her eccentric employer, R. F. Jackaby, are called upon to investigate the supernatural. First, members of a particularly vicious species of shape-shifters disguise themselves as a litter of kittens. A day later, their owner is found murdered, with a single mysterious puncture wound to her neck. Then, in nearby Gad's Valley, dinosaur bones from a recent dig go missing, and an unidentifiable beast attacks animals and people, leaving their mangled bodies behind. Policeman Charlie Cane, exiled from New Fiddleham to the valley, calls on Abigail for help, and soon Abigail and Jackaby are on the hunt for a thief, a monster, and a murderer.</description>

      <![CDATA[It took me a while to get back into this world, but gladly this was still a very fast read. It feels different to the original trilogy and I think I sometimes was more annoyed with characters than before, but I love some of the new additions to the cast! I will post a full review on the blog soon...]]>

  <description>Greece in the age of heroes. Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the court of King Peleus and his perfect son Achilles. Despite their difference, Achilles befriends the shamed prince, and as they grow into young men skilled in the arts of war and medicine, their bond blossoms into something deeper - despite the displeasure of Achilles' mother Thetis, a cruel sea goddess. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, Achilles must go to war in distant Troy and fulfill his destiny. Torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus goes with him, little knowing that the years that follow will test everything they hold dear.</description>

  <description>Kady, Ezra, Hanna, and Nik narrowly escaped with their lives from the attacks on Heimdall station and now find themselves crammed with 2,000 refugees on the container ship, Mao. With the jump station destroyed and their resources scarce, the only option is to return to Kerenza—but who knows what they'll find seven months after the invasion? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Kady's cousin, Asha, survived the initial BeiTech assault and has joined Kerenza's ragtag underground resistance. When Rhys—an old flame from Asha's past—reappears on Kerenza, the two find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With time running out, a final battle will be waged on land and in space, heroes will fall, and hearts will be broken.</description>

  <description>Now a series on Freeform, formerly ABC Family, starring Bella Thorne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A must-read for anyone curious about life and love behind the scenes."--Bella Thorne, actor and author of Autumn Falls&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Paige Townsen gets plucked from high school obscurity to star in the movie adaptation of a blockbuster book series, her life changes practically overnight. Within a month, Paige has traded the quiet streets of her hometown for a bustling film set on the shores of Maui, and she is spending quality time with her costar Rainer Devon, one of People's Sexiest Men Alive. But when troubled star Jordan Wilder lands the role of the other point in the movie's famous love triangle, Paige's crazy new life begins to resemble her character's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this exciting tale of romance and drama, both on-and offscreen, Paige must adjust to a crazy new life without the daily support of her friends and family, while figuring out who she is--and who she wants--as the whole world watches.</description>

  <description>Tess is the 22-year-old narrator of this stunning first novel. Moving to New York, a place at the centre of the universe, from a place that feels like 'nowhere to live', she lands a job at a renowned Union Square restaurant and begins to navigate the chaotic and punishing life of a waiter, on and off duty. As her appetites awaken - not just for food and wine but also for knowledge and friendship - Tess becomes helplessly drawn into a dark, alluring love triangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweetbitter is a novel of the senses. Of taste and hunger, of love and desire, and the wisdom that comes from our experiences, both sweet and bitter.</description>

  <description>"To give them hope she must tell their story"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The war is over. Juliet Ashton is grappling with writer's block when she receives a letter from Dawsey Adams of Guernsey - a total stranger living halfway across the Channel, who has come across her name written in a second-hand book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliet begins writing to Dawsey, and in time to everyone in the extraordinary Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. The society tell Juliet about life on the island - and the dark years spent under the shadow of German occupation. Drawn into their irresistible world, Juliet sets sail for Guernsey, changing her life - and theirs - forever.</description>

  <description>Raw, captivating, and undeniably real, Nic Stone joins industry giants Jason Reynolds and Walter Dean Myers as she boldly tackles American race relations in this stunning debut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justyce McAllister is top of his class and set for the Ivy League—but none of that matters to the police officer who just put him in handcuffs. And despite leaving his rough neighborhood behind, he can't escape the scorn of his former peers or the ridicule of his new classmates. Justyce looks to the teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for answers. But do they hold up anymore? He starts a journal to Dr. King to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then comes the day Justyce goes driving with his best friend, Manny, windows rolled down, music turned up—way up, sparking the fury of a white off-duty cop beside them. Words fly. Shots are fired. Justyce and Manny are caught in the crosshairs. In the media fallout, it's Justyce who is under attack.</description>

  <description>Scarlett Dragna has never left the tiny island where she and her sister, Tella, live with their powerful, and cruel, father. Now Scarlett’s father has arranged a marriage for her, and Scarlett thinks her dreams of seeing Caraval—the faraway, once-a-year performance where the audience participates in the show—are over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this year, Scarlett’s long-dreamt-of invitation finally arrives. With the help of a mysterious sailor, Tella whisks Scarlett away to the show. Only, as soon as they arrive, Tella is kidnapped by Caraval’s mastermind organizer, Legend. It turns out that this season’s Caraval revolves around Tella, and whoever finds her first is the winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scarlett has been told that everything that happens during Caraval is only an elaborate performance. Nevertheless she becomes enmeshed in a game of love, heartbreak, and magic.</description>

  <description>Area X has been cut off from the rest of the continent for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; the second expedition ended in mass suicide, the third expedition in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another. The members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within weeks, all had died of cancer. In &lt;i&gt;Annihilation&lt;/i&gt;, the first volume of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach trilogy, we join the twelfth expedition.&lt;br /&gt; The group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, record all observations of their surroundings and of one anotioner, and, above all, avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.&lt;br /&gt; They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers--they discover a massive topographic anomaly and life forms that surpass understanding--but it's the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Katie Price has a rare disease that makes exposure to even the smallest amount of sunlight deadly. Confined to her house during the day, her company is limited to her widowed father and her best (okay, only) friend. It isn't until after nightfall that Katie's world opens up, when she takes her guitar to the local train station and plays for the people coming and going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie Reed is a former all-star athlete at a crossroads in his life - and the boy Katie has secretly admired from afar for years. When he happens upon her playing guitar one night, fate intervenes and the two embark on a star-crossed romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they challenge each other to chase their dreams and fall for each other under the summer night sky, Katie and Charlie form a bond strong enough to change them - and everyone around them - forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling series!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this breathless third installment to Victoria Aveyard’s #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling Red Queen series, rebellion is rising and allegiances will be tested on every side. Perfect for fans of George R.R. Martin’s Game of Thrones series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mare Barrow is a prisoner, powerless without her lightning, tormented by her lethal mistakes. She lives at the mercy of a boy she once loved, a boy made of lies and betrayal. Now a king, Maven Calore continues weaving his dead mother's web in an attempt to maintain control over his country—and his prisoner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Mare bears the weight of Silent Stone in the palace, her once-ragtag band of newbloods and Reds continue organizing, training, and expanding. They prepare for war, no longer able to linger in the shadows. And Cal, the exiled prince with his own claim on Mare's heart, will stop at nothing to bring her back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When blood turns on blood, and ability on ability, there may be no one left to put out the fire—leaving Norta as Mare knows it to burn all the way down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And don’t miss &lt;em&gt;Broken Throne: A Red Queen Collection&lt;/em&gt;, featuring three brand-new novellas and other exclusive content, coming in April!&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Die Beziehung von Joana und Valentin ist am Tiefpunkt angelangt, und die hilflosen Versuche des Paartherapeuten, die beiden Streithähne in den Griff zu kriegen, sind zwar unterhaltsam - aber anscheinend ganz und gar nicht erfolgreich. Joana weiß eigentlich immer schon vorher, was ihr Ehemann sagen will, und sorgt mit ihrem Redeschwall obendrein dafür, dass er oft gar nicht erst zu Wort kommt. Valentin straft sie dafür mit Gefühlskälte und leidenschaftsloser Ignoranz. Er nimmt die Missstände offenbar als gegeben hin und sieht keinen Grund für große Veränderungen, wodurch sich Joana nur noch mehr provoziert fühlt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doch nicht nur Joana und Valentin haben ein Problem – auch der Therapeut selbst scheint in gröberen Schwierigkeiten zu stecken. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Die Wunderübung&lt;/i&gt; erweist sich Daniel Glattauer ein weiteres Mal als ein Meister darin, die feinen Zwischentöne im Dschungel unserer Gefühle darzustellen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Trevor Noah’s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents’ indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa’s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man’s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother—his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stories collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother’s unconventional, unconditional love.&lt;br /&gt;--randomhousebooks.com</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;They call him father, liberator, warlord, Reaper. But he feels a boy as he falls toward the pale blue planet, his armor red, his army vast, his heart heavy. It is the tenth year of war and the thirty-second of his life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A decade ago, Darrow was the hero of the revolution he believed would break the chains of the Society. But the Rising has shattered everything: Instead of peace and freedom, it has brought endless war. Now he must risk everything he has fought for on one last desperate mission.

Witness the beginning of a stunning new saga of tragedy and triumph from masterly &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Pierce Brown.</description>

  <description>Genie Lo is one among droves of Ivy-hopeful overachievers in her sleepy Bay Area suburb. You know, the type who &lt;i&gt;wins&lt;/i&gt;. When she’s not crushing it at volleyball or hitting the books, Genie is typically working on how to crack the elusive Harvard entry code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when her hometown comes under siege from hellspawn straight out of Chinese folklore, her priorities are dramatically rearranged. Enter Quentin Sun, a mysterious new kid in class who becomes Genie’s self-appointed guide to battling demons. While Genie knows Quentin only as an attractive transfer student with an oddly formal command of the English language, in another reality he is Sun Wukong, the mythological Monkey King incarnate—right down to the furry tale and penchant for peaches.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, acing the SATs is the least of Genie’s worries. The fates of her friends, family, and the entire Bay Area all depend on her summoning an inner power that Quentin assures her is strong enough to level the very gates of Heaven. But every second Genie spends tapping into the secret of her true nature is a second in which the lives of her loved ones hang in the balance.</description>

  <description>If you were told the date of your death, how would it shape your present?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1969 in New York City's Lower East Side, and word has spread of the arrival of a mystical woman, a traveling psychic who claims to be able to tell anyone the day they will die. The Gold children—four adolescents on the cusp of self-awareness—sneak out to hear their fortunes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their prophecies inform their next five decades. Golden-boy Simon escapes to the West Coast, searching for love in '80s San Francisco; dreamy Klara becomes a Las Vegas magician, obsessed with blurring reality and fantasy; eldest son Daniel seeks security as an army doctor post-9/11, hoping to control fate; and bookish Varya throws herself into longevity research, where she tests the boundary between science and immortality.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A three-time winner of Goodreads Choice Awards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter moves between two worlds: the poor neighborhood where she lives and the fancy suburban prep school she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Khalil was unarmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some are calling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters are taking to the streets in Khalil’s name. Some cops and the local drug lord try to intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what really went down that night? And the only person alive who can answer that is Starr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Starr does—or does not—say could upend her community. It could also endanger her life.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Call Me by Your Name&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a sudden and powerful romance that blossoms between an adolescent boy and a summer guest at his parents' cliffside mansion on the Italian Riviera. Each is unprepared for the consequences of their attraction when, during the restless summer weeks, unrelenting currents of obsession, fascination, and desire intensify their passion and test the charged ground between them. Recklessly, the two verge toward the one thing both fear they may never truly find again: total intimacy.</description>

  <description>“Internetainers” Rhett &amp;amp; Link met in first grade when their teacher made them miss recess for writing profanity on their desks, and they have been best friends ever since. Today, their daily YouTube talk show, Good Mythical Morning, is the most-watched daily talk show on the Internet, and nearly 12 million subscribers tune in to see the guys broadcast brainy trivia, wild experiments, and hilarious banter (not to mention the occasional cereal bath). Now the award-winning comedians are finally bringing their “Mythical” world to the printed page in their first book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hilarious blend of autobiography, trivia, and advice, Rhett &amp;amp; Link's Book of Mythicality: A Field Guide to Curiosity, Creativity, and Tomfoolery will offer twenty ways to add “Mythicality” to your life, including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eat Something That Scares You&lt;br /&gt;Make a Bold Hair Choice&lt;br /&gt;Invent Something Ridiculous&lt;br /&gt;Say “I Love You” Like It's Never Been Said&lt;br /&gt;Speak at Your Own Funeral&lt;br /&gt;The goal of these offbeat prompts? To learn new things, laugh more often, and earn a few grown-up merit badges along the way. Heartfelt and completely original, this book will be the perfect gift for anyone looking for a fresh dose of humor and fun.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Love speaks in flowers. Truth requires thorns.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel to a world of dark bargains struck by moonlight, of haunted towns and hungry woods, of talking beasts and gingerbread golems, where a young mermaid's voice can summon deadly storms and where a river might do a lovestruck boy's bidding but only for a terrible price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by myth, fairy tale, and folklore, #1 New York Times–bestselling author Leigh Bardugo has crafted a deliciously atmospheric collection of short stories filled with betrayals, revenge, sacrifice, and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for new readers and dedicated fans, these tales will transport you to lands both familiar and strange—to a fully realized world of dangerous magic that millions have visited through the novels of the Grishaverse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This collection of six stories includes three brand-new tales, all of them lavishly illustrated with art that changes with each turn of the page, culminating in six stunning full-spread illustrations as rich in detail as the stories themselves.</description>

  <description>As a child, Rose Franklin made an astonishing discovery: a giant metallic hand, buried deep within the earth. As an adult, she’s dedicated her brilliant scientific career to solving the mystery that began that fateful day: Why was a titanic robot of unknown origin buried in pieces around the world? Years of investigation have produced intriguing answers—and even more perplexing questions. But the truth is closer than ever before when a second robot, more massive than the first, materializes and lashes out with deadly force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now humankind faces a nightmare invasion scenario made real, as more colossal machines touch down across the globe. But Rose and her team at the Earth Defense Corps refuse to surrender. They can turn the tide if they can unlock the last secrets of an advanced alien technology. The greatest weapon humanity wields is knowledge in a do-or-die battle to inherit the Earth . . . and maybe even the stars.</description>

  <description>For Ta-Nehisi Coates, history has always been personal. At every stage of his life, he's sought in his explorations of history answers to the mysteries that surrounded him -- most urgently, why he, and other black people he knew, seemed to live in fear. What were they afraid of? Coates takes readers along on his journey through America's history of race and its contemporary resonances through a series of awakenings -- moments when he discovered some new truth about our long, tangled history of race, whether through his myth-busting professors at Howard University, a trip to a Civil War battlefield with a rogue historian, a journey to Chicago's South Side to visit aging survivors of 20th century America's 'long war on black people,' or a visit with the mother of a beloved friend who was shot down by the police. In his trademark style -- a mix of lyrical personal narrative, reimagined history, essayistic argument, and reportage -- Coates provides readers a thrillingly illuminating new framework for understanding race: its history, our contemporary dilemma, and where we go from here.</description>

  <description>A new era begins for the Black Panther! MacArthur Genius and National Book Award-winning writer T-Nehisi Coates (BETWEEN THE WORLD AND ME) takes the helm, confronting T'Challa with a dramatic upheaval in Wakanda that will make leading the African nation tougher than ever before. When a superhuman terrorist group that calls itself The People sparks a violent uprising, the land famed for its incredible technology and proud warrior traditions will be thrown into turmoil. If Wakanda is to survive, it must adapt--but can its monarch, one in a long line of Black Panthers, survive the necessary change? Heavy lies the head that wears the cowl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLLECTING:&lt;/strong&gt; Black Panther 1-4, Fantastic Four (1961) 52</description>

  <description>K-I-S-S-I-N-G! That’s just one of the things that makes this a very modern Marvel team-up, as the two most sensational web-spinners of the 21st century cross paths — and lock lips! Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy are two young heroes from different Earths, but what threat could unite the Spider-Man and Spider-Woman of the new generation? The answer will rock both their worlds! Not for the first time, Miles will find himself in another universe — and he’s in pursuit of someone he holds dear. But will that description soon apply to Gwen? Or, as the stakes are raised, will this spider-crossed pair see teen romance give way to arachnid animosity? First comes love, then comes much worse, then comes chaos in the Multiverse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collecting:&lt;/b&gt; SPIDER-MAN (2016) #12-14 and SPIDER-GWEN (2015B) #16-18.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Saints and Misfits&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable debut novel that feels like a modern day My So-Called Life…starring a Muslim teen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much can you tell about a person just by looking at them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Janna Yusuf knows a lot of people can’t figure out what to make of her…an Arab Indian-American hijabi teenager who is a Flannery O’Connor obsessed book nerd, aspiring photographer, and sometime graphic novelist is not exactly easy to put into a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Janna suddenly finds herself caring what people think. Or at least what a certain boy named Jeremy thinks. Not that she would ever date him—Muslim girls don’t date. Or they shouldn’t date. Or won’t? Janna is still working all this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While her heart might be leading her in one direction, her mind is spinning in others. She is trying to decide what kind of person she wants to be, and what it means to be a saint, a misfit, or a monster. Except she knows a monster…one who happens to be parading around as a saint…Will she be the one to call him out on it? What will people in her tightknit Muslim community think of her then?</description>

      <![CDATA[4.5 stars for this one. I did not love the art of every single issue, but the story was solid throughout. Clark becoming himself and Superman in the process was a real feast. Also, the fact that my copy is signed makes it kinda double special.]]>

  <description>Charlie Grant’s older sister is getting married this weekend at their family home, and Charlie can’t wait—for the first time in years, all four of her older siblings will be under one roof. Charlie is desperate for one last perfect weekend, before the house is sold and everything changes. The house will be filled with jokes and games and laughs again. Making decisions about things like what college to attend and reuniting with longstanding crush Jesse Foster—all that can wait. She wants to focus on making the weekend perfect.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only problem? The weekend is shaping up to be an absolute disaster.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s the unexpected dog with a penchant for howling, house alarm that won’t stop going off, and a papergirl with a grudge.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are the relatives who aren’t speaking, the (awful) girl her favorite brother brought home unannounced, and a missing tuxedo.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the neighbor who seems to be bent on sabotage and a storm that is bent on drenching everything. The justice of the peace is missing. The band will only play covers. The guests are all crazy. And the wedding planner’s nephew is unexpectedly, distractingly…cute.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Over the course of three ridiculously chaotic days, Charlie will learn more than she ever expected about the family she thought she knew by heart. And she’ll realize that sometimes, trying to keep everything like it was in the past means missing out on the future.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Power corrupts. Magic kills.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eighteen-year-old Jemmie Carmichael is surrounded by magic in the quiet town of Hawthorne, New York. In her world, magic users are called “kindled,” and Jemmie would count herself among them if only she could cast a simple spell without completely falling apart. It doesn't help that she was also recently snubbed by Crowe—the dangerous and enigmatic leader of Hawthorne’s kindled motorcycle gang, the Devils’ League.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the entire kindled community rolls into Hawthorne for an annual festival, a rumor spreads that someone is practicing forbidden magic. Then people start to go missing. With threats closing in from every side, no one can be trusted. Jemmie and Crowe will have to put aside their tumultuous history to find their loved ones, and the only thing that might save them is the very flaw that keeps Jemmie from fully harnessing her magic. For all her years of feeling useless, Jemmie may just be the most powerful kindled of all.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“Miss Rook, I am not an occultist,” Jackaby said. “I have a gift that allows me to see truth where others see the illusion--and there are many illusions. All the world’s a stage, as they say, and I seem to have the only seat in the house with a view behind the curtain.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newly arrived in New Fiddleham, New England, 1892, and in need of a job, Abigail Rook meets R. F. Jackaby, an investigator of the unexplained with a keen eye for the extraordinary--including the ability to see supernatural beings. Abigail has a gift for noticing ordinary but important details, which makes her perfect for the position of Jackaby’s assistant. On her first day, Abigail finds herself in the midst of a thrilling case: A serial killer is on the loose. The police are convinced it’s an ordinary villain, but Jackaby is certain it’s a nonhuman creature, whose existence the police--with the exception of a handsome young detective named Charlie Cane--deny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Sherlock&lt;/i&gt; in William Ritter’s debut novel, which features a detective of the paranormal as seen through the eyes of his adventurous and intelligent assistant in a tale brimming with cheeky humor and a dose of the macabre.</description>

      <![CDATA[I really enjoyed reading Jackaby! Maybe it was a little predictable sometimes and not the most overwhelmingly amazing new story in the world (seen as it read like an old-timey mix of Elementary, Doctor Who and Teen Wolf), but it was fun and that counts a lot. I already ordered the sequel and hope...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first collection of poetry by Instagram sensation Atticus.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love Her Wild&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of new and beloved poems from Atticus, the young writer who has captured the hearts and minds of hundreds of thousands of avid followers on his Instagram account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Love Her Wild&lt;/i&gt;, Atticus captures what is both raw and relatable about the smallest and the grandest moments in life: the first glimpse of a new love in Paris; skinny dipping on a summer’s night; the irrepressible exuberance of the female spirit; or drinking whiskey in the desert watching the rising sun. With honesty, poignancy, and romantic flair, Atticus distills the most exhilarating highs and the heartbreaking lows of life and love into a few perfectly evocative lines, ensuring that his words will become etched in your mind—and will awaken your sense of adventure.</description>

  <description>From the author of “The Tell-Tale Heart,” “The Pit and the Pendulum,” and “The Murders in the Rue Morgue”. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although best known for his short stories, Edgar Allan Poe was by nature and choice a poet. This edition of his complete poetry illustrates the transcendent world of unity and ultimate beauty he created in his verse. From his exquisite lyric “To Helen” to his immortal masterpieces “Annabel Lee,” “The Bells,” and “The Raven,” Poe stands beside the celebrated English Romantic poets Shelley, Byron, and Keats, and his haunting, sensuous poetic vision profoundly influenced the Victorian giants Swinburne, Tennyson, and Rossetti.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Today his dark side speaks eloquently to contemporary readers in his poems, such as “The Haunted Palace” and “The Conqueror Worm,” with their powerful images of madness and the macabre. But even at the end of his life, Poe reached out to his art for comfort and courage, giving us in “Eldorado” a talisman to hold during our darkest moments—a timeless gift from an American writer.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;With an Introduction by Jay Parini and an Afterword by April Bernard&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>When Lain Fisher wakes up in a hospital bed she can't remember anything of the last few months. As a mindwalker herself she knows about erasing peoples memories. She just never thought that she would need that to happen to her. Before she can get any answers to her questions she is rescued by two young men, one of whom she remembers and the other is a stranger to her. With them she reconnects to her lost memories, discovers things about IFEN she couldn't have imagined and realises that the stranger is someone with whom she has a long and complicated history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon the battle for survival is personal and Lain and Stuart and the others in the rebel group are fighting to make big changes to the world as they know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gripping novel about the power of knowledge, the importance of the truth, and the tyranny of secrets.</description>

  <description>At seventeen, Lain Fisher has already aced the Institute's elite training program for Mindwalkers, therapists who use a direct neural link to erase a patient's traumatic memories. A prodigy and the daughter of a renowned scientist-whose unexplained death left her alone in the world-Lain is driven by the need to save others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Steven, a troubled classmate, asks her to wipe a horrific childhood experience from his mind, Lain's superiors warn her to stay away. Steven's scars are too deep, they say; the risk too great. Yet the more time Lain spends with him, the more she begins to question everything about her society. As she defies the warnings and explores Steven's memories, it becomes clear that he's connected to something much bigger…something the Institute doesn't want the world to discover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lain never expected to be a rule breaker. She certainly didn't plan on falling in love with a boy she's been forbidden to help. But then, she never expected to stumble into a conspiracy that could ignite a revolution.</description>

  <description>JUGHEAD VOL. 2 is the second collection of the historic JUGHEAD series relaunch, featuring the talents of comics superstars Chip Zdarsky, Ryan North and Derek Charm. This series is true to the spirit and characters that all Jughead and Archie fans know and love while reinvigorating its essence and humor through the talents of some of the most popular creators in the comic book industry. In the grand tradition of comic book reboots like ARCHIE VOL. 1, Archie Comics proudly presents... JUGHEAD VOL. 2--from the super team of Chip Zdarsky (HOWARD THE DUCK), Ryan North (THE UNBEATABLE SQUIRREL GIRL) and Derek Charm (REGULAR SHOW)! New story! New arc! New creative team! Let's not compare them too harshly with the old creative team though--they were awesome. This new team is pretty good too though, lots of talent and they really do try their best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collects issues #7-11</description>

  <description>Looming war threatens all Feyre holds dear in the third volume of the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling &lt;i&gt;A Court of Thorns and Roses &lt;/i&gt;series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feyre has returned to the Spring Court, determined to gather information on Tamlin's manoeuvrings and the invading king threatening to bring Prythian to its knees. But to do so she must play a deadly game of deceit – and one slip may spell doom not only for Feyre, but for her world as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As war bears down upon them all, Feyre must decide who to trust amongst the dazzling and lethal High Lords – and hunt for allies in unexpected places. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this thrilling third book in the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling series from Sarah J. Maas, the earth will be painted red as mighty armies grapple for power over the one thing that could destroy them all.</description>

  <description>Length: 10 hrs and 7 mins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice doesn’t believe in luck—at least, not the good kind. But she does believe in love, and for some time now, she’s been pining for her best friend, Teddy. On his eighteenth birthday—just when it seems they might be on the brink of something—she buys him a lottery ticket on a lark. To their astonishment, he wins $140 million, and in an instant, everything changes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, it seems like a dream come true, especially since the two of them are no strangers to misfortune. As a kid, Alice won the worst kind of lottery possible when her parents died just over a year apart from each other. And Teddy’s father abandoned his family not long after that, leaving them to grapple with his gambling debts. Through it all, Teddy and Alice have leaned on each other. But now, as they negotiate the ripple effects of Teddy’s newfound wealth, a gulf opens between them. And soon, the money starts to feel like more of a curse than a windfall. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they try to find their way back to each other, Alice learns more about herself than she ever could have imagined . . . and about the unexpected ways in which luck and love sometimes intersect.</description>

  <description>Anise Sawyer plans to spend every minute of summer with her friends: surfing, chowing down on fish tacos drizzled with wasabi balsamic vinegar, and throwing bonfires that blaze until dawn. But when a serious car wreck leaves her aunt, a single mother of three, with two broken legs, it forces Anise to say goodbye for the first time to Santa Cruz, the waves, her friends, and even a kindling romance, and fly with her dad to Nebraska for the entire summer. Living in Nebraska isn’t easy. Anise spends her days caring for her three younger cousins in the childhood home of her runaway mom, a wild figure who’s been flickering in and out of her life since birth, appearing for weeks at a time and then disappearing again for months, or even years, without a word. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complicating matters is Lincoln, a one-armed, charismatic skater who pushes Anise to trade her surfboard for a skateboard. As Anise draws closer to Lincoln and takes on the full burden and joy of her cousins, she loses touch with her friends back home – leading her to one terrifying question: will she turn out just like her mom and spend her life leaving behind the ones she loves?</description>

  <description>Candy hates boarding school. As a junior, graduation is still eons away, and making films is the only way to survive the boredom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she is kidnapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Candy panics. &lt;em&gt;Along Came a Spider, &lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ransom&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Taken&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cellular&lt;/em&gt;... Candy knows how these movies end. The only reason anyone would abduct her is to get a payout from her rock star father. Except Candy and her father are estranged. There's no way he's going to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with every hour that passes, Candy's fear slowly recedes. Being on the road is freeing, not to mention great material for a new documentary. And the more time she spends with her mysterious and handsome captor, Levon, the more she learns the whole scheme is not just about ransom. It's about revenge. What began as a kidnapping is spiraling into a crazy road trip adventure as Candy and Levon find a lot of wrong ways to do the right thing.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>America’s Favorite Teenager, Archie Andrews, is reborn in the pages of this must-have graphic novel collecting the first six issues of the comic book series that everyone is talking about. Meet Riverdale High teen Archie, his oddball, food-loving best friend Jughead, girl-next-door Betty and well-to-do snob Veronica Lodge as they embark on a modern reimagining of the beloved Archie world. It’s all here: the love triangle, friendship, humor, charm and lots of fun – but with a decidedly modern twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by some of the masters of the comic book genre, including writer Mark Waid and the all-star lineup of artists: Fiona Staples, Annie Wu and Veronica Fish, the first volume of ARCHIE presents readers with a new take on the beloved Archie Comics concepts while retaining the best elements from the company’s 75 years of history. ARCHIE VOL. 1 collects ARCHIE #1-6 and features bonus content including scripts, sketches, variant covers and the full first issue of the all new JUGHEAD series by acclaimed writer Chip Zdarsky and artist Erica Henderson.</description>

  <description>Stories can be powerful. In 1719, Elizabeth Goose of Boston Massachusetts published a collection of rhyming spells as a children's book, creating a spellbook of terrifying power. The Librarian of that age managed to dispose of all copies of the book except one, which remained in the possession of Elizabeth Goose and her family, temporarily averting any potential disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, strange things are happening, A window washer in San Diego who was blown off his elevated perch by a freak gust of wind, but miraculously survived by landing on a canopy over the building entrance. A woman in rural Pennsylvania who was attacked by mutant rodents without any eyes. And, a college professor in England who somehow found herself trapped inside a prize pumpkin at a local farmer’s market. Baird and her team of Librarians suspect that the magic of Mother Goose is again loose in the world, and with Flynn Carson AWOL once again, it is up to Cassandra, Ezekiel, and Stone to track down the missing spellbook before the true power of the rhymes can be unleashed.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Witness the fate of beloved heroes - and enemies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BALANCE OF POWER HAS FINALLY TIPPED...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precarious equilibrium among four Londons has reached its breaking point. Once brimming with the red vivacity of magic, darkness casts a shadow over the Maresh Empire, leaving a space for another London to rise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL CRUMBLE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kell - once assumed to be the last surviving &lt;i&gt;Antari&lt;/i&gt; - begins to waver under the pressure of competing loyalties. And in the wake of tragedy, can Arnes survive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL RISE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lila Bard, once a commonplace - but never common - thief, has survived and flourished through a series of magical trials. But now she must learn to control the magic, before it bleeds her dry. Meanwhile, the disgraced Captain Alucard Emery of the &lt;i&gt;Night Spire&lt;/i&gt; collects his crew, attempting a race against time to acquire the impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL TAKE CONTROL?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And an ancient enemy returns to claim a crown while a fallen hero tries to save a world in decay.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;What if you could spend one last day with someone you lost?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day Carver Briggs had it all—three best friends, a supportive family, and a reputation as a talented writer at his high school, Nashville Academy for the Arts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day he lost it all when he sent a simple text to his friend Mars, right before Mars, Eli, and Blake were killed in a car crash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Carver can’t stop blaming himself for the accident, and he’s not the only one. Eli’s twin sister is trying to freeze him out of school with her death-ray stare. And Mars’s father, a powerful judge, is pressuring the district attorney to open a criminal investigation into Carver’s actions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, Carver has some unexpected allies: Eli’s girlfriend, the only person to stand by him at school; Dr. Mendez, his new therapist; and Blake’s grandmother, who asks Carver to spend a Goodbye Day with her to share their memories and say a proper goodbye to his friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon the other families are asking for a Goodbye Day with Carver, but he’s unsure of their motives. Will they all be able to make peace with their losses, or will these Goodbye Days bring Carver one step closer to a complete breakdown or—even worse—prison?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Cinderella goes to the con in this fandom-fueled twist on the classic fairy tale.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part romance, part love letter to nerd culture, and all totally adorbs, Geekerella is a fairy tale for anyone who believes in the magic of fandom. Geek girl Elle Wittimer lives and breathes &lt;i&gt;Starfield&lt;/i&gt;, the classic sci-fi series she grew up watching with her late father. So when she sees a cosplay contest for a new &lt;i&gt;Starfield&lt;/i&gt; movie, she has to enter. The prize? An invitation to the ExcelsiCon Cosplay Ball, and a meet-and-greet with the actor slated to play Federation Prince Carmindor in the reboot. With savings from her gig at the Magic Pumpkin food truck (and her dad’s old costume), Elle’s determined to win…unless her stepsisters get there first.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Teen actor Darien Freeman used to live for cons—before he was famous. Now they’re nothing but autographs and awkward meet-and-greets. Playing Carmindor is all he’s ever wanted, but the &lt;i&gt;Starfield&lt;/i&gt; fandom has written him off as just another dumb heartthrob. As ExcelsiCon draws near, Darien feels more and more like a fake—until he meets a girl who shows him otherwise.</description>

  <description>From the moment Kamala put on her costume, she's been challenged. But nothing has prepared her for this: the last days of the Marvel Universe. Lucky she's got the help of Carol "Captain Marvel" Danvers! Between teaming up with her personal hero to rescue her brother and trying to keep her city from falling into an all-out frenzy, Kamala has barely had time to come to terms with the fact that the world is literally collapsing around her. But the truth will catch up to her, and soon. When the world is about to end, do you still keep fighting? Kamala knows the answer. Let's do this, Jersey City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collecting: &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel (2014) #16-19&lt;/em&gt;, written by G. Willow Wilson and illustrated by Adrian Alphona, plus material from &lt;em&gt;Amazing Spider-Man (2014) #7-8&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>Loki is many things: god, trickster, brother, son, villain, even hero. Now he wants to add one more title to the list: President of the United States! That's right, the God of Lies wants to be ruler of the free world! But is this just another scheme? One fact is certain: With Loki's winning smile and silver tongue on the campaign trail, this election just got a lot more interesting! He'll soon have the American people eating out of the palm of his hand, but can would-be President Laufeyson sway the media? And what will be his response when the heroes of Earth launch their attack ad? A crisis in Latveria offers Loki the chance to demonstrate his foreign policy...but surely he wouldn't cause a national catastrophe just for a little good press? Would he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COLLECTING:&lt;/b&gt; VOTE LOKI 1-4; MATERIAL FROM JOURNEY INTO MYSTERY 85, AVENGERS (1963) 300</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Three friends, two love stories, one convention: this fun, feminist love letter to geek culture is all about fandom, friendship, and finding the courage to be yourself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie likes to stand out. She’s a vlogger and actress promoting her first movie at SupaCon, and this is her chance to show fans she’s over her public breakup with co-star Reese Ryan. When internet-famous cool-girl actress Alyssa Huntington arrives as a surprise guest, it seems Charlie’s long-time crush on her isn’t as one-sided as she thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor likes to blend in. Her brain is wired differently, making her fear change. And there’s one thing in her life she knows will never change: her friendship with her best guy friend Jamie—no matter how much she may secretly want it to. But when she hears about a fan contest for her favorite fandom, she starts to rethink her rules on playing it safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Queens of Gee&lt;/i&gt;k by Jen Wilde, chosen by readers like you for Macmillan's young adult imprint Swoon Reads, is an empowering novel for anyone who has ever felt that fandom is family.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>"You go through life thinking there’s so much you need. . . . Until you leave with only your phone, your wallet, and a picture of your mother."&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Marin hasn’t spoken to anyone from her old life since the day she left everything behind. No one knows the truth about those final weeks. Not even her best friend Mabel. But even thousands of miles away from the California coast, at college in New York, Marin still feels the pull of the life and tragedy she’s tried to outrun. Now, months later, alone in an emptied dorm for winter break, Marin waits. Mabel is coming to visit and Marin will be forced to face everything that’s been left unsaid and finally confront the loneliness that has made a home in her heart.</description>

  <description>Who is the Inventor, and what does he want with the all-new Ms. Marvel and all her friends? Maybe Wolverine can help! If Kamala can stop fan-girling out about meeting her favorite super hero, that is. Then, Kamala crosses paths with Inhumanity -- by meeting the royal dog, Lockjaw! But why is Lockjaw really with Kamala? As Ms. Marvel discovers more about her past, the Inventor continues to threaten her future. Kamala bands together with some unlikely heroes to stop the maniacal villain before he does real damage, but has she taken on more than she can handle? And how much longer can Ms. Marvel's life take over Kamala Khan's? Kamala Khan continues to prove why she's the best (and most adorable) new super hero there is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collecting &lt;i&gt;Ms. Marvel(2014) #6-11&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A million universes. A million dangers. One destiny.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fate of the multiverse rests in Marguerite Caine’s hands. Marguerite has been at the center of a cross-dimensional feud since she first traveled to another universe using her parents’ invention, the Firebird. Only now has she learned the true plans of the evil Triad Corporation—and that those plans could spell doom for dozens or hundreds of universes, each facing total annihilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Markov has always been at Marguerite’s side, but Triad’s last attack has left him a changed man—angry and shadowed by tragedy. He struggles to overcome the damage done to him, but despite Marguerite’s efforts to help, Paul may never be the same again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it’s up to Marguerite alone to stop the destruction of the multiverse. Billions of lives are at stake. The risks have never been higher. And Triad has unleashed its ultimate weapon: another dimension’s Marguerite—wicked, psychologically twisted, and always one step ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the conclusion to Claudia Gray’s Firebird trilogy, fate and family will be questioned, loves will be won and lost, and the multiverse will be forever changed. It’s a battle of the Marguerites…and only one can win.</description>

      <![CDATA[Actual rating: 3.5<br /><br />That was a little more anti-climactic than I would have hoped for. Marguerite was endlessly annoying in this series, but it's still fast-paced and entertaining. Full review to come soon on the blog!]]>

  <description>Mori is out for revenge. Imprisoned in the English countryside, with her brothers held as leverage, she’s never felt angrier or more helpless. When an opportunity for escape arises, Mori takes it and flees back to the streets of London, where she is finally able to plot the demise of her recently freed father and his cohorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after a bittersweet reunion with Lock, she discovers that he may not be the ally he once was. In the face of blackmail, threats, and Lock’s noble attempts to thwart her crusade, Mori has an impossible decision to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Mori wash the blood from her hands and walk away? Or will her final fall from grace be the end of everyone she loves?</description>

      <![CDATA[I think this trilogy was an excellent villain origin story. While it did explain the background of Moriarty, it didn't necessarily try to make excuses for her behaviour. I really like when villains have their reasons for what they do, but at the same time we all know it isn't right and the hero s...]]>

  <description>Sherlock Holmes and Miss James “Mori” Moriarty may have closed their first case, but the mystery is far from over in the thrilling sequel to &lt;i&gt;Lock &amp;amp; Mori&lt;/i&gt;, perfect for fans of Maureen Johnson and &lt;i&gt;Sherlock&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;You know their names. Now discover their beginnings. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mori’s abusive father is behind bars…and she has never felt less safe. Threatening letters have started appearing on her doorstep, and the police are receiving anonymous tips suggesting that Mori—not her father—is the Regent’s Park killer. To make matters worse, the police are beginning to believe them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through it all, Lock—frustrating, brilliant, gorgeous Lock—is by her side. The two of them set out to discover who is framing Mori, but in a city full of suspects, the task is easier said than done. With the clock ticking, Mori will discover just how far she is willing to go to make sure that justice is served, and no one—not even Lock—will be able to stop her.</description>

  <description>Miles Morales is hitting the big time! Not only is he joining the Marvel Universe, but he's also a card-carrying Avenger, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Iron Man, Thor and Captain America! And he'll soon be a media sensation in this All-New, All-Different New York! One thing's the same, though: non-stop action! Like when Earth's Mightiest heroes all fall, and Miles stands alone against a villain with the power to destroy the universe. Or when the Black Cat tries to get her claws in this new Spider-Man. Or when a new mutant threatens to grab the spotlight! And don't forget Miles' toughest foe yet: his grandmother! But his grades might be the ultimate challenge -- maybe a study session (date?) with Ms. Marvel would help? Welcome to the neighborhood, Spider-Man -- hope it's friendly! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collecting SPIDER-MAN (2016) #1-5.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Let me be clear: I never intended to raise my brother from his grave, though he may claim otherwise. If there's anything I've learned from him in the years since, it's that the dead hide truths as well as the living.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Tea accidentally resurrects her brother from the dead, she learns she is different from the other witches in her family. Her gift for necromancy means that she's a bone witch, a title that makes her feared and ostracized by her community. But Tea finds solace and guidance with an older, wiser bone witch, who takes Tea and her brother to another land for training.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her new home, Tea puts all her energy into becoming an asha-one who can wield elemental magic. But dark forces are approaching quickly, and in the face of danger, Tea will have to overcome her obstacles...and make a powerful choice.</description>

  <description>HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO TO TRUST WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN TRUST YOURSELF?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look at my hands. One of them says FLORA BE BRAVE.&lt;br /&gt;Flora has anterograde amnesia. She can't remember anything day-to-day: the joke her friend made, the instructions her parents gave her, how old she is.&lt;br /&gt;Then she kisses someone she shouldn't, and the next day she remembers it. It's the first time she's remembered anything since she was ten. &lt;br /&gt;But the boy is gone. She thinks he's moved to the Arctic. &lt;br /&gt;Will following him be the key to unlocking her memory? Who can she trust?</description>

  <description>In this personal, eloquently-argued essay—adapted from her much-admired TEDx talk of the same name—Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Americanah,&lt;/i&gt; offers readers a unique definition of feminism for the twenty-first century, one rooted in inclusion and awareness. Drawing extensively on her own experiences and her deep understanding of the often masked realities of sexual politics, here is one remarkable author’s exploration of what it means to be a woman now—and an of-the-moment rallying cry for why we should all be feminists.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There would be blood. Blood for blood. Blood to pay. An entire world of it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the resistance in 1950s Germany, the war may be over, but the fight has just begun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Death camp survivor Yael, who has the power to skinshift, is on the run: the world has just seen her shoot and kill Hitler. But the truth of what happened is far more complicated, and its consequences are deadly. Yael and her unlikely comrades dive into enemy territory to try to turn the tide against the New Order, and there is no alternative but to see their mission through to the end, whatever the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But dark secrets reveal dark truths, and one question hangs over them all: how far can you go for the ones you love?</description>

  <description>Lily Proctor has come a long way from the weak, sickly girl she used to be. She has gained power as a witch and a leader, found her way home, chosen to face battle again, and (after losing her first love and being betrayed by her new love) she has learned more about loss and grief than she ever wanted to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrust once again into a society different from anything they have ever seen, Lily and her coven are determined to find answers―to find a new path to victory, a way to defeat the monstrous Woven without resorting to nuclear weapons or becoming a tyrannical mass murderer like her alternate self, Lillian. But sometimes winning requires sacrifices . . . and when the only clear path to victory lies at Lillian's side, what price will Lily be willing to pay?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Internationally bestselling author Josephine Angelini takes us on another emotionally wrenching thrill ride in the stunning conclusion to her &lt;i&gt;Worldwalker Trilogy&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Moving to a space station at the edge of the galaxy was always going to be the death of Hanna’s social life. Nobody said it might actually get her killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sci-fi saga that began with the breakout bestseller &lt;i&gt;Illuminae&lt;/i&gt; continues on board the Jump Station &lt;i&gt;Heimdall&lt;/i&gt;, where two new characters will confront the next wave of the BeiTech assault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanna is the station captain’s pampered daughter; Nik the reluctant member of a notorious crime family. But while the pair are struggling with the realities of life aboard the galaxy’s most boring space station, little do they know that Kady Grant and the &lt;i&gt;Hypatia&lt;/i&gt; are headed right toward &lt;i&gt;Heimdall&lt;/i&gt;, carrying news of the Kerenza invasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an elite BeiTech strike team invades the station, Hanna and Nik are thrown together to defend their home. But alien predators are picking off the station residents one by one, and a malfunction in the station’s wormhole means the space-time continuum might be ripped in two before dinner. Soon Hanna and Nik aren’t just fighting for their own survival; the fate of everyone on the &lt;i&gt;Hypatia&lt;/i&gt;—and possibly the known universe—is in their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But relax. They’ve totally got this. They hope.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Rashad is absent again today.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s the sidewalk graffiti that started it all…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, no, actually, a lady tripping over Rashad at the store, making him drop a bag of chips, was what started it all. Because it didn’t matter what Rashad said next—that it was an accident, that he wasn’t stealing—the cop just kept pounding him. Over and over, pummeling him into the pavement. So then Rashad, an ROTC kid with mad art skills, was absent again…and again…stuck in a hospital room. Why? Because it &lt;i&gt;looked&lt;/i&gt; like he was stealing. And he was a black kid in baggy clothes. So he must have been stealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that’s how it started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that’s what Quinn, a white kid, saw. He saw his best friend’s older brother beating the daylights out of a classmate. At first Quinn doesn’t tell a soul…He’s not even sure he understands it. And does it matter? The whole thing was caught on camera, anyway. But when the school—and nation—start to divide on what happens, blame spreads like wildfire fed by ugly words like “racism” and “police brutality.” Quinn realizes he’s &lt;i&gt;got&lt;/i&gt; to understand it, because, bystander or not, he’s a part of history. He just has to figure out what side of history that will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rashad and Quinn—one black, one white, both American—face the unspeakable truth that racism and prejudice didn’t die after the civil rights movement. There’s a future at stake, a future where no one else will have to be absent because of police brutality. They just have to risk everything to change the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuz that’s how it can end.</description>

  <description>A captivating, beautiful, and stunningly accomplished debut novel that opens in 1918 Australia - the story of a lighthouse keeper and his wife who make one devastating choice that forever changes two worlds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Australia, 1926. After four harrowing years fighting on the Western Front, Tom Sherbourne returns home to take a job as the lighthouse keeper on Janus Rock, nearly half a day's journey from the coast. To this isolated island, where the supply boat comes once a season and shore leaves are granted every other year at best, Tom brings a young, bold, and loving wife, Isabel. Years later, after two miscarriages and one stillbirth, the grieving Isabel hears a baby's cries on the wind. A boat has washed up onshore carrying a dead man and a living baby. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom, whose records as a lighthouse keeper are meticulous and whose moral principles have withstood a horrific war, wants to report the man and infant immediately. But Isabel has taken the tiny baby to her breast. Against Tom's judgment, they claim her as their own and name her Lucy. When she is two, Tom and Isabel return to the mainland and are reminded that there are other people in the world. Their choice has devastated one of them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M. L. Stedman's mesmerizing, beautifully written debut novel seduces us into accommodating Isabel's decision to keep this "gift from God." And we are swept into a story about extraordinarily compelling characters seeking to find their North Star in a world where there is no right answer, where justice for one person is another's tragic loss.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Forced to return to his estranged family, John discovers how hard it is to truly go home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been a year since John lost his girlfriend, Leah, to suicide. Living with his uncle keeps his mind from the tragedy and his screwed up family-until he gets into trouble and a judge sends him back home. With a neglectful mother and abusive brother, John's homecoming is far from happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he tries to navigate and repair the relationships he abandoned years ago, Emily, the girl next door, is the only bright spot. She's sweet and smart and makes him think his heart may finally be healing. But tragedy isn't far away, and John must soon face an impossible decision: save his family or save himself.</description>

  <description>Welcome to the world of the Grisha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaz Brekker and his crew of deadly outcasts have just pulled off a heist so daring even they didn't think they'd survive. But instead of divvying up a fat reward, they're right back to fighting for their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Double-crossed and badly weakened, the crew is low on resources, allies, and hope. As powerful forces from around the world descend on Ketterdam to root out the secrets of the dangerous drug known as jurda parem, old rivals and new enemies emerge to challenge Kaz's cunning and test the team's fragile loyalties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A war will be waged on the city's dark and twisting streets - a battle for revenge and redemption that will decide the fate of the Grisha world.</description>

  <description>In the male-dominated field of animation, Mel Vaught and Sharon Kisses are a dynamic duo, the friction of their differences driving them: Sharon, quietly ambitious but self-doubting; Mel, brash and unapologetic, always the life of the party. Best friends and artistic partners since the first week of college, where they bonded over their working-class roots and obvious talent, they spent their twenties ensconced in a gritty Brooklyn studio. Working, drinking, laughing. Drawing: Mel, to understand her tumultuous past, and Sharon, to lose herself altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after a decade of striving, the two are finally celebrating the release of their first full-length feature, which transforms Mel’s difficult childhood into a provocative and visually daring work of art. The toast of the indie film scene, they stand at the cusp of making it big. But with their success come doubt and destruction, cracks in their relationship threatening the delicate balance of their partnership. Sharon begins to feel expendable, suspecting that the ever-more raucous Mel is the real artist. During a trip to Sharon’s home state of Kentucky, the only other partner she has ever truly known—her troubled, charismatic childhood best friend, Teddy—reenters her life, and long-buried resentments rise to the surface, hastening a reckoning no one sees coming.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;AP exams—check&lt;br /&gt;SAT test—check&lt;br /&gt;College application—check&lt;br /&gt;Date the wrong guy and ruin everything you’ve spent your whole life working for—check&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super-achiever Viviana Rabinovich-Lowe has never had room to be anything less than perfect. But her quest for perfection is derailed when her boyfriend leaks a private picture of her to the entire school—a picture only he was supposed to see. Making matters worse, her parents are getting divorced and now her perfect family is falling apart. For the first time, Vivi feels like a complete and utter failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she gets a job working at the community pool, where she meets a new group of friends who know nothing about her past. That includes Evan, a gorgeous guy who makes her want to do something she never thought she’d do again: trust. For the first time in her life, Vivi realizes she can finally be whoever she wants. But who is that? While she tries to figure it out, she learns something they never covered in her AP courses: that it’s okay to be less than perfect, because it’s our imperfections that make us who we are.</description>

  <description>An inventive debut in the tradition of World War Z and The Martian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A GIRL NAMED ROSE IS RIDING HER NEW BIKE NEAR HER HOME IN DEADWOOD, South Dakota, when she falls through the earth. She wakes up at the bottom of a square-shaped hole, its walls glowing with intricate carvings. But the firemen who come to save her peer down upon something even stranger: a little girl in the palm of a giant metal hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen years later, the mystery of the bizarre artifact remains unsolved - the object's origins, architects, and purpose unknown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But some can never stop searching for answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose Franklin is now a highly trained physicist leading a top-secret team to crack the hand's code. And along with her colleagues, she is being interviewed by a nameless interrogator whose power and purview are as enigmatic as the relic they seek. What's clear is that Rose and her compatriots are on the edge of unravelling history's most perplexing discovery-and finally figuring out what it portends for humanity. But once the pieces of the puzzle are in place, will the result be an instrument of lasting peace or a weapon of mass destruction?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;'Masterfully blends together elements of sci-fi, political thriller and apocalyptic fiction. . . . A page-turner of the highest order." -KIRKUS REVIEWS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read more at &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.penguin.co.uk/books/sleeping-giants/9780718181680/#P7mvEFfl6KqIlikB.99" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.penguin.co.uk/books/sleepi...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When kingdom come, there will be one.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In every generation on the island of Fennbirn, a set of triplets is born—three queens, all equal heirs to the crown and each possessor of a coveted magic. Mirabella is a fierce elemental, able to spark hungry flames or vicious storms at the snap of her fingers. Katharine is a poisoner, one who can ingest the deadliest poisons without so much as a stomachache. Arsinoe, a naturalist, is said to have the ability to bloom the reddest rose and control the fiercest of lions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But becoming the Queen Crowned isn’t solely a matter of royal birth. Each sister has to fight for it. And it’s not just a game of win or lose…it’s life or death. The night the sisters turn sixteen, the battle begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last queen standing gets the crown. </description>

  <description>In the enchanted kingdom of Brooklyn, the fashionable people put on cute shoes, go to parties in warehouses, drink on rooftops at sunset, and tell themselves they’ve &lt;i&gt;arrived&lt;/i&gt;. A whole lot of Brooklyn is like that now—but not Vassa’s working-class neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Vassa’s neighborhood, where she lives with her stepmother and bickering stepsisters, one might stumble onto magic, but stumbling away again could become an issue. Babs Yagg, the owner of the local convenience store, has a policy of beheading shoplifters—and sometimes innocent shoppers as well. So when Vassa’s stepsister sends her out for light bulbs in the middle of night, she knows it could easily become a suicide mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Vassa has a bit of luck hidden in her pocket, a gift from her dead mother. Erg is a tough-talking wooden doll with sticky fingers, a bottomless stomach, and a ferocious cunning. With Erg’s help, Vassa just might be able to break the witch’s curse and free her Brooklyn neighborhood. But Babs won’t be playing fair…</description>

  <description>SOMETIMES THE ONE WHO LOVES YOU IS THE ONE WHO HURTS YOU THE MOST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily hasn't always had it easy, but that's never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She's come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up - she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily's life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryle is assertive, stubborn, and maybe even a little arrogant. He's also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily, but Ryle's complete aversion to relationships is disturbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan - her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this bold and deeply personal novel, Colleen Hoover delivers a heart-wrenching story that breaks exciting new ground for her as a writer. It Ends With Us is an unforgettable tale of love that comes at the ultimate price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book contains graphic scenes and very sensitive subject matter..</description>

  <description>Henrietta Howel can burst into flames. &lt;br /&gt;Forced to reveal her power to save a friend, she's shocked when instead of being executed, she's invited to train as one of Her Majesty's royal sorcerers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrust into the glamour of Victorian London, Henrietta is declared the chosen one, the girl who will defeat the Ancients, bloodthirsty demons terrorizing humanity. She also meets her fellow sorcerer trainees, handsome young men eager to test her power and her heart. One will challenge her. One will fight for her. One will betray her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Henrietta Howel is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the chosen one.&lt;br /&gt;As she plays a dangerous game of deception, she discovers that the sorcerers have their own secrets to protect. With battle looming, what does it mean to not be the one? And how much will she risk to save the city--and the one she loves?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exhilarating and gripping, Jessica Cluess's spellbinding fantasy introduces Henrietta Howel, a powerful, unforgettable heroine, and an entertaining world filled with magic, monsters, and mayhem.</description>

  <description>A whip-smart, heart-wrenching debut YA novel about first love, first loss, and filmmaking that will delight fans of Jandy Nelson and Jennifer Niven &lt;br /&gt; In the movie version of Amelia s life, the roles have always been clear. Her older brother, Toby: definitely the Star. As popular with the stoners as he is with the cheerleaders, Toby is someone you d pay ten bucks to watch sweep Battle of the Bands and build a beach party in the bathroom. As for Amelia? She s Toby Anderson s Younger Sister. She s perfectly happy to watch Toby s hijinks from the sidelines, when she s not engrossed in one of her elaborately themed Netflix movie marathons. &lt;br /&gt; But recently Toby s been acting in a very non-movie-version way. He s stopped hanging out with his horde of friends and started obsessively journaling and disappearing for days at a time. Amelia doesn t know what s happened to her awesome older brother, or who this strange actor is that s taken his place. And there s someone else pulling at her attention: a smart, cute new boyfriend who wants to know the real Amelia not Toby s Sidekick. Amelia feels adrift without her star, but to best help Toby and herself it might be time to cast a new role: Amelia Anderson, leading lady."</description>

  <description>Eight weeks after sixteen-year-old Andie Hamilton gives her virginity to her best friend, “the stick” says she’s pregnant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her friends treat her like she’s carrying the plague, her classmates torture and ridicule her, and the boy she thought loved her doesn’t even care. Afraid to experience the next seven months alone, she turns to her ex-boyfriend, Neil Donaghue, a dark-haired, blue-eyed player. With him, she finds comfort and the support she desperately needs to make the hardest decision of her life: whether or not to keep the baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a tragic accident leads Andie to discover Neil’s keeping a secret that could dramatically alter their lives, and she's forced to make a choice. But after hearing her son’s heartbeat for the first time, she doesn’t know how she’ll ever be able to let go.</description>

  <description>For years, Gansey has been on a quest to find a lost king. One by one, he's drawn others into his mission: Ronan, who steals from dreams; Adam, whose life is no longer his own; Noah, whose life is no longer a life; and Blue, who loves Gansey … and is certain she is destined to kill him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nothing dead can be trusted.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the endgame has begun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nothing living is safe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dreams and nightmares are converging. Love and loss are inseparable. And the quest refuses to be pinned to a path.</description>

  <description>Lin-Manuel Miranda's groundbreaking musical &lt;i&gt;Hamilton&lt;/i&gt; is as revolutionary as its subject, the poor kid from the Caribbean who fought the British, defended the Constitution, and helped to found the United States. Fusing hip-hop, pop, R&amp;amp;B, and the best traditions of theater, this once-in-a-generation show broadens the sound of Broadway, reveals the storytelling power of rap, and claims our country's origins for a diverse new generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hamilton: The Revolution&lt;/i&gt; gives readers an unprecedented view of both revolutions, from the only two writers able to provide it. Miranda and Jeremy McCarter, a cultural critic and theater artist who was involved in the project from its earliest stages--"since before this was even a show," according to Miranda--trace its development from an improbable perfor­mance at the White House to its landmark opening night on Broadway six years later. In addition, Miranda has written more than 200 funny, revealing footnotes for his award-winning libretto, the full text of which is published here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their account features photos by the renowned Frank Ockenfels and veteran Broadway photographer Joan Marcus; exclusive looks at notebooks and emails; interviews with Questlove, Stephen Sond­heim, leading political commentators, and more than 40 people involved with the production; and multiple appearances by Presi­dent Obama himself. The book does more than tell the surprising story of how a Broadway musical became a national phenomenon: It demonstrates that America has always been renewed by the brash upstarts and brilliant outsiders, the men and women who don't throw away their shot.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The third installment in the captivating series from the irrepressible, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Maggie Stiefvater.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Sargent has found things. For the first time in her life, she has friends she can trust, a group to which she can belong. The Raven Boys have taken her in as one of their own. Their problems have become hers, and her problems have become theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick with found things, though, is how easily they can be lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friends can betray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mothers can disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visions can mislead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainties can unravel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a starred review, &lt;i&gt;The Bulletin&lt;/i&gt; called &lt;i&gt;The Dream Thieves&lt;/i&gt;, the previous book in The Raven Cycle, "a complex web of magical intrigue and heart-stopping action." Now, with &lt;i&gt;Blue Lily, Lily Blue&lt;/i&gt;, the web becomes even more complex, snaring readers at every turn.</description>

I love how each part of the series focuses on someone else of the group, even though Noah gets thoroughly ignored again, while increasingly getting worse too.

As they work together to find food, water, and shelter, they find the strength to take control of their own lives.</description>

  <description>"'There are only two reasons a non-seer would see a spirit on St. Mark's Eve,' Neeve said. 'Either you're his true love...or you killed him.'"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is freezing in the churchyard, even before the dead arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year, Blue Sargent stands next to her clairvoyant mother as the soon-to-be dead walk past. Blue herself never sees them — not until this year, when a boy emerges from the dark and speaks directly to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His name is Gansey, and Blue soon discovers that he is a rich student at Aglionby, the local private school. Blue has a policy of staying away from Aglionby boys. Known as Raven Boys, they can only mean trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Blue is drawn to Gansey, in a way she can't entirely explain. He has it all — family money, good looks, devoted friends — but he's looking for much more than that. He is on a quest that has encompassed three other Raven Boys: Adam, the scholarship student who resents all the privilege around him; Ronan, the fierce soul who ranges from anger to despair; and Noah, the taciturn watcher of the four, who notices many things but says very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as she can remember, Blue has been warned that she will cause her true love to die. She never thought this would be a problem. But now, as her life becomes caught up in the strange and sinister world of the Raven Boys, she's not so sure anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Maggie Stiefvater, the bestselling and acclaimed author of the Shiver trilogy and The Scorpio Races, comes a spellbinding new series where the inevitability of death and the nature of love lead us to a place we've never been before.</description>

  <description>Nix has spent her entire life aboard her father’s ship, sailing across the centuries, across the world, across myth and imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as her father has a map for it, he can sail to any time, any place, real or imagined: nineteenth-century China, the land from &lt;i&gt;One Thousand and One Nights&lt;/i&gt;, a mythic version of Africa. Along the way they have found crewmates and friends, and even a disarming thief who could come to mean much more to Nix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the end to it all looms closer every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her father is obsessed with obtaining the one map, 1868 Honolulu, that could take him back to his lost love, Nix’s mother. Even though getting it—and going there—could erase Nix’s very existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, Nix is entering unknown waters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She could find herself, find her family, find her own fantastical ability, her own epic love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or she could disappear.</description>

  <description>Based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, a new play by Jack Thorne, &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&lt;/i&gt; is the eighth story in the Harry Potter series and the first official Harry Potter story to be presented on stage. The play will receive its world premiere in London’s West End on July 30, 2016.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn’t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.</description>

I mean, I couldn't stop referring to August as my new baby and I was in agony whenever he wasn't okay (which was a lot).

  <description>Alyssa Gardner has been down the rabbit hole and faced the bandersnatch. She saved the life of Jeb, the guy she loves, and escaped the machinations of the disturbingly seductive Morpheus and the vindictive Queen Red. Now all she has to do is graduate high school and make it through prom so she can attend the prestigious art school in London she's always dreamed of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; That would be easier without her mother, freshly released from an asylum, acting overly protective and suspicious. And it would be much simpler if the mysterious Morpheus didn’t show up for school one day to tempt her with another dangerous quest in the dark, challenging Wonderland—where she (partly) belongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As prom and graduation creep closer, Alyssa juggles Morpheus’s unsettling presence in her real world with trying to tell Jeb the truth about a past he’s forgotten. Glimpses of Wonderland start to bleed through her art and into her world in very disturbing ways, and Morpheus warns that Queen Red won’t be far behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If Alyssa stays in the human realm, she could endanger Jeb, her parents, and everyone she loves. But if she steps through the rabbit hole again, she'll face a deadly battle that could cost more than just her head.</description>

  <description>Dill has had to wrestle with vipers his whole life—at home, as the only son of a Pentecostal minister who urges him to handle poisonous rattlesnakes, and at school, where he faces down bullies who target him for his father’s extreme faith and very public fall from grace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He and his fellow outcast friends must try to make it through their senior year of high school without letting the small-town culture destroy their creative spirits and sense of self. Graduation will lead to new beginnings for Lydia, whose edgy fashion blog is her ticket out of their rural Tennessee town. And Travis is content where he is thanks to his obsession with an epic book series and the fangirl turning his reality into real-life fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their diverging paths could mean the end of their friendship. But not before Dill confronts his dark legacy to attempt to find a way into the light of a future worth living.</description>

  <description>Kiera Cass’s #1 New York Times bestselling Selection series has captured the hearts of readers from its very first page. Now the end of the journey is here. Prepare to be swept off your feet by The Crown—the eagerly awaited, wonderfully romantic fifth and final book in the Selection series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In The Heir, a new era dawned in the world of The Selection. Twenty years have passed since America Singer and Prince Maxon fell in love, and their daughter is the first princess to hold a Selection of her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eadlyn didn’t think she would find a real partner among the Selection’s thirty-five suitors, let alone true love. But sometimes the heart has a way of surprising you…and now Eadlyn must make a choice that feels more difficult—and more important—than she ever expected.</description>

  <description>Das Leben von Clementine kippt an dem Tag, als sie Emma trifft, eine junge Frau mit blauen Haaren, die sie alle Facetten der Lust entdecken lässt und ihr ermöglicht, sich dem Blick der anderen zu stellen. Eine einfühlsame Erzählung voller Zärtlichkeit.Die ebenso sanfte wie tragische und mit autobiografischen Elementen versehene Coming-Out Geschichte über die zwei jugendlichen Frauen Clementine und Emma, die miteinander eine Liebesbeziehung eingehen und deswegen den homophoben Attacken ihrer Umwelt ausgesetzt sind. &lt;br /&gt;Die in Angoulême lebende Schöpferin der Vorlage, Julie Maroh, erhielt für ihr Graphic Novel-Debüt bereits im Jahr 2011 den Prix du Public auf dem berühmten Festival der Stadt.</description>

  <description>Edward (long live the king) is the King of England. He’s also dying, which is inconvenient, as he’s only sixteen and he’d much rather be planning for his first kiss than considering who will inherit his crown…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane (reads too many books) is Edward’s cousin, and far more interested in books than romance. Unfortunately for Jane, Edward has arranged to marry her off to secure the line of succession. And there’s something a little odd about her intended…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gifford (call him G) is a horse. That is, he’s an &lt;i&gt;Eðian&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;eth-y-un&lt;/i&gt;, for the uninitiated). Every day at dawn he becomes a noble chestnut steed—but then he wakes at dusk with a mouthful of hay. It’s all very undignified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot thickens as Edward, Jane, and G are drawn into a dangerous conspiracy. With the fate of the kingdom at stake, our heroes will have to engage in some conspiring of their own. But can they pull off their plan before it’s off with their heads?</description>

  <description>Lea Holder watched a boy die in the same DUI accident that ruined Lea’s legs and threw her little sister into a coma. As the only eye-witness to the accident, if she tells the truth in court, the drunk driver will go to prison and the dead boy’s family will have justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Lea lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If she had told the truth, Lea would have put her own mom in prison for causing the accident. With the trial over and her mom set free, Lea attempts to rebuild her shattered life as she waits for her little sister to wake from her coma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lea transfers schools, she finds herself in the same senior class as Seth Ashbury, the brother of the boy her mom killed. As Lea gets to know the person buried underneath Seth's grief, she quickly falls for his quick wit and passionate soul. But Seth remains completely oblivious that Lea is the same girl who robbed his family of justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their relationship deepens, Lea finally gets a taste of the love that’s been missing from her life since the accident. But soon she’s faced with a choice: she can continue her lies and accept the comfort it gives them both. Or she can tell Seth the truth about everything, and risk destroying both her family and her newfound love.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I don't entirely understand how anyone gets a boyfriend. Or a girlfriend. It just seems like the most impossible odds. A perfect alignment of feelings and circumstances&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly Peskin-Suso knows all about unrequited love. No matter how many times her twin sister, Cassie, tells her to woman up, Molly is &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; careful. &lt;i&gt;Better to be careful than be hurt&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Cassie gets a new girlfriend who comes with a cute hipster-boy sidekick, everything changes. Will is funny, flirtatious, and basically the perfect first boyfriend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's only one problem: Molly's coworker, Reid, the awkward Tolkien superfan, she could &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; fall for … right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A heart-warming and hilarious story about growing up and learning to be comfortable in your own skin.</description>

  <description>Andie had it all planned out. When you are a politician’s daughter who’s pretty much raised yourself, you learn everything can be planned or spun, or both. Especially your future. Important internship? Check. Amazing friends? Check. Guys? Check (as long as we’re talking no more than three weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that was before the scandal. Before having to be in the same house with her dad. Before walking an insane number of dogs. That was before Clark and those few months that might change her whole life. Because here’s the thing—if everything’s planned out, you can never find the unexpected. And where’s the fun in that?</description>

  <description>Model Finley needs someone to help her shed her "good girl" persona, so she'll try Eddie on for size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York City model Finley is fed up with hearing the same feedback at castings: she needs to take some serious action to wipe the "good girl" stamp from her resume if she wants to launch to stardom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Eddie Wells. He's shallow, predictable…and just as lost as Finley feels. Deep down, Finley is drawn to Eddie's bravado, his intensity. Except Eddie is hiding something. A big something. And when it surfaces, both loving and leaving Finley will become so much harder.</description>

  <description>When Zahara Bakur was forced to join the Hydras, she had no idea that the leaders of the growing street gang got their superpowers from the shadowy Parthenon Company. Nor did she ever expect that after Parthenon’s CEO Jason Price was done with the Hydras, he would try to have them killed. Or that she and her friends would have to flee in order to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the epic sequel to Reborn City, Rami Ungar takes us further into the world of Anno Bombus as Zahara and her friends try to outrun Jason Price and the numerous forces sent against them. With tensions high in the group and old enemies hot on their trails, the Hydras will be tested beyond their limits if they hope to survive what fate has in store for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And maybe find hope in the most unlikely of places.</description>

  <description>It is Clara who is desperate to enter the labyrinth and it is Clara who is bright, strong, and fearless enough to take on any challenge. It is no surprise when she is chosen. But so is the girl who has always lived in her shadow. Together they enter. Within minutes, they are torn apart forever. Now the girl who has never left the city walls must fight to survive in a living nightmare, where one false turn with who to trust means a certain dead end."</description>

  <description>THE BREAKOUT CHARACTER HIT OF THE YEAR IS &lt;b&gt;GWEN STACY: SPIDER-WOMAN!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN ONE UNIVERSE, it wasn't Peter Parker who was bitten by the radioactive spider, but Gwen Stacy! She's smart, charming and can lift a car ... just don't tell her father, the police chief. Now, in the wake of Spider-Verse, Gwen swings into her own solo adventures! And she soon finds herself between a rock and a hard place when the Vulture attacks, and NYPD Lieutenant Frank Castle sets his sights on bringing her down. Then, still haunted by Peter's death, Gwen visits his only family: Ben and May Parker. But what really happened the day Peter died? Find out right here as the spectacular Spider-Gwen steals not only the spotlight, but also the hearts of comic fans worldwide!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLLECTING &lt;b&gt;EDGE OF SPIDER-VERSE #2&lt;/b&gt; AND &lt;b&gt;SPIDER-GWEN #1-5&lt;/b&gt;, WRITTEN BY JASON LATOUR AND ILLUSTRATED BY ROBBIE RODRIGUEZ.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The darker the sky, the brighter the stars.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a land on the brink of war, Shahrzad is forced from the arms of her beloved husband, the Caliph of Khorasan. She once thought Khalid a monster—a merciless killer of wives, responsible for immeasurable heartache and pain—but as she unraveled his secrets, she found instead an extraordinary man and a love she could not deny. Still, a curse threatens to keep Shazi and Khalid apart forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she’s reunited with her family, who have found refuge in the desert, where a deadly force is gathering against Khalid—a force set on destroying his empire and commanded by Shazi’s spurned childhood sweetheart. Trapped between loyalties to those she loves, the only thing Shazi can do is act. Using the burgeoning magic within her as a guide, she strikes out on her own to end both this terrible curse and the brewing war once and for all. But to do it, she must evade enemies of her own to stay alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The saga that began with &lt;i&gt;The Wrath and the Dawn&lt;/i&gt; takes its final turn as Shahrzad risks everything to find her way back to her one true love again.</description>

  <description>Hollywood critics agree. Joss Byrd is "fiercely emotional," a young actress with "complete conviction," and a "powerhouse." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joss Byrd is America's most celebrated young actress, but on the set of her latest project, a gritty indie film called The Locals, Joss's life is far from glamorous. While struggling with her mother's expectations, a crush on her movie brother, and a secret that could end her career, Joss must pull off a performance worthy of a star. When her renowned, charismatic director demands more than she is ready to deliver, Joss must go off-script to stay true to herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, s&lt;b&gt;oon to be a major motion picture; US release on June 3, 2016.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; They had nothing in common until love gave them everything to lose . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Louisa Clark is an ordinary girl living an exceedingly ordinary life—steady boyfriend, close family—who has barely been farther afield than their tiny village. She takes a badly needed job working for ex–Master of the Universe Will Traynor, who is wheelchair bound after an accident. Will has always lived a huge life—big deals, extreme sports, worldwide travel—and now he’s pretty sure he cannot live the way he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Will is acerbic, moody, bossy—but Lou refuses to treat him with kid gloves, and soon his happiness means more to her than she expected. When she learns that Will has shocking plans of his own, she sets out to show him that life is still worth living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Love Story&lt;/i&gt; for this generation, &lt;i&gt;Me Before You&lt;/i&gt; brings to life two people who couldn’t have less in common—a heartbreakingly romantic novel that asks, &lt;i&gt;What do you do when making the person you love happy also means breaking your own heart?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>This stunning debut captures the grotesque madness of a mystical under-land, as well as a girl's pangs of first love and independence. Alyssa Gardner hears the whispers of bugs and flowers--precisely the affliction that landed her mother in a mental hospital years before. This family curse stretches back to her ancestor Alice Liddell, the real-life inspiration for Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." Alyssa might be crazy, but she manages to keep it together. For now. When her mother's mental health takes a turn for the worse, Alyssa learns that what she thought was fiction is based in terrifying reality. The real Wonderland is a place far darker and more twisted than Lewis Carroll ever let on. There, Alyssa must pass a series of tests, including draining an ocean of Alice's tears, waking the slumbering tea party, and subduing a vicious bandersnatch, to fix Alice's mistakes and save her family. She must also decide whom to trust: Jeb, her gorgeous best friend and secret crush, or the sexy but suspicious Morpheus, her guide through Wonderland, who may have dark motives of his own.</description>

  <description>Over ten years since the Nazis won the war, 18 yr old Yael has one mission: to kill Hitler - a captivating second novel from Walled City author, Ryan Graudin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Once upon a different time, there was a girl who lived in a kingdom of death. Wolves howled up her arm. A whole pack of them-made of tattoo ink and pain, memory and loss. It was the only thing about her that ever stayed the same.Her story begins on a train. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Germania, 1956. Over ten years since the Nazis won the war. 18-year-old Yael is part of the resistance, and she has just one mission: to kill Hitler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first she's got to get close enough to him to do it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experimented on during her time at Auschwitz, Yael has the unique ability to change her appearance at will. The only part of her which always remains are the five tattooed wolves on her arm; one for each of the people she's lost. Using her abilities, she must transform into Adele Wolfe, Germany's most famous female rider and winner of the legendary Axis Tour; an epic long distance motorcycle race from Berlin to Tokyo, where only the strongest (and wiliest) riders survive. If she can win this, she will be able to get close enough to kill the Fuhrer and change history forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with other riders sabotaging her chances at every turn, Yael's mission won't be easy. . .</description>

  <description>This morning, Kady thought breaking up with Ezra was the hardest thing she’d have to do. This afternoon, her planet was invaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 2575, and two rival megacorporations are at war over a planet that’s little more than an ice-covered speck at the edge of the universe. Too bad nobody thought to warn the people living on it. With enemy fire raining down on them, Kady and Ezra—who are barely even talking to each other—are forced to fight their way onto an evacuating fleet, with an enemy warship in hot pursuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But their problems are just getting started. A deadly plague has broken out and is mutating, with terrifying results; the fleet's AI, which should be protecting them, may actually be their enemy; and nobody in charge will say what’s really going on. As Kady hacks into a tangled web of data to find the truth, it's clear only one person can help her bring it all to light: the ex-boyfriend she &lt;i&gt;swore&lt;/i&gt; she'd never speak to again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BRIEFING NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; Told through a fascinating dossier of hacked documents—including emails, schematics, military files, IMs, medical reports, interviews, and more—&lt;i&gt;Illuminae&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in a heart-stopping, high-octane trilogy about lives interrupted, the price of truth, and the courage of everyday heroes.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the Flying Start author of &lt;i&gt;Amy &amp;amp; Roger’s Epic Detour&lt;/i&gt;, a powerful novel about hope in the face of heartbreak. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor Edwards’ family might not be the closest-knit—everyone is a little too busy and overscheduled—but for the most part, they get along just fine. Then Taylor’s dad gets devastating news, and her parents decide that the family will spend one last summer all together at their old lake house in the Pocono Mountains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crammed into a place much smaller and more rustic than they are used to, they begin to get to know each other again. And Taylor discovers that the people she thought she had left behind haven’t actually gone anywhere. Her former best friend is still around, as is her first boyfriend…and he’s much cuter at seventeen than he was at twelve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the summer progresses and the Edwards become more of a family, they’re more aware than ever that they’re battling a ticking clock. Sometimes, though, there is just enough time to get a second chance—with family, with friends, and with love.</description>

  <description>Expect a bundle of joy—er, trouble—in this hilarious, heartwarming story from the award-winning author of Stupid Fast Geoff Herbach&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taco's mom always said, "Today is the best day of your life, and tomorrow will be even better." That was hard to believe the day she died of cancer and when Taco's dad had to move up north for work, but he sure did believe it when Maggie Corrigan agreed to go with him to junior prom. Taco loves Maggie- even more than the tacos that earned him his nickname. And she loves him right back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except all that love? It gets Maggie pregnant. Everyone else may be freaking out, but Taco can't wait to have a real family again. He just has to figure out what it means to be a dad and how to pass calculus. And then there's getting Maggie's parents to like him. Because it would be so much easier for them to be together if he didn't have to climb the side of the Corrigans' house to see her...</description>

  <description>Hope is dying. Hope Jackson has lived her short life to the fullest, but her four closest friends are dangling on the brink of disaster. Right before dying of a rare heart condition, Hope sets up a scavenger hunt across New York City using her graffiti art. The directions she leaves her friends are simple: Solve the clues hidden in her art, and they'll solve the problems haunting their lives. Hope is dead. Two days after her heart fails, Hope's friends are thrown together: Aiden, her best friend, whose plans to attend college have been scattered by his OCD. Kali, her foster sister, whose last ties to sanity are as razor-thin as her anorexic waistline. Erik, her high school crush, whose success as an athlete is based on a lie with no end in sight. And Sam, her online pen-pal, whose perfect life exploded into chaos in the aftermath of a school bombing. Together, the four teens take to the streets of New York to complete Hope's scavenger hunt and fulfill her dying wishes. But in order to unravel the clues hidden in Hope's graffiti, her friends will have to confront their personal demons head on. Hope is within reach.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It was the perfect trip…until it wasn’t.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eighteen-year-old Jill Charron wakes up in a hospital room, leg in a cast, stitches in her face and a big blank canvas where the last six weeks should be. She discovers she was involved in a fatal car accident while on a school trip in Italy. A trip she doesn’t even remember taking. She was jetted home by her affluent father in order to receive quality care. Care that includes a lawyer. And a press team. Because maybe the accident…wasn’t an accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the accident makes national headlines, Jill finds herself at the center of a murder investigation. It doesn’t help that the media is portraying her as a sociopath who killed her bubbly best friend, Simone, in a jealous rage. With the evidence mounting against her, there’s only one thing Jill knows for sure: She would never hurt Simone. But what really happened? Questioning who she can trust and what she’s capable of, Jill desperately tries to piece together the events of the past six weeks before she loses her thin hold on her once-perfect life.</description>

  <description>In a secret world where half-angel warriors called Shadowhunters are sworn to fight demons, parabatai is a sacred word. A parabatai is your best friend and battle partner. Parabatai can be everything to each other--but they can never fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;Emma Carstairs ia a Shadowhunter, the best in her generation. Together with her parabatai, Julian Blackthorn, she patrols the streets of Loa Angeles, where faeries--the most powerful of supranatural creatures--teeter on the edge of open war with Shadowhunters. When bodies--both faerie and human-turn up, bearing marks that match those found on Emma's own murdered parents, an uneasy alliance is formed. This is Emma's chance for revenge--and Julian's chance to get back to his brother, a prisoner of the faerie Courts. All they have to do is solve the murders within two weeks... and before the murderer target them.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;His world is music. Her world is silent.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Collins was a child prodigy destined to become one of the greatest musicians of the twenty-first century—until she was diagnosed with a life-changing brain tumor. Now, at seventeen, Ali lives in a soundless world where she gets by with American Sign Language and lip-reading. She’s a constant disappointment to her father, a retired cop fighting his own demons, and the bruises are getting harder to hide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ali accidentally wins a backstage tour with the chart-topping band Tone Deaf, she’s swept back into the world of music. Jace Beckett, the nineteen-year-old lead singer of the band, has a reputation. He’s a jerk and a player, and Ali wants nothing to do with him. But there’s more to Jace than the tabloids let on. When Jace notices Ali’s bruises and offers to help her escape to New York, Ali can’t turn down the chance at freedom and a fresh start. Soon she’s traveling cross-country, hidden away in Jace’s RV as the band finishes their nationwide tour. With the help of Jace, Ali sets out to reboot her life and rediscover the music she once loved.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A boy with extraordinary powers. An army of deadly monsters. An epic battle for the future of peculiardom.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adventure that began with &lt;i&gt;Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children&lt;/i&gt; and continued in &lt;i&gt;Hollow City&lt;/i&gt; comes to a thrilling conclusion with &lt;i&gt;Library of Souls&lt;/i&gt;. As the story opens, sixteen-year-old Jacob discovers a powerful new ability, and soon he’s diving through history to rescue his peculiar companions from a heavily guarded fortress. Accompanying Jacob on his journey are Emma Bloom, a girl with fire at her fingertips, and Addison MacHenry, a dog with a nose for sniffing out lost children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’ll travel from modern-day London to the labyrinthine alleys of Devil’s Acre, the most wretched slum in all of Victorian England. It’s a place where the fate of peculiar children everywhere will be decided once and for all. Like its predecessors, &lt;i&gt;Library of Souls&lt;/i&gt; blends thrilling fantasy with never-before-published vintage photography to create a one-of-a-kind reading experience.</description>

  <description>My name’s Sunny Grace Beaumont. Branded SGB/2/6895/03.12.93. Only child, self-taught computer geek and cancer survivor. Oh, and did I mention my dad’s the President? As you can imagine that’s sometimes a little problematic, especially when I want to sneak out. But it never got me into quite as much trouble as the night I ventured into the Ghetto – don’t ask me why I was there in the first place… it was stupid. Everyone knows that the Ghetto is where hardened criminals are sent to live out the remainder of their lives. At first the men that kidnap me are just as I’d imagine, mean and thoughtless, but slowly I begin to have doubts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I meet a guy. His name’s Sin, he has no Brand – a crime punishable by death – and he’s the rebel leader. I should hate him… but I don’t. Instead he opens my eyes to a whole other side of the Ghetto, where people are innocent of the crimes they’re accused of and helpless children suffer dreadful poverty. Is it possible that I’ve been lied to my entire life… that the governments been deceiving everyone? And how can I challenge the law my own dad is adamant to uphold?</description>

  <description>From the New York Times bestselling author of The Selection series comes this sweeping standalone fantasy romance. A girl with a secret. The boy of her dreams. An ocean between them.&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the ages, the Ocean has occasionally rescued young women from drowning. To repay their debt, these young women must serve for 100 years as Sirens, remaining young and beautiful and using their deadly voices to lure strangers into watery graves. To keep their true nature secret, Sirens must never speak to humans, and must be careful never to stay in the same place for too long. But once her century of service is over, each Siren gets a chance to start over – a chance to live the mortal life that was almost stolen from her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kahlen became a Siren after her family died in a terrible shipwreck, decades ago. And though a single word from her can kill, she can’t resist spending her days on land, watching ordinary people and longing for the day when she will be able to speak and laugh and live freely among them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kahlen is resigned to finishing her sentence in solitude…until she meets Akinli. Handsome, caring, and kind, Akinli is everything Kahlen ever dreamed of. And though she can’t talk to him, they soon forge a connection neither of them can deny… and Kahlen doesn’t want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falling in love with a human breaks all of the Ocean’s rules, and if the Ocean discovers Kahlen’s feelings, she’ll be forced to leave Akinli for good. But for the first time in a lifetime of following the rules, Kahlen is determined to follow her heart.</description>

      <![CDATA[You can read my full review on <b> <a href="https://theimpossiblegirlblog.wordpress.com/2016/03/18/the-siren-by-kiera-cass-book-review/" rel="nofollow">Life and Other Disasters!</a> </b><br /><br />I really, really enjoyed the melancholy of this book. The romance was bittersweet (even if it came very quickly), but I felt it was much more about friendship and family in the end. The Siren sisterhood is such a deep bond and they are always there...</a>]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;‘Everybody likes everything these days. The whole world is a nerd.’&lt;br /&gt;‘Are you mad because other people like Star Wars? Are you mad because people like me like Star Wars?’&lt;br /&gt;‘Maybe.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you broke Elena’s heart, &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; would spill out. So when she decides to queue outside her local cinema to see the new movie, she’s expecting a celebration with crowds of people who love Han, Luke and Leia just as much as she does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What she’s not expecting is to be last in a line of only three people; to have to pee into a collectible &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; soda cup behind a dumpster or to meet that unlikely someone who just might truly understand the way she feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kindred Spirits&lt;/i&gt; is an engaging short story by Rainbow Rowell, author of the bestselling &lt;i&gt;Eleanor &amp;amp; Park&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fangirl&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Carry On&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Kindred Spirits&lt;/i&gt; has been specially produced for World Book Day.</description>

  <description>Lily Proctor has made it back to her own universe, and it's finally time for her and Rowan to be happy and relax. True, she almost died in the Pyre that fueled their escape, and they must hide her new magic for the safety of the world, but compared to fighting the monstrous Woven and leading armies in the alternate Salem, life is looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'You think I'm a monster, but my choices, as ruthless as they seem, are justified.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Lillian, ruthless ruler of the 13 Cities, is not willing to let Lily go that easily. Lily is the closest version of herself she's ever seen in all her worldwalking, and Lillian's running out of time. If she can't persuade Lily and Rowan to return to her world, she'll have to find a way to make them come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firewalker - the follow-up to Trial By Fire - is another sexy, fast-paced thrill ride from internationally bestselling author of the Starcrossed series, Josephine Angelini!</description>

  <description>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Red Rising thrilled readers and announced the presence of a talented new author. Golden Son changed the game and took the story of Darrow to the next level. Now comes the exhilarating conclusion to the Red Rising Trilogy: Morning Star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darrow would have lived in peace, but his enemies brought him war. The Gold overlords demanded his obedience, hanged his wife, and enslaved his people. But Darrow is determined to fight back. Risking everything to transform himself and breach Gold society, Darrow has battled to survive the cutthroat rivalries that breed Society’s mightiest warriors, climbed the ranks, and waited patiently to unleash the revolution that will tear the hierarchy apart from within.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally, the time has come.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But devotion to honor and hunger for vengeance run deep on both sides. Darrow and his comrades-in-arms face powerful enemies without scruple or mercy. Among them are some Darrow once considered friends. To win, Darrow will need to inspire those shackled in darkness to break their chains, unmake the world their cruel masters have built, and claim a destiny too long denied—and too glorious to surrender.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“Was this story written about me?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shrugged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes or no?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shrugged again, finally earning a little scowl, which somehow made the girl even more pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It’s very rude not to answer simple questions,” she said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gestured for my journal, but she still wouldn’t give it to me. So I took out my pen and wrote on my palm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t, I wrote. Then, in tiny letters below it: Now don’t you feel like a jerk?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parker Santé hasn’t spoken a word in five years. While his classmates plan for bright futures, he skips school to hang out in hotels, killing time by watching the guests. But when he meets a silver-haired girl named Zelda Toth, a girl who claims to be quite a bit older than she looks, he’ll discover there just might be a few things left worth living for.</description>

  <description>Ever since she used the Firebird, her parents' invention, to cross into alternate dimensions, Marguerite has caught the attention of enemies who will do anything to force her into helping them dominate the multiverse—even hurting the people she loves. She resists until her boyfriend, Paul, is attacked and his consciousness scattered across multiple dimensions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marguerite has no choice but to search for each splinter of Paul’s soul. The hunt sends her racing through a war-torn San Francisco, the criminal underworld of New York City, and a glittering Paris where another Marguerite hides a shocking secret. Each world brings Marguerite one step closer to rescuing Paul. But with each trial she faces, she begins to question the destiny she thought they shared.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Love has no rules.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been a year since Eden Munro last saw Tyler Bruce: her stepbrother…and secret love. Although they swore to ignore their feelings and put their family first, Eden can’t help but feel excited when Tyler invites her to join him in New York City for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it’s not like anything is going to happen. Eden is happy with her boyfriend Dean, and she knows gorgeous, green-eyed Tyler must have moved on as well. But as they spend the long, hot summer in the city that never sleeps, it becomes obvious that those old feelings are still there…simmering beneath the surface. Will Tyler and Eden be able to resist temptation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Did I Mention I Need You?&lt;/i&gt; is book two in Wattpad sensation Estelle Maskame’s DIMILY trilogy: three unforgettable summers of secrets, heartbreak and forbidden romance.</description>

  <description>As a Red, Darrow grew up working the mines deep beneath the surface of Mars, enduring backbreaking labor while dreaming of the better future he was building for his descendants. But the Society he faithfully served was built on lies. Darrow’s kind have been betrayed and denied by their elitist masters, the Golds—and their only path to liberation is revolution. And so Darrow sacrifices himself in the name of the greater good for which Eo, his true love and inspiration, laid down her own life. He becomes a Gold, infiltrating their privileged realm so that he can destroy it from within. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lamb among wolves in a cruel world, Darrow finds friendship, respect, and even love—but also the wrath of powerful rivals. To wage and win the war that will change humankind’s destiny, Darrow must confront the treachery arrayed against him, overcome his all-too-human desire for retribution—and strive not for violent revolt but a hopeful rebirth. Though the road ahead is fraught with danger and deceit, Darrow must choose to follow Eo’s principles of love and justice to free his people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He must live for more.</description>

  <description>In Earth’s battle-ridden future, humans have evolved. Those with extraordinary skills rise to power and fame. Those without live in poverty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Willow Kent believed she was normal. But when a genetically-advanced military officer shows up in her village and questions her identity, long-buried secrets begin to emerge. With remarkable skills and a shocking genetic code the Core and its enemies will do anything to obtain, Willow suddenly finds the freedom she craves slipping through her fingers. Greed, corruption, and genetic tampering threaten every aspect of her existence as she’s thrust, unwilling, into the sophisticated culture of the elite Core city. To ensure peace, she must leave the past behind, marry a man she’s never met, and submit to the authority of a relentless officer with a hidden agenda of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her life has become a dangerous game. How much will she sacrifice in order to win?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Don't call them heroes. But these six Californian teens have powers that set them apart&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan aka Scam has a voice inside him that'll say whatever people want to hear, whether it's true or not. Which is handy, except when it isn't - like when the voice starts gabbing in the middle of a bank robbery. The only people who can help are the other Zeroes, who aren't exactly best friends these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Nate, aka Bellwether, the group's 'glorious leader.' After Scam's SOS, he pulls the scattered Zeroes back together. But when the rescue blows up in their faces, the Zeroes find themselves propelled into whirlwind encounters with ever more dangerous criminals. At the heart of the chaos they find Kelsie, who can take a crowd in the palm of her hand and tame it or let it loose as she pleases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with high-stakes action and drama, &lt;i&gt;Zeroes&lt;/i&gt; unites three powerhouse authors for the opening installment of a thrilling new series.</description>

  <description>It’s Wolfstime, the foreboding period around each full moon when villagers must protect their homes and families against the giant, ferocious wolves that roam the forest. On the day Red turned thirteen, Granny gave her a special red cloak upon which a spell had been cast to protect Red from wolves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red is now sixteen and is desperately trying to fit in among her peers, save Granny’s failing bakery business, and, of course, protect herself from wolves. Her crush on Peter and her determination not to let the mean girls sabotage her blossoming romance cause Red to make some questionable choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will these choices let the wolves in? Will Red pick the right battle? Will her skills be strong enough to keep her alive?</description>

  <description>Hugo est un jeune homme de son temps, accro à Internet et aux jeux vidéo, entre deux petits boulots. Il voit sa vie soudainement bouleversée le jour où il trouve dans son salon un robot doté d'une intelligence artificielle.&lt;br /&gt;Baptisé Roger, celui-ci a pour principale caractéristique une incapacité totale à mentir, en plus d'une curiosité aiguisée pour le mode de vie si curieux des étranges créatures qui partagent désormais sa vie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Le célèbre youtuber et phénomène web Cyprien Iov s'offre une première incursion dans le monde de la BD, avec cet album émaillé de vannes vachardes et relevé d'une pointe de nonsense des plus réjouissants.&lt;br /&gt;Accompagné de Paka au dessin, il livre ici une aventure qui met aux prises un robot en cavale avec des humains plus imparfaits les uns que les autres, en un cocktail détonnant et furieusement efficace, qui mêle chroniques de la génération Y, humour grinçant, références geeks, action et espionnage. Divisé en strips de trois cases qui peuvent se lire indépendamment, mais forment également une histoire complète et un univers cohérent, cet album est le premier d'une nouvelle série à suivre de très près !</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Emily likes her life the way it is: doting parents, good friends, good school in a safe neighborhood. Sure, she's curious about her biological father—the one who chose life in a motorcycle club, the Reign of Terror, over being a parent—but that doesn't mean she wants to be a part of his world. But when a reluctant visit turns into an extended summer vacation among relatives she never knew she had, one thing becomes clear: nothing is what it seems. Not the club, not her secret-keeping father and not Oz, a guy with suck-me-in blue eyes who can help her understand them both. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oz wants one thing: to join the Reign of Terror. They're the good guys. They protect people. They're…family. And while Emily—the gorgeous and sheltered daughter of the club's most respected member—is in town, he's gonna prove it to her. So when her father asks him to keep her safe from a rival club with a score to settle, Oz knows it's his shot at his dream. What he doesn't count on is that Emily just might turn that dream upside down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one wants them to be together. But sometimes the right person is the one you least expect, and the road you fear the most is the one that leads you home.</description>

      <![CDATA[4.5 stars to Nowhere But Here!<br /><br />This book reminded me of why I like Katie McGarry's stories so much. There is always a lot of drama - a bit of the every day kind and then some extra that drives the story to extremes. The characters are quirky and lovable and the chemistry between the MC...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The romantic companion to&lt;i&gt; My Life Next Door&lt;/i&gt;—great for fans of Sarah Dessen and Jenny Han. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tim Mason was The Boy Most Likely To find the liquor cabinet blindfolded, need a liver transplant, and drive his car into a house&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Alice Garrett was The Girl Most Likely To . . . well, not date her little brother’s baggage-burdened best friend, for starters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For Tim, it wouldn’t be smart to fall for Alice. For Alice, nothing could be scarier than falling for Tim. But Tim has never been known for making the smart choice, and Alice is starting to wonder if the “smart” choice is always the right one. When these two crash into each other, they crash hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Told in Tim’s and Alice’s distinctive, disarming, entirely compelling voices, this novel is for readers of&lt;i&gt; The Spectacular Now&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Paper Towns&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>E.E. Cummings is without question one of the major poets of this century, and this volume, first published in 1959, is indispensable for every lover of modern lyrical verse. It contains one hundred of Cummings’s wittiest and most profound poems, harvested from thirty-five of the most radically creative years in contemporary American poetry. These poems exhibit all the extraordinary lyricism, playfulness, technical ingenuity, and compassion for which Cummings is famous. They demonstrate beautifully his extrapolations from traditional poetic structures and his departures from them, as well as the unique synthesis of lavish imagery and acute artistic precision that has won him the adulation and respect of critics and poetry lovers everywhere.</description>

  <description>This world is trying to kill Lily Proctor. Her life-threatening allergies keep her from enjoying experiences that others in her hometown of Salem take for granted, which is why she is determined to enjoy her first high school party with her best friend and longtime crush, Tristan. But after a humiliating incident in front of half her graduating class, Lily wishes she could just disappear.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, Lily is in a different Salem—one overrun with horrifying creatures and ruled by powerful women called Crucibles. Strongest and cruelest of them all is Lillian . . . Lily's other self in this alternate universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes Lily weak at home is what makes her extraordinary in New Salem. In this confusing world, Lily is torn between responsibilities she can't hope to shoulder alone and a love she never expected.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Seven students. Seven (deadly) sins. One secret.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paloma High School is ordinary by anyone’s standards. It’s got the same cliques, the same prejudices, the same suspect cafeteria food. And like every high school, every student has something to hide—from Kat, the thespian who conceals her trust issues onstage, to Valentine, the neurotic genius who’s planted the seed of a school scandal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When that scandal bubbles over, and rumors of a teacher-student affair surface, everyone starts hunting for someone to blame. For the seven unlikely allies at the heart of it all, the collision of their seven ordinary-seeming lives results in extraordinary change.</description>

  <description>The Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Review&lt;br /&gt;Georgia Byng's mind-bending heroine makes a California-bound comeback, this time heading to L.A. to stop a power-hungry businessman from hypnotizing his way into the presidency of the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Molly learns that Lucy Logan has a dangerous job for her -- stop multibillionaire (and ultra-strong hypnotist) Primo Cell in his tracks -- the orphan thinks this task might be more than she can handle. Thankfully, she has Rocky and other characters along for the trip, and Molly soon finds herself hobnobbing with Hollywood stars. But Molly learns that Primo has the power of permanent hypnotism that can only be broken by a secret password -- how can she reverse his effects? Molly discovers a startling surprise -- she has time-stopping powers of her own -- and after Primo's son saves them from near death, she finds out that her problems have only just begun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glittering with even more action and adventure than Byng's first book, &lt;i&gt;Molly Moon's Incredible Book of Hypnotism,&lt;/i&gt; this sequel will have readers starry-eyed for more. Plot-twisting turns of events keep coming throughout, and with all of Molly's personal revelations, fans will feel like their world has stopped, too, until the last page. &lt;i&gt;Shana Taylor&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An unflinching, darkly funny, and deeply moving story of a boy, his seriously ill mother, and an unexpected monstrous visitor.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At seven minutes past midnight, thirteen-year-old Conor wakes to find a monster outside his bedroom window. But it isn't the monster Conor's been expecting-- he's been expecting the one from his nightmare, the nightmare he's had nearly every night since his mother started her treatments. The monster in his backyard is different. It's ancient. And wild. And it wants something from Conor. Something terrible and dangerous. It wants the truth. From the final idea of award-winning author Siobhan Dowd-- whose premature death from cancer prevented her from writing it herself-- Patrick Ness has spun a haunting and darkly funny novel of mischief, loss, and monsters both real and imagined.</description>

  <description>Travis Parker has everything a man could want: a good job, loyal friends, even a waterfront home in small-town North Carolina. In full pursuit of the good life -- boating, swimming, and regular barbecues with his good-natured buddies -- he holds the vague conviction that a serious relationship with a woman would only cramp his style. That is, until Gabby Holland moves in next door. Despite his attempts to be neighborly, the appealing redhead seems to have a chip on her shoulder about him...and the presence of her longtime boyfriend doesn't help. Despite himself, Travis can't stop trying to ingratiate himself with his new neighbor, and his persistent efforts lead them both to the doorstep of a journey that neither could have foreseen. Spanning the eventful years of young love, marriage and family, The Choice ultimately confronts us with the most heartwrenching question of all: how far would you go to keep the hope of love alive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Did You Know?---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabby was named after one of the former athletes on the track team that Nicholas coaches?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second novel, along with A Walk to Remember, that Nicholas set in Beaufort, North Carolina?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis’s character was modeled after Nicholas’s brother Micah?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The structure of The Choice was modeled after The Notebook?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The Earth is dying. Darrow is a Red, a miner in the interior of Mars. His mission is to extract enough precious elements to one day tame the surface of the planet and allow humans to live on it. The Reds are humanity's last hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so it appears, until the day Darrow discovers it's all a lie. That Mars has been habitable - and inhabited - for generations, by a class of people calling themselves the Golds. A class of people who look down on Darrow and his fellows as slave labour, to be exploited and worked to death without a second thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the day that Darrow, with the help of a mysterious group of rebels, disguises himself as a Gold and infiltrates their command school, intent on taking down his oppressors from the inside. But the command school is a battlefield - and Darrow isn't the only student with an agenda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Break the chains. Live for more.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Ramona and Sam are best friends. She fell for him the moment they met, but their friendship is just too important for her to mess up. Sam loves April, but he would never expect her to feel the same way-she's too quirky and cool for someone like him. Together, they have a band, and put all of their feelings for each other into music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Ramona and Sam meet Tom. He's their band's missing piece, and before Ramona knows it, she's falling for him. But she hasn't fallen out of love with Sam either. How can she be true to her feelings without breaking up the band?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Educators and librarians looking for fast-moving, interesting plots, in-depth characters, and meaningful themes need to add this one to their shelves."-VOYA praise for If He Had Been with Me</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I can't go back in the house. I'm restless, prickling all over. The wind hits me like slaps from huge invisible hands. But it's not the wind that worries me. It's something else, beyond the storm...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sapphire and her brother Conor can't forget their adventures in Ingo, the mysterious world beneath the sea. They long to see their Mer friends once more. But a crisis is brewing far below the ocean's surface, where Saldowr, the wisest of the Mer, guards the Tide Knot. And soon both Sapphire and Conor will be drawn into Ingo's troubled waters.</description>

  <description>Ketika Mathew Trewhella pergi dari rumahnya dan tidak pernah pulang lagi, orang-orang percaya dia sudah mati di tengah laut, tetapi putrinya, Sapphire, yakin sekali ayahnya masih hidup. Dia teringat kisah-kisah yang sering diceritakan ayahnya, tentang putri duyung Zennor yang jatuh cinta pada manusia namun tak bisa hidup bersama kekasihnya di daratan kering penuh udara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Musim panas berikutnya, Conor, kakak lelaki Sapphire, mulai sering menghabiskan waktu berjam-jam di laut, bersama seorang gadis misterius. Pada waktu mengikuti Conor itulah Sapphire menemukan Ingo---dunia bawah laut yang sangat memikat namun berbahaya. Dan makin lama makin sulit baginya untuk menolak panggilan dunia lain itu</description>
