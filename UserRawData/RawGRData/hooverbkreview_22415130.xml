  <description>&lt;b&gt;'Astonishing . . . A fascinating, detailed and dramatic story of one of Rome's most notorious emperors'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; SUNDAY EXPRESS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Commodus&lt;/i&gt; is a brilliant, thrilling novel about one of Rome's most intriguing - and notorious - emperors, for fans of Simon Scarrow, Conn Iggulden, Christian Cameron, Ben Kane and Harry Sidebottom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rome is enjoying a period of stability and prosperity. The Empire's borders are growing, and there are two sons in the imperial succession for the first time in Rome's history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all is not as it appears. Cracks are beginning to show. Two decades of war have taken their toll, and there are whispers of a sickness in the East. The Empire stands on the brink of true disaster, an age of gold giving way to one of iron and rust, a time of reason and strength sliding into hunger and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decline may yet be halted, though. One man tries to hold the fracturing empire together. To Rome, he is their emperor, their Hercules, their Commodus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Commodus is breaking up himself, and when the darkness grips, only one woman can hold &lt;i&gt;him &lt;/i&gt;together. To Rome she was nothing. The plaything of the emperor. To Commodus, she was everything. She was Marcia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the author of the critically acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Caligula &lt;/i&gt;('an engrossing new spin on a well-known tale' - &lt;i&gt;The Times&lt;/i&gt;) comes the new novel in The Damned Emperors series: &lt;i&gt;Commodus&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHAT READERS ARE SAYING ABOUT THE DAMNED EMPEROR SERIES&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'&lt;i&gt;Commodus&lt;/i&gt; by Simon Turney is &lt;b&gt;my sort of historical fiction &lt;/b&gt;- people who actually lived - with their lives told in an intriguing and interesting way' - Amazon review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Truly &lt;b&gt;a magnificent read&lt;/b&gt;, insightful, powerful, emotional and gripping from the start' - Amazon review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Simon Turner is &lt;b&gt;a first class writer&lt;/b&gt;, and he certainly did his research well' Amazon review</description>

  <description>Lexington, Kentucky, 1859. After saving John Hunt Morgan from a puma attack, fifteen-year-old farm boy Will Crump joins Hunt’s militia, the Lexington Rifles. Morgan mentors Will and enrolls him in the local university, where he hopes to study law. As tensions rise between the North and South, Will is torn between his loyalty to Morgan and his love for his family. Will’s father, sisters, and sweetheart follow the Union, while Morgan and Will commit to the South. As part of Morgan’s band, Will participates in ambushes and unconventional warfare until his first real battle at Shiloh. He fights bravely, but increasingly questions what the war is accomplishing, and whether his devotion to honor has led him astray. And where is God in all this killing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will’s sister Albinia, friend of the Clay family, becomes increasingly aware of the plight of the slaves. When she finds Luther, a slave she knows, trying to escape, she must decide between her conscience, and her friends. She becomes involved in the Underground Railroad, helping slaves to freedom – but will it cost her love and her freedom?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will’s other sister, Julia, is approaching spinster status and despairs of ever meeting a man who can give her more than life on a farm until she meets Hiram Johannsen, a son of immigrants who owns a steamship company. They marry and she makes a new life in the North. When Hiram answers the call to fight for the North, Julia runs the steamboat company in her husband’s absence and uses her boats to help Albinia ferry escaped slaves to freedom. Her business relations put her in the perfect position to spy for the North. When the Confederates capture her, will she survive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luther is one of the first slaves Albinia helps flee the South after his master cruelly abuses his mother and sister. He escapes with his family, and when war breaks out, he fights for the North as an auxiliary of the Third Ohio Cavalry, alongside Julia’s husband, Hiram, and against Morgan and Will. Luther has to confront the demons of his past, an abusive master, and a slave catcher that kills his little sister. Will the desire for revenge destroy him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the war, Will is forced to examine and question everything he believes in—his faith in God, his love for his family, his loyalty to Morgan, and his worth as a human being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will and his family must somehow mend the torn fabric of relationships to find peace, and reach Across the Great Divide.</description>

  <description>Mid 1970s. Ex-Praetorian Aurelia Mitela is serving as Roma Nova’s interim ambassador in London. Asked by a British colleague to find his missing son, Aurelia thinks it will only be a case of a young man temporarily rebelling. He’s bound to turn up only a little worse for wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a spate of high-level killings pulls Aurelia away into a dangerous pan-European investigation. Badly beaten in Rome as a warning, she discovers the killers have kidnapped her life companion, Miklós, and sent an ultimatum: Back off or he’ll die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Aurelia is a Roma Novan and they never give up…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set between AURELIA and INSURRECTIO in the Aurelia Mitela Roma Nova adventures</description>

  <description>Eighteen-year-old Tom Murrell could never understand his father’s dreams of carving a new life out of the wilderness. He wanted to do something else with his life besides spend it behind a plow, but with the family moving to the Red River in Arkansaw Territory, he was stuck.&lt;br /&gt;Everything changes for Tom when he witnesses the death of Tiatesun, spiritual leader of the Kadohadacho tribe, and is drawn into a raging conflict between the Kado and their arch enemies, a renegade band of Osage.&lt;br /&gt;His new friends Mattie and James say there is no alternative. They must use a cryptic map, drawn in a bible by Tiatesun in his own blood before he died, to find this place called Na-Da-cah-ah. Only then can Tom be sure that his family and friends will be safe.&lt;br /&gt;But it is a race against time—a race against Wey Chutta’s Osage. Dangers are everywhere. The only chance to save his family is for Tom, Mattie, and James to join with six Kado warriors, make sense from the many clues they uncover on their quest, and discover the real Na-Da-cah-ah.</description>

  <description>A curse, a conspiracy and the clash of kingdoms. A defiant priestess confronts her foes, armed only with ingenuity and forbidden magic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A malignant curse from the Underworld threatens Tesha’s city with fiery devastation. The young priestess of Ishana, goddess of love and war, must overcome this demonic darkness. Charred remains of an enemy of the Hitolian Empire reveal both treason and evil magic. Into this crisis, King Hattu, the younger brother of the Great King, arrives to make offerings to the goddess Ishana, but he conceals his true mission in the city. As a connection sparks between King Hattu and Tesha, the Grand Votary accuses Hattu of murderous sorcery and jails him under penalty of death. Isolated in prison, Hattu’s only hope lies in Tesha to uncover the conspiracy against him. Unfortunately, the Grand Votary is Tesha’s father, a rash, unyielding man, and now her worst enemy. To help Hattu, she must risk destroying her own father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step into this exotic world of historical fantasy, with its richly imagined details of the Bronze Age, evocative of the Near East. In a whirlpool of magic, politics, family crisis and love, Tesha pursues justice over the dark forces arrayed against her.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; A desolate wasteland. A mission gone wrong. An impossible goal. A gripping new series of Ancient Rome &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roman scout &lt;b&gt;Silus &lt;/b&gt;is deep behind enemy lines in Caledonia. As he spies on a raiding party, he is abruptly discovered by an enemy chief and his son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mounting a one man ambush, everything quickly goes wrong. Silus must run for his life, the head of the enemy leader in his hands. Little does he know the price he will pay...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Silus is inducted into the Arcani, an elite faction of assassins and spies, he must return to Caledonia, back into the wilderness, and risk everything in the service of his Caesar. The odds don’t look good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failure is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A blood-soaked and unputdownable Roman thriller, anchored in detailed historical research, perfect for fans of Ben Kane, Conn Iggulden and Robert Fabbri&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; Praise for Alex Gough &lt;p&gt;'Gritty and real, exciting and pacy, this is first rate historical fiction, and Gough is clearly ready to take his place among the leading writers of the genre' SJA Turney, author of the Praetorian series&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Palace intrigue, passion, deceit, betrayal, and tragedy—this is the story of King Kasyapa and his beloved Sigiriya. Born of a village girl and a warrior king, he is denied the crown because of his inferior birth - but is forced to become king. Accused of murdering his father, he abandons his capital and builds a new city in the inhospitable forests of Sri Lanka. There, he lives in a spectacular sky palace atop a massive rock two hundred meters high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also the story of Amira, a beautiful girl from Afghanistan who is only twelve years old when she is sold into slavery. At eighteen, she is traded for a hundred pearls from Sri Lanka. Arriving at her new home, she is trained as a concubine in Kasyapa’s harem and becomes his favorite consort. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set fifteen hundred years ago, this spellbinding novel weaves historical facts into a remarkably entertaining story of fate, dangerous alliances, enduring friendships, and forbidden love.</description>

  <description>Shahnaz is a liberal but observant Pakistani Muslim, a nurse with a dream that all pregnant women will deliver healthy babies. At her parents’ command she weds Naseer, a gentle man who encourages her work. But marrying Naseer means she must live with his extended family, including his fundamentalist older brother, Raja Haider. When their father dies, Raja Haider becomes head of the family. With this new power, he orders Shahnaz to quit her job and stay at home. Mild Naseer respects his brother’s authority, but Shahnaz rebels with the strength of a courageous warrior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush explores a Muslim society threatened by extremism. The story churns with the struggles of obedience versus self-determination, piety versus zealotry, and tradition versus progress. Some seek peace, and others pursue violence to achieve what’s holy.</description>

  <description>Wanders Far lived in dangerous times and was faced with one difficult challenge after another. He was a skinny, quiet boy who was raised on the banks of a tributary of New York State's Mohawk River, hundreds of years before colonists arrived. One lifetime was not enough for Wanders Far's old soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a very young age, his wanderlust compelled him down one path after another. No village could contain him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was happy living a simple life in the physical world during challenging times. The spirit world had other plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wise, enigmatic shaman mentored Wanders Far and helped him cultivate the supernatural visions that haunted him.

  <description>A generation after Hengest and Horsa carved out a kingdom in the east, a hero of the Britons rises in the west...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;North Wales, 480 A.D. The sons of Cunedag have ruled Venedotia for fifty years but the chief of them - the Pendraig - is now dying. His sons Cadwallon and Owain must fight to retain their birthright from their envious cousins. As civil war consumes Venedotia, Arthur - a young warrior and bastard son of the Pendraig - is sent on a perilous quest that will determine the fate of the kingdom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Morgens; nine priestesses of the Mother Goddess have found the cauldron of rebirth - a symbol of otherworldly power - and have allied themselves with the enemy. Arthur and six companions are dispatched to the mysterious island of Ynys Mon to steal the cauldron and break the power of the Morgens. Along the way they run into the formidable Guenhuifar whose family have been stewards of Ynys Mon for generations. They need her help. The trouble is, Guenhuifar despises Arthur's family and all they stand for...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the earliest Arthurian legends, Sign of the White Foal is a rip-roaring adventure of Celtic myth and real history set in the ruins of post-Roman Britain.</description>

  <description>1374. When a member of one of York’s most prominent families is found dead in the woods, his throat torn out, rumours spread like wildfire that wolves are running loose throughout the city. Persuaded to investigate by the victim’s father, Owen Archer is convinced that a human killer is responsible. But before he can gather sufficient evidence to prove his case, a second body is discovered, stabbed to death. Is there a connection? What secrets are contained within the victim’s household? And what does apprentice healer Alisoun know that she’s not telling? Teaming up with Geoffrey Chaucer, who is in York on a secret mission on behalf of Prince Edward, Owen’s enquiries will draw him headlong into a deadly conspiracy.</description>

  <description>Britannia, 45 AD: Vespasian's brother, Sabinus, is captured by druids. The druids want to offer a potent sacrifice to their gods - not just one Roman Legate, but two. They know that Vespasian will come after his brother and they plan to sacrifice the siblings on mid-summer's day. But to whom will they be making this sacrifice? What were the gods of this land before the Celts came? Only the druids still hold the secret and it is one of pure malevolence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vespasian must strive to save his brother whilst completing the conquest of the south-west of the haunted isle, before he is drawn inexorably back to Rome and the heart of Imperial politics. Claudius' three freedmen remain at the locus of power. As Messalina's time as Empress comes to a bloody end, the three freedmen each back a different mistress. But which woman will be victorious? And at what price for Vespasian?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Four sons. One throne. A world on the precipice.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1315 BC: Tensions soar between the great powers of the Late Bronze Age. The Hittites stand toe-to-toe with Egypt, Assyria and Mycenaean Ahhiyawa, and war seems inevitable. More, the fierce Kaskan tribes – age-old enemies of the Hittites – amass at the northern borders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Prince Hattu is born, it should be a rare joyous moment for all the Hittite people. But when the Goddess Ishtar comes to King Mursili in a dream, she warns that the boy is no blessing, telling of a dark future where he will stain Mursili’s throne with blood and bring destruction upon the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, Hattu endures a solitary boyhood in the shadow of his siblings, spurned by his father and shunned by the Hittite people. But when the Kaskans invade, Hattu is drawn into the fray. It is a savage journey in which he strives to show his worth and valour. Yet with his every step, the shadow of Ishtar’s prophecy darkens…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Empires of Bronze: Son of Ishtar:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A meticulously researched and vivid reimagining of an almost forgotten civilisation" - Douglas Jackson, bestselling author of the celebrated Gaius Valerius Verrens series&lt;br /&gt;"Vivid, immersive...wondrous!" - SJA Turney, bestselling author of Marius' Mules and The Damned Emperors.&lt;br /&gt;"An action-packed epic" - Matthew Harffy, bestselling author of the acclaimed Bernicia Chronicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Hittites &amp;amp; the Bronze Age:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over three thousand years ago, before iron had been tamed, before Rome had risen, before the ashes from which Classical Greece would emerge had even been scattered, the world was forged in bronze. It was an age when Great Kings ruled, when vast armies clashed for glory, riches and the favour of their strange gods.&lt;br /&gt;Until the late 19th century, historians thought that they had identified the major powers who held sway in the last stretch of the Bronze Age: Egypt, Assyria… Ahhiyawa (Homer’s Achaean Greece) even. But there was another – a fourth great power, all but lost to the dust of history: the Hittites.&lt;br /&gt;Hardy, fierce masters of Anatolia, utterly devout to their myriad gods, the scale and wonder of their world is only now shedding its dusty cloak thanks to the tireless work of archaeologists. The Hittites ruled from the high, rugged plateau at the heart of modern-day Turkey, commanding a ring of vassal states (most notably Troy) and boasting a dauntless army that struck fear into the hearts of their rivals. Their Great King, titled Labarna and revered as the Sun itself, was every bit the equal of Egypt’s Pharaoh, of the trade-rich King of Assyria, and of the brash lords of Ahhiyawa.&lt;br /&gt;The Hittites were there when the Bronze Age collapsed. They bore the brunt of the cataclysmic events that destroyed the great powers, threw the Near East into a centuries-long dark age and changed the world forever.&lt;br /&gt;This is their story…</description>

  <description>Not all enemies are visible.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the most defiant ones exist only in the heart and mind.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Defiler of Prille and his hound are dead, and the houses of Sajen and Vitus are united. With the birth of a new heir to the throne, peace settles over Agrius.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it's a fragile peace.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As King Casmir works to restore the former glory of his inheritance, rumors of betrayal and treachery reach the throne, threatening to shatter everything he has worked hard to achieve.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When old enemies surface, the rumors become real. Disaster strikes, plunging him into a darkness that feels palpable.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Many advisers step forward to help, but it's never easy to determine friend from foe when it comes to the power around the throne.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Faced with the decision to forge his own path and stay true to his honor, or to become like his father, a man he despised, his bonds of unity are tested. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To the point of breaking.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What compromises will he make to secure the future of his family and his kingdom?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will he lose both himself and the ones he loves?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Follow his journey into darkness.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Go Down the Mountain&lt;/i&gt; was inspired by the stories of the people who lost their homes to Shenandoah National Park in the 1930s. At once dramatic adventure, moving love story and recollection of a vanished life, the story follows mountain girl Bee on her harrowing journey to discover the truth about her family, living and dead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bee is a nervy, teenage beauty whose beloved father's sudden death in a snake charming accident has left her alone with her abusive mother. Her one salvation is Miles, the big-city photographer who promises escape and a life full of the adventure she craves. But when Bee is caught in a dangerous cat-and-mouse game with a government man who takes her family's land and won't stop until he claims her too, it may be Torch, the boy she grew up with on the mountain, who becomes the man she needs.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Risk everything; fight to the last: a taut and intense historical thriller from master author S.J.A. Turney&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relics of Christendom have been plundered during the long Moorish conquest of the Iberian peninsula. Newly minted Templar Sergeant Arnau de Vallbona must recover one of the most elusive to save his priory at Rourell in Spain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travelling to Majorca on a stealth mission to retrieve the bones of St Stephen, Arnau soon discovers the raid is more complex than it first appears: the mighty Almohad dynasty has laid claim to the island, and will fight them every step of the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with his companion, the aged warrior Balthesar, Arnau is in desperate straits. Surrounded on all sides by hostile forces, it will take all their cunning and strength to escape with their prize – and their lives.... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A thrilling and unexplored account of the Knights Templar, grounded in extraordinary research, The Last Emir is perfect for fans of Bernard Cornwell, K.M. Ashman and C.F. Iggulden.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>AD 915.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Orkney Isles, a young woman flees her home to save the life of her unborn child. Eighteen years later, a witch foretells that evil from her past is reaching out again to threaten her son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outlawed from his home in Iceland, Einar Unnsson is thrown on the mercy of his Uncle, the infamous Jarl Thorfinn 'Skull Cleaver' of Orkney. He joins forces with a Norse-Irish princess and a company of wolfskin-clad warriors to become a player in a deadly game for control of the Irish sea, where warriors are the pawns of kings and Jarls and the powerful are themselves mere game pieces on the tafl board of the Gods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together they embark on a quest where Einar must fight unimaginable foes, forge new friendships, and discover what it truly means to be a warrior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the clouds of war gather, betrayal follows betrayal and Einar realises the only person he can really trust is himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone will survive, but who will conquer all in Odin's game?</description>

  <description>For readers of The Nightingale and Beneath a Scarlet Sky comes a gripping historical thriller set against a fully-realized WWII backdrop about the love a father has for his son and the lengths he is willing to go to find him, from a talented new voice in suspense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhys Gravenor, Great War veteran and Welsh sheep farmer, arrives in Paris in the midst of the city's liberation with a worn letter in his pocket that may have arrived years too late. As he follows the footsteps of his missing son across an unfamiliar, war-torn country, he struggles to come to terms with the incident that drove a wedge between the two of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joined by Charlotte Dubois, an American ambulance driver with secrets of her own, Rhys discovers that even as liberation sweeps across France, the war is far from over. And his personal war has only begun as he is haunted by memories of previous battles and hampered at every turn by danger and betrayal. In a race against time and the war, Rhys follows his son's trail from Paris to the perilous streets of Vichy to the starving mobs in Lyon to the treacherous Alps. But Rhys is not the only one searching for his son. In a race of his own, a relentless enemy stalks him across the country and will stop at nothing to find the young man first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The country is in tatters, no one is trustworthy, and Rhys must unravel the mystery of his son's wartime actions in the desperate hope of finding him before it's too late. Too late to mend the frayed bond between them. Too late to beg his forgiveness. Too late to bring him home alive.</description>

  <description>Lift the veil of legend for the untold story of Makeda, the Queen of Sheba, and Bathsheba, wife and mother of Israel’s first kings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Makeda, the slave-born daughter of the chieftain of Saba, comes of age, she wins her freedom and inherits her father's titles along with a crumbling earthwork dam that threatens her people's survival. When she learns of a great stone temple being built in a land far to the north, Makeda leads a caravan to the capital of Yisrael to learn how to build a permanent dam and secure her people's prosperity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On her arrival, Makeda discovers that her half-sister Bilkis (also known as Bathsheba) who was thought to have died in a long-ago flash flood, not only survived, but has become Queen of Yisrael. Not content with her own wealth, Bilkis intends to claim the riches of Saba for herself by forcing Makeda to marry her son. But Bilkis’s designs are threatened by the growing attraction between Makeda and Yetzer abi-Huram, master builder of Urusalim’s famed temple. Will Bilkis’s plan succeed or will Makeda and Yetzer outsmart her and find happiness far from her plots and intrigue?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A dangerous element discovered by Bianca Goddard's father falls into the wrong hands . . . leading to a chain of murders.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spring 1544&lt;/i&gt; Now that she is with child, Bianca is more determined than ever to distance herself from her unstable father. Desperate to win back the favor of King Henry VIII, disgraced alchemist Albern Goddard plans to reveal a powerful new element he's discovered--one with deadly potential. But when the substance is stolen, he implores his daughter to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after, a woman's body is found behind the Dim Dragon Inn, an eerie green vapor rising from her mouth. Bianca has reason to suspect her own mother may be involved in the theft and the murder.

  <description>A sublime and seductive reading experience. Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written, this enormously engaging portrait of a most beguiling Southern city has become a modern classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shots rang out in Savannah's grandest mansion in the misty, early morning hours of May 2, 1981. Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the "soul of pampered self-absorption"; the uproariously funny black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight. These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else.</description>

  <description>A savage tale of love, treason and betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;A bloody struggle for power at the heart of the royal court.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In April 1483, the sudden death of King Edward IV brings his 12 year old son to the throne.&lt;br /&gt;Restless young lord and ex-mercenary John Elder is newly-appointed to the service of Edward, Prince of Wales, and charged with the boy’s safety. His first task, escorting the new king to London for his coronation, seems a simple one but the accession of a boy king raises concerns among the leading noblemen of the land. &lt;br /&gt;As old jealousies and feuds are rekindled, the new king’s uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, seizes control and plunges the kingdom into crisis. But is Gloucester young Edward’s enemy, or saviour? &lt;br /&gt;While John, outlawed and trapped, must wait to see how events unfold, other members of the battle-scarred Elder family are drawn, one by one, into his conspiracy. Soon they are mired so deep in the murky underbelly of London society, that there seems no hope of escape from the tangle of intrigue and murder.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, all lives will hang upon the outcome of a daring incursion into the Tower of London itself.</description>

  <description>As King Henry VI slips into insanity and the realm of England teeters on the brink of civil war, a child is married to the mad king’s brother. Edmund Tudor, Earl of Richmond, takes his child bride into Wales where she discovers a land of strife and strangers. &lt;br /&gt;At Caldicot Castle and Lamphey Palace Margaret must put aside childhood, acquire the dignity of a Countess and, despite her tender years, produce Richmond with a son and heir. &lt;br /&gt;While Edmund battles to restore the king’s peace, Margaret quietly supports his quest; but it is a quest fraught with danger. &lt;br /&gt;As the friction between York and Lancaster intensifies 14-year-old Margaret, now widowed, turns for protection to her brother-in-law, Jasper Tudor. At his stronghold in Pembroke, two months after her husband’s death, Margaret gives birth to a son whom she names Henry, after her cousin the king. &lt;br /&gt;Margaret is small of stature but her tiny frame conceals a fierce and loyal heart and a determination that will not falter until her son’s destiny as the king of England is secured. &lt;br /&gt;The Beaufort Bride traces Margaret’s early years from her nursery days at Bletsoe Castle to the birth of her only son in 1457 at Pembroke Castle. Her story continues in Book Two: The Beaufort Woman. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Rufinus is dead, crumpled at the base of a cliff in far-off Dacia. Or so the world believes. Back in the west, secretly in the entourage of the fierce Septimius Severus, the young hero moves in the shadows with fellow conspirators in an attempt to finally bring down the would-be tyrant of Rome: Cleander. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Under assumed names and in a variety of roles, the former Praetorian conspires with some of the most important men in Rome, bringing the city to the very brink of disaster in a grand and complex plot to cause the fall of the untouchable chamberlain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And as governors, prefects, Praetorians and consuls work their secret plots in the seedy underbelly of Rome, Rufinus finds he has an opportunity to settle old scores along the way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The empire is suffering. Rome is seething. Rufinus is back.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;'Great characters, strident battles and a story to be savoured' David Gilman&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is 1170 – a tumultuous time for the people of Wales, England and Ireland. Raymond de Carew is in love, but the woman he desires is an earl's daughter and so far above his station that he has no hope of ever winning her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Raymond’s lord has a mission for him: one that if it succeeds will put an Irish king back on his throne and prove Raymond worthy – for in Norman society, a man can rise as high as his skill with a sword can take him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;With only a hundred men at his side, Raymond must cross the ocean to Ireland ahead of his mercenary lord's invasion. There he will face the full might of the Viking city of Waterford... and either his deeds will become legend or he will be trampled into dust.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Raising the literary bar to a new level, Jerome Charyn re-creates the voice of Theodore Roosevelt, the New York City police commissioner, Rough Rider, and soon- to-be twenty-sixth president through his derring-do adventures, effortlessly combining superhero dialogue with haunting pathos. Beginning with his sickly childhood and concluding with McKinley’s assassination, the novel positions Roosevelt as a “perfect bull in a china shop,” a fearless crime fighter and pioneering environmentalist who would grow up to be our greatest peacetime president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With an operatic cast, including “Bamie,” his handicapped older sister; Eleanor, his gawky little niece; as well as the devoted Rough Riders, the novel memorably features the lovable mountain lion Josephine, who helped train Roosevelt for his “crowded hour,” the charge up San Juan Hill. Lauded by Jonathan Lethem for his “polymorphous imagination and crack comic timing,” Charyn has created a classic of historical fiction, confirming his place as “one of the most important writers in American literature” (Michael Chabon).</description>

  <description>The 11th century world through which the narrator, Thomas Woodward, travels is changing; marked by the emergence of a disruptive commercial revolution. In the Mediterranean, the great Abrahamic faiths of Judaism, Christianity and Islam meet, often in cooperation and peace but, at times, in bloody conflict. It is an era of migration, globalism and multiculturalism leading to a robust interchange of technology, ideas and the basic tools of international trade. But, the interests of the Christian west are on a collision course with those of the Muslim world. War is coming. The Church is rallying the nobles of Europe to embark on an ‘armed pilgrimage’ to reclaim the Holy Land. Now, Thomas and his Muslim and Jewish partners’ lucrative sugar trade is in jeopardy. Thomas’s own secret and dangerous mission, directed from Rome, will become filled with even greater peril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Thomas’s family is annihilated in a raid, his life changes forever. Wandering for days, starving and hopeless, he is rescued by a monk and is taken to live at the abbey of Eynsham. There he receives a curious education, training to be a scholar, a merchant and a spy. His mission: to develop commerce in Muslim lands and dispatch vital information to the Holy See.&lt;br /&gt;His perilous adventures during the 11th century’s commercial revolution will take him far from his cloistered life to the great trading cities of Almeria, Amalfi, Alexandria and Cairo.&lt;br /&gt;But the world in which he lives is chaotic. Struggling with love and loss, faith and fortune, can Thomas carry out his secret mission before conflict overtakes him? &lt;br /&gt;Spanning the tumultuous medieval worlds of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, The Sugar Merchant is a tale of clashing cultures, massive economic change and one man’s determination to fulfill his destiny.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Their lives are ones of quiet contemplation—and brutal murder.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christmas Eve, 1176. Brother Maurice, monk of Fairmore Abbey, awaits the night prayer bell. But there is only silence. Cursing his fellow brother Cuthbert’s idleness, he seeks him out—and in the darkness, finds him brutally murdered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summoned from London to the isolated monastery on the Yorkshire Moors, Aelred Barling, clerk to the King’s justices, and his messenger Hugo Stanton, set about investigating the horrific crime. They quickly discover that this is far from a quiet monastic house. Instead, it seethes with bitter feuds, rivalries and resentments. But no sooner do they arrive than the killer strikes again—and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Barling discovers a pattern to these atrocities, it becomes apparent that the murderer’s rampage is far from over. With everyone, including the investigators, now fearing for their lives, can Barling and Stanton unmask the culprit before more blood is spilled?</description>

  <description>Northern Britain, AD 430 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A land in turmoil. A village ablaze. A king’s daughter abducted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the aftermath of a surprise attack Dun Buic lies in smoking ruins and many innocent villagers are dead. As the survivors try to make sense of the night’s events the giant warrior-druid, Bellicus, is tasked with hunting down the raiders and thwarting their dark purpose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With years of training in the old ways, two war-dogs at his side, and unsurpassed skill with a longsword, Bellicus’s quest will take him on a perilous journey through lands still struggling to cope with the departure of the Roman legions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, amongst her brutal captors the little princess Catia finds an unlikely ally, but even he may not be able to avert the terrible fate King Hengist has in store for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, the first volume in a stunning new series from the bestselling author of Wolf’s Head, explores the rich folklore and culture of post-Roman Britain, where blood-sacrifice, superstition and warfare were as much a part of everyday life as love, laughter and song. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Saxon invaders and the new Christian religion seek to mould the country for their own ends one man will change the course of Britain’s history forever. . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. . . THE DRUID.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Steven A. McKay's archetypal villains and heroes step vividly onto the page from a mist-veiled past of legend to battle for the life of a princess and the fate of Britain.&lt;br /&gt;Dark age adventure at its gripping best." - MATTHEW HARFFY, author of The Bernicia Chronicles</description>

  <description>After a peaceful year running their Frisian estate, Harald and Selia are called to Engla-lond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their return is marked by violence and intrigue. The king has vowed to Queen Emma that their son, Harthacnute, will inherit the throne, but the atheling is cruel and reckless. Many view Harald as the better choice, which makes him a target for the unseen supporters of his half-brother. King Cnute urges Harald to be prepared to assume the throne should Harthacnute prove inadequate. Harald resists being swept up by forces beyond his control, but doubts he will survive the reign of King Hartha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what of his older brother, Sweyn?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winner of the 2017 Howard Frank Mosher First Book Prize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shortlisted for the 2016 Plaza Literary Prize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Mojave Desert, at the southern end of the isolated Moapa Valley, sat the town of St. Thomas, Nevada. A small community that thrived despite scorching temperatures and scarce water, St. Thomas was home to hardy railroad workers, farmers, shopkeepers, teachers, and a lone auto mechanic named Henry Lord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born and raised in St. Thomas, Lord lived in a small home beside his garage with his son, Thomas, his daughter-in-law, Ellen, and his grandson, "Little" Henry. All lived happily until the stroke of a pen by President Coolidge authorizing the construction of the Boulder (Hoover) Dam. Within a decade, more than 250 square miles of desert floor would become flooded by the waters of the Colorado River, and St. Thomas would be no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the early 1930s, the federal government began buying out the residents of St. Thomas, yet the hardheaded Henry Lord, believing the water would never reach his home, refused to sell. It was a mistake that would cost him―and his family―dearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lords of St. Thomas&lt;/i&gt; details the tragedies and conflicts endured by a family fighting an unwinnable battle, and their hectic and terrifying escape from the flood waters that finally surge across the threshold of their front door. Surprisingly, it also shows that, sometimes, you can go home again, as Little Henry returns to St. Thomas 60 years later, after Lake Mead recedes, to retrieve a treasure he left behind―and to fulfill a promise he made as a child.</description>

  <description>It is 954 A.D. and a tempest is brewing in the North. Twenty summers before, Hakon Haraldsson wrested Norway’s throne from his murderous brother, Erik Bloodaxe, but he failed to rid himself of Erik’s family. Now the sons of Erik have come to reclaim Erik’s former throne and avenge the wrong done to their father and their kin. But they do not come alone. With them marches an army of sword-Danes sent by the Danish King, Harald Bluetooth, whose desire to expand his realm is as powerful as the lust for vengeance that pulses in the veins of Erik’s brood. Like storm-driven waves, the opposing forces collide in War King; and when they do, Hakon is left with no choice but to face the tempest and resist.</description>

  <description>Being trusted by a Caesar makes him an enemy of the Roman who crucified Jesus Christ, and puts him under threat from Rome itself... Rome 30 AD. A Senator is plunged into the dark heart of the Roman Empire, sent to investigate the corrupt practices of Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem by Caesar Tiberius. In this tense historical thriller can Senator Vivius Marcianus outmanoeuvre charges of treason, devastating secrets resurfaced from his own troubled past, and the political snake pit of Rome to save himself and the woman he loves?</description>

But if you are new to Roma Nova, enjoy these eight ‘behind the scenes’ short stories and perhaps feel curious about exploring the longer novels… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description> An extraordinary story of the Knights Templar, seen from the bloody inside &lt;br /&gt;Europe is aflame. On the Iberian Peninsula the wars of the Reconquista rage across Aragon and Castile. Once again, the Moors are gaining the upper hand. Christendom is divided.&lt;br /&gt;Amidst the chaos comes a young knight: &lt;b&gt;Arnau of Valbona&lt;/b&gt;. After his Lord is killed in an act of treachery, Arnau pledges to look after his daughter, whose life is now at risk. But in protecting her Arnau will face terrible challenges, and enter a world of Templars, steely knights and visceral combat he could never have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;She in turn will find a new destiny with the Knights as a daughter of war… Can she survive? And can Arnau find his destiny?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An explosive novel of greed and lust, God and blood, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Daughter of War&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; marks the beginning of an epic new series from bestseller S.J.A. Turney. Perfect for fans of Bernard Cornwell, Conn Iggulden and Matt Harffy.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The empire is on its knees, but a last hope lies beyond the eastern frontier . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;377 AD: Emperor Valens has stripped the Persian frontier of its legions, sending every available man to Thracia in an effort to contain the rampaging Gothic hordes. Now, covetous eyes have fallen upon Rome’s trade-rich but sparsely defended desert provinces. Shapur II, Shahanshah of the Sassanid Empire and his many client kings have long believed Rome’s eastern holdings to be theirs by ancestral right, and those lands have never been more vulnerable. Thus, Valens must grasp at the slimmest of hopes that a Persian invasion can be staved off, not by the brute force of absent legions, but by the tenacity of a hardy few. For in the heart of enemy lands, something thought long lost might just offer salvation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Optio Numerius Vitellius Pavo and a select group of the XI Claudia are summoned to the Persian front, they leave Thracia behind, knowing little of what awaits them. They know only that they are to march into a burning land of strange gods. They whisper tales of the mighty Persian Savaran cavalry and pray to Mithras they will see their homes and families again. All too soon it becomes clear to them that this is no ordinary mission – indeed, the very fate of the empire might rest upon their efforts. But for Pavo the burden is weightier still, for he knows that the east also holds something even more precious to him . . . the truth about his father.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winner of the Lincoln Prize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acclaimed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin illuminates Lincoln's political genius in this highly original work, as the one-term congressman and prairie lawyer rises from obscurity to prevail over three gifted rivals of national reputation to become president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On May 18, 1860, William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Abraham Lincoln waited in their hometowns for the results from the Republican National Convention in Chicago. When Lincoln emerged as the victor, his rivals were dismayed and angry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the turbulent 1850s, each had energetically sought the presidency as the conflict over slavery was leading inexorably to secession and civil war. That Lincoln succeeded, Goodwin demonstrates, was the result of a character that had been forged by experiences that raised him above his more privileged and accomplished rivals. He won because he possessed an extraordinary ability to put himself in the place of other men, to experience what they were feeling, to understand their motives and desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was this capacity that enabled Lincoln as president to bring his disgruntled opponents together, create the most unusual cabinet in history, and marshal their talents to the task of preserving the Union and winning the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We view the long, horrifying struggle from the vantage of the White House as Lincoln copes with incompetent generals, hostile congressmen, and his raucous cabinet. He overcomes these obstacles by winning the respect of his former competitors, and in the case of Seward, finds a loyal and crucial friend to see him through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brilliant multiple biography is centered on Lincoln's mastery of men and how it shaped the most significant presidency in the nation's history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Stay out of trouble. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though this is Marik’s mantra, he rarely seems able to follow it. Having escaped a brutal civil war in his native South, the former soldier now roams the distant North, trying to forget his past and forge some kind of future. Marik suspects he is paying the price for the moment of weakness that caused him to flee his comrades and family and everything he knew. Because however hard he tries, intrigue and danger are never far away..…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several abrupt turns of fate, Marik survives a terrifying shipwreck and washes up on a distant shore. He finds himself in the Salka Delta, an isolated region of islands and marshes. Here, a mercenary named Reverrik has enslaved the local people and Marik is soon recruited by a tiny band of rebels. As well as spies, traitors and outlandish creatures, he also faces the mighty Hammerhand, a giant enforcer feared by all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staying out of trouble is never easy.</description>

His series Agent of Rome is top notch Roman historical fiction, and I wasn't too concerned that he switched to a more fantasy like tale especially since this fantasy tale isn't heavy on the fantasy, but more focused on telling a believable tale o...]]>

  <description>Two soldiers from opposite sides of the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Christmas meal that will change their lives forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An action packed historical thriller where survival is the only thing that matters, SERGEI AND HANS is a story of war, loss, and redemption.

  <description>AD 69. As this most dramatic year draws to a close, now is the time to choose a definitive side. Whilst Vitellius enjoys the trappings of power around him, machinations are afoot. In the East, Vespasian has his eye on the throne, but he needs help preparing Rome for his plans and, for his teenage son Domitian, protection from Vitellius' agents. With her characteristic flair, and lashings of skulduggery, sex, brutality, and humour, L. J. Trafford brings her Roman quartet, tracing the Year of the Four Emperors, to a spectacular conclusion.</description>

  <description>TWO POWERFUL RIVALS -- ONE DECISIVE BATTLE Now a political hostage in Falaise, Aelfgifa forms an unlikely friendship with William, Duke of Normandy. William has been swift to recognize her skills and exploit them to his advantage. However, unbeknownst to the duke, Gifa is acting as a spy for her brother, Harold Godwinson, a possible rival for the English throne currently in the failing grip of Edward the Confessor. Homesick and alienated by the Norman court, Gifa is torn between the Duke's trust and the duty she owes her family. William has subdued his dissenting nobles, and a united Normandy is within his grasp. But the tides of power and influence are rarely still. As William's stature grows, the circle of those he can trust shrinks. Beyond the English Channel, William has received news of Edward's astonishing decree regarding the succession. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aelfgifa returns to an England where an undercurrent of discontent bubbles beneath the surface. An England that may soon erupt in conflict as one king dies and another is chosen. The ambitions of two powerful men will decide the fates of rival cultures in a single battle at Hastings that will change England, Europe, and the world in this compelling conclusion to the Oath &amp;amp; Crown series on the life and battles of William the Conqueror.</description>

  <description>A young woman walks alone through a barren landscape in a time before history, a time of cataclysmic natural change. She is cold, hungry and with child but not without hope or resources. A skilful hunter, she draws on her intuitive understanding of how to stay alive… and knows that she must survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In present-day London, geneticist Dr Eloise Kluft wrestles with an ancient conundrum as she unravels the secrets of a momentous archaeological find. She is working at the forefront of contemporary science but is caught in the lonely time-lock of her own emotional past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bone Lines is the story of two women, separated by millennia yet bound by the web of life. A tale of love and survival – of courage and the quest for wisdom – it explores the nature of our species and asks what lies at the heart of being human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although partly set during a crucial era of human history 74,000 years ago, Bone Lines is very much a book for our times. Dealing with themes from genetics, climate change and migration to the yearning for meaning and the clash between faith and reason, it also paints an intimate portrait of two extraordinary characters. The book tackles some of the big questions but requires no prior or special knowledge of any of the subjects to enjoy.</description>

  <description>Sometimes, a snake is just a snake. And sometimes…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First-century Rome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senator Gaius Lucius Nerva is taken ill at a dinner party and dies a few days later. His heartbroken wife, Flavia, is told it was a natural death. Calidus, Nerva’s recently freed slave, suspects otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he embarks upon the funeral ceremonies, Calidus becomes more and more convinced that his master was murdered and begins an investigation, seeking out everyone who had attended the dinner party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His enquiries lead him to rub shoulders with the ‘great and good’ of Rome; senators, soldiers, even the ruthless and mercurial Emperor Nero. And his former lover, Julia Eusabia, who seems intent on rekindling their romance and luring him away from his wife and daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calidus’ quest is by no means easy or safe as he encounters the darkest and most dangerous people in Rome. But he knows he must keep searching for the person responsible, to bring justice to the master he had loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This racy historical whodunnit brings to life the sights, smells and sounds of ancient Rome, with sharp humour and a Christie-style finale to boot.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Breakfast of Champions,&lt;/i&gt; one of Kurt Vonnegut’s  most beloved characters, the aging writer Kilgore Trout, finds to his horror that a Midwest car dealer is taking his fiction as truth. What follows is murderously funny satire, as Vonnegut looks at war, sex, racism, success, politics, and pollution in America and reminds us how to see the truth.</description>

Whenever I am asked to name my favorite author(s), or which author(s) I would invite to a dinner party, two names always top the list(s) - Mark Twain and Kurt Vonnegut.

  <description>AD 576. A time of upheaval for the people of the Summer Land - the Saxons push further and further westward, a new religion supplants the old, unexpected alliances are formed and deadly rivalries fester – son against father, brother against brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleri Gwir, the daughter of a chieftain, speaks only the truth - and one thing she knows is that war is coming and that a reckoning awaits her people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Red Cloaks of Caer Baddan, the last remnant of the Roman legions on British soil, represent hope for Eleri and for all the Summer Land. And their leader Macsen represents something else for Eleri herself - new possibilities, new horizons to explore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the decisive battle between the Britons and the Saxons draws nearer, Eleri and her people must decide what their role will be in this story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rich and compelling novel brings to vivid life a moment of transformation that shaped the Britain we know today.</description>

  <description>Hampton Court, 1522. Two young men, both heirs to an earldom, both rivals. Their hatred comes to a climax when Queen Katherine of Aragon brings her ladies-in-waiting to Cardinal Wolsey's luxurious palace. One of the ladies, Anne Boleyn, is to marry James Butler, son of the Earl of Ormond in Ireland, but appears more attracted to Harry Percy, son of the Earl of Northumberland. And when a member of the cardinal’s staff is found shot dead with an arrow, Percy is quick to give evidence that implicates Butler. With Percy’s testimony unexpectedly backed by Boleyn, things start to look bleak for the young Irishman. Luckily, his father has sent a Brehon lawyer, Hugh Mac Egan, over from Ormond to draw up the marriage contract between the Butlers and the Boleyns. With many years’ experience in solving crimes, Mac Egan sets out to find the real killer.</description>

  <description>Conrad is a monk, but he has become a monk through trickery and against his will. So, it is fair to say that his heart isn't really in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conrad is also clever, charming, entirely self-serving, self-absorbed and almost completely without scruple — but in Anglo-Saxon England, when the Danish invaders come calling, those are very helpful attributes to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so it comes to pass that Conrad finds himself constantly dodging death by various means, some reasonable, some... less so. His tricks include selling his brother monks into slavery, witnessing the death of a king, juggling his loyalties between his own people and the Danes, robbing corpses and impersonating a bishop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By his side throughout is the gentle and honourable Brother Odo, a man so naturally and completely good that even animals sense it. He is no match of wits for the cunning Conrad but can he, perhaps, at least encourage the wayward monk to behave a little better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conrad Monk and the Great Heathen Army takes the reader on a hugely entertaining and highly informative trip through the Anglo-Saxon world, in the company of a persuasive and likeable — if frequently despicable — tour guide. It is a story that combines painstakingly accurate depictions of history with a fast-moving and often hilarious plot, and as such is bound to appeal to lovers of history, historical fiction and character-driven fiction alike.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate-cover edition for ASIN B01B8NL7FO &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36337228-the-lady-of-the-tower" rel="nofollow"&gt; can be found &lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London, 1609. When Lucy St.John, a beautiful highborn orphan at the court of King James, is seduced by the Earl of Suffolk, she never imagines the powerful enemy she creates in his beloved sister, the Countess of Rochester. Or that her own sister Barbara would betray her and force Lucy to leave the court in disgrace. Spirited, educated, and skilled in medicine and precious remedies, Lucy fights her way back into society, and through an unexpected love match, becomes mistress of the Tower of London. Living inside the walls of the infamous prison, she defies plague, political intrigues and tragic executions to tend to aristocratic prisoners and criminals alike.&lt;br /&gt;Now married into the immensely powerful Villiers family, Barbara unites with the king’s favorite, the Duke of Buckingham, to raise the fortunes of Lucy and her family to dizzying heights. But with great wealth comes treachery, leaving Lucy to fight for her survival—and her honor—in a world of deceit and debauchery.&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth St.John’s critically acclaimed debut novel tells the true story of her ancestress Lucy through her family’s surviving diaries, letters, and court papers. Lucy’s personal friendships with historical figures such as Sir Walter Raleigh and the Stuart kings brings a unique perspective to the history of seventeenth century England.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A historical mystery that blends nautical adventure in pirate waters with a locked-room murder mystery, featuring a pirate sleuth whose wits are as sharp as his blade.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1723--Spider John, longing to escape the pirate life he never wanted, has an honest seafaring job at last, aboard a sailing vessel, and is returning to his beloved Em and their child. But when Captain Brentwood is murdered in his cabin, Spider's plans are tossed overboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who killed Redemption's captain? The mysterious pirate with a sadistic past? The beautiful redhead who hides guns beneath her skirt? One of the men pining for the captain's daughter? There are plenty of suspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how could anyone kill the captain in his locked quarters while the entire crew was gathered together on the deck? Before he can solve the puzzle, Spider John and his ex-pirate friends Hob and Odin will have to cope with violence, schemes, nosy Royal Navy officers, and a deadly trap set by the ruthless pirate Ned Low.</description>

  <description>When his superiors ignore his warnings of an impending Afghan insurrection in 1841, British army captain Reeve Waterton vows never to return to Kabul. But then he rescues strong-willed Sarah Kane from an ambush and his plans for civilian life and self-preservation unravel around him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first Reeve dislikes Sarah as much as she loathes him. She's as impudent and disdainful of authority as he, plus she's betrothed to his bitterest rival. It's only after Reeve's closest friend is brutally murdered and the Afghan tribes explode in revolt that he and Sarah discover their desperate need for each other. When the retreating British army is caught between the jaws of Afghanistan's blizzard-wracked mountain passes and hordes of vengeful Afghan tribesmen, Sarah and Reeve must rely on their skills, courage, and blossoming love just to survive.</description>

      <![CDATA[Heracles, the natal result of a Zeusian dalliance, is the subject of Mr. Iliffe's new series. Son of Zeus is a wonderful telling of the first part of the Heracles myth; the enmity and hatred of Hera toward him is the focal point as Heracles struggles mightily not only with the first three challen...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A gripping page turner, in the style of &lt;em&gt;Best Selling Author Lee Child&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;immersive action of great epic love stories like, The Titanic, Dances With Wolves and Outlander.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by exciting true events in our history in the time of the American Revolution!&lt;br /&gt;Letters from the States came often and, sometimes, more than five at a time. Marines do love to get mail. Not email. The real thing. Good old U.S. Post mail. Handwritten. Had to be. It was 2003 and Sergeant Leah Ann Sullivan read her mail every day, addressed to her 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, which was just south of Fallujah, Iraq. The mail was from her grandmother, with whom she was very close. One hell of a story was laid out in those letters. A love story in the time of the American Revolution. Leah never knew she had such history in her family. Leave it to Grandma, always so full of great stories. On Leah's breaks from her duties, the letters brought her back to a time when America was young A time when the country was undiscovered and her ancestors had to protect Fort Henry and their colony. There was a lot to lose in the 1700s, around the Ohio Valley. Local tribes wanted their land back, and the British knew how to take advantage of that. Betty Zane was the girl who had to grow up fast on the frontier. She was raised by her four brothers. Her older brother, Colonel Ebenezer Zane, taught her how to protect herself, use her instincts, and shoot a long rifle. Then, Betty fell in love with Zach. Their love was immediate and deep. She never stopped loving him, even when she was forced to go to school in Philadelphia. All she wanted to do was to come home and marry the boy she loved, a boy who was becoming a man and who helped transform Fort Henry into Zanesville. Betty would find a way. But the Shawnee Warrior with the scar on his brow was out to take everything from the Zanes. He lost his brother because of Betty and her brother. He lost the respect of his tribe. He was losing his land. He found his opportunity with the British Captain Pratt and the American traitor George Girty. They were just as determined. They conspired to take down the Zanes and Fort Henry. But they threatened the wrong girl. A girl who was becoming a woman, who loved her man and her country, and would do anything to save them. The letters told Betty Zane's story well, and Grandma knew what she was doing. The stories stirred something within Sergeant Leah Ann Sullivan at just the right time. Her Captain has assigned her to lead a mission. A "Red Eye Op." Now it is her turn. She is about to find out just how damn tough she is. Who is the ruthless enemy in the dark of the Iraqi desert, taking out her fellow Marines? Who are the two unknown soldiers who have compromised her team? Will she have the time to tell the Marine named Vargas how much she cares for him? With her Captain's faith, and a team who has put their trust and respect in her, Leah is about to embark on her own journey. A journey of self-discovery and intestinal fortitude, and high risk. One that takes us to the ending of a true story, about a female warrior in the past that will forever change who this warrior is in the present.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>381 AD: The Gothic War draws to a brutal climax, and the victor's name will be written in blood...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great struggle between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Gothic Horde rumbles into its fifth year. It seems that there can be no end to the conflict, for although the Goths are masters of the land, they cannot topple the last of the imperial cities. But heralds bring news that might change it all: Emperor Gratian readies to lead his Western legions into the fray, to turn matters on their head, to crush the horde and save the East!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The men of the XI Claudia legion long for their homeland’s salvation, but Tribunus Pavo knows these hopes drip with danger. For he and his soldiers are Gratian’s quarry as much as any Goth. The road ahead will be fraught with broken oaths, enemy blades... and tides of blood.</description>

  <description>A murder that defies logic—and a killer still on the loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;England, 1176. Aelred Barling, esteemed clerk to the justices of King Henry II, is dispatched from the royal court with his young assistant, Hugo Stanton, to investigate a brutal murder in a village outside York.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case appears straightforward. A suspect is under lock and key in the local prison, and the angry villagers are demanding swift justice. But when more bodies are discovered, certainty turns to doubt—and amid the chaos it becomes clear that nobody is above suspicion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facing growing unrest in the village and the fury of the lord of the manor, Stanton and Barling find themselves drawn into a mystery that defies logic, pursuing a killer who evades capture at every turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can they solve the riddle of who is preying upon the villagers? And can they do it without becoming prey themselves?</description>

  <description>The Sailing Master-Book Two: The Long Passage Readers will happily yield to the spell cast by Book Two without having to first read Book One! Conflict. Love. Commitment &amp;amp; Betrayal . . . all abound in this intrepid novel of the sea set in the Golden Age of Sail. The looming shadow of the Napoleonic War dims the waning glow of the Enlightenment, yet Owen Harriet's heartfelt narrative provides insight into the human condition. And an overarching question emerges . . . is this chronicle simply the story of a man, or of an entire age? From the opening broadside at the Battle of the Nile to the ironic conclusion off Ushant, Owen continues to come of age, maintaining a steadfast relationship with his beloved mentor, Ignatius Comet Lau, HMS Eleanor's esteemed Sailing Master. Deep within French Indochina. Lost on the Mekong River. Owen befriends an inscrutable boy monk, only to fall prey to a demonic French privateer. A powerful enigma continues to haunt Owen and he begins to understand. A premonition of unknown origin? An Oracle? Or a remnant calling from his own childhood imagination.</description>

  <description>In Vikings to Virgin - The Hazards of Being King Trisha Hughes provides the reader with a pacey introduction to the many pitfalls faced by the ambitious as they climbed the dangerous ladders of royalty. It is easy to think that monarchs are all powerful, but throughout the Dark and Middle Ages it was surprisingly easy to unseat one and assume the crown yourself. But if it was easy to gain ... it was just as easy to lose.&lt;br /&gt;From the dawn of the Vikings through to Elizabeth I, Trisha Hughes follows the violent struggles for power and the many brutal methods employed to wrest it and keep hold of it. Murder, deceit, treachery, lust and betrayal were just a few of the methods used to try and win the crown. Vikings to Virgin - The Hazards of Being King spans fifteen hundred years and is a highly accessible and enjoyable ride through the dark side of early British monarchy.</description>

  <description>From the beloved author of &lt;i&gt;Comeback Love &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Wherever There Is Light&lt;/i&gt;, comes a novel about the life-changing journey of a young man who travels from New Jersey to Khrushchev’s Russia and the beaches of Southern France as he finds love and discovers the long-hidden secrets about his heritage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1950s New Jersey, Michael Daniels launches a radio show in the storage room of his Russian-Jewish grandmother’s candy store. Not only does the show become a local hit because of his running satires of USSR leader Nikita Khrushchev, but half a world away, it picks up listeners in a small Soviet city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There, with rock and roll leaking in through bootlegged airwaves, Yulianna Kosoy—a war orphan in her mid-twenties—is sneaking American goods into the country with her boss, Der Schmuggler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just as Michael’s radio show is taking off, his grandmother is murdered in the candy store. Why anyone would commit such an atrocity against such a warm, affable woman is anyone’s guess. But she had always been secretive about her past and, as Michael discovers, guarded a shadowy ancestral history. In order to solve the mystery of who killed her, Michael sets out to Europe to learn where he—and his grandmother—really came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring Peter Golden’s signature “vivid characters and strong storytelling” (&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Nothing Is Forgotten&lt;/i&gt; changes our understanding of the impact of World War II on its survivors and their descendants, and will appeal to fans of novels by Anita Diamant and Kristin Hannah.</description>

Haunted by loss. 8th Century Sweden: Erlan Aurvandil, a Viking outlander, has pledged his sword to Sviggar Ivarsson, King of the Sveärs, and sworn enemy of the Danish king Harald Wartooth.

But, unbeknownst to the old King his daughter, Princess Lilla, has fallen under Erlan's spell. As the armies gather Erlan and Lilla must choose between their duty to Sviggar and their love for each other. Blooded young, betrayed often, Erlan is no stranger to battle. And hidden in the shadows, there are always those determined to bring about the maelstrom of war...</description>

  <description>The Troy of myth was a real city. This is its story…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hektor’s life of privilege is forever changed when a man, allegedly possessed by the sun god, inspires revolution among the oppressed townspeople of Wilusa – the historical Troy of myth.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Hektor, son of Bronze Age Wilusa’s despotic ruler, social equality contradicts every principle he has been indoctrinated into believing. But his principles and obsession with duty is alienating him from his young son, Hapi, with whom he has a fractured relationship. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the ‘possessed’ man saves Hapi’s life, Hektor is compelled to question the foundations upon which his father has constructed his life as he rebuilds his relationship with his child through the breaking of a foal. Wilusa collapses into political violence as the commoners rise up, and Hektor must decide whether to defend the people, but lose his identity, or remain loyal to an irrational, dangerous father.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Breaking the Foals is a breathless gallop through an ancient world carved out by tradition, stained with blood and immortalised in the lives of heroes and villains.</description>

  <description>The legions of Rome are a fading memory. Enemies stalk the fringes of Britain. And Uther Pendragon is dying. Into this fractured and uncertain world the boy is cast, a refugee from fire, murder and betrayal. An outsider whose only companions are a hateful hawk and memories of the lost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet he is gifted, and under the watchful eyes of Merlin and the Lady Nimue he will hone his talents and begin his journey to manhood. He will meet Guinevere, a wild, proud and beautiful girl, herself outcast because of her gift. And he will be dazzled by Arthur, a warrior who carries the hopes of a people like fire in the dark. But these are times of struggle and blood, when even friendship and love seem doomed to fail. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gods are vanishing beyond the reach of dreams. Treachery and jealousy rule men’s hearts and the fate of Britain itself rests on a sword’s edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the young renegade who left his home in Benoic with just a hunting bird and dreams of revenge is now a lord of war. He is a man loved and hated, admired and feared. A man forsaken but not forgotten. He is Lancelot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in a 5th century Britain besieged by invading bands of Saxons and Franks, Irish and Picts, Giles Kristian's epic new novel tells - through the warrior's own words - the story of Lancelot, that most celebrated of all King Arthur's knights. It is a story ready to be re-imagined for our times.</description>

  <description>Normandy, March 1196&lt;br /&gt;King Richard has their loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;The French would have their lives.&lt;br /&gt;And John, the king’s brother, will never forget how they betrayed him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kidnapping of the king’s former sister-in-law sets off a chain of events that entangle the knights Henry de Grey and Stephan l’Aigle in politics and intrigue, treason . . . and murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What begins as escort duty for the knights becomes a chase through the Norman countryside on the trail of her son, the young duke Arthur. Assassins want him—and the knights—dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If assassins’ blades don’t kill them, King Richard’s war to recover his continental domains from France just might. Former enemies, like the king’s brother, are now allies. Can they be trusted?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warriors. Heroes. Traitors. Spies . . . Lovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry and Stephan will risk their honor and the trust of the king to protect Duke Arthur. They will fight treachery and brave bloody battles, see war in all its horror, and fight their fears of losing each other, all the while keeping their forbidden love secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Swords of the King, Charlene Newcomb follows up her award-winning novel For King and Country (Battle Scars II) amidst the turbulent final years of the reign of Richard I of England, the Lionheart. This epic adventure furthers an original Robin Hood origins story and will captivate fans of historical fiction and anyone who likes romance—forbidden romance—with their history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The True Soldier&lt;/i&gt; by Paul Fraser Collard, roguish hero Jack Lark - dubbed 'Sharpe meets the Talented Mr Ripley' - travels to America to reinvent himself as the American Civil War looms... A must-read for fans of Bernard Cornwell and Simon Scarrow. 'Enthralling' - &lt;i&gt;The Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;'This ain't the kind of war you are used to. It's brother against brother, countryman against countryman'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April, 1861. Jack Lark arrives in Boston as civil war storms across America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hardened soldier, Jack has always gone where he was ordered to go - and killed the enemy he was ordered to kill. But when he becomes a sergeant for the Union army, he realises that this conflict between North and South is different. Men are choosing to fight - and die - for a cause they believe in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people of Boston think it will take just one, great battle. But, with years of experience, Jack knows better. This is the beginning of something that will tear a country apart - and force Jack to see what he is truly fighting for.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AD 642. Anglo-Saxon Britain. A gripping, action-packed historical thriller and the fifth instalment in the Bernicia Chronicles. Perfect for fans of Bernard Cornwell.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oswald has reigned over Northumbria for eight years and Beobrand has led the king to ever greater victories. Rewarded for his fealty and prowess in battle, Beobrand is now a wealthy warlord, with a sizable warband. Tales of Beobrand's fearsome black-shielded warriors and the great treasure he has amassed are told throughout the halls of the land. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many are the kings who bow to Oswald. And yet there are those who look upon his realm with a covetous eye. And there is one ruler who will never kneel before him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Penda of Mercia, the great killer of kings, invades Northumbria, Beobrand is once more called upon to stand in an epic battle where the blood of many will be shed in defence of the kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in this climactic clash between the pagan Penda and the Christian Oswald there is much more at stake than sovereignty. This is a battle for the very souls of the people of Albion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A man infatuated with ivy. A woman pining for lost love. In a Turkish square, ancient buildings lament a devastating explosion. An unlikely friendship struck up with a homeless person. A journey to a magical place that once visited can never be found again. The camaraderie between the patients in a cancer ward. A writer who has lost his muse. A tragedy that leads to dementia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are just a few of seventy individual tales set in locations straddling continents, which portray war, love, hate, hope, greed, revenge, despair, humour, mystical happenings, fantasy, and so much more. Like ripples expanding on the surface of a pond to reach its banks, they converge in this anthology of flash fiction and short stories by Sebnem E. Sanders in her debut release.</description>

  <description>The new magistrate of Justitia has a difficult task before him. Rome is a bed of deceit and murder and with the Emperor travelling the empire, it falls to him to keep order. However, with a highly skilled assassin slaughtering members of Rome's elite and a mysterious organisation plotting to take power in the Emperor's absence, the magistrate will face constant danger. Magistrate Lucius Magro Decius must learn the ways of Rome with all hast or find himself bleeding in the dirt.</description>

  <description>After Henry of Lancaster’s rebellion has been crushed early in 1329, a restless peace settles over England. However, the young Edward III is no longer content with being his regents’ puppet, no matter that neither Queen Isabella nor Roger Mortimer show any inclination to give up their power. Caught in between is Adam de Guirande, torn between his loyalty to the young king and that to his former lord, Roger Mortimer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edward III is growing up fast. No longer a boy to be manipulated, he resents the power of his mother, Queen Isabella, and Mortimer. His regents show little inclination of handing over their power to him, the rightful king, and Edward suspects they never will unless he forces their hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam de Guirande is first and foremost Edward’s man, and he too is of the opinion that the young king is capable of ruling on his own. But for Adam siding with his king causes heartache, as he still loves Roger Mortimer, the man who shaped him into who he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inevitably, Edward and his regents march towards a final confrontation. And there is nothing Adam can do but pray and hope that somehow things will work out. Unfortunately, prayers don’t always help.</description>

Before Sarah has come to terms with that loss, her merchant father grows frail and increasingly desperate in the face of impending bankruptcy. On the rainy night their father scours the docks of Bordeaux, France, to make his final bid to save his family, his children are kidnapped and forced onto a ship bound for New York City where they’ll be separated and sold to the highest bidder as indentured labor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased by a grotesque merchant whose wealth, backed by a team of henchmen, allows him to dominate the chaotic East River docks, Sarah strikes back the only way she can. Vowing to never allow him to put his hands on her again, she presses a knife to his fat neck. She demands her freedom, a roof over her head and the means to start a business. Her leverage? Knowledge obtained on the voyage that would bring the big man to his knees forever. He yields to her demands but privately swears to become her worst nightmare.</description>

  <description>In 12th Century East Anglia, poor Saxon boys stay poor. It takes an exceptional one to win Henry II's friendship, and to rise to the job of High Sheriff of all Norfolk and Suffolk, as my hero Wimer did. &lt;br /&gt;Falling foul of the stormy relationship between Henry and his Archbishop, he is excommunicated three times, twice by Thomas a'Becket, and once by the Pope. This will guarantee him a place in Hell, especially given his feelings towards Henry's mistress Ida, unless he can find land and resources to do something spectacular in the way of penance.</description>

Disgraced and smarting from a period in the cells for a disciplinary offence, she is sent out of everybody's way on a seemingly straightforward mission overseas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All she and her comrade-in-arms, Flavius, have to do is bring back a traitor from the Republic of Quebec. Under no circumstances will she risk entering the Eastern United States where she is still wanted under her old name Karen Brown. But when she and Flavius discover a conspiracy that reaches to the highest levels of Roma Nova, what price is personal danger against fulfilling the mission? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Set in the time after INCEPTIO but before PERFIDITAS in the Roma Nova series, this thriller novella reveals hidden parts of Carina's early life in Roma Nova. And North America isn't quite the continent we know in our timeline...</description>

  <description>Caligula: loving brother, reluctant ruler and tortured soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The five children of Germanicus are cursed from birth. Father: believed poisoned by the Emperor Tiberius over the imperial succession. Mother and two brothers arrested and starved to death by Tiberius. One sister married off to an abusive husband. Only two are left: Caligula, in line for the imperial throne, and his youngest sister, Livilla, who tells us this story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ascent of their family into the imperial dynasty forces Caligula to change from the fun-loving boy Livilla knew into a shrewd, wary and calculating young man. Tiberius's sudden death allows Caligula to manhandle his way to power. With the bloodthirsty tyrant dead, it should be a golden age in Rome and, for a while, it is. But Caligula suffers emotional blow after emotional blow as political allies, friends, and finally family betray him and attempt to overthrow him, by poison, by the knife, by any means possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little by little, Caligula becomes a bitter, resentful and vengeful Emperor, every shred of the boy he used to be eroded. As Caligula loses touch with reality, there is only one thing to be done before Rome is changed irrevocably. . .</description>

      <![CDATA[I must confess at the outset that the portrayal of Caligula that is permanently etched in my mind is John Hurt's magnificent, raving lunatic character in I, Claudius.  Having said that, I must also confess that if any author could convince me otherwise, it would be Simon Turney.  As proof of that...]]>

  <description>William, the nineteen-year-old duke of Normandy, is enjoying the full fruits of his station. Life is a succession of hunts, feasts, and revels, with little attention paid to the welfare of his vassals. Tired of the young duke’s dissolute behaviour &lt;br /&gt;and ashamed of his illegitimate birth, a group of traitorous barons force their way into his castle. While William survives their assassination attempt, his days of leisure are over. He’ll need help from the king of France to secure his dukedom &lt;br /&gt;from the rebels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other side of the English Channel lives ten-year-old Ælfgifa, the malformed and unwanted youngest sister to the Anglo-Saxon Jarl, Harold Godwinson. Ælfgifa discovers powerful rivalries in the heart of the state when her sister Ealdgyth is given in a political marriage to King Edward, and she finds herself caught up in intrigues and political manoeuvring as powerful men vie for influence. Her path will collide with William’s, and both must fight to shape the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Argument of Blood is the first of two sweeping historical novels on the life and battles of William the Conqueror.</description>

  <description>When Lucia discovers a dog-eared book by Martin Luther in her father's desk drawer, the precocious twelve-year-old at once remembers her priest's diatribe against Luther. Curiosity drives her to examine the arch-heretic's ideas for herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucia's father, Giordano, knows that in late Renaissance Italy, only a suicidal zealot would so much as whisper Luther's name--even in Verona, several days ride from Rome and the fury of the Church's Inquisition. Knowing his daughter's impulsive streak, Giordano warns Lucia of dire consequences if the Inquisition learns of her find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Giordano fears, Martin Luther's ideas ignite Lucia's faith. Faced with plague, death, and the Inquisition, at every step Lucia must choose between abandoning her faith and risking her life.</description>

  <description>War is coming to Saxon Briton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one kingdom after another falls to the savage might of the High King, Cerdic of Wessex, only one family dares to stand up to him — The Du Lacs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Budic and Alden Du Lac are barely speaking to each other, and Merton is a mercenary, fighting for the highest bidder. If Wessex hears of the brothers’ discord, then all is lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fate brings Merton du Lac back to the ancestral lands of his forefathers, and he finds his country on the brink of civil war. But there is worse to come, for his father’s old enemy has infiltrated the court of Benwick. Now, more than ever, the Du Lac must come together to save the kingdom and themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can old rivalries and resentments be overcome in time to stop a war?</description>

  <description>In this gripping sequel to The Scribe's Daughter, a young woman finds herself unwittingly caught up in a maelstrom of power, intrigue, and shifting perceptions, where the line between ally and enemy is subtle, and the fragile facade of reality is easily broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irisa's parents are dead and her younger sister Kassia is away on a journey when the sisters’ mysterious customer returns, urging Irisa to leave with him before disaster strikes. Can she trust him to keep her safe? How much does he know about the fate of her father? Only a voyage across the Eastmor Ocean to the land of her ancestors will reveal the truth about her family’s disturbing past. Once there, Irisa steps into a future she has unknowingly been prepared for since childhood, but what she discovers is far more sinister than she could have ever imagined. Will she have the courage to claim her inheritance for her own?</description>

  <description>At the mercy of the scheming Imperial Chamberlain, Cleander, Rufinus is dispatched to Dacia, a land of untamed beauty at the edge of the Roman world, with orders to investigate the two legionary commanders there for signs of treason. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Uncertain what to expect from his mission, the two generals, or the land itself, Rufinus travels east with Senova and his faithful hound, Acheron. But machinations and skullduggery are afoot in Dacia, and the young praetorian is walking into the heart of empire-changing events. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the generals Clodius Albinus and Pescennius Niger work to put the province right following recent invasions and revolts, Rufinus begins his investigation, suffering insubordinate soldiers, unseen attackers and dangerous locals. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At the edge of the world, Rufinus is about to stumble across a web that will put him in direct danger and threaten the empire to its core. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Dacia.</description>

  <description> Empires rise… and empires fall. Can the Empire survive its most awesome challenge yet? &lt;p&gt;Aram of the&lt;strong&gt; Inda&lt;/strong&gt;, a scattered people, has seen his lands pillaged, his sons taken and his empire crushed by the all-powerful &lt;strong&gt;Jade Empire&lt;/strong&gt;. Its numberless armies have crushed the disunited Inda, swarming in from the East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to the West lies another power, the Empire, ruled by mad Emperor Bassianus. And something powerful is stirring in the wild mountains…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power abhors a vacuum, and the Inda lands are now fair game. The stage is set for a showdown of cataclysmic proportions. Aram and his sons Jai, Dev and Ravi will find themselves at the heart of events that will shake empires to their very foundations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who will survive this game of conquest?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;This epochal clash of titans is the blood-curdling conclusion to S.J.A Turney’s Tales of the Empire. Perfect for fans of Simon Scarrow, Ben Kane and Gordon Doherty. &lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>He wanted to find peace in prayer, but some men serve God best with a sword in their hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Scaflock wants only to live in peace. He had more than his share of adventure when he went by the name Will Scarlet and fought corrupt authority alongside Robin Hood. Now widowed and alone, and estranged from his adult daughter, he has taken holy orders and sought refuge in a remote Benedictine abbey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even there, trouble and violence follow him. The abbot, John de Wystow, is a good man but a weak leader, and easily undermined by a faction of dissident monks. When the rebels, led by Brother Robert de Flexburgh, run riot in the local community—stealing, drinking, fornicating—Scaflock’s old instincts return. Reluctantly taking charge of the abbey’s moral defence, he finds himself embroiled in a series of fierce clashes with de Flexburgh’s rowdy gang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the abbey’s tranquillity is shattered, its cloisters stained with blood, Scaflock is forced to reconsider the direction of his life. Has he really left Will Scarlet behind him—or has he simply been running from reality?</description>

  <description>Germany 1505&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is very shameful that children, especially defenceless young girls, are pushed into the nunneries. Shame on the unmerciful parents who treat their own so cruelly.’ Martin Luther&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the death of her mother and her father’s remarriage, five-year-old Katharina is placed in the convent at Brehna. She will never see her father again. &lt;br /&gt;Sixty-five miles away, at Erfurt in Thuringia, Martin Luder, a promising young law student, turns his back on a lucrative career in order to become a monk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consequences of their meeting in Wittenberg, on Easter Sunday 1523, will reverberate down the centuries and throughout the Christian world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A compelling portrayal of Katharina von Bora, set against the turmoil of the Peasant’s War and the German Reformation … and the controversial priest at its heart.</description>

      <![CDATA[One of the things I like about historical-fiction is the way an author can take a subject, be that a place, an event, or in this case a person, and tell a story that is so compellingly real that you think you're reading a non-fictional account.  That is, in the opinion of this humble, yet moderat...]]>

  <description>Odysseus, infamous trickster of Troy, vaunted hero of the Greeks, left behind a wake of chaos and despair during his decade long journey home to Ithaca. Lovers and enemies, witches and monsters—no one who tangled with Odysseus emerged unscathed. Some prayed for his return, others, for his destruction. These are their stories…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A beleaguered queen’s gambit for maintaining power unravels as a son plots vengeance.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A tormented siren battles a goddess’s curse and the forces of nature to survive.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;An exiled sorceress defies a lustful captain and his greedy crew.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A blinded shepherd swears revenge on the pirate-king who mutilated him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A beautiful empress binds a shipwrecked sailor to servitude, only to wonder who is serving whom.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A young suitor dreams of love while a returned king conceives a savage retribution.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Six authors bring to life the epic tale of The Odyssey seen through the eyes of its shattered victims—the monsters, witches, lovers, and warriors whose lives were upended by the antics of the “man of many faces.” You may never look upon this timeless epic—and its iconic ancient hero—in quite the same way again.</description>

      <![CDATA[One might ask, 'why another book about Troy; another book about Odysseus?'  Well, in answer to that question, I would say, 'because of the variety of ways the story can be told.'  In A Sea of Sorrow we have that variety - here are told the tales of Odysseus without the elements of mythical monste...]]>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Gruffydd ap Cynan is missing, his army scattered. Twelve long years have passed since the king was taken prisoner and his people think him long dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the dirty shadows of Chester Castle, a beaten prisoner looks up from the squalor of the street. Dressed in rags, mocked and pelted with filth, he seems a broken man. Yet deep inside, the desire for freedom burns like the hottest furnace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nesta is a princess in fetters of a different kind. After the death of her father, Tewdwr, she is taken against her will to London to attend the court of King William, son of the Conqueror. There she will find that court politics, and the attentions of princes and lords, are just as dangerous as the arrows and swords of the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The royal blood of Wales is scattered and weakened, but while it flows in the bloodline of Rhodri Mawr, hope remains—Hope that a broken kingdom can be reborn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>It is 935 A.D. and Hakon Haraldsson has just wrested the High Seat of the North from his ruthless brother, Erik Bloodaxe. Now, he must fight to keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The land-hungry Danes are pressing from the south to test Hakon before he can solidify his rule. In the east, the Uplanders are making their own plans to seize the throne. It does not help that Hakon is committed to his dream of Christianizing his people - a dream his countrymen do not share and will fight to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As his enemies move in and his realm begins to crumble, Hakon and his band of oath-sworn warriors must make a stand in Raven’s Feast, the riveting sequel to God’s Hammer.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Beneath the warhorses' hooves, a nation will fall.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A tale of war, death, lust, and scheming, set in the starkly beautiful landscapes of medieval Ireland and Wales.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Robert FitzStephen is a warrior down on his luck. Arrogant, cold, but a brilliant soldier, FitzStephen commands a castle – yet although his mother was a princess his father was a lowly steward. When a Welsh rebellion brings defeat and a crippling siege, his highborn comrades scorn him, betraying him to the enemy. A hostage of his cousin, Prince Rhys, FitzStephen is disgraced, seemingly doomed to a life of obscurity and shame. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then King Diarmait arrives … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Diarmait is the ambitious overlord of an Irish kingdom. Forced to flee by the High King of Ireland, he seeks to reclaim his lands by any means possible – and that includes inviting the Normans in. With nothing left to lose – and perhaps a great deal to gain – FitzStephen agrees to lead the Irishman’s armies, and to drive Diarmait’s enemies from his kingdom. His price? Acceptance, perhaps … or perhaps a kingdom of his own? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Butler’s debut novel, Swordland is a powerful, impeccably researched story of medieval Celtic life, of the loves, losses, and hatreds of some of the most important figures in Irish and British history.</description>

  <description>Kassia is a thief and a soon-to-be oath breaker. Armed with only a reckless wit and sheer bravado, seventeen-year-old Kassia barely scrapes out a life with her older sister in a back-alley of the market district of the Imperial city of Corium. When a stranger shows up at her market stall, offering her work for which she is utterly unqualified, Kassia cautiously takes him on. Very soon however, she finds herself embroiled in a mystery involving a usurped foreign throne and a vengeful nobleman. Most intriguing of all, she discovers a connection with the disappearance of her father three years prior. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kassia is forced to flee her home, suffering extreme hardship, danger and personal trauma along the way, she feels powerless to control what happens around her. Rewarding revelations concerning the mysteries of her family’s past are tempered by the reality of a future she doesn’t want. In the end, Kassia discovers an unyielding inner strength, and that contrary to her prior beliefs, she is not defined by external things -- she discovers that she is worthy to be loved.</description>

  <description>In an epic tale of courage and ferocity, the kingdom of Mercia is born.More than a year has passed since the English crossed the German Sea to settle the island of Britain. Secure now in their Anglian fastness, their gaze turns to the West. But other kingdoms also covet the middle lands. Sweeping down from the western hills Cynlas Goch and his army of Powys lay waste the valley of the River Trenta, burning, killing and enslaving as they go.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Who would have thought it? That captivity could be liberty? That service could be freedom?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In 1548 four little girls, all called Mary, set sail from Scotland for France. Five years old, they are already primed for the work of their lifetime - to serve another little girl called Mary. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mary, Queen of Scots. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thirteen years later, the five return to an unwelcoming Scotland, and as Queen Mary struggles to take control of her turbulent country, her famous ‘Four Marys’ are at her side. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The queen finds herself set on the path of violence and disaster which will lead eventually to her tragic end. But what of the other four Marys, bound inexorably to their mistress’ fate? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of the four, it is Mary Seton who serves the queen longest, and whose loyalty is most severely tested. Through a maze of shadows - of treachery and even witchcraft - how can she find her own way ahead? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Praise for &lt;em&gt;The Queen’s Mary&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Sarah Gristwood breathes new life into the deeply tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots by telling it through the perspective of the invisible woman who sacrificed her life to serve her.”&lt;/b&gt; Elizabeth Freemantle, bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Girl in the Glass Tower&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After leaving Oxford, &lt;b&gt;Sarah Gristwood&lt;/b&gt; began work as a journalist, appearing in most of the UK’s leading newspapers. Turning to history, she wrote bestselling biographies and works of fiction and nonfiction, predominantly focused on the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. A regular media commentator on royal and historical affairs, Sarah was one of the team providing Radio 4’s live coverage of the royal wedding; and has since spoken on royal and historical stories from the royal babies to the reburial of Richard III for national television and radio. Shortlisted for both the Marsh Biography Award and the Ben Pimlott Prize for Political Writing, she is a Fellow of the RSA, and an Honorary Patron of Historic Royal Palaces. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>History and legend combine in the gripping tale of Hakon Haraldsson, a Christian boy who once fought for the High Seat of a Viking realm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 935 A.D. and the North is in turmoil. King Harald Fairhair has died, leaving the High Seat of the realm to his murderous son, Erik Bloodaxe. To solidify his claim, Erik ruthlessly disposes of all claimants to his throne, save one: his youngest brother Hakon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erik's surviving enemies send a ship to Wessex, where the Christian court of King Athelstan is raising Hakon. Unable to avoid his fate, he returns to the Viking North to face his brother and claim his birthright, only to discover that victory will demand sacrifices beyond his wildest nightmares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was swept up in the action and enthralled by the descriptions of Hakon’s struggle. -Roundtable Reviews-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this historical fiction novel, both for its entertaining story and historical information. -Historical Fiction Review-</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There is more blood to be spilt…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rome, first century AD and the city is in political and civil turmoil following the murder of Julius Caesar, (now posthumously elevated to the title of Divus Julius). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mark Antony, Divus Julius’ loyal co-consul and friend, is baying for blood, and for the heads of those of the scheming senators responsible for the murder, to display on spikes in the Forum of Rome. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But who to go for first? Which of the twenty-plus conspirators struck the first blow? Instigated the attack? Manipulated the situation to facilitate the crime? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What of Divus Julius’ dying words which implied that one of the attackers was actually his own son and therefore guilty of the worst crime possible… patricide? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once again, Antony calls upon his contubernium of spies, his military intelligence unit, led by Centurion Iacomus Artemidorus, code-named ‘Septem’, to turn his vengeful intent into an unforgiving, carefully planned campaign. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Antony’s path is not clear. Senator Cicero wants him out of the way, and there is friction with Divus Julius’ heir Octavius, despite their mutual desire to hunt down Divus Julius’ killers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Antony is reluctantly forced into war against Divus Julius’ murderers, and the Senate which supports them, the story follows Artemidorus’ mission, as he travels from Rome into the far reaches of her empire bringing back one head after another. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This historical thriller follows on from &lt;em&gt;The Ides&lt;/em&gt; but can be enjoyed as a stand-alone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Praise for Peter Tonkin  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“The Ides is a testosterone-fuelled battle roar in a world of double-dealing and betrayal, where wits must be sharp and recovery time between violent encounters is brief. Peter Tonkin has infused a familiar narrative with excitement, energy and a delicious twist right at the very end.” — &lt;em&gt;Mystery People&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘Riveting tale full of fast action’ – &lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘Edge-of-the-seat terror’ – &lt;em&gt;Daily Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘Good technical detail, plus an exciting climax, makes this entertaining reading’ – &lt;em&gt;Publishing News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peter Tonkin&lt;/b&gt; was born in Northern Ireland, and was raised in the UK, Holland, Germany, and the Persian Gulf. He has written thirty novels including the &lt;em&gt;Richard Mariner Series.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Jack Lark, once the Scarlet Thief, is back in &lt;i&gt;The Lone Warrior&lt;/i&gt; by Paul Fraser Collard - and he's about to march right into the bubbling centre of the Indian Mutiny. This series is perfect for fans of Conn Iggulden and Bernard Cornwell and 'evokes the horror of that era with great brio. Enthralling' (&lt;i&gt;The Times&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bombay, 1857. India is simmering with discontent, and Jack Lark, honourably discharged from the British Army, aims to take the first ship back to England. But before he leaves, he cannot resist the adventure of helping a young woman escape imprisonment in a gaming house. He promises to escort Aamira home, but they arrive in Delhi just as the Indian Mutiny explodes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As both sides commit horrific slaughter and the siege of Delhi begins, Jack realises that despite the danger he cannot stand by and watch. At heart, he is still a soldier...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lone Warrior &lt;/i&gt;is a scintillating tale of battle and courage from the author of &lt;i&gt;The Scarlet Thief&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for Paul Fraser Collard:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'I love a writer who wears his history lightly enough for the story he's telling to blaze across the pages like this. Jack Lark is an unforgettable new hero' Anthony Riches&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Sharpe fans will be delighted to welcome a swashbuckling new hero to follow... Marvellous fun' &lt;i&gt;Peterborough Telegraph&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'A confident, rich and exciting novel that gave me all the ingredients I would want for a historical adventure of the highest order' &lt;i&gt;For Winter Nights&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'It felt accurate, it felt real, it felt alive... The battles had me hooked, riveted to the page, there were times when I was almost as breathless as the exhausted soldiers' &lt;i&gt;Parmenion Books&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Agatha Christie meets Patrick O'Brian in the first book in a new series of swashbuckling historical mysteries featuring Spider John Rush, a most reluctant pirate. 1722--aboard a pirate ship off the American Colonial Coast. Spider John Rush never wanted to be a pirate, but it had happened and he'd learned to survive in the world of cut and thrust, fight or die. He and his friend Ezra knew that death could come at any moment, from grapeshot or storm winds or the end of a noose. But when Ezra is murdered in cold blood by a shipmate, Spider vows revenge. On a ship where every man is a killer many times over, how can Spider find the man who killed his friend? There is no law here, so if justice is to be done, he must do it. He will have to solve the crime and exact revenge himself. One wrong step will lead to certain death, but Spider is determined to look into the dying eyes of the man who killed his friend, even if it means his own death.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;1081. William’s bloody conquest is over and Britain is under Norman rule. But one bastion of resistance remains: Wales. A divided land where brother fights brother and kings battle for power. The English use this to further their own ends, and while one king is tempted by an offer he cannot resist, the others wage war over long-forgotten feuds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gruffydd ap Cynan, true heir to the kingdom of Gwynedd, is in exile across the sea. When he hears of the betrayal of the Welsh people by the imposter in his throne, Gruffydd unites with Tewdwr, a monarch deposed by the traitors, and they forge an army from the ashes of their kingdoms. But Tewdwr’s wife and daughter—the source of much of the allies’ strength—are a weakness their enemies will exploit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betrayal, treachery and war await, but both men know they must fight to the bitter end, when the sundered lands of Wales are drenched...in the blood of kings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description> The thrilling final instalment of the epic and bestselling Adventures of Odysseus  &lt;p&gt;Odysseus has been to Hell and back. Deserted by the Gods, and now in bitter conflict with his friend Eperitus, times look bleak. He dreams of returning to his home; to Ithaca. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But back on Ithaca things look little better. His son Telemachus and wife Penelope are besieged by a gang of suitors, believing Odysseus to be dead and looking for her hand in marriage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Odysseus and Eperitus have survived everything. But now they face a last test, perhaps the most difficult of all… Can they reclaim what has been lost? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;For readers of David Gemmell, Christian Cameron and Simon Scarrow, &lt;/strong&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Return to Ithaca&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;

  &lt;strong&gt;Praise for Glyn Iliffe&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;‘It has &lt;strong&gt;suspense, treachery, and bone-crunching action&lt;/strong&gt;… It will leave fans of the genre eagerly awaiting the rest of the series’ &lt;em&gt;Times Literary Supplement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;a must read&lt;/strong&gt; for those who enjoy good old epic battles, chilling death scenes and the extravagance of ancient Greece’ &lt;em&gt;Lifestyle Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The reader does not need to be classicist to enjoy this epic and stirring tale. It makes &lt;strong&gt;a great novel&lt;/strong&gt;’ &lt;em&gt;Historical Novels Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘I found it utterly fascinating, the historic detail was excellent. This was an easy and enjoyable read, and I am looking forward to the next instalments. As a personal read &lt;strong&gt;I can absolutely recommend it&lt;/strong&gt;’ &lt;em&gt;Book Talk Bournemouth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘An exciting story with plenty of action, and the requisite supernatural elements … &lt;strong&gt;if you are a fan of writers like Bernard Cornwell, Simon Scarrow and Conn Iggulden you will enjoy this&lt;/strong&gt;.’ Rachel Hyde, &lt;em&gt;Myshelf.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>"Something terrible happened in Salem in 1692 . . . but it isn't what you think!" &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE AFFLICTED GIRLS A Novel of Salem by author-researcher Suzy Witten presents a startling new theory of the Salem Witch Hunt which is certain to put this 300-year-old unsettled mystery to rest by expertly guiding readers through the Historical Record to revelation. Part parable, part star-crossed romance, and part supernatural venture, this is an intuitive human history--and inhuman--spun with a modern twist. Centering her story on Salem Village and its inhabitants, exploring their dark household corners as if she is solving a crime, the author adeptly details how the disintegration happened while spinning familiar facts in new directions, with the mysterious "afflictions" finally explained. A controversial debut by a new Historical storyteller. A Walt Disney Studios Fellowship Finalist, 2010 IPPY Silver Medal for Historical Fiction. (Historical Fiction, 456 pages, paperback and eBook for ages 17 and older; mature content with some sex and violence.) Published by Dreamwand &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.theafflictedgirls.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.theafflictedgirls.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Who is The Lady?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In ancient Britain, a Lady is living in a stone-walled house on an island in the middle of a river. So far as the people know, she has always been there. They sense her power, they hear her singing, but they never meet her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At first her life is idyllic. She wakes, she watches, she wanders in her garden, she weaves a complex web of what she sees, and she sleeps again. But as she grows, this pattern becomes narrow and frustrating. She longs to meet those who cherish her, but she cannot. The scenes beyond the walls of her home are different every time she wakes, and everyone she encounters is lost, swallowed up by the past.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when she finds the courage to break the cycle, there is no going back. Can she bear the cost of finding freedom? And what will her people do, when they finally come face to face with a lady of legend who is not at all what they have imagined?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A retelling – and metamorphosis – of Tennyson’s Lady of Shalott.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>I’m halfway to thirteen and 1968 is already the craziest year ever. Rigged elections, H-bombs, riots, rock and roll. My rock star brother might end up in Vietnam and The Monkees TV show just got cancelled. So much for flower power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should I tell my grandmother that our weird neighbor is an ex-Nazi? Nana survived Dachau and deserves a quiet life which, so far, I haven’t provided. I may be the dumbest kid in smart class, but I have a really big idea: I’m going to return to the scene of the crime and avenge Nana’s lost family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Garage bands, G-men, Germans and Jews. Laurel Canyon, where the nuts roll uphill. If the future of the free world depends on me, please accept my apology in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the many wise things Nana tells me, one that rings true time and again is that God keeps a big zoo. In the summer of 1968 I joined the menagerie</description>

Perfect for fans of Bernard Cornwell.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beobrand has land, men and riches. He should be content. And yet he cannot find peace until his enemies are food for the ravens. But before Beobrand can embark on his bloodfeud, King Oswald orders him southward, to escort holy men bearing sacred relics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Penda of Mercia marches a warhost into the southern kingdoms, Beobrand and his men are thrown into the midst of the conflict. Beobrand soon finds himself fighting for his life and his honour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the chaos that grips the south, dark secrets are exposed, bringing into question much that Beobrand had believed true. Can he unearth the answers and exact the vengeance he craves? Or will the blood-price prove too high, even for a warrior of his battle-fame and skill? &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Winner -- N.N.Light Award for Best Romance 2016.&lt;br /&gt;Bronze Medal Winner -- Circle Of Books Rings Of Honor Awards 2016&lt;br /&gt;Finalist -- The Golden Box Book Publishing Golden Book Award 2017&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It is dangerous to become attached to a du Lac. He will break your heart, and you will not recover.” So prophesies a wizened healer to Annis, daughter of King Cerdic of Wessex. If there is truth in the old crone’s words, they come far too late for Annis, who defies father, king, and country to save the man she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alden du Lac, once king of Cerniw, has nothing. Betrayed by Cerdic, Alden’s kingdom lies in rubble, his fort razed to the ground and his brother Merton missing, presumably dead. He has only one possession left worth saving: his heart. And to the horror of his few remaining allies, he gives that to the daughter of his enemy. They see Annis, at best, as a bargaining chip to avoid war with her powerful father. At worst, they see a Saxon whore with her claws in a broken, wounded king.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alden has one hope: When you war with one du Lac, you war with them all. His brother Budic, King of Brittany, could offer the deposed young king sanctuary—but whether he will offer the same courtesy to Annis is far less certain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Du Lac Chronicles has a recommended reading age of 16+</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Award-winning author Guy Gavriel Kay evokes the dazzling Tang Dynasty of 8th-century China in an masterful story of honor and power. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It begins simply. Shen Tai, son of an illustrious general serving the Emperor of Kitai, has spent two years honoring the memory of his late father by burying the bones of the dead from both armies at the site of one of his father's last great battles. In recognition of his labors and his filial piety, an unlikely source has sent him a dangerous gift: 250 Sardian horses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You give a man one of the famed Sardian horses to reward him greatly. You give him four or five to exalt him above his fellows, propel him towards rank, and earn him jealousy, possibly mortal jealousy. Two hundred and fifty is an unthinkable gift, a gift to overwhelm an emperor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wisely, the gift comes with the stipulation that Tai must claim the horses in person. Otherwise he would probably be dead already...</description>

  <description>Mary Kelly lies dead upon her bed... Her sorrowful eyes still hold captive, the agony of her fate. Anger, and fear walk side by side as the populace of London demand justice for the slain. Is it a single mad man or is there a bloody political game being played out in the grime filled streets of the old City? The authorities are powerless to stop the bloodletting and call for a new kind of law. William Harkness, former officer of the 66th Regiment of Foot will join the hunt. His task is not to bring an insane killer to court, his hands are not tied by the laws of the day.William Harkness is the killer of killers, the assassin of evil...Praise For the Reaper's Breath'He delivers a heck of a story that leaves me wanting to know what happens next while cringing in horror at the scene within the walls of the Mops. He shows that you can create true horror without the need to describe every splash of blood from a severed throat!'Stuart S Laing - Author of the Robert Young Mysteries'With fabulous dialogue and a story that keeps you on tenterhooks, one can easily imagine this as a TV programme, in the style of Ripper Street. Someone should call up a producer and refer them to this awesome book! I would love to see it as a movie or a TV series.This book is an excellent start to what promises to be a fabulous series!'Paula Lofting - Author of Sons of the Wolf'Let's get down to the honesty I like to bring to all my reviews... The plot itself seems well planned out.. everything made sense, nothing seemed out of place or had me confused. At one point I was 100% sure I had figured everything out..Then the author throws in some spectacular twists and turns that I just didn't see coming.'-The bookblurg review group -</description>

I was pretty confident that the author would have penned an entertaining piece as I have read his Spartacus series and enjoyed that.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ASIN B06XZBDN2Y&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early 1980s Vienna. Recovering from a near fatal shooting, Aurelia Mitela, ex-Praetorian and former foreign minister of Roma Nova, chafes at her enforced exile. She barely escaped from her nemesis, the charming and amoral Caius Tellus who grabbed power in Roma Nova, the only part of the Roman Empire to survive into the twentieth century. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aurelia’s duty and passion fire her determination to take back her homeland and liberate its people. But Caius’s manipulations have isolated her from her fellow exiles, leaving her ostracised, powerless and vulnerable. But without their trust and support Aurelia knows she will never see Roma Nova again. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A short story of love and danger on the empire's most hostile frontier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senna, a native Briton married to a Roman auxiliary, accidentally uncovers a dreadful plan by the rebellious northern Maeatae tribe. Her husband Brigius, a Briton who now serves Rome, is torn when the imperial prince Caracalla arrives in northern Britannia with his unit of vicious, dangerous Numidian cavalry, causing trouble and endangering the couple's once peaceful life. Heedless of the danger to both them and their world, the pair see only one way to ensure the continuation of peace in the north, and it carries a horrifying risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From two acclaimed authors of Historical Fiction set in the world of Rome, The Bear and the Wolf is a tale for all ages sure to enthrall. Originally penned for the Alderney Literary Festival, this short story is available at this time only in eBook form.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How far will a father go to keep an old promise?&lt;br /&gt;And how far will a son go to obey him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riding home from the Danube frontier, Marcus Carinna hears a voice whisper, “Your turn,” as he passes his family tomb. An unseen presence also startles the Germanic priestess Aurima, whom he is bringing to Rome. But hardheaded Romans scoff at ghosts, and Marcus can’t believe it’s a warning from his brother, who killed himself three years earlier.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;37 AD: To great acclaim, 25-year-old Caligula Caesar has become Rome’s new master. No one is more pleased than Senator Titus Carinna, who helped him succeed to the throne. It’s a shame the Senator’s older son—Caligula’s closest friend—committed suicide after being charged with treason. But that still leaves Marcus, his second son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Headstrong and hot-tempered, Marcus would rather prove his courage by fighting Rome's enemies than take his brother’s place. Yet when his father calls him home to befriend and steady the erratic Caligula, he has no choice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swept into a labyrinth of deceit, conspiracy, and betrayal reaching from Palatine mansions to the city’s grimy, teeming streets, Marcus will uncover a secret that threatens his family, the woman he desires, even his life… and may bring chaos to the young Roman Empire.</description>

  <description>Adam de Guirande has cause to believe the turbulent times are behind him: Hugh Despenser is dead and Edward II is forced to abdicate in favour of his young son. It is time to look forward, to a bright new world in which the young king, guided by his council, heals his kingdom and restores its greatness. But the turmoil is far from over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of strife, England in the early months of 1327 is a country in need of stability, and many turn with hope towards the new young king, Edward III. But Edward is too young to rule, so instead it is his mother, Queen Isabella, and her lover, Roger Mortimer, who do the actual governing, much to the dislike of barons such as Henry of Lancaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the north, the Scots take advantage of the weakened state of the realm and raid with impunity. Closer to court, it is Mortimer’s increasing powers that cause concerns – both among his enemies, but also for men like Adam, who loves Mortimer dearly, but loves the young king just as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it is announced that Edward II has died in September of 1327, what has so far been a grumble grows into voluble protests against Mortimer. Yet again, the spectre of rebellion haunts the land, and things are further complicated by the reappearance of one of Adam’s personal enemies. Soon enough, he and his beloved wife Kit are fighting for their survival – even more so when Adam is given a task that puts them both in the gravest of dangers.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;As the 14th century dawns, Scotland's survival hangs on an outlaw king on the run.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;James Douglas&lt;/b&gt; burns to avenge his father's murder. &lt;b&gt;Isabelle MacDuff&lt;/b&gt; prays to escape a fate worse than death. And while their fellow Scots scrap over the empty throne, the brutal &lt;b&gt;Edward Longshanks of England&lt;/b&gt; invades the weakened northern kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet one young warrior--who will become feared by his enemies as the &lt;b&gt;Black Douglas&lt;/b&gt;--stands in the path of three Plantagenet monarchs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their clans are sworn rivals, but James pursues the ravishing Isabelle, whose forefathers for centuries have inaugurated kings on the hallowed &lt;b&gt;Stone of Destiny&lt;/b&gt;. Their world is upturned when James befriends &lt;b&gt;Robert Bruce&lt;/b&gt;, a bitter foe of the MacDuffs. Both James and Isabelle must make agonizing decisions that will draw the armies to the bloody field of &lt;b&gt;Bannockburn&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the story of the remarkable events following the execution of &lt;b&gt;William Wallace&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;i&gt;Braveheart&lt;/i&gt; fame. Set during the Bruce wars of independence, &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The Spider and the Stone&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; is the unforgettable saga of the star-crossed love, religious intrigue, fierce friendship in arms, and heroic sacrifice that preserved Scotland's freedom during its time of greatest peril. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-- Chaucer Award First-Place Historical Fiction&lt;br /&gt;-- Foreword Finalist Book-of-the-Year Historical Fiction&lt;br /&gt;-- indieBRAG Medallion &lt;br /&gt;-- BTS Magazine Reader's Choice Honorable Mention&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>All he wanted was a quiet drink…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s spring, 1323 AD, and John Little, notorious outlaw, seeks to forget his troubles in a Barnsley alehouse. He didn’t count on the place being packed to the rafters with drunk, belligerent, Scottish mercenaries though.&lt;br /&gt;The locals all respect – even fear John – but the strangers from the north only see in him the chance to claim a great bounty. &lt;br /&gt;When the hard stares and furtive whispers turn into explosive violence the chase is on. Without any of his famous friends to help him though, will it mean the end for the giant outlaw?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new stand-alone Forest Lord tale sees one of England’s favourite sons in a battle for his very life that will hugely entertain all lovers of action and adventure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A short tale of Little John that packs a wallop as vicious as his quarterstaff!" - Parmenion Book Reviews</description>

  <description>The Church – powerful and moneyed. &lt;br /&gt;The Heretics – zealous and poor. &lt;br /&gt;Lyon – a city that might claim to cast the seeds of reformed thinking upon the world. &lt;br /&gt;Guillaume of Anjou, formerly an archer fighting with other Angevins in the Third Crusade, is now the manager of a successful merchant house. In his new position, he unwittingly steps into and out of the shadowed world of trade and secrets in Lyon. &lt;br /&gt;Guillaume carries the weight of a book in his hands – a book that may well light the flame of the greatest philosophical and spiritual change Europe will experience so that word and sword will cut a swathe through the fabric of life in Lyon. &lt;br /&gt;But he has also made an enemy who wants nothing more than revenge. &lt;br /&gt;He will fight for his life… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"With her customary elegant use of language, Prue Batten plunges us effortlessly into the mercantile houses, twisted alleys and secret shadowy tunnels of medieval Europe. Guillaume is a riveting tale of twelfth century trade, treachery and intrigue." Matthew Harffy, bestselling author of The Bernicia Chronicles. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"This is for readers who love the historical fiction of writers such as Wendy Dunn, but yearn for the adventure of an earlier period and the excitement and mystery of ordinary people tangled in dangerous politics." Gillian Polack, bestselling author of The Middle Ages Unlocked &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>It is 312 AD outside ancient Rome as Emperor Flavius Valerius Aurelius Constantinus Augustus stands above the Tiber River and watches his enemy, Maxentius, and over one hundred thousand soldiers cross Milvian Bridge and take position on the battlefield. Unfortunately, forty-year-old Constantine no longer feels like the invincible god his enemies and some friends believe he is. But as he stands in the midst of a civil war, Constantine knows now is not the time for doubts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he capitalizes on his opponent's smallest mistakes and executes strategies that reflect his perception and genius, Constantine brutally battles within two global wars that not only include Maxentius, but also several other enemies with large forces. While he consolidates his power on the battlefield, Constantine must fight the fissures within an emerging Christian Church controlled by two popes and countless bishops. But as Emperor Constantine grows older and becomes a devoted father, battles erupt within his own family that lead to dramatic changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imperator, Deus shares the fascinating historical tale of the first Christian Emperor of the Roman Empire from his victory at the Milvian Bridge in October 312 AD to his death twenty-five years later.</description>

  <description>Hailes Castle, 1511. Midnight on a doom-laden Hallowe'en and Elisabeth Hepburn, feisty daughter of the Earl of Bothwell, makes a wish ― to wed her lover, the poet David Lindsay. But her uncle has other plans. To safeguard the interests of the Hepbum family she is to become a nun and succeed her aunt as Prioress of St. Mary's Abbey, Haddington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, plunged into the political maelstrom and religious turmoil of the early Scottish Reformation, her life there is hardly one of quiet contemplation. Strong-willed and independent, she clashes with those who question her unorthodox regime at St. Mary's, including Cardinal David Beaton and her rival, Sister Maryoth Hay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her greatest struggle is against her thrawn godson, John Knox. Witnessing his rejection of the Roman Catholic Church ― aided by David Lindsay ― she despairs that the sins of her past may have contributed to his present disenchantment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he purges himself from the puddle of papistry, Knox finds his voice, denouncing everything he once held dear, but will that include his godmother, Prioress Elisabeth? And by confessing her dark secrets, will Elisabeth steer Knox from the pernicious pull of Protestantism or drive him further down the fateful path he seems hell-bent on; a path that leads to burning at the stake?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a daring attempt to shed light on a wheen of unanswered questions about John Knox's early, undocumented life, this novel throws up some startling claims and controversial conjectures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Book one of The Knox Trilogy.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Duplicity. Degeneracy. Destruction. One Empire. Two Emperors. Only one can survive.Rome, AD 69. Having spectacularly grabbed the imperial throne by way of a very bloody coup, new emperor Otho is horrified to discover another emperor already declared. Aulus Vitellius is relaxing in Germania, and his two generals, the twisted Valens and the handsome but dim Caecina, are marching colossal armies to Rome to claim his prize. Hopelessly outnumbered, all looks doomed for Otho, until a series of unexpected victories bring hope.Meanwhile, a former palace slave, Antonia Caenis, returns from Judaea with plans of her own...</description>

In fact, it is going through them so fast that Vitellius thinks he's supplanting Galba who's already been supplanted by Otho. A troubling time...]]>

  <description>Two years after Emperor Augustus’s bloody defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra, he triumphantly returns to Rome. To his only child, Julia, he brings an unlikely companion—Selene, the daughter of the conquered Egyptian queen and her lover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the watchful eye of Augustus’s wife, Livia, Selene struggles to accept her new home among her parents’ enemies. Bound together by kinship and spilled blood, these three women—Livia, Selene, and Julia—navigate the dangerous world of Rome’s ruling elite, their every move a political strategy, their most intimate decisions in the emperor’s hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always suppressing their own desires for the good of Rome, each must fulfill her role. For astute Livia, this means unwavering fidelity to her all-powerful husband; for sensual Julia, surrender to an arranged marriage and denial of her craving for love and the pleasures of the flesh; for orphaned Selene, choosing between loyalty to her family’s killers and her wish for revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can they survive Rome’s deadly intrigues, or will they be swept away by the perilous currents of the world’s most powerful empire?</description>

  <description>An unwelcome legacy. An impossible love. A relentless enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 1481, England has been free from civil war for ten years. &lt;br /&gt;The Elder family have found a fragile peace after their part in the bloody struggle for the throne, yet the scars remain with them all. And close to home, in Ludlow, trouble is stirring once more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born out of the carnage of the Wars of the Roses, young John Elder is now the heir to his father’s legacy, but he finds it a poisonous one. After a brutal fight with an outlaw, John abandons his home and inheritance to become a mercenary in Flanders. But, in his absence, the Elder family must face his ruthless outlaw enemy alone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the young Edward, Prince of Wales, is caught up in their bitter struggle, the life of the heir to the throne hangs in the balance. To save the prince, all other lives must be put at risk, but will John Elder return in time to help?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only if the Elders can leave the scars of the past behind them, is there any hope of survival.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Britain, 391 AD.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The geographical, political and social outlines of the annexed nation are being constantly redefined, as the battling powers in Rome attempt to seize control of the Empire. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Flavius Vitulasius and his trusted associate, Siward, are journeying to receive a highly confidential mission, across the narrow sea, from the Master of Offices in Gaul. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On their path, they stumble upon a seeming damsel in distress, her carriage under attack from bandits. Using all their prowess and experience, Flavius and Siward rescue the damsel from certain death. Nevertheless, the beautiful young lady, Corellia Velva, is not as she seems. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Corellia slips away the following night, Flavius thinks nothing of it. He has orders passed down from the Emperor himself to attend to. A document, the ‘Pagan Concord’, threatens to pull apart Britain at the seams, creating the lurking fear of civil war between the Christians and Pagans. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If Flavius and Siward can recover the ‘Pagan Concord’, they will be able to unmask the conspirators behind the unrest. With the help of an ardent Christian, Lucius Aurelius, the trio commence their enquiries in a clearly divided Britain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, their expedition takes an unexpected turn when they visit the town of their first suspect. Once again, they come across Corellia. She fervently denies any knowledge of Flavius and Siward, suggesting that it is a case of mistaken identity, prompting suspicion from Flavius. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The disquiet among Pagans soon becomes clear, as ritualistic sacrifices and mysterious disappearances soon become the norm, while Flavius attempts to track down the ‘Pagan Concord’ and save the country of his origin. It is not long before he has some unwelcome attention, as murderous villains stalk his every move. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Flavius locate the document in time? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is there more to Corellia than meets the eye? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Can he escape the clutches of his murderous pursuers, and uncover a conspiracy that goes right to the top?   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Divided Empire&lt;/em&gt; is a compelling piece of historical fiction. The first in a series, there is an unexpected twist around every action-packed corner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Endeavour Press is the UK's leading independent digital publisher.

  <description>Elizabeth Rosa Fulton is leading a great life. The bright star in the sky of Lake Enterprises as its Business Manager, she is also the shining light in the life of Justin Lake, her boss and owner of Lake Enterprises. However, as the result of a certain event, all this suddenly changes, leaving Elizabeth broken hearted and without a job or a home. When her grandfather, Lord Carrington, offers her the post of Estate Manager to the Longdene Estate, Elizabeth feels that this is the place to recover from her broken heart and be useful to the family at the same time. And indeed, she loves Longdene and the friends she makes there. But, as time goes on, as she learns about the mysterious disappearance, many years before, of her great grandmother and namesake Rosa, Elizabeth becomes a victim of a series of unexplained and scary 'dreams'. As the events escalate, Elizabeth has cause to doubt everyone around her, even her friends. And, as the culmination of experiences rises to something quite terrifying, Elizabeth has to ask herself if she is really being haunted by her dead great grandparents or is she going mad?</description>

  <description>The year after defeating the Spanish Armada, England retaliates. The expedition to Portugal sets out to destroy what remains of Spain’s Atlantic fleet, drive the Spanish out of Portugal, put the claimant Dom Antonio of Aviz on the throne, and seize the Azores. But from the time the English fleet, led by Drake and Norreys, reaches Plymouth, things start to go wrong. Christoval Alvarez, sent to carry out two missions by Walsingham, has a more important private plan in mind. Are any members of the family still alive? And what will become of the disaster-ridden expedition?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She will defy the most powerful pope in history.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the &lt;b&gt;13th century&lt;/b&gt; dawns across &lt;b&gt;Occitania&lt;/b&gt;, a brash, charismatic viscountess named &lt;b&gt;Esclarmonde de Foix&lt;/b&gt; champions her persecuted pacifist faith and shocks the Church by publicly debating its greatest monastic minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Centuries later, she is still revered as the &lt;b&gt;Cathar Joan of Arc&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spiritual upheaval shakes Latin Christendom. In Rome, &lt;b&gt;Pope Innocent III&lt;/b&gt; plots to crush a growing dualist sect that preaches Christ's mission has been corrupted. In the &lt;b&gt;Holy Land&lt;/b&gt;, warrior-monks make a disturbing discovery. In &lt;b&gt;southern France&lt;/b&gt;, roving troubadours sing of a &lt;b&gt;Holy Grail&lt;/b&gt; that offers salvation through the intercession of a worthy lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in the &lt;b&gt;foothills of the Pyrenees&lt;/b&gt;, war clouds approach Esclarmonde's hunted heretics, who protect an &lt;b&gt;ancient scroll&lt;/b&gt; containing shattering revelations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Declared outlaws by the Church, the Occitan knights who defend Esclarmonde's family and followers determine to make their last stand atop &lt;b&gt;Montsegur&lt;/b&gt;, a haunting mountain keep that protects a sacred treasure. Their heroic resistance against the papal and French armies evokes the legendary defiance of the Jewish rebels against the Roman legions at Masada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Myth and history collide in this sweeping saga of crusading fanaticism, courtly romance, knightly valor, and monastic conspiracy set during the infamous &lt;b&gt;Albigensian Crusade&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Foreword Book-of-the-Year Finalist/Honorable Mention Historical Fiction&lt;br /&gt;-- NIEA Award for Best New Fiction&lt;br /&gt;-- Nautilus Silver Award&lt;br /&gt;-- IPPY Silver Award&lt;br /&gt;-- Eric Hoffer Award Finalist/Honorable Mention&lt;br /&gt;-- Da Vinci Eye Award Finalist</description>

  <description>Troy: city of gold, gatekeeper of the east, haven of the god-born and the lucky, a city destined to last a thousand years. But the Fates have other plans—the Fates, and a woman named Helen. In the shadow of Troy's gates, all must be reborn in the greatest war of the ancient world: slaves and queens, heroes and cowards, seers and kings . . . and these are their stories. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A young princess and an embittered prince join forces to prevent a fatal elopement. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A tormented seeress challenges the gods themselves to save her city from the impending disaster. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A tragedy-haunted king battles private demons and envious rivals as the siege grinds on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A captured slave girl seizes the reins of her future as two mighty heroes meet in an epic duel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A grizzled archer and a desperate Amazon risk their lives to avenge their dead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A trickster conceives the greatest trick of all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A goddess' son battles to save the spirit of Troy even as the walls are breached in fire and blood. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Seven authors bring to life the epic tale of the Trojan War: its heroes, its villains, its survivors, its dead. Who will lie forgotten in the embers, and who will rise to shape the bloody dawn of a new age? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

Moving south the Geats raid deeply into the lands of the Salian Francs, carrying sword and spear to the regions of the Hetware and Cherusci as the Christian giant in the south slumbers on. &lt;br /&gt;But appearances can deceive. As the long days of midsummer slowly fade and the Geats prepare to sail away back to their northern fastness the Francs and Frisians move to crush their tormentors. &lt;br /&gt;Into this whirlwind the paths of three heroes converge until they meet on the bloody battlefield before the town of Dorestada. Only the gods can know which, if any, will survive the clash. &lt;br /&gt;Dayraven-Hygelac's Raid is a final novella in the acclaimed Sword of Woden series dealing with the early life story of Beowulf and his clan.</description>

Before the lawmen can track them down though, Will Scaflock is attacked and another of their old companions murdered in his own home by the outlaws whose leader seems to have only one thing on his mind: &lt;br /&gt;Bloody vengeance! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Robin’s reunited gang be enough to defeat this savage new threat that seeks to wipe them out one by one? Or will another old foe provide the final twist that sees England’s greatest longbowman dead and buried? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stunning conclusion to the bestselling Forest Lord series will delight and entertain readers looking for action packed historical fiction in the mould of Scarrow, Kane and Cornwell!</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Her life would be marked by scandal and suspicion, worship and adoration…&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the tender age of fourteen, Livia Drusilla overhears her father and fellow aristocrats plotting the assassination of Julius Caesar. Proving herself an astute confidante, she becomes her father’s chief political asset—and reluctantly enters into an advantageous marriage to a prominent military officer. Her mother tells her, “It is possible for a woman to influence public affairs,” reminding Livia that—while she possesses a keen sense for the machinations of the Roman senate—she must also remain patient and practical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But patience and practicality disappear from Livia’s mind when she meets Caesar’s heir, Octavianus. At only eighteen, he displays both power and modesty. A young wife by that point, Livia finds herself drawn to the golden-haired boy. In time, his fortunes will rise as Livia’s family faces terrible danger. But her sharp intellect—and her heart—will lead Livia to make an unbelievable choice: one that will give her greater sway over Rome than she could have ever foreseen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>As a young woman living in the high mountains of Crete Talita knows nothing of the opulent and sophisticated civilisation developing in the cities of the coast. Yet when her uncle sells her and she is taken to the city of Mulia she determines to make the best of her new life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mulia is famous for its thrilling and deadly acrobatic displays, where young men face the fierce charges of giant bulls, leaping over them or dying in the attempt. Talita is sold to the owner of the arena and trains as a dancer, her job to entertain the audience and goad the raging bulls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet she wants more than this. In the high mountains she had protected her flocks from bears and wolves and was undaunted by them. Now she yearns to be a bull-leaper, a profession reserved only for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she realises that she has a bond with Torq, the greatest of the bulls, her ambition grows even stronger. Yet her dreams are thwarted when priests arrive from the Kingdom of Egypt and steal Torq away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her enemies accuse Talita of taking him and she and her lover Pellon are condemned to a hideous death. Will she find the strength and courage to escape, find Torq and prove her innocence?</description>

  <description>Ruso and Tilla's excitement at arriving in Rome with their new baby daughter is soon dulled by their discovery that the grand facades of polished marble mask an underworld of corrupt landlords and vermin-infested tenements. There are also far too many doctors--some skilled--but others positively dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruso thinks he has been offered a reputable medical practice only to find that his predecessor Doctor Kleitos has fled, leaving a dead man in a barrel on the doorstep and the warning, “Be careful who you trust.” Distracted by the body and his efforts to help a friend win the hand of a rich young heiress, Ruso makes a grave mistake, causing him to question both his competence and his integrity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Ruso's reputation under threat, he and Tilla must protect their small family from Doctor Kleitos's debt collectors and find allies in their new home while they track down the vanished doctor and find out the truth about the heiress's dead father--Ruso's patient--and the unfortunate man in the barrel.</description>

  <description>As the cataclysmic events unfold at Ravenswood, Beowulf is left fighting his own very personal war against the forces of Hel. Finally cured with the help of the wizard Asgrim, Beowulf and the men of his comitatus gather their forces and travel to Heorot to finally confront the monster, Grendel. &lt;br /&gt;In a journey which sweeps across the north, from the depths of the great Swedish forests and the marshes of Frisland to the gentle hills surrounding Sutton Hoo, Beowulf finally discovers that killing Grendel was not his sternest test after all. Woden has one more, even more powerful fiend to confront as the Gods vie for ascendancy over middle earth. &lt;br /&gt;Sword of Woden, Monsters, is the conclusion of a trilogy of novels which seek to tell the early life story of Beowulf and his clan, the Swertings. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Geatland – Late Summer 517 AD &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fresh from the desperate defence of the Northern borders of the Kingdom, Beowulf is appointed by King Hythcyn to lead the greatest ship army in the history of his people, carrying fire and sword to the ‘Black Heart’ of their enemies. But all is not as it seems. Hythcyn’s actions have thrust a flaming brand into the delicate balance of power in the Scandinavian lands, setting a series of events in motion which quickly spiral out of control. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Beowulf begins to understand that the Allfather is carefully grooming him to confront the Grendel, a mysterious affliction begins to cast its long dark shadow across his soul, causing him to fear for his sanity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In an enthralling tale of brutal battles, love and betrayal, Beowulf and his closest kin are swept up by the storm and scattered to the winds. From the mountainous rollers of the North Atlantic to the frozen forests of Swede Land and the bloody temple at Uppsala, Beowulf and his fellow exiles, the Wraeccan, gather their strength and prepare to confront King Hythcyn in the final battle for Geatland. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PRAISE FOR BOOK ONE ‘SWORD OF WODEN-SORROW HILL’ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;…a great start to a very promising series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;…fast paced and exciting… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;…the style of prose used by C.R.May is so much better than normal debut novels. His story is well paced and wonderfully descriptive but most of all he knows how to tell a damn good yarn. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;…one of the best battle sequences I have had the pleasure of reading for some time. Definitely recommended. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The characters became real, multi-faceted people, always the mark of a good writer.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A forbidden love. A daring escape. A gathering storm.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forty years have passed since the Empire was restored. Emperor Kiva the Golden, his wife Jala Parishid, and his brother Marshal Quintillian have together overseen decades of peace and prosperity, a time when the horrors of the civil war could begin to fade from memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But nothing can last forever. A forbidden love drives Quintillian from the capital far into the eastern deserts, where he discovers an unprecedented threat to the Empire’s very survival. And when Jala is kidnapped by a sinister and ruthless group of warriors, it will take all of Kiva’s strength to defend her, his people, and their destiny…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Insurgency&lt;/i&gt; is the fourth novel in S.J.A. Turney’s Tales of the Empire series, set in a world inspired by Roman history. A sweeping tale of deception, cunning, and military valour, this will appeal to readers of Matthew Harffy, Simon Scarrow, and K.M. Ashman.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>318 BC. The Macedonian Empire remains in chaos after the unexpected death of Alexander the Great five years earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrikos and Vettias continue the work of the King’s Hand as the fate of their beleaguered army hangs in the balance at the mountain fortress of Nora. They receive orders to embark on a new clandestine mission that could reverse the fortunes of their army and possibly change the course of history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also another rite of passage for Andrikos as he strives to take on the responsibilities and emotions of a man beyond his years. He and his mentor navigate this fascinating and dangerous world to save Alexander’s surviving heirs, fulfill the promise made to Andrikos’ love, Mara, while serving the very men who wish to usurp the Argead Dynasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expect plotting, treachery and military might in Christian Kachel’s absorbing sequel to his critically acclaimed debut novel that explores the little known age of post-Alexandrian Greece. World on Fire continues the story of a young man's coming-of-age through alliances, espionage and epic battles played out over the span of the known world. Readers are sure to be captivated as they are once again drawn in by Kachel's vivid depictions of the ancient world in this thoroughly researched historical narrative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kachel’s first book, Spoils of Olympus: By the Sword, won First Place for Best Ancient History novel in the 2015 Chaucer Awards held by Chanticleer Book Reviews, won the Bronze Medal for Best Historical Fiction in the 2015 Reader’s Favorite Book Reviews and Award Contest, and was a finalist for Best Historical Fiction in the 2015 National Indie Excellence Awards.</description>

  <description>Cicero returns to continue his struggle to grasp supreme power in the state of Rome. Amidst treachery, vengeance, violence, and treason, this brilliant lawyer, orator, and philosopher finally reaches the summit of all his ambitions. Cicero becomes known as the world's first professional politician, using his compassion, and deviousness, to overcome all obstacles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Compelling historical fiction at its best: Harris employs historical detail and an engrosing plot to give readers a man who is by turns a sympathetic hero and compromising manipulator who sets himself up for his own massive, violent ruin. This trilogy charges forward, propelled by the strength of Harris's stunningly fascinating prose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Internationally bestselling author: "Imperium" was hailed as "quite possibly Harris's most accomplished work to date" ( "Los Angeles Times" ) and has received rave reviews from across the globe. Robert Harris's novels have sold more than 10 million copies and have been translated into thirty-seven languages.</description>

  <description>Adam de Guirande has barely survived the aftermath of Roger Mortimer’s rebellion in 1321. When Mortimer manages to escape the Tower and flee to France, anyone who has ever served Mortimer becomes a potential traitor – at least in the eyes of King Edward II and his royal chancellor, Hugh Despenser. Adam must conduct a careful balancing act to keep himself and his family alive. Fortunately, he has two formidable allies: Queen Isabella and his wife, Kit. England late in 1323 is a place afflicted by fear. Now that the king’s greatest traitor, Roger Mortimer, has managed to evade royal justice, the king and his beloved Despenser see dissidents and rebels everywhere – among Mortimer’s former men, but also in the queen, Isabella of France.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their suspicions are not unfounded. Tired of being relegated to the background by the king’s grasping favourite, Isabella has decided it is time to act – to safeguard her own position, but also that of her son, Edward of Windsor. As Adam de Guirande has pledged himself to Prince Edward he is automatically drawn into the queen’s plans – whether he likes it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet again, Kit and Adam are forced to take part in a complicated game of intrigue and politics. Yet again, they risk their lives – and that of those they hold dear – as the king and Mortimer face off. Once again, England is plunged into war – and this time it will not end until either Despenser or Mortimer is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days of Sun and Glory is the second in Anna Belfrage’s series, The King’s Greatest Enemy, the story of a man torn apart by his loyalties to his lord, his king, and his wife.</description>

  <description>Facing the threat of King Philip’s Enterprise of England – Spanish invasion and annexation of the country – Sir Francis Walsingham’s secret service spreads a network of agents across Europe. After caring for hundreds of maimed and wounded soldiers returning from the fall of Sluys, young physician and code-breaker Christoval Alvarez is sent on two dangerous missions to Amsterdam, where, amongst the friendly Hollanders, treason and treachery lurks. Christoval’s ship, sailing home, plays its part in the great sea battle in which the small and inexperienced English navy must confront the most powerful sea force in the world.</description>

  <description>Heart of Evil A year has passed since the end of the Gallic rebellion of Sacrovir and Florus. Retribution has been exacted and the province is at peace once more. And yet there are some who escaped Rome's justice. They are led by a man whose heart burns with hate; an heir to rebellion. Knowing that there can be no victory against the legions; his vengeance can only be wrought through terror and murder. The Gallic city of Lugdunum will be the first to taste his wrath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The city of Lugdunum flourishes; the Twentieth Legion's Third Cohort having been stationed within the city since the end of the Sacrovir Revolt. For Centurion Proculus and his legionaries their comfortable assignment will soon come unraveled as a series of grisly murders looks to upset the order of the city. Sergeant Artorius inadvertently finds himself at the center of the search to find these mysterious killers before they undermine the city's faith in the protection of the legions; a search that will lead him on a journey into the darkest corners of what lurks in a broken man's wicked soul.</description>

  <description>Rome 68 AD. Slaughtering hundreds of civilians at the gates of Rome is hardly the best introduction for new Emperor Galba to his city. However the aged ruler is determined to get on with clearing up the mess Nero left. Assisting him are his three men: Vinius, Laco and Icelus. Also in his entourage one Marcus Salvius Otho. Jovial, charming and fatally reckless Otho is armed with a killer idea: Wouldn't it be marvellous if the childless Galba adopted him as his heir? Appointing old pal Epaphroditus as his campaign manager, Otho sets about winning hearts and minds in his own unique cheery way. For Epaphroditus it is a harmless way of enlivening his post Nero retirement; either Galba makes Otho his heir, or he doesn't. What could possibly go wrong? For once the former Palace manipulator has fatally miscalculated. These are paranoid times and Otho's 'harmless' plan is about to bring Rome to its knees.</description>

  <description>“Keep your eyes open, Gnaeus, and don’t fall asleep. You’ve just made your enemy more powerful than yourself.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;79 BCE. Gnaeus Pompey, recently returned to Rome in triumph, has almost singlehandedly brought the civil war to a standstill. As the memory of Gaius Marius begins to slowly fade, another war has begun to rage within Rome's own streets and far to the west. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hailed as Great by his own loyal soldiers, Pompey's elders still have their doubts. With his age and Rome's elite politicians working against him, will he follow the course set for him or continue to carve a path of significance by his own means? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Spanning two continents and the violent sea between them, Triumphator is the second book in Robert Allen Johnson's awe inspiring MAGNUS trilogy.</description>

  <description>We are behind, and below, the scenes of JFK's presidential election, the Bay of Pigs, the assassination—in the underworld that connects Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago, D.C....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the CIA, the Mob, J. Edgar Hoover, Howard Hughes, Jimmy Hoffa, Cuban political exiles, and various loose cannons conspire in a covert anarchy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the right drugs, the right amount of cash, the right murder, buys a moment of a man's loyalty...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where three renegade law-enforcement officers—a former L.A. cop and two FBI agents—are shaping events with the virulence of their greed and hatred, riding full-blast shotgun into history....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Ellroy's trademark nothing-spared rendering of reality, blistering language, and relentless narrative pace are here in electrifying abundance, put to work in a novel as shocking and daring as anything he's written: a secret history that zeroes in on a time still shrouded in secrets and blows it wide open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chosen by &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; magazine as one of the ten best books of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Hard-bitten ... ingenious ... Ellroy segues into political intrigue without missing a beat." —&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Vastly entertaining." —&lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"One hellishly exciting ride." —&lt;i&gt;Detroit Free Press&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A supremely controlled work of art." —&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;When love commands, destiny must obey!&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Against an epic background and torn between duty and passion, Arria Felix, a Roman senator’s daughter, must choose between Rome’s decadent world and her forbidden love - Garic, a Frank barbarian noble.&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;The year is AD 450.&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Roman Empire wanes as the Medieval Age awakens. Attila the Hun and his horde conquer their way across Europe into Gaul. Caught between Rome’s tottering empire and Attila’s threat are the Frankish tribes and their &lt;i&gt;‘Long-Hair’&lt;/i&gt; chiefs, northern pagans in a Roman Christian world, and a people history will call the Merovingians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A young widow, Arria longs for a purpose and a challenge. She is as well versed in politics and diplomacy as any man … &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;but with special skills of her own...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Emperor Valentinian, determined to gain allies to help stop the Huns, sends a remarkable envoy, a woman, to the Assembly of Warriors in Gaul. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Arria will persuade the Franks to stand with Rome against Attila!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When barbarian raiders abduct Arria, the Frank blue-eyed warrior, Garic, rescues her. Alarmed by the instant and passionate attraction she feels, Arria is torn between duty and desire. Her arranged betrothal to the ambitious tribune, Drusus, her secret enlistment by Valentinian as a courier to Attila the Hun, and a mysterious riddle - threaten their love and propel them into adventure, intrigue, and Attila’s camp. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rebels in a falling empire, Arria and Garic must find the strength to defy tradition and possess the love prophesied as their destiny!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <description>Fresh from their victory in Germania, Marcus Aquila and the Tungrians have been sent to Dacia, on the north-eastern edge of the Roman Empire, with the mission to safeguard a major source of imperial power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mines of Alburnus Major contain enough gold to pave the road to Rome. They would make a mighty prize for the marauding Sarmatae tribesmen who threaten the province, and the outnumbered auxiliaries are entrusted with their safety in the face of a barbarian invasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beset by both the Sarmatian horde and more subtle threats offered by men who should be their comrades, the Tungrians must also come to terms with the danger posed by a new and unexpected enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They will have to fight to the death to save the honour of the empire - and their own skins.</description>

  <description>The Norman conquerors are tightening their grip upon England. Only one person stands in the way of their final triumph. Edgar Atheling continues to battle for his lost throne, doggedly refusing to bend the knee. Having survived an attempt upon his life he now prepares to journey south to continue the conflict against the Norman heartlands. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet when his fleet is shipwrecked and his friends are captured by the Normans he faces a desperate decision. He finally submits to William and returns to England where he is given a derisory amount of land and wealth. Despite this he decides not to support the ill-fated Revolt of the Earls and endeavours to settle into his new existence. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet he still desires the throne and glory. The people he loves are in conflict over the future, his wealth is slowly but surely taken from him, he begins to doubt his destiny. Yet when he hears that his old friend Cnut, now King of the Danes, plans to invade England, Edgar once more takes up the sword. The invasion fails but Edgar will not be daunted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He makes a momentous decision which will change his life and those of his friends forever. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>'The second fall of Rome?' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aurelia Mitela, ex-Praetorian and imperial councillor in Roma Nova, scoffs at her intelligence chief when he throws a red file on her desk. But 1980s Roma Nova, the last province of the Roman Empire that has survived into the twentieth century, has problems - a ruler frightened of governing, a centuries-old bureaucracy creaking for reform and, worst of all, a rising nationalist movement with a charismatic leader. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrified when her daughter is brutally attacked in a demonstration turned riot, Aurelia tries to rally resistance to the growing fear and instability. But it may already be too late to save Roma Nova from meltdown and herself from entrapment and destruction by her lifelong enemy...</description>

  <description>When one of their friends is captured and sold into slavery in the land of the Rus, the children of the old chieftain and their comrades decide to risk everything to rescue him. Little do they know what awaits them when they embark on the Viking ship, the 'Eagle'. In addition to the dangers of the sea voyage, they must face the villainy of a traitor, marauding pirates and robbers, before they end up in a seemingly hopeless situation as slaves in a quarry. To add to their problems, they learn that they have provoked the anger of the new chieftain of their island home and have been banished.</description>

  <description>Jack Lark has come a long way since his days as a gin palace pot boy. But can he surrender the thrill of freedom to return home?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London, 1859. After years fighting for Queen and country, Jack walks back into his mother's East End gin palace a changed man. Haunted by the horrors of battle, and the constant fight for survival, he longs for a life to call his own. But the city - and its people - has altered almost beyond recognition, and Jack cannot see a place for himself there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A desperate moment leaves him indebted to the Devil - intelligence officer Major John Ballard, who once again leads Jack to the battlefield with a task he can't refuse. He tried to deny being a soldier once. He won't make the same mistake again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Europe is about to go to war. Jack Lark will march with them.</description>

  <description>The armies of Troy have been defeated and the city lies in ruins, but for Odysseus his greatest challenge is just beginning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With his oath fulfilled, Odysseus sets sail for Ithaca and the long-awaited reunion with his family. But the gods who were once his allies have turned against him, exiling him and the warrior Eperitus into a world populated with seductive demi-gods and man-eating monsters. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As they struggle from one supernatural encounter to another, never knowing what the next landfall will bring, their chances of ever returning home grow fainter. Tensions reach breaking point between Odysseus and his crew. Even the faithful Eperitus’s loyalties are divided. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eventually only one hope remains. For Odysseus to see his wife and son again, he must tread the paths of the dead and descend into the pits of Hell… &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Geatland in the first decades of the sixth century was an island of peace amidst the upheaval which marked the death throes of the Roman Empire in the West. Under the benevolent rule of King Hrethel and his sons the King’s grandchild, Beowulf, the only child of his daughter, is carefully groomed by the family in the skills and duties of the warrior elite. As Beowulf reaches adulthood a death suddenly tears the family apart. Torn between family loyalties and the freshly sworn demands of his warrior code, Beowulf must choose between those he loves and his personal ambition as the dynasty begins to tear itself apart. Sensing weakness the Geats most feared enemy appears on their northern border and Beowulf must fight his first desperate battle to save the Kingdom…. &lt;br /&gt;Skilfully interwoven into the fabric of the old English poem we know as ‘Beowulf’ lies the tale of a great but ultimately doomed people, the Geats. It is a tale of decay and renewal as the old order is swept away and the new nations of Europe struggle to emerge from the ensuing chaos in an age when it was common for Kings to die in battle. &lt;br /&gt;Beowulf, Sorrow Hill, is the first in a series of novels which seek to unravel the threads contained within the original poem by recounting the full life story of Beowulf and his family. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Almost a year has passed since the great barbarian army of the Senones crossed the Apeninnus and crushed the Etruscan forces outside Clusium. Determined to avenge the death of Crixos at the hands of the Roman general Numerius, the savage warriors of the barbarian leader Brennus recross the mountains and bear down on the city as Solemis and the Horsetail clan ravage Latium. &lt;br /&gt;Confident in the might of their arms, the citizens of the great city gather on the Field of Mars to cheer their army as it marches to drive away the threat. But the battle does not follow its expected course. Overwhelmed by the ferocity and tenacious brutality of the Gaulish warriors the army of Rome is routed, and the Fabii and their fellow citizens face the judgement of Nemesis as the mournful howl of barbarian war horns approach. &lt;br /&gt;Other gods also scheme, and the druid Catumanda begins to understand that her journey may have a terrible conclusion... &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>*Revised 2012 Edition* A Shadow Rising It has been three years since the wars against Arminius and the Cherusci. Gaius Silius, Legate of the Twentieth Legion, is concerned that the barbarians-though shattered by the war-may be stirring once again. He also seeks to confirm the rumors regarding Arminius' death. What Silius does not realize is that there is a new threat to the Empire, but it does not come from beyond the frontier; it is coming from within, where a disenchanted nobleman looks to sow the seeds of rebellion in Gaul. Legionary Artorius has greatly matured during his five years in the legions. He has become stronger in mind; his body growing even more powerful. Like the rest of the Legion, he is unaware of the shadow growing well within the Empire's borders, where a disaffected nobleman seeks to betray the Emperor Tiberius. A shadow looms; one that looks to envelope the province of Gaul as well as the Rhine legions. The year is 20 A.D.</description>

  <description>"An epic work of historical and military fiction. . . a prime work for Roman history lovers." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- InD'Tale Magazine &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caesar and Brutus. Marius and Sulla. Cicero, Antony, Clodius and Augustus. The century before the current era gave us a host of larger-than-life characters hailing from Rome. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one was named Great. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the year 90 B.C.E., chaos and unrest erupts across the Italian peninsula. Rome's allies have rebelled and taken up arms against the most powerful military on earth. Leading Rome's legions - and his only son - to the city's defense, an unproven and unloved commander will taste victory and defeat outside the capital's gates. The name Pompey had yet to be praised and revered, but fate would soon alter the course of one man's life.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RISING SUN is the first book in Robert Allen Johnson's captivating MAGNUS trilogy. Narrated by the last living son of Gnaeus Pompey, RISING SUN sets the stage for the man historians would later name the Roman Alexander.</description>

  <description>Based on the true story of Cleopatra’s daughter…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of abuse as the emperor’s captive in Rome, Cleopatra Selene has found a safe harbor. No longer the pitiful orphaned daughter of the despised Egyptian Whore, the twenty year old is now the most powerful queen in the empire, ruling over the kingdom of Mauretania—an exotic land of enchanting possibility where she intends to revive her dynasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her husband, King Juba II and the magic of Isis that is her birthright, Selene brings prosperity and peace to a kingdom thirsty for both. But when Augustus Caesar jealously demands that Selene’s children be given over to him to be fostered in Rome, she’s drawn back into the web of imperial plots and intrigues that she vowed to leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined and resourceful, Selene must shield her loved ones from the emperor’s wrath, all while vying with ruthless rivals like King Herod. Can she find a way to overcome the threat to her marriage, her kingdom, her family, and her faith? Or will she be the last of her line?</description>

  <description>Using scholarly, historical insight, and evocative storytelling that brings to life the glories of ancient Rome, Steven Saylor takes the reader from the bloody lines of clashing Roman armies to the backrooms of the Senate floor, where power-hungry politicians wrestle the Fates for control of Rome's destiny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the consular election drawing near, Rome is fiercely divided between the conservative Cicero and the tempestuous Catilina, whose followers are rumored to be plotting a blood-thirsty siege for power if their leader fails to win office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gordianus the Finder, retired to his Etruscan farm, is happy to be free of the intrigue and danger of the capital, but when his old friend Cicero enlists the Finder in an elaborate plot to control Catilina, Gordianus is drawn back into a familiar world. Now caught in a cloak-and-dagger political struggle for the fate of the Republic, Gordianus finds himself strangely drawn to the controversial candidate. Is Catilina really a subversive renegade, or are Cicero suspicions part of an even greater conspiracy? When a headless corpse ominously appears on his farm, Gordianus knows he must unlock the secret of &lt;i&gt;Catilina's Riddle&lt;/i&gt; before Rome tears herself apart.</description>

  <description>Adam de Guirande owes his lord, Sir Roger Mortimer, much more than loyalty. He owes Sir Roger for his life and all his worldly goods, he owes him for his beautiful wife – even if Kit is not quite the woman Sir Roger thinks she is. So when Sir Roger rises in rebellion against the king, Adam has no choice but to ride with him – no matter what the ultimate cost may be. &lt;br /&gt;England in 1321 is a confusing place. Edward II has been forced by his barons to exile his favourite, Hugh Despenser. The barons, led by the powerful Thomas of Lancaster, Roger Mortimer and Humphrey de Bohun, have reasons to believe they have finally tamed the king. But Edward is not about to take things lying down, and fate is a fickle mistress, favouring first one, then the other. &lt;br /&gt;Adam fears his lord has over-reached, but at present Adam has other matters to concern him, first and foremost his new wife, Katherine de Monmouth. His bride comes surrounded by rumours concerning her and the baron, and he hates it when his brother snickers and whispers of used goods. &lt;br /&gt;Kit de Courcy has the misfortune of being a perfect double of Katherine de Monmouth – which is why she finds herself coerced into wedding a man under a false name. What will Adam do when he finds out he has been duped? &lt;br /&gt;Domestic matters become irrelevant when the king sets out to punish his rebellious barons. The Welsh Marches explode into war, and soon Sir Roger and his men are fighting for their very lives. When hope splutters and dies, when death seems inevitable, it falls to Kit to save her man – if she can. &lt;br /&gt;'In the Shadow of the Storm' is the first in Anna Belfrage’s new series,The King’s Greatest Enemy, the story of a man torn apart by his loyalties to his baron, his king, and his wife. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>"I hope there's a good explanation for this, Colonel Babbitt," Fairfax said, with a sigh. &lt;br /&gt;"No," said Hollie honestly, "but there is an explanation." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There's a lot of miles between Essex and Cheshire.... &lt;br /&gt;...and newly-promoted Colonel Hollie Babbitt is cursing the most recent additions to his company, for every step of them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A scarred lieutenant with a death wish, and they don't call him Hapless for nothing. &lt;br /&gt;Captain Drew Venning. And his dog. &lt;br /&gt;Captain Penitence Chedglow, last seen smashing up the inside of Worcester Cathedral in an excess of godly zeal, and his new companion in bigotry, the silent but violent Webb. &lt;br /&gt;The mysterious Trooper Gray, a one-man insurrection. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forced to leave a posting to Cromwell's Eastern Association as a result of some more than usually scatter-brained chivalric meddling by the posh poet Lucey Pettitt, Hollie finds himself up to the elbows in freezing mud at Nantwich, mired in intrigue and insubordination. &lt;br /&gt;When Hollie's old nemesis Prince Rupert relieves the siege at Newark, freeing up a cavalry force to hammer Fairfax’s garrisons in Yorkshire, it looks as if the gallant Parliamentarian defenders will be overwhelmed in the North. But after a fierce attack is repulsed, the Northern Royalists retreat to their foothold at Selby, with its vital strategic command of both the Ouse and the road to York. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It will be hard. It will surely be bloody. But can Hollie’s rebel rabble make the difference between victory and defeat for Parliament in the North?</description>

  <description>In 1540 Hernando de Soto and 600 Spanish conquistadors crossed the Savannah River into what is now South Carolina and thus entered the empire of the Chicora, the largest and most powerful Native American civilization in the Southeast. Modern archaeologists have yet to find any trace of that once vibrant society. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although now considered a lost civilization, when the Spanish arrived the Chicora were led by a beautiful queen and had a magnificent temple filled with the remains of their honored ancestors. Did Hernando de Soto, a ruthless conquistador with a lust for gold, bring about their downfall? THE RIVER OF CORN is a powerful tale of the destruction of these American Indians told by an experienced South Carolina fiction writer who spent his youth in the locales he writes about, places that match the Spanish accounts almost exactly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Who were the Chicora? What really happened to them? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>
