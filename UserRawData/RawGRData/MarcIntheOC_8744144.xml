  <description>Lily Buschwald is ready to live life on her own terms. After years in foster care, she is determined to leave behind everything she knows for the adventure of a lifetime: teaching English to a wealthy family in Cochabamba, Bolivia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the program she’s signed up for is a scam. Suddenly rudderless and broke, she begins a whirlwind romance with Omar, a savvy, handsome local who’s left his life as a hunter in the remote jungle village to try city life. When Omar learns that a jaguar has killed his brother’s child in Ayachero, he gives Lily a choice: stay alone in the unforgiving city, or marry him and travel to the last in an ever-isolated string of river towns. Love-struck Lily sees no option. She follows Omar to a ruthless new world of lawless poachers, heartless missionaries, and option-less indigenous tribes driven to the brink of survival. A far cry from the romantic life she imagined, Lily is forced to navigate the jungle—and its residents—using her wits and resilience.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Poet Ocean Vuong's debut novel is a shattering portrait of a family, a first love, and the redemptive power of storytelling&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous&lt;/i&gt; is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born — a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, &lt;i&gt;On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous&lt;/i&gt; is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and how to make of it a kind of joy, powers the most important debut novel of many years.</description>

  <description>Melanie, a perfectionist mom who views the approaching end of parenting as a type of death, can t believe she has only one more year to live vicariously through her slacker senior son, Dane. Gorgeous mom Sarah has just begun to realize that her only daughter, Ashley, has been serving as a stand-in for her traveling husband, and the thought of her daughter leaving for college is cracking the carefully cultivated facade of her life. Will and his wife are fine as long as he follows the instructions on the family calendar and is sure to keep secret his whole other life with Lauren, the woman he turns to for fun (and who also happens to have a daughter in the senior class). &lt;br /&gt; Told from the points of view of both the parents and the kids, The Goodbye Year explores high school peer pressure, what it s like for young people to face the unknown of life after high school, and how a transition that should be the beginning of a couple s second act together empty nesting is often actually the end."</description>

  <description>A taut, psychological mind-bender from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;I’m Thinking of Ending Things.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;We don’t get visitors. Not out here. We never have.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In Iain Reid’s second haunting, philosophical puzzle of a novel, set in the near-future, Junior and Henrietta live a comfortable, solitary life on their farm, far from the city lights, but in close quarters with each other. One day, a stranger from the city arrives with alarming news: Junior has been randomly selected to travel far away from the farm...very far away. The most unusual part? Arrangements have already been made so that when he leaves, Henrietta won't have a chance to miss him, because she won't be left alone—not even for a moment. Henrietta will have company. Familiar company.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Told in Reid’s sharp and evocative style, &lt;i&gt;Foe&lt;/i&gt; examines the nature of domestic relationships, self-determination, and what it means to be (or not to be) a person. An eerily entrancing page-turner, it churns with unease and suspense from the first words to its shocking finale.</description>

  <description>On an early morning in November, a couple boards a private plane bound for Geneva, flying into a storm. Soon after, it simply drops off the radar, and its wreckage is later uncovered in the Alps. Among the disappeared is Matthew Werner, a banking insider at Swiss United, a powerful offshore bank. His young widow, Annabel, is left grappling with the secrets he left behind, including an encrypted laptop and a shady client list. As she begins a desperate search for answers, she determines that Matthew's death was no accident, and that she is now in the crosshairs of his powerful enemies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, ambitious society journalist Marina Tourneau has finally landed at the top. Now that she's engaged to Grant Ellis, she will stop writing about powerful families and finally be a part of one. Her entry into the upper echelons of New York's social scene is more appealing than any article could ever be, but, after the death of her mentor, she agrees to dig into one more story. While looking into Swiss United, Marina uncovers information that implicates some of the most powerful men in the financial world, including a few who are too close to home. The story could also be the answer to Annabel's heartbreaking search--if Marina chooses to publish it.</description>

  <description>No visitors. No nights spent away from the apartment. No disturbing the other residents, all of whom are rich or famous or both. These are the only rules for Jules Larsen's new job as an apartment sitter at the Bartholomew, one of Manhattan's most high-profile and mysterious buildings. Recently heartbroken and just plain broke, Jules is taken in by the splendor of her surroundings and accepts the terms, ready to leave her past life behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she gets to know the residents and staff of the Bartholomew, Jules finds herself drawn to fellow apartment sitter Ingrid, who comfortingly, disturbingly reminds her of the sister she lost eight years ago. When Ingrid confides that the Bartholomew is not what it seems and the dark history hidden beneath its gleaming facade is starting to frighten her, Jules brushes it off as a harmless ghost story—until the next day, when Ingrid disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searching for the truth about Ingrid's disappearance, Jules digs deeper into the Bartholomew's dark past and into the secrets kept within its walls. Her discovery that Ingrid is not the first apartment sitter to go missing at the Bartholomew pits Jules against the clock as she races to unmask a killer, expose the building's hidden past, and escape the Bartholomew before her temporary status becomes permanent.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The internationally bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Last Mrs. Parrish&lt;/em&gt; follows that success with an addictive novel filled with shocking twists about the aftermath of a brutal high-society murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Kate English has it all. Not only is she the heiress to a large fortune; she has a gorgeous husband and daughter, a high-flying career, and a beautiful home anyone would envy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all that changes the night Kate’s mother, Lily, is found dead, brutally murdered in her own home. Heartbroken and distraught, Kate reaches out to her estranged best friend, Blaire Barrington, who rushes to her side for the funeral, where the years of distance between them are forgotten in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That evening, Kate’s grief turns to horror when she receives an anonymous text: &lt;em&gt;You think you’re sad now, just wait. By the time I’m finished with you, you’ll wish you had been buried today&lt;/em&gt;. More than ever, Kate needs her old friend’s help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Blaire decides to take the investigation into her own hands, it becomes clear that all is not as it seems in Baltimore high society. As infidelity, lies, and betrayals come to light, and tensions rise to a boiling point, she begins to alienate Kate’s friends and relatives with her relentless, accusatory questions, as she tries to find Lily’s killer. The murderer could be anyone—friend, neighbor, loved one. But whoever it is, it’s clear that Kate is next on their list. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Last Time I Saw You&lt;/em&gt;, Liv Constantine takes the lightning pace of &lt;em&gt;The Last Mrs. Parrish&lt;/em&gt; and raises the stakes, creating an exquisitely tension-filled and absorbing tale of psychological suspense in which innocent lives—and one woman’s sanity—hang in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A spine-tingling new collection of stories from the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;Thrill Me&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Dark Net&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Benjamin Percy is a versatile and propulsive storyteller whose genre-busting novels and story collections have ranged from literary to thriller to postapocalyptic. In his essay collection, &lt;i&gt;Thrill Me&lt;/i&gt;, he laid bare for readers how and why he channels disparate influences in his work. Now, in his first story collection since the acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Refresh, Refresh&lt;/i&gt;, Percy brings his page-turning skills to bear in &lt;i&gt;Suicide Woods&lt;/i&gt;, a potent brew of horror, crime, and weird happenings in the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A boy in his uncle’s care falls through the ice on a pond and emerges in a frozen, uncanny state. A group of people in therapy for suicidal ideation undergoes a drastic session in the woods with fatal consequences. A body found on a train and a blood-soaked carpet in an empty house are clues to a puzzling crime in a small town. And in a pulse-quickening novella, thrill seekers on a mapping expedition into the “Bermuda Triangle” of remote Alaska are stranded on a sinister island that seems to want them dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In story after story, which have appeared in magazines ranging from the &lt;i&gt;Virginia Quarterly Review&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Orion Magazine&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;McSweeney’s&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ploughshares&lt;/i&gt;, Percy delivers haunting and chilling narratives that will have readers hanging on every word. A master class in suspense and horror, &lt;i&gt;Suicide Woods&lt;/i&gt; is a dark, inventive collection packed to the gills with eerie, can’t-miss tales.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fresh and distinctive writing from an exciting new voice in fiction, &lt;i&gt;Elmet&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable novel about family, as well as a beautiful meditation on landscape. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel is heading north. He is looking for someone. The simplicity of his early life with Daddy and Cathy has turned sour and fearful. They lived apart in the house that Daddy built for them with his bare hands. They foraged and hunted. When they were younger, Daniel and Cathy had gone to school. But they were not like the other children then, and they were even less like them now. Sometimes Daddy disappeared, and would return with a rage in his eyes. But when he was at home he was at peace. He told them that the little copse in Elmet was theirs alone. But that wasn't true. Local men, greedy and watchful, began to circle like vultures. All the while, the terrible violence in Daddy grew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atmospheric and unsettling, &lt;i&gt;Elmet&lt;/i&gt; is a lyrical commentary on contemporary society and one family's precarious place in it, as well as an exploration of how deep the bond between father and child can go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>From the author of the popular Psychic Surveys series, comes a brand new series of STANDALONE novels, set in and around THE WORLD'S MOST HAUNTED PLACES and BLENDING FACT WITH FICTION. &lt;br /&gt;In Book One discover Venice, 'the world's most haunted city' and Poveglia, in the Venetian Lagoon, 'the world's most haunted island'. In Book Two, travel to Pennsylvania for a stay at The Egress Hotel…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A snowstorm, a highway, a lonely hotel…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devastated by the deaths of her parents and disillusioned with life, Caroline Daynes is in America trying to connect with their memory. Travelling to her mother’s hometown of Williamsfield in Pennsylvania, she is caught in a snowstorm and forced to stop at The Egress hotel – somewhere she’d planned to visit as her parents honeymooned there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment she sets foot inside the lobby and meets the surly receptionist, she realises this is a hotel like no other. Charming and unique, it seems lost in time with a whole cast of compelling characters sheltering behind closed doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the storm deepens, so does the mystery of The Egress. Who are these people she’s stranded with and what secrets do they hide? In a situation that’s becoming increasingly nightmarish, is it possible to find solace?</description>

  <description>In this dark, suspenseful thriller, Alex North weaves a multi-generational tale of a father and son caught in the crosshairs of an investigation to catch a serial killer preying on a small town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the sudden death of his wife, Tom Kennedy believes a fresh start will help him and his young son Jake heal. A new beginning, a new house, a new town. Featherbank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the town has a dark past. Twenty years ago, a serial killer abducted and murdered five residents. Until Frank Carter was finally caught, he was nicknamed "The Whisper Man," for he would lure his victims out by whispering at their windows at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Tom and Jake settle into their new home, a young boy vanishes. His disappearance bears an unnerving resemblance to Frank Carter's crimes, reigniting old rumors that he preyed with an accomplice. Now, detectives Amanda Beck and Pete Willis must find the boy before it is too late, even if that means Pete has to revisit his great foe in prison: The Whisper Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Jake begins acting strangely. He hears a whispering at his window...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two brothers meet at the border of their vast cattle properties under the unrelenting sun of outback Queensland, in this stunning new standalone novel from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller Jane Harper&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are at the stockman’s grave, a landmark so old, no one can remember who is buried there. But today, the scant shadow it casts was the last hope for their middle brother, Cameron. The Bright family’s quiet existence is thrown into grief and anguish. Something had been troubling Cameron. Did he lose hope and walk to his death? Because if he didn’t, the isolation of the outback leaves few suspects…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark, suspenseful, and deeply atmospheric, &lt;i&gt;The Lost Man&lt;/i&gt; is the highly anticipated next book from the bestselling and award-winning Jane Harper, author of &lt;i&gt;The Dry&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Force of Nature&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Melanie, a perfectionist mom who views the approaching end of parenting as a type of death, can t believe she has only one more year to live vicariously through her slacker senior son, Dane. Gorgeous mom Sarah has just begun to realize that her only daughter, Ashley, has been serving as a stand-in for her traveling husband, and the thought of her daughter leaving for college is cracking the carefully cultivated facade of her life. Will and his wife are fine as long as he follows the instructions on the family calendar and is sure to keep secret his whole other life with Lauren, the woman he turns to for fun (and who also happens to have a daughter in the senior class). &lt;br /&gt; Told from the points of view of both the parents and the kids, The Goodbye Year explores high school peer pressure, what it s like for young people to face the unknown of life after high school, and how a transition that should be the beginning of a couple s second act together empty nesting is often actually the end."</description>

Diana was exquisitely polite, and properly friendly, but Lucy knew that she was not what Diana envisioned. But who could fault Diana? She was a pillar of the community, an advocate for social justice who helped female refugees assimilate to their new country. Diana was happily married to Tom, and lived in wedded bliss for decades. Lucy wanted so much to please her new mother-in-law. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was five years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Diana has been found dead, a suicide note near her body. Diana claims that she no longer wanted to live because of a battle with cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the autopsy finds no cancer.&lt;br /&gt;The autopsy does find traces of poison and suffocation. &lt;br /&gt;Who could possibly want Diana dead? &lt;br /&gt;Why was her will changed at the eleventh hour to disinherit both of her adult children and their spouses?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Lucy's secrets getting deeper and her relationship with her mother-in-law growing more complex as the pages turn, this new novel from Sally Hepworth is sure to add to her growing legion of fans.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and international bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Sometimes I Lie&lt;/i&gt; comes a brand new, highly anticipated, dark and twisted thriller: &lt;i&gt;I Know Who You Are&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet Aimee Sinclair: the actress everyone thinks they know but can’t remember where from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone knows Aimee very well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They know who she is and they know what she did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Aimee comes home and discovers her husband is missing, she doesn’t seem to know what to do or how to act. The police think she’s hiding something and they’re right, she is—but perhaps not what they thought. Aimee has a secret she’s never shared, and yet, she suspects that someone knows. As she struggles to keep her career and sanity intact, her past comes back to haunt her in ways more dangerous than she could have ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;I Know Who You Are&lt;/i&gt;, Alice Feeney proves that she is a master of brilliantly complicated plots and killer twists that will keep you guessing until the final page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A dark, thrilling new novel from the best-selling author of &lt;i&gt;Longbourn:&lt;/i&gt; a work of riveting psychological suspense that grapples with how to live as a woman in the world--or in the pages of a book--when the stakes are dangerously high.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a young writer accepts a job at a university in the remote English countryside, it's meant to be a fresh start, away from the bustle of London and the scene of a violent assault she is desperate to forget. But despite the distractions of her new life and the demands of single motherhood, her nerves continue to jangle. To make matters worse, a vicious debate about violence against women inflames the tensions and mounting rivalries in her creative-writing class. When a troubled student starts turning in chapters that blur the lines between fiction and reality, the professor recognizes herself as the main character in his book--and he has written her a horrific fate. Will she be able to stop life imitating art before it's too late? At once a breathless cat-and-mouse game and a layered interrogation of the fetishization of the female body, &lt;i&gt;The Body Lies&lt;/i&gt; gives us an essential story for our time that will have you checking the locks on your doors.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is an alternate cover edition of ASIN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search/search?q=B07J4LPZRN" title="B07J4LPZRN" rel="nofollow"&gt;B07J4LPZRN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;A big-hearted romantic comedy in which the First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales after an incident of international proportions forces them to pretend to be best friends...&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Son Alex Claremont-Diaz is the closest thing to a prince this side of the Atlantic. With his intrepid sister and the Veep’s genius granddaughter, they’re the White House Trio, a beautiful millennial marketing strategy for his mother, President Ellen Claremont. International socialite duties do have downsides—namely, when photos of a confrontation with his longtime nemesis Prince Henry at a royal wedding leak to the tabloids and threaten American/British relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan for damage control: staging a fake friendship between the First Son and the Prince. Alex is busy enough handling his mother’s bloodthirsty opponents and his own political ambitions without an uptight royal slowing him down. But beneath Henry’s Prince Charming veneer, there’s a soft-hearted eccentric with a dry sense of humor and more than one ghost haunting him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As President Claremont kicks off her reelection bid, Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret relationship with Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations. And Henry throws everything into question for Alex, an impulsive, charming guy who thought he knew everything: What is worth the sacrifice? How do you do all the good you can do? And, most importantly, how will history remember you?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Colson Whitehead brilliantly dramatizes another strand of American history through the story of two boys sentenced to a hellish reform school in Jim Crow-era Florida.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Civil Rights movement begins to reach the black enclave of Frenchtown in segregated Tallahassee, Elwood Curtis takes the words of Dr. Martin Luther King to heart: He is "as good as anyone." Abandoned by his parents, but kept on the straight and narrow by his grandmother, Elwood is about to enroll in the local black college. But for a black boy in the Jim Crow South in the early 1960s, one innocent mistake is enough to destroy the future. Elwood is sentenced to a juvenile reformatory called The Nickel Academy, whose mission statement says it provides "physical, intellectual and moral training" so the delinquent boys in their charge can become "honorable and honest men."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reality, The Nickel Academy is a grotesque chamber of horrors, where the sadistic staff beats and sexually abuses the students, corrupt officials and locals steal food and supplies, and any boy who resists is likely to disappear "out back." Stunned to find himself in such a vicious environment, Elwood tries to hold on to Dr. King's ringing assertion "Throw us in jail and we will still love you." His friend Turner thinks Elwood is worse than naive, that the world is crooked and the only way to survive is to scheme and avoid trouble. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tension between Elwood's ideals and Turner's skepticism leads to a decision whose repercussions will echo down the decades. Formed in the crucible of the evils Jim Crow wrought, the boys' fates will be determined by what they endured at The Nickel Academy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the real story of a reform school in Florida that operated for one hundred and eleven years and warped the lives of thousands of children, &lt;i&gt;The Nickel Boys&lt;/i&gt; is a devastating, driven narrative.</description>

  <description>Twelve six-year-olds and their three adult chaperones head into the woods on a camping trip. None of them make it out alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Laws of the Skies&lt;/i&gt; follows the terrified children as they scatter into the night to escape danger, dressed only in their pajamas. They face their darkest childhood fears and new imaginary threats, like trolls masquerading as boulders and child-eating tree trunks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A harrowing story of those days in the woods, of illness, poisoning, and accidents; of a love triangle among tots; a pint-sized hero; and a child on a murderous rampage that comes to a grisly end. Part fairy tale, part horror story, this macabre fable takes us through the minds of all the members of this doomed part, murderers and murdered alike.</description>

  <description>Lauren’s hopes and dreams of being a new mom are shattered when she encounters a mother’s worst nightmare—someone is threatening to take her children if she leaves them alone. Everyone, from her doctor to her husband, thinks she’s imagining things. From the stark loneliness of returning home after giving birth to the confines of a psychiatric unit, Lauren’s desperation increases as no one will listen to her. Is she mad, or does she know something we don’t?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loosely inspired by the ghostly folktale “The Brewery of Eggshells,”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and giving us a modern take on the idea of changelings, &lt;em&gt;Little Darlings&lt;/em&gt; is a taut, gripping read. It reminds us that folk tales do not spring from whimsy; they warn us and teach us, and speak to the fear in us all . . .</description>

  <description>India, 1922: It is rainy season in the lush, remote Satara mountains southeast of Bombay, where the kingdom of Satapur is tucked away. A curse seems to have fallen upon Satapur’s royal family, whose maharaja died of a sudden illness shortly before his teenage son was struck down in a tragic accident. The kingdom is now ruled by an agent of the British Raj on behalf of Satapur’s two maharanis, the dowager queen and the maharaja’s widow.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The royal ladies are in dispute over the education of the young crown prince, and a lawyer’s council is required—but the maharanis live in purdah and do not speak to men. Just one person can help them: Perveen Mistry, India’s only female lawyer.  Perveen is determined to bring peace to the royal house and make a sound recommendation for the young prince’s future, but knows she is breaking a rule by traveling alone as a woman into the remote countryside. And she arrives to find that the Satapur palace is full of cold-blooded power plays and ancient vendettas. Too late, she realizes she has walked into a trap. But whose? And how can she protect the royal children from the palace’s deadly curse?</description>

  &lt;b&gt;THE NIGHTMARE NO PARENT COULD ENDURE. THE CASE NO DETECTIVE COULD SOLVE. THE TWIST NO READER COULD PREDICT.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For five days, the parents of a seven-year-old Japanese schoolgirl sat and listened to the demands of their daughter’s kidnapper. They would never learn his identity. And they would never see their daughter alive again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourteen years later, the mystery remains unsolved. The police department’s press officer—Yoshinobu Mikami, a former detective who was involved in the original case and who is now himself the father of a missing daughter—is forced to revisit the botched investigation. The stigma of the case known as “Six Four” has never faded; the police’s failure remains a profound source of shame and an unending collective responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mikami does not aspire to solve the crime. He has worked in the department for his entire career, and while he has his own ambitions and loyalties, he is hoping simply to reach out to the victim’s family and to help finally put the notorious case to rest. But when he spots an anomaly in the files, he uncovers secrets he never could have imagined. He would never have even looked if he’d known what he would find. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An award-winning phenomenon in its native Japan—more than a million copies sold in its first week of publication, and the winner of the Best Japanese Crime Fiction of the Year award—and already a critically celebrated top-ten bestseller in the U.K., Hideo Yokoyama’s &lt;i&gt;Six Four &lt;/i&gt;is an unforgettable novel by a literary master at the top of his form. It is a dark and riveting plunge into a crime, an investigation, and a culture like no other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A stunning debut novel, from Rhodes Scholar and winner of the Caine Prize for African Writing, Tope Folarin about a Nigerian family living in Utah and their uncomfortable assimilation to American life. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in small-town Utah has always been an uneasy fit for Tunde Akinola’s family, especially for his Nigeria-born parents. Though Tunde speaks English with a Midwestern accent, he can’t escape the children who rub his skin and ask why the black won’t come off. As he struggles to fit in and find his place in the world, he finds little solace from his parents who are grappling with their own issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tunde’s father, ever the optimist, works tirelessly chasing his American dream while his wife, lonely in Utah without family and friends, sinks deeper into schizophrenia. Then one otherwise-ordinary morning, Tunde’s mother wakes him with a hug, bundles him and his baby brother into the car, and takes them away from the only home they’ve ever known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But running away doesn’t bring her, or her children, any relief from the demons that plague her; once Tunde’s father tracks them down, she flees to Nigeria, and Tunde never feels at home again. He spends the rest of his childhood and young adulthood searching for connection — to the wary stepmother and stepbrothers he gains when his father remarries; to the Utah residents who mock his father’s accent; to evangelical religion; to his Texas middle school’s crowd of African-Americans; to the fraternity brothers of his historically black college. In so doing, he discovers something that sends him on a journey away from everything he has known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweeping, stirring, and perspective-shifting, &lt;i&gt;A Particular Kind of Black Man &lt;/i&gt;is a beautiful and poignant exploration of the meaning of memory, manhood, home, and identity as seen through the eyes of a first-generation Nigerian-American.</description>

  <description>One morning, Jessa-Lynn Morton walks into the family taxidermy shop to find that her father has committed suicide, right there on one of the metal tables. Shocked and grieving, Jessa steps up to manage the failing business, while the rest of the Morton family crumbles. Her mother starts sneaking into the shop to make aggressively lewd art with the taxidermied animals. Her brother Milo withdraws, struggling to function. And Brynn, Milo’s wife—and the only person Jessa’s ever been in love with—walks out without a word. As Jessa seeks out less-than-legal ways of generating income, her mother’s art escalates—picture a figure of her dead husband and a stuffed buffalo in an uncomfortably sexual pose—and the Mortons reach a tipping point. For the first time, Jessa has no choice but to learn who these people truly are, and ultimately how she fits alongside them.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Vegetarian &lt;/i&gt;meets &lt;i&gt;Heathers&lt;/i&gt; in this darkly funny, seductively strange novel about a lonely graduate student drawn into a clique of rich girls who seem to move and speak as one&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"We were just these innocent girls in the night trying to make something beautiful. We nearly died. We very nearly did, didn't we?"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samantha Heather Mackey couldn't be more of an outsider in her small, highly selective MFA program at New England's Warren University. A scholarship student who prefers the company of her dark imagination to that of most people, she is utterly repelled by the rest of her fiction writing cohort--a clique of unbearably twee rich girls who call each other "Bunny," and are often found entangled in a group hug so tight they become one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everything changes when Samantha receives an invitation to the Bunnies' fabled "Smut Salon," and finds herself inexplicably drawn to their front door--ditching her only friend, Ava, a caustic art school dropout, in the process. As Samantha plunges deeper and deeper into the sinister yet saccharine world of the Bunny cult and starts to take part in their ritualistic off-campus "Workshop" where they magically conjure their monstrous creations, the edges of reality begin to blur, and her friendships with Ava and the Bunnies are brought into deadly collision. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A spellbinding, down-the-rabbit-hole tale of loneliness and belonging, creativity and agency, and friendship and desire, &lt;i&gt;Bunny &lt;/i&gt;is a dazzlingly original second book.</description>

  <description>A TODAY Show "Read with Jenna" Book Club Selection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the "Most Anticipated Books of the Summer": Entertainment Weekly • Vogue • TIME • Washington Post • Buzzfeed • Vulture • O Magazine • Vanity Fair • Elle • Real Simple • NYLON • New York Post • Newsday • Southern Living&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;From nationally celebrated novelist Nicole Dennis-Benn, a brave, stirring portrait of a Jamaican woman who leaves her daughter behind for a new life in America.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Patsy gets her long-coveted visa to America, it’s the culmination of years of yearning to be reunited with Cicely, her oldest friend and secret love, who left home years before for the “land of opportunity.” Patsy’s plans do not include her religious mother or even her young daughter, Tru, both of whom she leaves behind in a bittersweet trail of sadness and relief. But Brooklyn is not at all what Cicely described in her letters, and to survive as an undocumented immigrant, Patsy is forced to work as a bathroom attendant, and ironically, as a nanny. Meanwhile, back in Jamaica, Tru struggles with her own questions of identity and sexuality, grappling every day with what it means to be abandoned by a mother who has no intention of returning. Passionate, moving, and fiercely urgent, &lt;em&gt;Patsy&lt;/em&gt; is a haunting depiction of immigration and womanhood, and the silent threads of love stretching across years and oceans.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Miscast in the media for nearly 130 years, the victims of Jack the Ripper finally get their full stories told in this eye-opening and chilling reminder that life for middle-class women in Victorian London could be full of social pitfalls and peril.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The "canonical five" women murdered by Jack the Ripper have always been dismissed as society's waste, their stories passed down to us wrapped in a package of Victorian assumptions and prejudice. But social historian Hallie Rubenhold sets the record straight in &lt;i&gt;The Five. &lt;/i&gt;In reality, only two of the victims were prostitutes, and Rubenhold has uncovered entirely new research about them all--in some cases, material no one has ever seen before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Five &lt;/i&gt;tells for the first time the true stories of these fascinating women. It delves into the Victorian experience of poverty, homelessness, and alcoholism, but also motherhood, childbirth, sexuality, child-rearing, work, and marriage, all against the fascinating, dark, and quickly changing backdrop of nineteenth-century London. From rural Sweden to the wedding of Queen Victoria, from the London of Charles Dickens to the factories of the Industrial Revolution and the high-class brothels of the West End, these women were not just victims but witnesses to the vagaries and vicissitudes of the Victorian age.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA["The Five: The Untold Lives of the Women Killed by Jack the Ripper" by Hallie Rubenhold is excellent. It is not about Jack the Ripper and a retelling of the horrible acts he committed. Instead, it is about the lives of the women he murdered, misogyny, the harshness of the Victorian era, addiction...]]>

  <description>‘Welcome to the asylum…’&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2015&lt;br /&gt;Their troubled past behind them, married couple, Rob and Louise, visit Venice for the first time together, looking forward to a relaxing weekend. Not just a romantic destination, it’s also the ‘most haunted city in the world’ and soon, Louise finds herself the focus of an entity she can’t quite get to grips with – a ‘veiled lady’ who stalks her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1938&lt;br /&gt;After marrying young Venetian doctor, Enrico Sanuto, Charlotte moves from England to Venice, full of hope for the future. Home though is not in the city; it’s on Poveglia, in the Venetian lagoon, where she is set to work in an asylum, tending to those that society shuns. As the true horror of her surroundings reveals itself, hope turns to dust.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the labyrinthine alleys of Venice to the twisting, turning corridors of Poveglia, their fates intertwine. Vengeance only waits for so long…</description>

  <description>From the author of the page-turning domestic suspense &lt;i&gt;Best Day Ever&lt;/i&gt;, comes another gripping novel of psychological suspense set in an upscale Southern California community, for fans of B.A. Paris and Shari Lapena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfect home. The perfect family. The perfect lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane Harris lives in a sparkling home in an oceanfront gated community in Orange County. It’s a place that seems too beautiful to be touched by sadness. But exactly one year ago, Jane’s oldest daughter, Mary, died in a tragic accident and Jane has been grief-stricken ever since. Lost in a haze of anti-depressants, she’s barely even left the house. Now that’s all about to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s time for Jane to reclaim her life and her family. Jane’s husband, David, has planned a memorial service for Mary and three days later, their youngest daughter, Betsy, graduates high school. Yet as Jane reemerges into the world, it’s clear her family has changed without her. Her husband has been working long days—and nights—at the office. Her daughter seems distant, even secretive. And her beloved Mary was always such a good girl—dutiful and loving. But does someone know more about Mary, and about her last day, than they’ve revealed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonds between mothers and daughters, and husbands and wives should never be broken. But you never know how far someone will go to keep a family together…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the celebrated and bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Banker's Wife&lt;/i&gt;, worlds collide when an FBI agent investigates a string of grisly murders on Long Island that raises the impossible question: What happens when the primary suspect is your father?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FBI Agent Nell Flynn hasn't been home in ten years. Nell and her father, Homicide Detective Martin Flynn, have never had much of a relationship. And Suffolk County will always be awash in memories of her mother, Marisol, who was brutally murdered when Nell was just seven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Martin Flynn dies in a motorcycle accident, Nell returns to the house she grew up in so that she can spread her father's ashes and close his estate. At the behest of her father's partner, Detective Lee Davis, Nell becomes involved in an investigation into the murders of two young women in Suffolk County. The further Nell digs, the more likely it seems to her that her father should be the prime suspect--and that his friends on the police force are covering his tracks. Plagued by doubts about her mother's murder--and her own role in exonerating her father in that case--Nell can't help but ask questions about who killed Ria Ruiz and Adriana Marques and why. But she may not like the answers she finds--not just about those she loves, but about herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Britain has lost the Falklands war, Margaret Thatcher battles Tony Benn for power and Alan Turing achieves a breakthrough in artificial intelligence. In a world not quite like this one, two lovers will be tested beyond their understanding.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Machines Like Me&lt;/i&gt; occurs in an alternative 1980s London. Charlie, drifting through life and dodging full-time employment, is in love with Miranda, a bright student who lives with a terrible secret. When Charlie comes into money, he buys Adam, one of the first batch of synthetic humans. With Miranda’s assistance, he co-designs Adam’s personality. This near-perfect human is beautiful, strong and clever – a love triangle soon forms. These three beings will confront a profound moral dilemma. Ian McEwan’s subversive and entertaining new novel poses fundamental questions: what makes us human? Our outward deeds or our inner lives? Could a machine understand the human heart? This provocative and thrilling tale warns of the power to invent things beyond our control.</description>

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Henri ends up in a coma after rescuing a young girl from the Thames, his ex-girlfriend, Eddie, discovers that she is listed as Henri's next-of-kin in his living will. While Henri lies in a hospital bed, he fitfully revisits the boyhood he spent with his beloved grandfather, who fed him a steady diet of Breton fish and fairy tales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Sam, Henri's sensitive teenage son with whom Henri never had a relationship--Henri was in love with his mother, but too afraid of love to make the relationship work--has never seen his father alive, other than in Henri's reportages or the video of him heroically saving a girl from drowning. Yet, Sam has a more profound connection with his father than most children of his age. Sam and Eddie, each previously unaware of the other, slowly begin to carve out an unexpected and powerful friendship. But when Sam is on his way to meet his father for the first time, tragedy strikes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of rich, captivating characters, and in placing the serious questions of life and death alongside a wonderful and engrossing story, &lt;i&gt;The Book of Dreams&lt;/i&gt; asks with grace and gravitas what we will truly find meaningful in our lives after we are gone.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;A mesmerizing debut novel by Chip Cheek, &lt;i&gt;Cape May&lt;/i&gt; explores the social and sexual mores of 1950s America through the eyes of a newly married couple from the genteel south corrupted by sophisticated New England urbanites.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late September 1957. Henry and Effie, very young newlyweds from Georgia, arrive in Cape May, New Jersey, for their honeymoon only to find the town is deserted. Feeling shy of each other and isolated, they decide to cut the trip short. But before they leave, they meet a glamorous set of people who sweep them up into their drama. Clara, a beautiful socialite who feels her youth slipping away; Max, a wealthy playboy and Clara’s lover; and Alma, Max’s aloof and mysterious half-sister, to whom Henry is irresistibly drawn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The empty beach town becomes their playground, and as they sneak into abandoned summer homes, go sailing, walk naked under the stars, make love, and drink a great deal of gin, Henry and Effie slip from innocence into betrayal, with irrevocable consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erotic and moving, this is a novel about marriage, love and sexuality, and the lifelong repercussions that meeting a group of debauched cosmopolitans has on a new marriage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Dust&lt;/i&gt; comes a vibrant, stunning coming-of-age novel about a young woman struggling to find her place in a vast world--a poignant exploration of fate, mortality, love, and loss.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the island of Pate, off the coast of Kenya, lives solitary, stubborn Ayaana and her mother, Munira. When a sailor named Muhidin, also an outsider, enters their lives, Ayaana finds something she has never had before: a father. But as Ayaana grows into adulthood, forces of nature and history begin to reshape her life and the island itself--from a taciturn visitor with a murky past to a sanctuary-seeking religious extremist, from dragonflies to a tsunami, from black-clad kidnappers to cultural emissaries from China. Ayaana ends up embarking on a dramatic ship's journey to the Far East, where she will discover friends and enemies; be seduced by the charming but unreliable scion of a powerful Turkish business family; reclaim her devotion to the sea; and come to find her own tenuous place amid a landscape of beauty and violence and surprising joy. Told with a glorious lyricism and an unerring sense of compassion, &lt;i&gt; The Dragonfly Sea&lt;/i&gt; is a transcendent story of adventure, fraught choices, and of the inexorable need for shelter in a dangerous world.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delighted by a surprise invitation, Miriam Macy sails off to a luxurious private island off the coast of Mexico, with six strangers—an ex-cop, a chef, a financial advisor, a nurse, a lawyer, a young widow. Surrounded by miles of open water in the gloriously green Sea of Cortez, Miriam is shocked to discover that she and the rest of her companions have been brought to the remote island under false pretenses—and all seven strangers harbor a secret. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danger lurks in the lush forest and in the halls and bedrooms of the lonely mansion. Sporadic cell-phone coverage and miles of ocean keeps the group trapped in paradise. And strange accidents keep them suspicious of each other, as one by one . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;They all fall down&lt;/i&gt;'</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Lily and the Octopus&lt;/i&gt; comes a novel about a struggling writer who gets his big break, with a little help from the most famous woman in America.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of trying to make it as a writer in 1990s New York City, James Smale finally sells his novel to an editor at a major publishing house: none other than Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Jackie--or Mrs. Onassis, as she's known in the office--has fallen in love with James's candidly autobiographical novel, one that exposes his own dysfunctional family. But when the book's forthcoming publication threatens to unravel already fragile relationships, both within his family and with his partner, James finds that he can't bring himself to finish the manuscript. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackie and James develop an unexpected friendship, and she pushes him to write an authentic ending, encouraging him to head home to confront the truth about his relationship with his mother. Then a long-held family secret is revealed, and he realizes his editor may have had a larger plan that goes beyond the page... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Lily and the Octopus &lt;/i&gt;comes a funny, poignant, and highly original novel about an author whose relationship with his very famous book editor will change him forever--both as a writer and a son.</description>

Though she doesn’t want to get married, her grandparents give her no choice. History is repeating itself: Deya’s mother, Isra, also had no choice when she left Palestine as a teenager to marry Adam. Though Deya was raised to believe her parents died in a car accident, a secret note from a mysterious, yet familiar-looking woman makes Deya question everything she was told about her past. As the narrative alternates between the lives of Deya and Isra, she begins to understand the dark, complex secrets behind her community.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the internationally bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Our House&lt;/i&gt;, a new addictive novel of domestic suspense that dives into the world of suburban neighborhood drama and asks, "Could your neighbor make you angry enough to kill?"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowland Way is the epitome of the suburban dream. Every house and yard is carefully maintained for maximum curb appeal, and everyone knows one another and gets along. One homeowner, Sissy Watkins, runs a successful B and B from her house. Two brothers and their families live next door to each other. It's the picture-perfect neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Darren Booth and his girlfriend, Jodie, move in across from Sissy, it doesn't take long for them to begin making trouble. They're loud, rude, messy, and don't play by the community rules. They blast music at all hours and have started an unsightly renovation on their house. Before long, guests don't want to stay at Sissy's B and B, and everyone is fed up with the new neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An all-out war is brewing on Lowland Way. When a person is killed, accusations start flying. Someone is dead, and everyone has something to hide....</description>

  <description>From the author of the New York Times and USA Today bestselling novel, The Alice Network, comes another fascinating historical novel about a battle-haunted English journalist and a Russian female bomber pilot who join forces to track the Huntress, a Nazi war criminal gone to ground in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the aftermath of war, the hunter becomes the hunted…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold, reckless Nina Markova grows up on the icy edge of Soviet Russia, dreaming of flight and fearing nothing. When the tide of war sweeps over her homeland, she gambles everything to join the infamous Night Witches, an all-female night bomber regiment wreaking havoc on Hitler’s eastern front. But when she is downed behind enemy lines and thrown across the path of a lethal Nazi murderess known as the Huntress, Nina must use all her wits to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;British war correspondent Ian Graham has witnessed the horrors of war from Omaha Beach to the Nuremberg Trials. He abandons journalism after the war to become a Nazi hunter, yet one target eludes him: the Huntress. Fierce, disciplined Ian must join forces with brazen, cocksure Nina, the only witness to escape the Huntress alive. But a shared secret could derail their mission, unless Ian and Nina force themselves to confront it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Jordan McBride grows up in post WWII Boston, determined despite family opposition to become a photographer. At first delighted when her long-widowed father brings home a fiancée, Jordan grows increasingly disquieted by the soft-spoken German widow who seems to be hiding something. Armed only with her camera and her wits, Jordan delves into her new stepmother’s past and slowly realizes there are mysteries buried deep in her family. But Jordan’s search for the truth may threaten all she holds dear.</description>

  <description>A servant and former slave is accused of murdering her employer and his wife in this astonishing historical thriller that moves from a Jamaican sugar plantation to the fetid streets of Georgian London—a remarkable literary debut with echoes of &lt;em&gt;Alias Grace,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Underground Railroad&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Paying Guests.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of London is abuzz with the scandalous case of Frannie Langton, accused of the brutal double murder of her employers, renowned scientist George Benham and his eccentric French wife, Marguerite. Crowds pack the courtroom, eagerly following every twist, while the newspapers print lurid theories about the killings and the mysterious woman being held in the Old Bailey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The testimonies against Frannie are damning. She is a seductress, a witch, a master manipulator, a whore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Frannie claims she cannot recall what happened that fateful evening, even if remembering could save her life. She doesn’t know how she came to be covered in the victims’ blood. But she does have a tale to tell: a story of her childhood on a Jamaican plantation, her apprenticeship under a debauched scientist who stretched all bounds of ethics, and the events that brought her into the Benhams’ London home—and into a passionate and forbidden relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though her testimony may seal her conviction, the truth will unmask the perpetrators of crimes far beyond murder and indict the whole of English society itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Confessions of Frannie Langton&lt;/em&gt; is a breathtaking debut: a murder mystery that travels across the Atlantic and through the darkest channels of history. A brilliant, searing depiction of race, class, and oppression that penetrates the skin and sears the soul, it is the story of a woman of her own making in a world that would see her unmade.</description>

  <description>A masterful debut novel by Plimpton Prize winner Isabella Hammad, The Parisian illuminates a pivotal period of Palestinian history through the journey and romances of one young man, from his studies in France during World War I to his return to Palestine at the dawn of its battle for independence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Midhat Kamal is the son of a wealthy textile merchant from Nablus, a town in Ottoman Palestine. A dreamer, a romantic, an aesthete, in 1914 he leaves to study medicine in France, and falls in love. When Midhat returns to Nablus to find it under British rule, and the entire region erupting with nationalist fervor, he must find a way to cope with his conflicting loyalties and the expectations of his community. The story of Midhat’s life develops alongside the idea of a nation, as he and those close to him confront what it means to strive for independence in a world that seems on the verge of falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against a landscape of political change that continues to define the Middle East, The Parisian explores questions of power and identity, enduring love, and the uncanny ability of the past to disrupt the present. Lush and immersive, and devastating in its power, The Parisian is an elegant, richly-imagined debut from a dazzling new voice in fiction.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sharply intelligent novel about two college students and the strange, unexpected connection they forge with a married couple.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances is twenty-one years old, cool-headed, and darkly observant. A college student and aspiring writer, she devotes herself to a life of the mind--and to the beautiful and endlessly self-possessed Bobbi, her best friend and comrade-in-arms. Lovers at school, the two young women now perform spoken-word poetry together in Dublin, where a journalist named Melissa spots their potential. Drawn into Melissa's orbit, Frances is reluctantly impressed by the older woman's sophisticated home and tall, handsome husband. Private property, Frances believes, is a cultural evil--and Nick, a bored actor who never quite lived up to his potential, looks like patriarchy made flesh. But however amusing their flirtation seems at first, it gives way to a strange intimacy neither of them expect. As Frances tries to keep her life in check, her relationships increasingly resist her control: with Nick, with her difficult and unhappy father, and finally even with Bobbi. Desperate to reconcile herself to the desires and vulnerabilities of her body, Frances's intellectual certainties begin to yield to something new: a painful and disorienting way of living from moment to moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with gem-like precision and probing intelligence, &lt;i&gt;Conversations With Friends&lt;/i&gt; is wonderfully alive to the pleasures and dangers of youth."</description>

  <description>'In the first few months after Charlie died, I began hearing from her much more frequently.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helen Clapp is a physics professor. She doesn't believe in pseudo-science, or time travel and especially not in ghosts. So when she gets a missed call from Charlie, her closest friend from university with whom she hasn't spoken in over a year, Helen thinks there must be some mistake. Because Charlie died two days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then when her young son, Jack, claims to have seen Charlie in their house just the other day, Helen begins to have doubts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the grief of the husband and daughter Charlie left behind, Helen is drawn into the orbit of Charlie's world, slotting in the missing pieces of her friend's past. And, as she delves into the web of their shared history, Helen finds herself entangled in the forgotten threads of her own life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lost and Wanted&lt;/em&gt; is a searing novel from one of America's most exciting writers about the knottiness of female friendship, the forces which fuse us together and those which drive us apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The prize-winning, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Boy, Snow, Bird&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours&lt;/i&gt; returns with a bewitching and inventive novel&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Influenced by the mysterious place gingerbread holds in classic children's stories—equal parts wholesome and uncanny, from the tantalizing witch's house in "Hansel and Gretel" to the man-shaped confection who one day decides to run as fast as he can—beloved novelist Helen Oyeyemi invites readers into a delightful tale of a surprising family legacy, in which the inheritance is a recipe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perdita Lee may appear to be your average British schoolgirl; Harriet Lee may seem just a working mother trying to penetrate the school social hierarchy; but there are signs that they might not be as normal as they think they are. For one thing, they share a gold-painted, seventh-floor walk-up apartment with some surprisingly verbal vegetation. And then there's the gingerbread they make. Londoners may find themselves able to take or leave it, but it's very popular in Druhástrana, the far-away (or, according to many sources, non-existent) land of Harriet Lee's early youth. The world's truest lover of the Lee family gingerbread, however, is Harriet's charismatic childhood friend Gretel Kercheval —a figure who seems to have had a hand in everything (good or bad) that has happened to Harriet since they met. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decades later, when teenaged Perdita sets out to find her mother's long-lost friend, it prompts a new telling of Harriet's story. As the book follows the Lees through encounters with jealousy, ambition, family grudges, work, wealth, and real estate, gingerbread seems to be the one thing that reliably holds a constant value. Endlessly surprising and satisfying, written with Helen Oyeyemi's inimitable style and imagination, it is a true feast for the reader.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A Zambian debut novel that follows three generations of three families, telling the story of a nation, and of the grand sweep of time&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the banks of the Zambezi River, a few miles from the majestic Victoria Falls, there was once a colonial settlement called The Old Drift. Here begins the story of a small African nation, told by a swarm-like chorus that calls itself man’s greatest nemesis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1904, in a smoky room at the hotel across the river, an Old Drifter named Percy M. Clark, foggy with fever, makes a mistake that entangles the fates of an Italian hotelier and an African busboy. This sets off a cycle of unwitting retribution between three Zambian families (black, white, brown) as they collide and converge over the course of the century, into the present and beyond. As the generations pass, their lives – their triumphs, errors, losses and hopes – form a symphony about what it means to be human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a woman covered with hair and another plagued with endless tears, to forbidden love affairs and fiery political ones, to homegrown technological marvels like Afronauts, microdrones and viral vaccines – this novel sweeps over the years and the globe.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a magnificent novel and one I hope many people will read. It isn't an "easy" read and I had to Google quite a bit and look at the relationship tree at the beginning of the book a lot as there are many characters over many years but it was absolutely worth it. I find it astounding this was...]]>

  <description>When Molly, home alone with her two young children, hears footsteps in the living room, she tries to convince herself it’s the sleep deprivation. She’s been hearing things these days. Startling at loud noises. Imagining the worst-case scenario. It’s what mothers do, she knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then the footsteps come again, and she catches a glimpse of movement. Suddenly Molly finds herself face-to-face with an intruder who knows far too much about her and her family. As she attempts to protect those she loves most, Molly must also acknowledge her own frailty. Molly slips down an existential rabbit hole where she must confront the dualities of motherhood: the ecstasy and the dread; the languor and the ferocity; the banality and the transcendence as the book hurtles toward a mind-bending conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Need&lt;/i&gt;, Helen Phillips has created a subversive, speculative thriller that comes to life through blazing, arresting prose and gorgeous, haunting imagery. Helen Phillips has been anointed as one of the most exciting fiction writers working today, and &lt;i&gt;The Need&lt;/i&gt; is a glorious celebration of the bizarre and beautiful nature of our everyday lives.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Stories of a young man finding his place among family and community in Houston, from a powerful, emerging American voice.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the city of Houston - a sprawling, diverse microcosm of America - the son of a black mother and a Latino father is coming of age. He's working at his family's restaurant, weathering his brother's blows, resenting his older sister's absence. And discovering he likes boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This boy and his family experience the tumult of living in the margins, the heartbreak of ghosts, and the braveries of the human heart. The stories of others living and thriving and dying across Houston's myriad neighborhoods are woven throughout to reveal a young woman's affair detonating across an apartment complex, a rag-tag baseball team, a group of young hustlers, the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, a local drug dealer who takes a Guatemalan teen under his wing, and a reluctant chupacabra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bryan Washington's brilliant, viscerally drawn world leaps off the page with energy, wit, and the infinite longing of people searching for home. With soulful insight into what makes a community, a family, and a life, &lt;i&gt;Lot&lt;/i&gt; is about love in all its unsparing and unsteady forms.</description>

  <description>An eerie, watery reimagining of the Oedipus myth set on the canals of Oxford, from the author of Fen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dictionary doesn’t contain every word. Gretel, a lexicographer by trade, knows this better than most. She grew up on a houseboat with her mother, wandering the canals of Oxford and speaking a private language of their own invention. Her mother disappeared when Gretel was a teen, abandoning her to foster care, and Gretel has tried to move on, spending her days updating dictionary entries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One phone call from her mother is all it takes for the past to come rushing back. To find her, Gretel will have to recover buried memories of her final, fateful winter on the canals. A runaway boy had found community and shelter with them, and all three were haunted by their past and stalked by an ominous creature lurking in the canal: the bonak. Everything and nothing at once, the bonak was Gretel’s name for the thing she feared most. And now that she’s searching for her mother, she’ll have to face it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this electrifying reinterpretation of a classical myth, Daisy Johnson explores questions of fate and free will, gender fluidity, and fractured family relationships. Everything Under - a debut novel whose surreal, watery landscape will resonate with fans of Fen - is a daring, moving story that will leave you unsettled and unstrung.</description>

  <description>No one knows more about everything - especially everything rude, clever, and offensively compelling - than John Waters. The man in the pencil-thin moustache, auteur of the transgressive movie classics &lt;i&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Polyester&lt;/i&gt;, the original &lt;i&gt;Hairspray&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;A Dirty Shame&lt;/i&gt;, is one of the world’s great sophisticates, and in &lt;i&gt;Mr. Know-It-All&lt;/i&gt; he serves it up raw: how to fail upward in Hollywood; how to develop musical taste from Nervous Norvus to Maria Callas; how to build a home so ugly and trendy that no one but you would dare live in it; more important, how to tell someone you love them without emotional risk; and yes, how to cheat death itself. Through it all, Waters swears by one undeniable truth: “Whatever you might have heard, there is absolutely no downside to being famous. None at all.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studded with cameos of Waters’s stars, from Divine and Mink Stole to Johnny Depp, Kathleen Turner, Patricia Hearst, and Tracey Ullman, and illustrated with unseen photos from Waters’s personal collection, &lt;i&gt;Mr. Know-It-All&lt;/i&gt; is Waters’s most hypnotically readable, upsetting, revelatory book—another instant Waters classic.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Promising to be &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; debut novel of the season &lt;i&gt;The Silent Patient&lt;/i&gt; is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....</description>

  <description>Hen and her husband Lloyd have settled into a quiet life in a new house outside of Boston, Massachusetts. Hen (short for Henrietta) is an illustrator and works out of a studio nearby, and has found the right meds to control her bipolar disorder. Finally, she’s found some stability and peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when they meet the neighbors next door, that calm begins to erode as she spots a familiar object displayed on the husband’s office shelf. The sports trophy looks exactly like one that went missing from the home of a young man who was killed two years ago. Hen knows because she’s long had a fascination with this unsolved murder—an obsession she doesn’t talk about anymore, but can’t fully shake either...</description>

  <description>Death lies between the lines. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dark story has been brought to terrifying life. Can the ending be rewritten in time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clare Cassidy is no stranger to murder. As a literature teacher specialising in the Gothic writer RM Holland, she teaches a short course on it every year. Then Clare's life and work collide tragically when one of her colleagues is found dead, a line from an RM Holland story by her body. The investigating police detective is convinced the writer's works somehow hold the key to the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not knowing who to trust, and afraid that the killer is someone she knows, Clare confides her darkest suspicions and fears about the case to her journal. Then one day she notices some other writing in the diary. Writing that isn't hers...</description>

  <description>In the most explosive and twisted psychological thriller since &lt;i&gt;The Woman in the Window&lt;/i&gt;, a beautiful marriage turns beautifully bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Things that make me scared: When Charlie cries. Hospitals and lakes. When Ian drinks vodka in the basement. ISIS. When Ian gets angry... That something is really, really wrong with me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddie and Ian's romance began with a chance encounter at a party overseas; he was serving in the British army and she was a travel writer visiting her best friend, Jo. Now almost two decades later, married with a beautiful son, Charlie, they are living the perfect suburban life in Middle America. But when a camping accident leaves Maddie badly scarred, she begins attending writing therapy, where she gradually reveals her fears about Ian's PTSD; her concerns for the safety of their young son, Charlie; and the couple's tangled and tumultuous past with Jo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Balkans to England, Iraq to Manhattan, and finally to an ordinary family home in Kansas, sixteen years of love and fear, adventure and suspicion culminate in The Day of the Killing, when a frantic 911 call summons the police to the scene of a shocking crime.</description>

  <description>Dean Harper is the type of doctor anyone would want to bump into in an elevator. He’s devilishly handsome, deeply caring, and has a pair of sapphire blue eyes that pierce right through you. He was well on his way to having the perfect life with who he thought was the perfect man. Well, until he found that ‘perfect’ man cheating on him with three other guys. At the same time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Noah Silver is having a difficult time. With his mom passing and his dad growing more and more difficult to live with, he’s pushed into an unorthodox way of making money. He knew that being a cam boy would be temporary, but he didn't realize how drastically it would change his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He had no idea he would meet the man of his dreams because of it. He also had no idea he would become the target of a serial killer because of it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dean’s world gets turned upside down when Noah, the guy he’d been fantasizing with through a computer screen, ends up in his exam room. Their connection is immediate, even though Noah has no idea Dean is behind his online crush. They both have issues to work on, but can either of them pass up a chance like this? Or are they both throwing themselves into harm’s way? &lt;br /&gt;______________ &lt;br /&gt;Code Silver is the first book in the Sierra View series. It's a full-length, steamy gay romance that can be read alone and has no cliffhangers.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; and Amazon Charts bestseller.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A page-turning debut of suspense about a young couple desperate to have a child of their own—and the unsettling consequences of getting what they always wanted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christopher and Hannah are a happily married surgeon and nurse with picture-perfect lives. All that’s missing is a child. When Janie, an abandoned six-year-old, turns up at their hospital, Christopher forms an instant connection with her, and he convinces Hannah they should take her home as their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Janie is no ordinary child, and her damaged psyche proves to be more than her new parents were expecting. Janie is fiercely devoted to Christopher, but she acts out in increasingly disturbing ways, directing all her rage at Hannah. Unable to bond with Janie, Hannah is drowning under the pressure, and Christopher refuses to see Janie’s true nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah knows that Janie is manipulating Christopher and isolating him from her, despite Hannah’s attempts to bring them all together. But as Janie’s behavior threatens to tear Christopher and Hannah apart, the truth behind Janie’s past may be enough to push them all over the edge.</description>

  <description>Connell Waldron is one of the most popular boys in his small-town high school--he is a star of the football team and an excellent student, and he is never wanting for attention from girls. The one thing he doesn't have is money. Marianne Sheridan, a classmate of Connell's, has the opposite problem. Marianne is plain-looking, odd, and stubborn, and while her family is quite well off, she has no friends to speak of. There is, however, a deep and undeniable connection between the two teenagers, one that develops into a secret relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything changes when both Connell and Marianne are accepted to Trinity College. Suddenly Marianne is well liked and elegant, holding court with her intellectual friends, while Connell hangs at the sidelines, not quite as fluent in the language of the elite. Throughout their years at university, Marianne and Connell circle each other, falling in and out of romance but never straying far from where they started. And as Marianne experiments with an increasingly dangerous string of boyfriends, Connell must decide how far he is willing to go to save his oldest friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Rooney brings her brilliant psychological acuity and perfectly spare prose to a novel that explores the subtleties of class, the electricity of first love, and the inescapable challenges of family and friendships. &lt;i&gt;Normal People&lt;/i&gt; is a book that you will read in one sitting, and then immediately jump up to share with your friends.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The definitive, dramatic untold story of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster, based on original reporting and new archival research.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 25, 1986, in Chernobyl, was a turning point in world history. The disaster not only changed the world’s perception of nuclear power and the science that spawned it, but also our understanding of the planet’s delicate ecology. With the images of the abandoned homes and playgrounds beyond the barbed wire of the 30-kilometer Exclusion Zone, the rusting graveyards of contaminated trucks and helicopters, the farmland lashed with black rain, the event fixed for all time the notion of radiation as an invisible killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chernobyl was also a key event in the destruction of the Soviet Union, and, with it, the United States’ victory in the Cold War. For Moscow, it was a political and financial catastrophe as much as an environmental and scientific one. With a total cost of 18 billion rubles—at the time equivalent to $18 billion—Chernobyl bankrupted an already teetering economy and revealed to its population a state built upon a pillar of lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The full story of the events that started that night in the control room of Reactor No.4 of the V.I. Lenin Nuclear Power Plant has never been told—until now. Through two decades of reporting, new archival information, and firsthand interviews with witnesses, journalist Adam Higginbotham tells the full dramatic story, including Alexander Akimov and Anatoli Dyatlov, who represented the best and worst of Soviet life; denizens of a vanished world of secret policemen, internal passports, food lines, and heroic self-sacrifice for the Motherland. &lt;i&gt;Midnight in Chernobyl&lt;/i&gt;, award-worthy nonfiction that reads like sci-fi, shows not only the final epic struggle of a dying empire but also the story of individual heroism and desperate, ingenious technical improvisation joining forces against a new kind of enemy.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;A richly imagined novel that tells the story behind &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;, the book that inspired the iconic film, through the eyes of author L. Frank Baum's intrepid wife, Maud--from the family's hardscrabble days in South Dakota to the Hollywood film set where she first meets Judy Garland.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maud Gage Baum, widow of the author of the book &lt;i&gt;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&lt;/i&gt;, met Judy Garland, the young actress playing the role of Dorothy on the set of &lt;i&gt;The Wizard of Oz &lt;/i&gt;in 1939. At the time, Maud was seventy-eight and Judy was sixteen. In spite of their age difference, Maud immediately connected to Judy--especially when Maud heard her sing "Over the Rainbow," a song whose yearning brought to mind the tough years in South Dakota when Maud and her husband struggled to make a living--until Frank Baum's book became a national sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wonderfully evocative two-stranded story recreates Maud's youth as the rebellious daughter of a leading suffragette, and the prairie years of Maud and Frank's early days when they lived among the people--especially young Dorothy--who would inspire Frank's masterpiece. Woven into this past story is one set in 1939, describing the high-pressured days on &lt;i&gt;The Wizard of Oz&lt;/i&gt; film set where Judy is being badgered by the director, producer, and her ambitious stage mother to lose weight, bind her breasts, and laugh, cry, and act terrified on command. As Maud had promised to protect the original Dorothy back in Aberdeen, she now takes on the job of protecting young Judy.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;Everyone's invited...everyone's a suspect...&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fans of Ruth Ware and Tana French, a shivery, atmospheric, page-turning novel of psychological suspense in the tradition of Agatha Christie, in which a group of old college friends are snowed in at a hunting lodge . . . and murder and mayhem ensue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of them are friends. One of them is a killer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the languid days of the Christmas break, a group of thirtysomething friends from Oxford meet to welcome in the New Year together, a tradition they began as students ten years ago. For this vacation, they’ve chosen an idyllic and isolated estate in the Scottish Highlands—the perfect place to get away and unwind by themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They arrive on December 30th, just before a historic blizzard seals the lodge off from the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days later, on New Year’s Day, one of them is dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trip began innocently enough: admiring the stunning if foreboding scenery, champagne in front of a crackling fire, and reminiscences about the past. But after a decade, the weight of secret resentments has grown too heavy for the group’s tenuous nostalgia to bear. Amid the boisterous revelry of New Year’s Eve, the cord holding them together snaps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now one of them is dead . . . and another of them did it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your friends close, the old adage goes. But just how close is too close? &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A new thriller about an unlikely burglar — a young woman in her 20s — who realizes she must solve a string of murders, or else become the next victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Elle Stowell is a young woman with an unconventional profession: burglary. But Elle is no petty thief—with just the right combination of smarts, looks, and skills, she can easily stroll through ritzy Bel Air neighborhoods and pick out the perfect home for plucking the most valuable items. This is how Elle has always gotten by—she is good at it, and she thrives on the thrill. But after stumbling upon a grisly triple homicide while stealing from the home of a wealthy art dealer, Elle discovers that she is no longer the only one sneaking around. Somebody is searching for her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As Elle realizes that her knowledge of the high-profile murder has made her a target, she races to solve the case before becoming the next casualty, using her breaking-and-entering skills to uncover the truth about exactly who the victims were and why someone might have wanted them dead.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“The greatest works of poetry are the stories we tell about ourselves."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the renowned poet Fiona Skinner is asked about the inspiration behind her iconic work, &lt;i&gt;The Love Poem&lt;/i&gt;, she tells her audience a story about her family and a betrayal that reverberates through time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It begins in a big yellow house, with a funeral, an iron poker, and a brief variation forever known as the Pause: a free and feral summer in a middle-class Connecticut town. Caught between the predictable life they once led and an uncertain future that stretches before them, the Skinner siblings—fierce Renee, sensitive Caroline, golden-boy Joe and watchful Fiona—emerge from the Pause staunchly loyal and deeply connected.  Two decades later, the siblings find themselves once again confronted with a family crisis that tests the strength of these bonds and forces them to question the life choices they’ve made and to ask what, exactly, they are willing to do for love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sweeping yet intimate epic about one American family, &lt;i&gt;The Last Romantics&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable exploration of the ties that bind us together, the responsibilities we embrace and the duties we resent, and how we can lose—and sometimes rescue—the ones we love. A novel that pierces the heart and lingers in the mind, it is also a beautiful meditation on the power of stories—how they guide us through difficult times, help us understand the past, and point the way toward our future.</description>

  <description>From the internationally bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Somewhere in France&lt;/em&gt; comes an enthralling historical novel about one of the most famous wedding dresses of the twentieth century—Queen Elizabeth’s wedding gown—and the fascinating women who made it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Millions will welcome this joyous event as a flash of color on the long road we have to travel.”&lt;/em&gt;—Sir Winston Churchill on the news of Princess Elizabeth’s forthcoming wedding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London, 1947: Besieged by the harshest winter in living memory, burdened by onerous shortages and rationing, the people of postwar Britain are enduring lives of quiet desperation despite their nation’s recent victory. Among them are Ann Hughes and Miriam Dassin, embroiderers at the famed Mayfair fashion house of Norman Hartnell. Together they forge an unlikely friendship, but their nascent hopes for a brighter future are tested when they are chosen for a once-in-a-lifetime honor: taking part in the creation of Princess Elizabeth’s wedding gown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toronto, 2016: More than half a century later, Heather Mackenzie seeks to unravel the mystery of a set of embroidered flowers, a legacy from her late grandmother. How did her beloved Nan, a woman who never spoke of her old life in Britain, come to possess the priceless embroideries that so closely resemble the motifs on the stunning gown worn by Queen Elizabeth II at her wedding almost seventy years before? And what was her Nan’s connection to the celebrated textile artist and holocaust survivor Miriam Dassin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;With The Gown&lt;/em&gt;, Jennifer Robson takes us inside the workrooms where one of the most famous wedding gowns in history was created. Balancing behind-the-scenes details with a sweeping portrait of a society left reeling by the calamitous costs of victory, she introduces readers to three unforgettable heroines, their points of view alternating and intersecting throughout its pages, whose lives are woven together by the pain of survival, the bonds of friendship, and the redemptive power of love.</description>

  <description>When she stumbles across the ad, she’s looking for something else completely. But it seems like too good an opportunity to miss—a live-in nannying post, with a staggeringly generous salary. And when Rowan Caine arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten—by the luxurious “smart” home fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture-perfect family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What she doesn’t know is that she’s stepping into a nightmare—one that will end with a child dead and herself in prison awaiting trial for murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the unravelling events that led to her incarceration. It wasn’t just the constant surveillance from the cameras installed around the house, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time. It wasn’t just the girls, who turned out to be a far cry from the immaculately behaved model children she met at her interview. It wasn’t even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman, Jack Grant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She knows she’s made mistakes. She admits that she lied to obtain the post, and that her behavior toward the children wasn’t always ideal. She’s not innocent, by any means. But, she maintains, she’s not guilty—at least not of murder. Which means someone else is.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From award-winning author Amy Hempel, one of the most celebrated and original voices in American short fiction: a stellar new story collection—her first in over a decade—about people finding meaning and connection in the idiosyncratic lives they lead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy Hempel has a stunning reputation as one of the most important voices of contemporary American short fiction. She is a multiple award winner, the recipient of broad acclaim, and her &lt;i&gt;Collected Stories&lt;/i&gt;, which compiled her four previous collections, is widely considered essential reading among writers, students, and readers of great fiction. This new collection, her first in more than a decade, is a veritable publishing event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In these exquisitely honed and consistently surprising stories, where every sentence sings, Amy Hempel takes readers inside the surpassing trials of daily life. In “A Full-Service Shelter,” a volunteer at a dog shelter in Spanish Harlem works tirelessly and passionately to deliver care to dogs who are on a list to be euthanized the next morning. In “Greed,” a spurned wife investigates her husband’s affair with a glamorous, older married woman. And in “Cloudland,” the longest story in the collection, a woman reckons with the choice she made as a teenager to give up her baby for adoption after discovering the true story of what went on in a maternity home nearby decades earlier. Woven throughout this collection are Hempel’s bracing truths and her ability to paint moments that are ordinary, devastating, and deeply human. &lt;i&gt;Sing to It &lt;/i&gt;is a dazzling, unmissable collection from a quintessential American writer.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bridget Jones’s Diary&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Americanah&lt;/i&gt; in this disarmingly honest, boldly political, and truly inclusive novel that will speak to anyone who has gone looking for love and found something very different in its place.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Queenie Jenkins is a 25-year-old Jamaican British woman living in London, straddling two cultures and slotting neatly into neither. She works at a national newspaper, where she’s constantly forced to compare herself to her white middle class peers. After a messy break up from her long-term white boyfriend, Queenie seeks comfort in all the wrong places…including several hazardous men who do a good job of occupying brain space and a bad job of affirming self-worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Queenie careens from one questionable decision to another, she finds herself wondering, “What are you doing? Why are you doing it? Who do you want to be?”—all of the questions today’s woman must face in a world trying to answer them for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With “fresh and honest” (Jojo Moyes) prose, &lt;i&gt;Queenie&lt;/i&gt; is a remarkably relatable exploration of what it means to be a modern woman searching for meaning in today’s world.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The author of the Reese Witherspoon Book Club selection &lt;em&gt;Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows&lt;/em&gt; follows her acclaimed America debut with this life-affirming, witty family drama—an Indian &lt;em&gt;This Is Where I Leave You&lt;/em&gt;—about three Punjabi sisters embarking on a pilgrimage to their homeland to lay their mother to rest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The British-born Punjabi Shergill sisters—Rajni, Jezmeen, and Shirina—were never close and barely got along growing up, and now as adults, have grown even further apart. Rajni, a school principal is a stickler for order. Jezmeen, a thirty-year-old struggling actress, fears her big break may never come. Shirina, the peacemaking "good" sister married into wealth and enjoys a picture-perfect life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On her deathbed, their mother voices one last wish: that her daughters will make a pilgrimage together to the Golden Temple in Amritsar to carry out her final rites. After a trip to India with her mother long ago, Rajni vowed never to return. But she’s always been a dutiful daughter, and cannot, even now, refuse her mother’s request. Jezmeen has just been publicly fired from her television job, so the trip to India is a welcome break to help her pick up the pieces of her broken career. Shirina’s in-laws are pushing her to make a pivotal decision about her married life; time away will help her decide whether to meekly obey, or to bravely stand up for herself for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving in India, these sisters will make unexpected discoveries about themselves, their mother, and their lives—and learn the real story behind the trip Rajni took with their Mother long ago—a momentous journey that resulted in Mum never being able to return to India again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Unlikely Adventures of the Shergill Sisters&lt;/em&gt; is a female take on the Indian travel narrative. "I was curious about how different the trip would be if it were undertaken by women, who are vulnerable to different dangers in a male-dominated society," Balli Kaur Jaswal writes. "I also wanted to explore the tensions between tradition and modernity in immigrant communities, and particularly how those tensions play out among women like these sisters, who are the first generation to be raised outside of India."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powerful, emotionally evocative, and wonderfully atmospheric, &lt;em&gt;The Unlikely Adventures of the Shergill Sisters&lt;/em&gt; is a charming and thoughtful story that illuminates the bonds of family, sisterhood, and heritage that tether us despite our differences. Funny and heartbreaking, it is a reminder of the truly important things we must treasure in our lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;“With each new book by Tessa Hadley, I grow more convinced that she’s one of the greatest stylists alive.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—Ron Charles&lt;em&gt;, Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review &lt;/em&gt;Editors' Choice |A Parnassus First Editions Club Pick | Powell’s Indispensable Book Club Pick &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lives of two close-knit couples are irrevocably changed by an untimely death in the latest from Tessa Hadley, the acclaimed novelist and short story master who “recruits admirers with each book” (Hilary Mantel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexandr and Christine and Zachary and Lydia have been friends since they first met in their twenties. Thirty years later, Alex and Christine are spending a leisurely summer’s evening at home when they receive a call from a distraught Lydia: she is at the hospital. Zach is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of this profound loss, the three friends find themselves unmoored; all agree that Zach, with his generous, grounded spirit, was the irreplaceable one they couldn’t afford to lose. Inconsolable, Lydia moves in with Alex and Christine. But instead of loss bringing them closer, the three of them find over the following months that it warps their relationships, as old entanglements and grievances rise from the past, and love and sorrow give way to anger and bitterness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Late in the Day&lt;/em&gt; explores the complex webs at the center of our most intimate relationships, to expose how, beneath the seemingly dependable arrangements we make for our lives, lie infinite alternate configurations. Ingeniously moving between past and present and through the intricacies of her characters’ thoughts and interactions, Tessa Hadley once again “crystallizes the atmosphere of ordinary life in prose somehow miraculous and natural” (&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;).</description>

  <description>Carol Evers is a woman with a dark secret. She has died many times . . . but her many deaths are not final: They are comas, a waking slumber indistinguishable from death, each lasting days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only two people know of Carol’s eerie condition. One is her husband, Dwight, who married Carol for her fortune, and—when she lapses into another coma—plots to seize it by proclaiming her dead and quickly burying her . . . alive. The other is her lost love, the infamous outlaw James Moxie. When word of Carol’s dreadful fate reaches him, Moxie rides the Trail again to save his beloved from an early, unnatural grave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all the while, awake and aware, Carol fights to free herself from the crippling darkness that binds her—summoning her own fierce will to survive. As the players in this drama of life and death fight to decide her fate, Carol must in the end battle to save herself.</description>

  <description>J is a student at a school deep in a forest far away from the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; J is one of only twenty-six students, all of whom think of the school’s enigmatic founder as their father. J’s peers are the only family he has ever had. The students are being trained to be prodigies of art, science, and athletics, and their life at the school is all they know—and all they are allowed to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But J suspects that there is something out there, beyond the pines, that the founder does not want him to see, and he’s beginning to ask questions. What is the real purpose of this place? Why can the students never leave? And what secrets is their father hiding from them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Meanwhile, on the other side of the forest, in a school very much like J’s, a girl named K is asking the same questions. J has never seen a girl, and K has never seen a boy. As K and J work to investigate the secrets of their two strange schools, they come to discover something even more mysterious: each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A chilling ghost story with a twist: the &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;The Winter People&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; returns to the woods of Vermont to tell the story of a husband and wife who don't simply move into a haunted house, they start building one from scratch, without knowing it, until it's too late . . . &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a quest for a simpler life, Helen and Nate abandon the comforts of suburbia and their teaching jobs to take up residence on forty-four acres of rural land where they will begin the ultimate, aspirational do-it-yourself project: building the house of their dreams. When they discover that this charming property has a dark and violent past, Helen, a former history teacher, becomes consumed by the legend of Hattie Breckenridge, a woman who lived and died there a century ago. As Helen starts carefully sourcing decorative building materials for her home--wooden beams, mantles, historic bricks--she starts to unearth, and literally conjure, the tragic lives of Hattie's descendants, three generations of "Breckenridge women," each of whom died amidst suspicion, and who seem to still be seeking something precious and elusive in the present day.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;By the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Age of Miracles &lt;/i&gt;comes&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;a mesmerizing novel about a town transformed by a mysterious contagion that locks victims in perpetual sleep and triggers extraordinary, life-altering dreams.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; One night in an isolated college town in the hills of Southern California, a first-year student stumbles into her dorm room, falls asleep—and doesn’t wake up. She sleeps through the morning, into the evening. Her roommate, Mei, cannot rouse her. Neither can the paramedics who carry the girl away, nor the perplexed doctors at the hospital.&lt;br /&gt; Then a second girl falls asleep, and then a third, and panic takes hold of the college and spreads to the town. As the number of cases multiplies, classes are canceled. A quarantine is established. Mei, an outsider in the hierarchy of dorm life, finds herself thrown together with an eccentric, idealistic classmate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A psychiatrist summoned from Los Angeles attempts to make sense of the phenomenon as it spreads. Those infected, she discovers, are displaying unusual levels of brain activity, higher than has ever been recorded before. They are dreaming heightened dreams—but of what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Gorgeously written, &lt;i&gt;The Dreamers &lt;/i&gt;is a breathtaking novel, startling and provocative, about the possibilities contained within a human life—in our waking days and, perhaps even more, in our dreams.</description>

  <description>After the notorious 'Middle Street Massacre' of 1951, when the majority of Brighton's criminals wiped one another out in a vicious battle as the local police force enjoyed a brief stop en route for an ice cream, Inspector Steine rather enjoys life as a policeman. No criminals, no crime, no stress. He just wishes Sergeant Brunswick would stop insisting that perhaps not &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; criminal was wiped out that fateful day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it's really rather annoying when an ambitious – not to mention irritating – new Constable shows up to work and starts investigating a series of burglaries. And it's even &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; annoying when, after Constable Twitten is despatched to the theatre for the night, he sits next to a vicious theatre critic who is promptly shot dead part way through the opening night of a new play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems Brighton may be in need of a police force after all…</description>

  <description>Adèle appears to have the perfect life: She is a successful journalist in Paris who lives in a beautiful apartment with her surgeon husband and their young son. But underneath the surface, she is bored--and consumed by an insatiable need for sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driven less by pleasure than compulsion, Adèle organizes her day around her extramarital affairs, arriving late to work and lying to her husband about where she's been, until she becomes ensnared in a trap of her own making. Suspenseful, erotic, and electrically charged, Adèle is a captivating exploration of addiction, sexuality, and one woman's quest to feel alive.</description>

  <description>One hot August day a family drives to a mountain clearing to collect birch wood. Jenny, the mother, is in charge of lopping any small limbs off the logs with a hatchet. Wade, the father, does the stacking. The two daughters, June and May, aged nine and six, drink lemonade, swat away horseflies, bicker, and sing snatches of songs as they while away the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then something unimaginably shocking happens, an act so extreme it will scatter the family in every different direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a story told from multiple perspectives and in razor-sharp prose, we gradually learn more about this act, and the way its violence, love and memory reverberate through the life of every character in &lt;i&gt;Idaho&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

      <![CDATA[One horrific and unthinkable action and the Mitchell family and others are changed forever. This is a beautifully written and heartbreaking story but also a story of love, hope, and forgiveness. I'll be thinking about this book for quite a while. Highly recommended.]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;San Francisco. Summer, 1947. A dame walks into a saloon . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not every afternoon that an enigmatic, comely blonde named Stilton (like the cheese) walks into the scruffy gin joint where Sammy "Two Toes" Tiffin tends bar. It’s love at first sight, but before Sammy can make his move, an Air Force general named Remy arrives with some urgent business. ’Cause when you need something done, Sammy is the guy to go to; he’s got the connections on the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, a suspicious flying object has been spotted up the Pacific coast in Washington State near Mount Rainer, followed by a mysterious plane crash in a distant patch of desert in New Mexico that goes by the name Roswell. But the real weirdness is happening on the streets of the City by the Bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When one of Sammy’s schemes goes south and the Cheese mysteriously vanishes, Sammy is forced to contend with his own dark secrets—and more than a few strange goings on—if he wants to find his girl.</description>

  <description>Set against the assassination of JFK, a poignant and evocative crime novel that centers on a desperate cat-and-mouse chase across 1960s America—a story of unexpected connections, daring possibilities, and the hope of second chances from the Edgar Award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;The Long and Faraway Gone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank Guidry’s luck has finally run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A loyal street lieutenant to New Orleans’ mob boss Carlos Marcello, Guidry has learned that everybody is expendable. But now it’s his turn—he knows too much about the crime of the century: the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within hours of JFK’s murder, everyone with ties to Marcello is turning up dead, and Guidry suspects he’s next: he was in Dallas on an errand for the boss less than two weeks before the president was shot. With few good options, Guidry hits the road to Las Vegas, to see an old associate—a dangerous man who hates Marcello enough to help Guidry vanish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guidry knows that the first rule of running is "don’t stop," but when he sees a beautiful housewife on the side of the road with a broken-down car, two little daughters and a dog in the back seat, he sees the perfect disguise to cover his tracks from the hit men on his tail. Posing as an insurance man, Guidry offers to help Charlotte reach her destination, California. If she accompanies him to Vegas, he can help her get a new car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For her, it’s more than a car— it’s an escape. She’s on the run too, from a stifling existence in small-town Oklahoma and a kindly husband who’s a hopeless drunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s an American story: two strangers meet to share the open road west, a dream, a hope—and find each other on the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte sees that he’s strong and kind; Guidry discovers that she’s smart and funny. He learns that’s she determined to give herself and her kids a new life; she can’t know that he’s desperate to leave his old one behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another rule—fugitives shouldn’t fall in love, especially with each other. A road isn’t just a road, it’s a trail, and Guidry’s ruthless and relentless hunters are closing in on him. But now Guidry doesn’t want to just survive, he wants to really live, maybe for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone’s expendable, or they should be, but now Guidry just can’t throw away the woman he’s come to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it might get them both killed.</description>

  <description>Toby is a happy-go-lucky charmer who's dodged a scrape at work and is celebrating with friends when the night takes a turn that will change his life - he surprises two burglars who beat him and leave him for dead. Struggling to recover from his injuries, beginning to understand that he might never be the same man again, he takes refuge at his family's ancestral home to care for his dying uncle Hugo. Then a skull is found in the trunk of an elm tree in the garden - and as detectives close in, Toby is forced to face the possibility that his past may not be what he has always believed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A spellbinding standalone from one of the best suspense writers working today, &lt;i&gt;The Witch Elm&lt;/i&gt; asks what we become, and what we're capable of, when we no longer know who we are.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An eerie, old Scottish manor in the middle of nowhere that’s now hers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ailsa Calder has inherited half of a house. The other half belongs to a man who disappeared without a trace twenty-seven years ago—her father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving London behind to settle the inheritance from her mother’s estate, Ailsa returns to her childhood home, nestled amongst the craggy peaks of the Scottish Highlands, joined by the half-sister who’s almost a stranger to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ailsa can’t escape the claustrophobic feeling that the house itself is watching her—as if her past hungers to consume her. She also can’t ignore how the neighbourhood animals refuse to set one foot within the gates of the garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the first nighttime intruder shows up, Ailsa fears that the manor’s careless rugged beauty could cost her everything.</description>

  <description>From Taylor Jenkins Reid, “a genius when it comes to stories about life and love” (&lt;i&gt;Redbook&lt;/i&gt;), comes an unforgettable and sweeping novel about one classic film actress’s relentless rise to the top—the risks she took, the loves she lost, and the long-held secrets the public could never imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Written with Reid’s signature talent for “creating complex, likable characters” (&lt;i&gt;Real Simple&lt;/i&gt;), this is a fascinating journey through the splendor of Old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means—and what it takes—to face the truth.</description>

  <description>In the north of England, far from the intrusions of cities but not far from civilization, Silvie and her family are living as if they are ancient Britons, surviving by the tools and knowledge of the Iron Age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two weeks, the length of her father's vacation, they join an anthropology course set to reenact life in simpler times. They are surrounded by forests of birch and rowan; they make stew from foraged roots and hunted rabbit. The students are fulfilling their coursework; Silvie's father is fulfilling his lifelong obsession. He has raised her on stories of early man, taken her to witness rare artifacts, recounted time and again their rituals and beliefs—particularly their sacrifices to the bog. Mixing with the students, Silvie begins to see, hear, and imagine another kind of life, one that might include going to university, traveling beyond England, choosing her own clothes and food, speaking her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ancient Britons built ghost walls to ward off enemy invaders, rude barricades of stakes topped with ancestral skulls. When the group builds one of their own, they find a spiritual connection to the past. What comes next but human sacrifice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A story at once mythic and strikingly timely, Sarah Moss's &lt;i&gt;Ghost Wall &lt;/i&gt;urges us to wonder how far we have come from the "primitive minds" of our ancestors.</description>

  <description>There’s something strange about the Silver family house in the closed-off town of Dover, England. Grand and cavernous with hidden passages and buried secrets, it’s been home to four generations of Silver women—Anna, Jennifer, Lily, and now Miranda, who has lived in the house with her twin brother, Eliot, ever since their father converted it to a bed-and-breakfast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Silver women have always had a strong connection, a pull over one another that reaches across time and space, and when Lily, Miranda’s mother, passes away suddenly while on a trip abroad, Miranda begins suffering strange ailments. An eating disorder starves her. She begins hearing voices. When she brings a friend home, Dover’s hostility toward outsiders physically manifests within the four walls of the Silver house, and the lives of everyone inside are irrevocably changed. At once an unforgettable mystery and a meditation on race, nationality, and family legacies, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;White is for Witching &lt;/i&gt;is a boldly original, terrifying, and elegant novel by a prodigious talent.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Death, deception, and a detective with quite a lot to hide stalk the pages of Anthony Horowitz’s brilliant murder mystery, the second in the bestselling series starring Private Investigator Daniel Hawthorne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You shouldn’t be here. It’s too late . . . “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These, heard over the phone, were the last recorded words of successful celebrity-divorce lawyer Richard Pryce, found bludgeoned to death in his bachelor pad with a bottle of wine—a 1982 Chateau Lafite worth £3,000, to be precise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Odd, considering he didn’t drink. Why this bottle? And why those words? And why was a three-digit number painted on the wall by the killer? And, most importantly, which of the man’s many, many enemies did the deed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baffled, the police are forced to bring in Private Investigator Daniel Hawthorne and his sidekick, the author Anthony, who’s really getting rather good at this murder investigation business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Hawthorne takes on the case with characteristic relish, it becomes clear that he, too, has secrets to hide. As our reluctant narrator becomes ever more embroiled in the case, he realizes that these secrets must be exposed—even at the risk of death . . . &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Queer City,&lt;/i&gt; the acclaimed Peter Ackroyd looks at London in a whole new way–through the complete history and experiences of its gay and lesbian population. In Roman &lt;i&gt;Londinium&lt;/i&gt;, the city was dotted with &lt;i&gt;lupanaria&lt;/i&gt; (“wolf dens” or public pleasure houses), &lt;i&gt;fornices&lt;/i&gt; (brothels), and &lt;i&gt;thermiae&lt;/i&gt; (hot baths). Then came the Emperor Constantine, with his bishops, monks, and missionaries. And so began an endless loop of alternating permissiveness and censure. Ackroyd takes us right into the hidden history of the city; from the notorious Normans to the frenzy of executions for sodomy in the early nineteenth century. He journeys through the coffee bars of sixties Soho to Gay Liberation, disco music, and the horror of AIDS. Ackroyd reveals the hidden story of London, with its diversity, thrills, and energy, as well as its terrors, dangers, and risks, and in doing so, explains the origins of all English-speaking gay culture.</description>

  <description>When five hyper-successful women agree to appear on a reality series set in New York City called Goal Diggers, the producers never expect the season will end in murder…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brett’s the fan favorite. Tattooed and only twenty-seven, the meteoric success of her spin studio—and her recent engagement to her girlfriend—has made her the object of jealousy and vitriol from her cast mates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly, Brett’s older sister and business partner, is the most recent recruit, dismissed as a hanger-on by veteran cast. The golden child growing up, she defers to Brett now—a role which requires her to protect their shocking secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephanie, the first black cast member and the oldest, is a successful bestselling author of erotic novels. There have long been whispers about her hot, non-working actor-husband and his wandering eye, but this season the focus is on the rift that has opened between her and Brett, former best friends—and resentment soon breeds contempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren, the start-up world’s darling whose drinking has gotten out of control, is Goal Diggers’ recovery narrative—everyone loves a comeback story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Jen, made rich and famous through her cultishly popular vegan food line plays a holistic hippie for the cameras, but is perhaps the most ruthless of them all when the cameras are off.</description>

  <description>Past midnight, something happens to time, that fragile concept we employ to order our sense of reality. It bends, stretches, turns back, or snaps, and sometimes reality with it. And what happens to the wide-eyed observer when the window between reality and unreality shatters, and the glass begins to fly? These four chilling novellas, a feast fit for King fans old and new, provide some shocking answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, past midnight is Stephen King's favorite time of day....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Past Midnight: "The Langoliers" takes a red-eye flight from L.A. to Boston into a most unfriendly sky. Only eleven passengers survive, but landing in an eerily empty world makes them wish they hadn't. Something's waiting for them, you see....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two Past Midnight: "Secret Window, Secret Garden" enters the suddenly strange life of writer Mort Rainey, recently divorced, depressed, and alone on the shore of Tashmore Lake. Alone, that is, until a figure named John Shooter arrives, pointing an accusing finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three Past Midnight: "The Library Policeman" is set in Junction City, Iowa, an unlikely place for evil to be hiding. But for small businessman Sam Peebles, who thinks he may be losing his mind, another enemy is hiding there as well--the truth. If he can find it in time, he might stand a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four Past Midnight: The flat surface of a Polaroid photograph becomes for fifteen-year-old Kevin Delevan an invitation to the supernatural. Old Pop Merrill, Castle Rock's sharpest trader, wants to crash the party for profit, but "The Sun Dog," a creature that shouldn't exist at all, is a very dangerous investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With an introduction and prefatory notes to each of the tales, Stephen King discusses how these stories arose in what is the world's most fearsome imagination. But it is the stories themselves that will keep readers awake long after bedtime, into those dark, timeless hours past midnight.&lt;br /&gt;source: stephenking.com</description>

  <description>'&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Talented Mr. Ripley&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Bad Seed&lt;/i&gt; in this breathless, chilling psychological thriller by the bestselling novelist known as "Korea's Stephen King" &lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Who can you trust if you can't trust yourself?&lt;/i&gt; Early one morning, twenty-six-year-old Yu-jin wakes up to a strange metallic smell, and a phone call from his brother asking if everything's all right at home - he missed a call from their mother in the middle of the night. Yu-jin soon discovers her murdered body, lying in a pool of blood at the bottom of the stairs of their stylish Seoul duplex. He can't remember much about the night before; having suffered from seizures for most of his life, Yu-jin often has trouble with his memory. All he has is a faint impression of his mother calling his name. But was she calling for help? Or begging for her life? Thus begins Yu-jin's frantic three-day search to uncover what happened that night, and to finally learn the truth about himself and his family. A shocking and addictive psychological thriller, &lt;i&gt;The Good Son&lt;/i&gt; explores the mysteries of mind and memory, and the twisted relationship between a mother and son, with incredible urgency.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows a couple like Jack and Grace: he has looks and wealth, she has charm and elegance. You'd like to get to know Grace better. But it's difficult, because you realize Jack and Grace are never apart. Some might call this true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture this: a dinner party at their perfect home, the conversation and wine flowing. They appear to be in their element while entertaining. And Grace's friends are eager to reciprocate with lunch the following week. Grace wants to go, but knows she never will. Her friends call—so why doesn't Grace ever answer the phone? And how can she cook such elaborate meals but remain so slim?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why are there bars on one of the bedroom windows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfect marriage? Or the perfect lie?</description>

  <description>9 Hours and 58 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From author Gilly Macmillan comes this original, chilling and twisty mystery about two shocking murder cases twenty years apart, and the threads that bind them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years ago, eleven-year-olds Charlie Paige and Scott Ashby were murdered in the city of Bristol, their bodies dumped near a dog racing track. A man was convicted of the brutal crime, but decades later, questions still linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For his whole life, filmmaker Cody Swift has been haunted by the deaths of his childhood best friends. The loose ends of the police investigation consume him so much that he decides to return to Bristol in search of answers. Hoping to uncover new evidence, and to encourage those who may be keeping long-buried secrets to speak up, Cody starts a podcast to record his findings. But there are many people who don’t want the case—along with old wounds—reopened so many years after the tragedy, especially Charlie’s mother, Jess, who decides to take matters into her own hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a long-dead body is found in the same location the boys were left decades before, the disturbing discovery launches another murder investigation. Now Detective John Fletcher, the investigator on the original case, must reopen his dusty files and decide if the two murders are linked. With his career at risk, the clock is ticking and lives are in jeopardy… &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This debut novel set in London during World War II is about a young woman who longs to be a war correspondent and inadvertantly becomes a secret advice columnist...” (&lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emmeline Lake and her best friend Bunty are doing their bit for the war effort and trying to stay cheerful, despite the German planes making their nightly raids. Emmy dreams of becoming a Lady War Correspondent, and when she spots a job advertisement in the newspaper she seizes her chance; but after a rather unfortunate misunderstanding, she finds herself typing letters for the formidable Henrietta Bird, renowned advice columnist of &lt;i&gt;Woman’s Friend &lt;/i&gt;magazine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Bird is very clear: letters containing any Unpleasantness must go straight into the bin. But as Emmy reads the desperate pleas from women who many have Gone Too Far with the wrong man, or can’t bear to let their children be evacuated, she begins to secretly write back to the readers who have poured out their troubles.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For fans of high-concept thrillers such as &lt;i&gt;Annihilation&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Girl with All the Gifts&lt;/i&gt;, this breathtaking dystopian psychological thriller follows an American academic stranded at a Swiss hotel as the world descends into nuclear war—along with twenty other survivors—who becomes obsessed with identifying a murderer in their midst after the body of a young girl is discovered in one of the hotel’s water tanks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jon thought he had all the time in the world to respond to his wife’s text message: I miss you so much. I feel bad about how we left it. Love you. But as he’s waiting in the lobby of the L’Hotel Sixieme in Switzerland after an academic conference, still mulling over how to respond to his wife, he receives a string of horrifying push notifications. Washington, DC has been hit with a nuclear bomb, then New York, then London, and finally Berlin. That’s all he knows before news outlets and social media goes black—and before the clouds on the horizon turn orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, two months later, there are twenty survivors holed up at the hotel, a place already tainted by its strange history of suicides and murders. Those who can’t bear to stay commit suicide or wander off into the woods. Jon and the others try to maintain some semblance of civilization. But when the water pressure disappears, and Jon and a crew of survivors investigate the hotel’s water tanks, they are shocked to discover the body of a young girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As supplies dwindle and tensions rise, Jon becomes obsessed with investigating the death of the little girl as a way to cling to his own humanity. Yet the real question remains: can he afford to lose his mind in this hotel, or should he take his chances in the outside world?</description>

  <description>She made John Lennon blush and Marlon Brando clam up. She cold-shouldered Princess Diana and humiliated Elizabeth Taylor.&lt;br /&gt;Andy Warhol photographed her. Jack Nicholson offered her cocaine. Gore Vidal revered her. John Fowles hoped to keep her as his sex-slave. Dudley Moore propositioned her. Francis Bacon heckled her. Peter Sellers was in love with her.&lt;br /&gt;For Pablo Picasso, she was the object of sexual fantasy. “If they knew what I had done in my dreams with your royal ladies” he confided to a friend, “they would take me to the Tower of London and chop off my head!”&lt;br /&gt;Princess Margaret aroused passion and indignation in equal measures. To her friends, she was witty and regal. To her enemies, she was rude and demanding.&lt;br /&gt;In her 1950’s heyday, she was seen as one of the most glamorous and desirable women in the world. By the time of her death, she had come to personify disappointment. One friend said he had never known an unhappier woman.&lt;br /&gt;The tale of Princess Margaret is pantomime as tragedy, and tragedy as pantomime. It is Cinderella in reverse: hope dashed, happiness mislaid, life mishandled.&lt;br /&gt;Combining interviews, parodies, dreams, parallel lives, diaries, announcements, lists, catalogues and essays, Ma’am Darling is a kaleidoscopic experiment in biography, and a witty meditation on fame and art, snobbery and deference, bohemia and high society.</description>

      <![CDATA[The structure of this book didn't work for me. There were some interesting bits but in the end I can't say I liked it. I didn't hate it but I would have appreciated some more historical context. I found myself googling over and over for information so I could understand what was being described....]]>

  <description>Sara Paretsky follows her instant New York Times bestseller Fallout—her most widely read novel in years—with an extraordinary adventure that pits her acclaimed detective, V.I. Warshawski, against some of today’s most powerful figures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legendary sleuth V.I. Warshawski returns to the Windy City to save an old friend’s nephew from a murder arrest. The case involves a stolen artifact that could implicate a shadowy network of international criminals. As V.I. investigates, the detective soon finds herself tangling with the Russian mob, ISIS backers, and a shady network of stock scams and stolen art that stretches from Chicago to the East Indies and the Middle East. In Shell Game, nothing and no one are what they seem, except for the detective herself, who loses sleep, money, and blood, but remains indomitable in her quest for justice.</description>

  <description>A remote lodge in upstate New York is the perfect getaway. . . until the bodies start piling up.It's winter in the Catskills and the weather outside is frightful. But Mitchell's Inn is so delightful! The cozy lodge nestled deep in the woods is perfect for a relaxing--maybe even romantic--weekend away. The Inn boasts spacious old rooms with huge wood-burning fireplaces, a well-stocked wine cellar, and opportunities for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, or just curling up with a book and someone you love. So when the weather takes a turn for the worse, and a blizzard cuts off the electricity--and all contact with the outside world--the guests settle in for the long haul. The power's down but they've got candles, blankets, and wood--a genuine rustic experience! Soon, though, a body turns up--surely an accident. When a second body appears, they start to panic. Then they find a third body. Within the snowed-in paradise, something--or someone--is picking off the guests one by one. They can't leave, and with no cell service, there's no prospect of getting the police in until the weather loosens its icy grip. The weekend getaway has turned deadly. For some couples, it's their first time away. For others, it will be their last. And there's nothing they can do about it but huddle down and hope they can survive the storm.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In her latest captivating novel, nationally bestselling author Fiona Davis takes readers into the glamorous lost art school within Grand Central Terminal, where two very different women, fifty years apart, strive to make their mark on a world set against them.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the nearly nine million people who live in New York City, Grand Central Terminal is a crown jewel, a masterpiece of design. But for Clara Darden and Virginia Clay, it represents something quite different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Clara, the terminal is the stepping stone to her future, which she is certain will shine as the brightly as the constellations on the main concourse ceiling. It is 1928, and twenty-five-year-old Clara is teaching at the lauded Grand Central School of Art. A talented illustrator, she has dreams of creating cover art for Vogue, but not even the prestige of the school can override the public's disdain for a "woman artist." Brash, fiery, confident, and single-minded—even while juggling the affections of two men, a wealthy would-be poet and a brilliant experimental painter—Clara is determined to achieve every creative success. But she and her bohemian friends have no idea that they'll soon be blindsided by the looming Great Depression, an insatiable monster with the power to destroy the entire art scene. And even poverty and hunger will do little to prepare Clara for the greater tragedy yet to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly fifty years later, in 1974, the terminal has declined almost as sharply as Virginia Clay's life. Full of grime and danger, from the smoke-blackened ceiling to the pickpockets and drug dealers who roam the floor, Grand Central is at the center of a fierce lawsuit: Is the once-grand building a landmark to be preserved, or a cancer to be demolished? For Virginia, it is simply her last resort. Recently divorced, she has just accepted a job in the information booth in order to support herself and her college-age daughter, Ruby. But when Virginia stumbles upon an abandoned art school within the terminal and discovers a striking watercolor hidden under the dust, her eyes are opened to the elegance beneath the decay. She embarks on a quest to find the artist of the unsigned masterpiece—an impassioned chase that draws Virginia not only into the battle to save Grand Central but deep into the mystery of Clara Darden, the famed 1920s illustrator who disappeared from history in 1931.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two sensational unsolved crimes—one in the past, another in the present—are linked by one man’s memory and self-deception in this chilling novel of literary suspense from National Book Award finalist Dan Chaon.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“We are always telling a story to ourselves, about ourselves,” Dustin Tillman likes to say. It’s one of the little mantras he shares with his patients, and it’s meant to be reassuring. But what if that story is a lie?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A psychologist in suburban Cleveland, Dustin is drifting through his forties when he hears the news: His adopted brother, Rusty, is being released from prison. Thirty years ago, Rusty received a life sentence for the massacre of Dustin’s parents, aunt, and uncle. The trial came to symbolize the 1980s hysteria over Satanic cults; despite the lack of physical evidence, the jury believed the outlandish accusations Dustin and his cousin made against Rusty. Now, after DNA analysis has overturned the conviction, Dustin braces for a reckoning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, one of Dustin’s patients gets him deeply engaged in a string of drowning deaths involving drunk college boys. At first Dustin dismisses talk of a serial killer as paranoid thinking, but as he gets wrapped up in their amateur investigation, Dustin starts to believe that there’s more to the deaths than coincidence. Soon he becomes obsessed, crossing all professional boundaries—and putting his own family in harm’s way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From one of today’s most renowned practitioners of literary suspense, Ill Will is an intimate thriller about the failures of memory and the perils of self-deception. In Dan Chaon’s nimble, chilling prose, the past looms over the present, turning each into a haunted place.</description>

  <description>Thirty-something Colquitt and Walter Kennedy live in a charming, peaceful suburb of the newly bustling Atlanta. Life is made up of enjoyable work, long, lazy weekends, and the company of good neighbors. Then, to their shock, construction starts on the vacant lot next door, a wooded hillside they'd believed would always remain undeveloped. Soon, though, they come to realize that more is wrong than their diminished privacy. Surely the house can't be "haunted," yet something about it seems to destroy the goodness of every person who comes to live in it, until the entire heart of this friendly neighborhood threatens to be torn apart.</description>

  <description>Candace Chen, a millennial living in NY, is devoted to routine. With the recent passing of her Chinese immigrant parents, she’s had her fill of uncertainty. She’s content just to carry on. So Candace barely notices when a plague of biblical proportions sweeps New York. Then Shen Fever spreads. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her bosses enlist her as part of a dwindling skeleton crew with a big end-date payoff. Soon entirely alone, she becomes the anonymous blogger NY Ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Enter a group of survivors, led by IT tech Bob. They’re traveling to a place called the Facility, where, Bob promises, they will have everything they need to start society anew. Should Candace trust Bob?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Tina and Kristian thought their love stories were over. Each on the other side of 60, they have lost a best friend and a wife, the ambitions of their youth, their hopes for a fresh start. Yearning for connection, they strike up a yearlong correspondence, brought together by a shared fascination with the Tollund Man, subject of Seamus Heaney’s famous poem. As they open up to one another about their lives—daily routines, travel, nature, beauty, work, family—these two strangers become friends and then, perhaps, something more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full of insight, humor, and candor, Tina and Kristian’s letters are a testament to the joy that can come from the meeting of two intensely curious minds. Anne Youngson’s &lt;i&gt;Meet Me at the Museum &lt;/i&gt;is a celebration of long letters, kindred spirits, and the possibility of writing a new story for yourself, at any stage of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In his much-anticipated debut novel, Hank Green--cocreator of Crash Course, Vlogbrothers, and SciShow--spins a sweeping, cinematic tale about a young woman who becomes an overnight celebrity before realizing she's part of something bigger, and stranger, than anyone could have possibly imagined.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Carls just appeared. Coming home from work at three a.m., twenty-three-year-old April May stumbles across a giant sculpture. Delighted by its appearance and craftsmanship--like a ten-foot-tall Transformer wearing a suit of samurai armor--April and her friend Andy make a video with it, which Andy uploads to YouTube. The next day April wakes up to a viral video and a new life. News quickly spreads that there are Carls in dozens of cities around the world--everywhere from Beijing to Buenos Aires--and April, as their first documentarian, finds herself at the center of an intense international media spotlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now April has to deal with the pressure on her relationships, her identity, and her safety that this new position brings, all while being on the front lines of the quest to find out not just what the Carls are, but what they want from us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compulsively entertaining and powerfully relevant, An Absolutely Remarkable Thing grapples with big themes, including how the social internet is changing fame, rhetoric, and radicalization; how our culture deals with fear and uncertainty; and how vilification and adoration spring from the same dehumanization that follows a life in the public eye.</description>

  <description>In Havana, Cuba, a widow tries to come to terms with her husband’s death―and the truth about their marriage―in Laura van den Berg’s surreal, mystifying story of psychological reflection and metaphysical mystery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after Clare arrives in Havana, Cuba, to attend the annual Festival of New Latin American Cinema, she finds her husband, Richard, standing outside a museum. He’s wearing a white linen suit she’s never seen before, and he’s supposed to be dead. Grief-stricken and baffled, Clare tails Richard, a horror film scholar, through the newly tourist-filled streets of Havana, clocking his every move. As the distinction between reality and fantasy blurs, Clare finds grounding in memories of her childhood in Florida and of her marriage to Richard, revealing her role in his death and reappearance along the way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with subtle but striking meditations on grief, marriage, art, misogyny, and the loneliness of travel, &lt;i&gt;The Third Hotel&lt;/i&gt; is a singular, propulsive, brilliantly shape-shifting novel from an inventive author at the height of her narrative powers.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;We’ve been waiting for an hour.&lt;/i&gt; That’s what Audrey says. She states it with a little bit of an edge, her words just bordering on cursive. That’s the thing I think first. Not: Audrey Hepburn is at my birthday dinner, but Audrey Hepburn is annoyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point or another, we’ve all been asked to name five people, living or dead, with whom we’d like to have dinner. Why do we choose the people we do? And what if that dinner was to actually happen? These are the questions Rebecca Serle contends within her utterly captivating novel, &lt;i&gt;The Dinner List&lt;/i&gt;, a story imbued with the same delightful magical realism as &lt;i&gt;One Day,&lt;/i&gt; and the life-changing romance of &lt;i&gt;Me Before You.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sabrina arrives at her thirtieth birthday dinner she finds at the table not just her best friend, but also three significant people from her past, and well, Audrey Hepburn. As the appetizers are served, wine poured, and dinner table conversation begins, it becomes clear that there’s a reason these six people have been gathered together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delicious but never indulgent, sweet with just the right amount of bitter, &lt;i&gt;The Dinner List&lt;/i&gt; is a romance for our times. Bon appetit.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A powerful, darkly glittering novel about violence, love, faith, and loss, as a young Korean American woman at an elite American university is drawn into acts of domestic terrorism by a cult tied to North Korea.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phoebe Lin and Will Kendall meet their first month at prestigious Edwards University. Phoebe is a glamorous girl who doesn't tell anyone she blames herself for her mother's recent death. Will is a misfit scholarship boy who transfers to Edwards from Bible college, waiting tables to get by. What he knows for sure is that he loves Phoebe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grieving and guilt-ridden, Phoebe is increasingly drawn into a religious group--a secretive extremist cult--founded by a charismatic former student, John Leal. He has an enigmatic past that involves North Korea and Phoebe's Korean American family. Meanwhile, Will struggles to confront the fundamentalism he's tried to escape, and the obsession consuming the one he loves. When the group bombs several buildings in the name of faith, killing five people, Phoebe disappears. Will devotes himself to finding her, tilting into obsession himself, seeking answers to what happened to Phoebe and if she could have been responsible for this violent act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Incendiaries&lt;/i&gt; is a fractured love story and a brilliant examination of the minds of extremist terrorists, and of what can happen to people who lose what they love most.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;How long can you protect your heart?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, rumors of the "Marsh Girl" have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life--until the unthinkable happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, &lt;i&gt;Where the Crawdads Sing&lt;/i&gt; is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.</description>

  <description>On a stifling summer's day, eleven-year-old Jack and his two sisters sit in their broken-down car, waiting for their mother to come back and rescue them. &lt;i&gt;Jack's in charge&lt;/i&gt;, she said. &lt;i&gt;I won't be long.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she doesn't come back. She never comes back. And life as the children know it is changed for ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years later, mum-to-be Catherine wakes to find a knife beside her bed, and a note that says: &lt;i&gt;I could have killed you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile Jack is still in charge - of his sisters, of supporting them all, of making sure nobody knows they're alone in the house, and - quite suddenly - of finding out the truth about what happened to his mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But the truth can be a dangerous thing . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A life-changing secret destroys an unlikely friendship in this "magnetic" (Meg Wolitzer) psychological thriller from the Edgar Award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Dare Me&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You told each other everything. Then she told you too much. &lt;br /&gt;Kit has risen to the top of her profession and is on the brink of achieving everything she wanted. She hasn't let anything stop her. &lt;br /&gt;But now someone else is standing in her way - Diane. Best friends at seventeen, their shared ambition made them inseparable. Until the day Diane told Kit her secret - the worst thing she'd ever done, the worst thing Kit could imagine - and it blew their friendship apart.&lt;br /&gt;Kit is still the only person who knows what Diane did. And now Diane knows something about Kit that could destroy everything she's worked so hard for. &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How far would Kit go, to make the hard work, the sacrifice, worth it in the end? What wouldn't she give up? Diane thinks Kit is just like her. Maybe she's right. Ambition: it's in the blood . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>From the Emmy, PEN, Peabody, Critics' Choice, and Golden Globe Award-winning creator of the TV show Fargo comes the thriller of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a foggy summer night, 11 people - 10 privileged, one down-on-his-luck painter - depart Martha's Vineyard on a private jet headed for New York. Sixteen minutes later the unthinkable happens: The plane plunges into the ocean. The only survivors are Scott Burroughs - the painter - and a four-year-old boy who is now the last remaining member of an immensely wealthy and powerful media mogul's family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With chapters weaving between the aftermath of the crash and the backstories of the passengers and crew members - including a Wall Street titan and his wife, a Texan-born party boy just in from London, a young woman questioning her path in life, and a career pilot - the mystery surrounding the tragedy heightens. As the passengers' intrigues unravel, odd coincidences point to a conspiracy. Was it merely by dumb chance that so many influential people perished? Or was something far more sinister at work? Events soon threaten to spiral out of control in an escalating storm of media outrage and accusations. And while Scott struggles to cope with fame that borders on notoriety, the authorities scramble to salvage the truth from the wreckage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid pulse-quickening suspense, the fragile relationship between Scott and the young boy glows at the heart of this stunning novel, raising questions of fate, human nature, and the inextricable ties that bind us together.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;A hilarious send-up of writing workshops, for-profit education, and the gulf between believers and nonbelievers&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marianne is in a slump: barely able to support herself by teaching, not making progress on her poetry, about to lose her Brooklyn apartment. When her novelist ex-fiancé, Eric, and his venture capitalist brother, Mark, offer her a job directing a low-residency school for Christian writers at a motel they’ve inherited on Florida’s Gulf Coast, she can’t come up with a reason to say no. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Genesis Inspirational Writing Ranch is born, and liberal, atheist Marianne is soon knee-deep in applications from writers whose political and religious beliefs she has always opposed but whose money she’s glad to take. Janine is a schoolteacher whose heartfelt poems explore the final days of Terri Schiavo’s life. Davonte is a former R&amp;amp;B superstar who hopes to reboot his career with a bestselling tale of excess and redemption. Lorraine and Tom, eccentric writers in need of paying jobs, join the Ranch as instructors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark finds an investor in God’s Word God’s World, a business that develops for-profit schools for the Christian market, but the conditions that come along with their support become increasingly problematic, especially as Marianne grows closer to the students. As unsavory allegations mount, a hurricane bears down on the Ranch, and Marianne is faced with the consequences of her decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With sharp humor and deep empathy, &lt;i&gt;The Gulf&lt;/i&gt; is a memorable debut novel in which Belle Boggs plumbs the troubled waters dividing America.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;b&gt;A novel of exhilarating range, magical realism, and history—a dazzling retelling of Liberia’s formation&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wayétu Moore’s powerful debut novel, &lt;i&gt;She Would Be King&lt;/i&gt;, reimagines the dramatic story of Liberia’s early years through three unforgettable characters who share an uncommon bond. Gbessa, exiled from the West African village of Lai, is starved, bitten by a viper, and left for dead, but still she survives. June Dey, raised on a plantation in Virginia, hides his unusual strength until a confrontation with the overseer forces him to flee. Norman Aragon, the child of a white British colonizer and a Maroon slave from Jamaica, can fade from sight when the earth calls him. When the three meet in the settlement of Monrovia, their gifts help them salvage the tense relationship between the African American settlers and the indigenous tribes, as a new nation forms around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore’s intermingling of history and magical realism finds voice not just in these three characters but also in the fleeting spirit of the wind, who embodies an ancient wisdom. “If she was not a woman,” the wind says of Gbessa, “she would be king.” In this vibrant story of the African diaspora, Moore, a talented storyteller and a daring writer, illuminates with radiant and exacting prose the tumultuous roots of a country inextricably bound to the United States. &lt;i&gt;She Would Be King &lt;/i&gt;is a novel of profound depth set against a vast canvas and a transcendent debut from a major new author.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Half-Hazard&lt;/i&gt; is the Winner of the Emily Dickinson First Book Award from the Poetry Foundation for a debut by an American poet over forty.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Half-Hazard &lt;/i&gt;is a book of near misses, would-be tragedies, and luck. As Kristen Tracy writes in the title poem, “Dangers here. Perils there. It’ll go how it goes.” The collection follows her wide curiosity, from growing up in a small Mormon farming community to her exodus into the forbidden world, where she finds snakes, car accidents, adulterers, meteors, and death-marked mice. These wry, observant narratives are accompanied by a ringing lyricism, and Tracy’s knack for noticing what’s so funny about trouble and her natural impulse to want to put all the broken things back together. Full of wrong turns, false loves, quashed beliefs, and a menagerie of animals, &lt;i&gt;Half-Hazard&lt;/i&gt; introduces a vibrant new voice in American poetry, one of resilience, faith, and joy.</description>

  <description>David Sedaris returns with his most deeply personal and darkly hilarious book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've ever laughed your way through David Sedaris's cheerfully misanthropic stories, you might think you know what you're getting with Calypso. You'd be wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he buys a beach house on the Carolina coast, Sedaris envisions long, relaxing vacations spent playing board games and lounging in the sun with those he loves most. And life at the Sea Section, as he names the vacation home, is exactly as idyllic as he imagined, except for one tiny, vexing realization: it's impossible to take a vacation from yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Calypso, Sedaris sets his formidable powers of observation toward middle age and mortality. Make no mistake: these stories are very, very funny--it's a book that can make you laugh 'til you snort, the way only family can. Sedaris's powers of observation have never been sharper, and his ability to shock readers into laughter unparalleled. But much of the comedy here is born out of that vertiginous moment when your own body betrays you and you realize that the story of your life is made up of more past than future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is beach reading for people who detest beaches, required reading for those who loathe small talk and love a good tumor joke. Calypso is simultaneously Sedaris's darkest and warmest book yet--and it just might be his very best.</description>

  <description>We all came to the powwow for different reasons. The messy, dangling threads of our lives got pulled into a braid--tied to the back of everything we'd been doing all along to get us here. There will be death and playing dead, there will be screams and unbearable silences, forever-silences, and a kind of time-travel, at the moment the gunshots start, when we look around and see ourselves as we are, in our regalia, and something in our blood will recoil then boil hot enough to burn through time and place and memory. We'll go back to where we came from, when we were people running from bullets at the end of that old world. The tragedy of it all will be unspeakable, that we've been fighting for decades to be recognized as a present-tense people, modern and relevant, only to die in the grass wearing feathers."</description>

      <![CDATA["There There" by Tommy Orange is one of the most remarkable and powerful novels I have ever read. I learned things I never knew about the Native American experience and for this I feel shame, I have to admit. The prologue itself is a punch to the gut. This is a book all of us need to read.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;On a bright January morning in the London suburbs, a family moves into the house they’ve just bought in Trinity Avenue.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Nothing strange about that. Except it is your house. And you didn’t sell it.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Fiona Lawson comes home to find strangers moving into her house, she's sure there's been a mistake. She and her estranged husband, Bram, have a modern co-parenting arrangement: bird's nest custody, where each parent spends a few nights a week with their two sons at the prized family home to maintain stability for their children. But the system built to protect their family ends up putting them in terrible jeopardy. In a domino effect of crimes and misdemeanors, the nest comes tumbling down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Bram has disappeared and so have Fiona's children. As events spiral well beyond her control, Fiona will discover just how many lies her husband was weaving and how little they truly knew each other. But Bram's not the only one with things to hide, and some secrets are best kept to oneself, safe as houses.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winner of the 2011 National Book Award for Fiction&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hurricane is building over the Gulf of Mexico, threatening the coastal town of Bois Sauvage, Mississippi, and Esch's father is growing concerned. A hard drinker, largely absent, he doesn't show concern for much else. Esch and her three brothers are stocking food, but there isn't much to save. Lately, Esch can't keep down what food she gets; she's fourteen and pregnant. Her brother Skeetah is sneaking scraps for his prized pitbull's new litter, dying one by one in the dirt. While brothers Randall and Junior try to stake their claim in a family long on child's play and short on parenting. As the twelve days that comprise the novel's framework yield to the final day and Hurricane Katrina, the unforgettable family at the novel's heart—motherless children sacrificing for each other as they can, protecting and nurturing where love is scarce—pulls itself up to struggle for another day. A wrenching look at the lonesome, brutal, and restrictive realities of rural poverty, "Salvage the Bone" is muscled with poetry, revelatory, and real.</description>

  <description>Camden, NJ, 1948.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When 11 year-old Sally Horner steals a notebook from the local Woolworth's, she has no way of knowing that 52 year-old Frank LaSalle, fresh out of prison, is watching her, preparing to make his move. Accosting her outside the store, Frank convinces Sally that he’s an FBI agent who can have her arrested in a minute—unless she does as he says. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This chilling novel traces the next two harrowing years as Frank mentally and physically assaults Sally while the two of them travel westward from Camden to San Jose, forever altering not only her life, but the lives of her family, friends, and those she meets along the way.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;The new novel from the beloved &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;The Boy in the Striped Pajamas&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; and&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt; The Heart's Invisible Furies&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;, a seductive Highsmithian psychodrama following one brilliant, ruthless man who will stop at nothing in his pursuit of fame&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look hard enough, you can find stories pretty much anywhere. They don't even have to be your own. Or so would-be writer Maurice Swift decides very early on in his career. A chance encounter in a West Berlin hotel with celebrated novelist Erich Ackermann gives him an opportunity to ingratiate himself with someone more powerful than him. For Erich is lonely, and he has a story to tell. Whether or not he should do so is another matter.&lt;br /&gt;     Once Maurice has made his name, he sets off in pursuit of other people's stories. He doesn't care where he finds them--or to whom they belong--as long as they help him rise to the top. Stories will make him famous, but they will also make him beg, borrow, and steal. They may even make him do worse.&lt;br /&gt;     A psychological drama of cat and mouse, &lt;i&gt;A Ladder to the Sky&lt;/i&gt; shows how easy it is to achieve the world if you are prepared to sacrifice your soul.</description>

  <description>It's Nantucket wedding season, also known as summer-the sight of a bride racing down Main Street is as common as the sun setting at Madaket Beach. The Otis-Winbury wedding promises to be an event to remember: the groom's wealthy parents have spared no expense to host a lavish ceremony at their oceanfront estate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it's going to be memorable for all the wrong reasons after tragedy strikes: a body is discovered in Nantucket Harbor just hours before the ceremony-and everyone in the wedding party is suddenly a suspect. As Chief of Police Ed Kapenash interviews the bride, the groom, the groom's famous mystery-novelist mother, and even a member of his own family, he discovers that every wedding is a minefield-and no couple is perfect. Featuring beloved characters from The Castaways, Beautiful Day, and A Summer Affair, The Perfect Couple proves once again that Elin Hilderbrand is the queen of the summer beach read.</description>

Passionately in love, they embark on a dream honeymoon to the tropical island of Bora Bora, where they enjoy the sun, the sand, and each other. Then, while scuba diving in the crystal blue sea, they find something in the water. . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Could the life of your dreams be the stuff of nightmares?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Suddenly the newlyweds must make a dangerous choice: to speak out or to protect their secret.

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Rice Moore is just beginning to think his troubles are behind him. He’s found a job protecting a remote forest preserve in Virginian Appalachia where his main responsibilities include tracking wildlife and refurbishing cabins. It’s hard work, and totally solitary—perfect to hide away from the Mexican drug cartels he betrayed back in Arizona. But when Rice finds the carcass of a bear killed on the grounds, the quiet solitude he’s so desperately sought is suddenly at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More bears are killed on the preserve and Rice’s obsession with catching the poachers escalates, leading to hostile altercations with the locals and attention from both the law and Rice’s employers. Partnering with his predecessor, a scientist who hopes to continue her research on the preserve, Rice puts into motion a plan that could expose the poachers but risks revealing his own whereabouts to the dangerous people he was running from in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James McLaughlin expertly brings the beauty and danger of Appalachia to life. The result is an elemental, slow burn of a novel—one that will haunt you long after you turn the final page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

"Bearskin" is an intense thriller and the author does an amazing job transporting the reader to the Appalachian mountains of Virginia. Truly a unique novel of suspens...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Six perfect days. Then he disappeared. A love story with a secret at its heart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sarah meets Eddie, they connect instantly and fall in love. To Sarah, it seems as though her life has finally begun. And it's mutual: It's as though Eddie has been waiting for her, too. Sarah has never been so certain of anything. So when Eddie leaves for a long-booked vacation and promises to call from the airport, she has no cause to doubt him. But he doesn't call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah's friends tell her to forget about him, but she can't. She knows something's happened--there must be an explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minutes, days, weeks go by as Sarah becomes increasingly worried. But then she discovers she's right. There is a reason for Eddie's disappearance, and it's the one thing they didn't share with each other: the truth.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;"This is simply one of the nastiest and most disturbing thrillers I've read in years. In short: I loved it, right down to the utterly chilling final line." —Gillian Flynn&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a love story. &lt;i&gt;Mike’s&lt;/i&gt; love story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Hayes fought his way out of a brutal childhood and into a quiet, if lonely life, before he met Verity Metcalf. V taught him about love, and in return, Mike has dedicated his life to making her happy. He’s found the perfect home, the perfect job, he’s sculpted himself into the physical ideal V has always wanted. He knows they’ll be blissfully happy together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter that she hasn’t been returning his emails or phone calls.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn’t matter that she says she’s marrying Angus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s all just part of the secret game they used to play. If Mike watches V closely, he’ll see the signs. If he keeps track of her every move he’ll know just when to come to her rescue…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spellbinding, darkly twisted novel about desire and obsession, and the complicated lines between truth and perception, &lt;i&gt;Our Kind of Cruelty&lt;/i&gt; introduces Araminta Hall, a chilling new voice in psychological suspense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>An unspeakable crime. A confounding investigation. At a time when the King brand has never been stronger, he has delivered one of his most unsettling and compulsively readable stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An eleven-year-old boy’s violated corpse is found in a town park. Eyewitnesses and fingerprints point unmistakably to one of Flint City’s most popular citizens. He is Terry Maitland, Little League coach, English teacher, husband, and father of two girls. Detective Ralph Anderson, whose son Maitland once coached, orders a quick and very public arrest. Maitland has an alibi, but Anderson and the district attorney soon add DNA evidence to go with the fingerprints and witnesses. Their case seems ironclad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the investigation expands and horrifying answers begin to emerge, King’s propulsive story kicks into high gear, generating strong tension and almost unbearable suspense. Terry Maitland seems like a nice guy, but is he wearing another face? When the answer comes, it will shock you as only Stephen King can.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A Place for Us&lt;/i&gt; unfolds the lives of an Indian-American Muslim family, gathered together in their Californian hometown to celebrate the eldest daughter, Hadia's, wedding - a match of love rather than tradition. It is here, on this momentous day, that Amar, the youngest of the siblings, reunites with his family for the first time in three years. Rafiq and Layla must now contend with the choices and betrayals that lead to their son's estrangement - the reckoning of parents who strove to pass on their cultures and traditions to their children; and of children who in turn struggle to balance authenticity in themselves with loyalty to the home they came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a narrative that spans decades and sees family life through the eyes of each member, &lt;i&gt;A Place For Us&lt;/i&gt; charts the crucial moments in the family's past, from the bonds that bring them together to the differences that pull them apart. And as siblings Hadia, Huda, and Amar attempt to carve out a life for themselves, they must reconcile their present culture with their parent's faith, to tread a path between the old world and the new, and learn how the smallest decisions can lead to the deepest of betrayals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A deeply affecting and resonant story, &lt;i&gt;A Place for Us&lt;/i&gt; is truly a book for our times: a moving portrait of what it means to be an American family today, a novel of love, identity and belonging that eloquently examines what it means to be both American and Muslim -- and announces Fatima Farheen Mirza as a major new literary talent.</description>

      <![CDATA[Wow! This was a great read. I had my suspicions and the author took me in so many different directions and yet, at the end, I was surprised by it. This is an excellent debut novel and I'm looking forward to reading the next Aaron Falk novel.]]>

  <description>From the author of &lt;i&gt;The Balance Project&lt;/i&gt; comes a dual-timeline narrative featuring a 1949 Miss Subways contestant and a modern-day advertising executive whose careers and lives intersect.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Schnall has written a book that is smart and timely...Feels perfect for fans of Beatriz Williams and Liza Klaussmann." —Taylor Jenkins Reid, acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"A fast-paced, clever novel filled with romantic possibilities, high-stakes decisions, and harsh realities. Perfect for fans of Fiona Davis’s &lt;i&gt;The Dollhouse&lt;/i&gt;, this engrossing tale highlights the role that ambition, sexism, and true love will forever play in women’s lives." —Amy Poeppel, author of &lt;i&gt;Small Admissions&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In 1949, dutiful and ambitious Charlotte's dream of a career in advertising is shattered when her father demands she help out with the family business. Meanwhile, Charlotte is swept into the glamorous world of the Miss Subways beauty contest, which promises irresistible opportunities with its Park Avenue luster and local fame status. But when her new friend—the intriguing and gorgeous fellow-participant Rose—does something unforgivable, Charlotte must make a heart-wrenching decision that will change the lives of those around her forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly 70 years later, outspoken advertising executive Olivia is pitching the NYC subways account in a last ditch effort to save her job at an advertising agency. When the charismatic boss she’s secretly in love with pits her against her misogynistic nemesis, Olivia’s urgent search for the winning strategy leads her to the historic Miss Subways campaign. As the pitch date closes in on her, Olivia finds herself dealing with a broken heart, an unlikely new love interest, and an unexpected personal connection to Miss Subways that could save her job—and her future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Subway Girls&lt;/i&gt; is the charming story of two strong women, a generation apart, who find themselves up against the same eternal struggle to find an impossible balance between love, happiness, and ambition.</description>

  <description>One sweltering night in 2013, four former high school classmates converge on their hometown in northeastern Ohio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s Bill Ashcraft, a passionate, drug-abusing young activist whose flailing ambitions have taken him from Cambodia to Zuccotti Park to post-BP New Orleans, and now back home with a mysterious package strapped to the undercarriage of his truck; Stacey Moore, a doctoral candidate reluctantly confronting her family and the mother of her best friend and first love, whose disappearance spurs the mystery at the heart of the novel; Dan Eaton, a shy veteran of three tours in Iraq, home for a dinner date with the high school sweetheart he’s tried desperately to forget; and the beautiful, fragile Tina Ross, whose rendezvous with the washed-up captain of the football team triggers the novel’s shocking climax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set over the course of a single evening, &lt;i&gt;Ohio &lt;/i&gt;toggles between the perspectives of these unforgettable characters as they unearth dark secrets, revisit old regrets and uncover—and compound—bitter betrayals. Before the evening is through, these narratives converge masterfully to reveal a mystery so dark and shocking it will take your breath away.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Sweetness can be deceptive.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet Hanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s the sweet-but-silent angel in the adoring eyes of her Daddy. He’s the only person who understands her, and all Hanna wants is to live happily ever after with him. But Mommy stands in her way, and she’ll try any trick she can think of to get rid of her. Ideally for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet Suzette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She loves her daughter, really, but after years of expulsions and strained home schooling, her precarious health and sanity are weakening day by day. As Hanna’s tricks become increasingly sophisticated, and Suzette's husband remains blind to the failing family dynamics, Suzette starts to fear that there’s something seriously wrong, and that maybe home isn’t the best place for their baby girl after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From blazing new talent Zoje Stage, &lt;i&gt;Baby Teeth&lt;/i&gt; is a story about a perfect-looking family, and a darling little girl who wants nothing more than to kill her mother.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Satire meets slasher in this short, darkly funny hand grenade of a novel about a Nigerian woman whose younger sister has a very inconvenient habit of killing her boyfriends&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Femi makes three, you know. Three and they label you a serial killer."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Korede is bitter. How could she not be? Her sister, Ayoola, is many things: the favorite child, the beautiful one, possibly sociopathic. And now Ayoola's third boyfriend in a row is dead. Korede's practicality is the sisters' saving grace. She knows the best solutions for cleaning blood, the trunk of her car is big enough for a body, and she keeps Ayoola from posting pictures of her dinner to Instagram when she should be mourning her "missing" boyfriend. Not that she gets any credit.&lt;br /&gt;     A kind, handsome doctor at the hospital where Korede works, is the bright spot in her life. She dreams of the day when he will realize they're perfect for each other. But one day Ayoola shows up to the hospital uninvited and he takes notice. When he asks Korede for Ayoola's phone number, she must reckon with what her sister has become and what she will do about it.&lt;br /&gt;     Sharp as nails and full of deadpan wit, Oyinkan Braithwaite has written a deliciously deadly debut that's as fun as it is frightening.</description>

  <description>It's easy to feel at home in Mitford. In these high, green hills, the air is pure, the village is charming, and the people are generally lovable. Yet, Father Tim, the bachelor rector, wants something more. Enter a dog the size of a sofa who moves in and won't go away. Add an attractive neighbor who begins wearing a path through the hedge. Now, stir in a lovable but unloved boy, a mystifying jewel theft, and a secret that's sixty years old. Suddenly, Father Tim gets more than he bargained for. And readers get a rich comedy about ordinary people and their ordinary lives.</description>

  <description>8 hours, 20 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who says you can't run away from your problems?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are a failed novelist about to turn fifty. A wedding invitation arrives in the mail: your boyfriend of the past nine years is engaged to someone else. You can't say yes--it would be too awkward--and you can't say no--it would look like defeat. On your desk are a series of invitations to half-baked literary events around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;QUESTION&lt;/b&gt;: How do you arrange to skip town?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ANSWER&lt;/b&gt;: You accept them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What would possibly go wrong?&lt;/i&gt; Arthur Less will almost fall in love in Paris, almost fall to his death in Berlin, barely escape to a Moroccan ski chalet from a Saharan sandstorm, accidentally book himself as the (only) writer-in-residence at a Christian Retreat Center in Southern India, and encounter, on a desert island in the Arabian Sea, the last person on Earth he wants to face. Somewhere in there: he will turn fifty. Through it all, there is his first love. And there is his last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because, despite all these mishaps, missteps, misunderstandings and mistakes, LESS is, above all, a love story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A scintillating satire of the American abroad, a rumination on time and the human heart, a bittersweet romance of chances lost, by an author The New York Times has hailed as "inspired, lyrical," "elegiac," "ingenious," as well as "too sappy by half," LESS shows a writer at the peak of his talents raising the curtain on our shared human comedy.</description>

  <description>An alternate cover edition for this ASIN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32707573-whose-body" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stark naked body was lying in the tub. Not unusual for a proper bath, but highly irregular for murder – especially with a pair of gold pince-nez deliberately perched before the sightless eyes. What's more, the face appeared to have been shaved after death. The police assumed that the victim was a prominent financier, but Lord Peter Wimsey, who dabbled in mystery detection as a hobby, knew better. In this, his first murder case, Lord Peter untangles the ghastly mystery of the corpse in the bath.</description>

      <![CDATA[I'm a big Agatha Christie fan and I've had Dorothy L. Sayers on my to-read list for quite a while. However, I did not enjoy reading this at all. I didn't like any of the characters, the anti-Semitism of the characters really bothered me, and I didn't like the plot. I'll just stick with Christie....]]>

  <description>Something is out there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something terrifying that must not be seen. One glimpse and a person is driven to deadly violence. No one knows what it is or where it came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years after it began, a handful of scattered survivors remain, including Malorie and her two young children. Living in an abandoned house near the river, she has dreamed of fleeing to a place where they might be safe. Now, that the boy and girl are four, it is time to go. But the journey ahead will be terrifying: twenty miles downriver in a rowboat—blindfolded—with nothing to rely on but her wits and the children’s trained ears. One wrong choice and they will die. And something is following them. But is it man, animal, or monster?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Engulfed in darkness, surrounded by sounds both familiar and frightening, Malorie embarks on a harrowing odyssey—a trip that takes her into an unseen world and back into the past, to the companions who once saved her. Under the guidance of the stalwart Tom, a motley group of strangers banded together against the unseen terror, creating order from the chaos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when supplies ran low, they were forced to venture outside—and confront the ultimate question: in a world gone mad, who can really be trusted?</description>

  <description>A smart, witty novel of driving lessons and vertigo, short-listed for the Man Booker International Prize&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonja is ready to get on with her life. She’s over forty now, and the Swedish crime novels she translates are losing their fascination. She sees a masseuse, tries to reconnect with her sister, and is finally learning to drive. But under the overbearing gaze of her driving instructor, Sonja is unable to shift gears for herself. And her vertigo, which she has always carefully hidden, has begun to manifest at the worst possible moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonja hoped her move to Copenhagen years ago would have left rural Jutland in the rearview mirror. Yet she keeps remembering the dramatic landscapes of her childhood―the endless sky, the whooper swans, the rye fields―and longs to go back. But how can she return to a place that she no longer recognizes? And how can she escape the alienating streets of Copenhagen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Mirror, Shoulder, Signal&lt;/em&gt;, Dorthe Nors brings her distinctive blend of style, humor, and insight to a poignant journey of one woman in search of herself when there’s no one to ask for directions.</description>

  <description>A searing novel about the obstacles facing women in Zimbabwe, by one of the country’s most notable authors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anxious about her prospects after leaving a stagnant job, Tambudzai finds herself living in a run-down youth hostel in downtown Harare. For reasons that include her grim financial prospects and her age, she moves to a widow’s boarding house and eventually finds work as a biology teacher. But at every turn in her attempt to make a life for herself, she is faced with a fresh humiliation, until the painful contrast between the future she imagined and her daily reality ultimately drives her to a breaking point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;This Mournable Body&lt;/em&gt;, Tsitsi Dangarembga returns to the protagonist of her acclaimed first novel, &lt;em&gt;Nervous Conditions&lt;/em&gt;, to examine how the hope and potential of a young girl and a fledgling nation can sour over time and become a bitter and floundering struggle for survival. As a last resort, Tambudzai takes an ecotourism job that forces her to return to her parents’ impoverished homestead. It is this homecoming, in Dangarembga’s tense and psychologically charged novel, that culminates in an act of betrayal, revealing just how toxic the combination of colonialism and capitalism can be.</description>

  <description>In the nine expansive, searching stories of &lt;em&gt;A Lucky Man&lt;/em&gt;, fathers and sons attempt to salvage relationships with friends and family members and confront mistakes made in the past. An imaginative young boy from the Bronx goes swimming with his group from day camp at a backyard pool in the suburbs, and faces the effects of power and privilege in ways he can barely grasp. A teen intent on proving himself a man through the all-night revel of J’Ouvert can’t help but look out for his impressionable younger brother. A pair of college boys on the prowl follow two girls home from a party and have to own the uncomfortable truth of their desires. And at a capoeira conference, two brothers grapple with how to tell the story of their family, caught in the dance of their painful, fractured history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamel Brinkley’s stories, in a debut that announces the arrival of a significant new voice, reflect the tenderness and vulnerability of black men and boys whose hopes sometimes betray them, especially in a world shaped by race, gender, and class―where luck may be the greatest fiction of all.</description>

  <description>Listening length: 8 hours, 58 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The author of &lt;i&gt;The Wedding Date &lt;/i&gt;serves up a novel about what happens when a public proposal doesn't turn into a happy ending, thanks to a woman who knows exactly how to make one on her own...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When someone asks you to spend your life with him, it shouldn't come as a surprise--or happen in front of 45,000 people.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When freelance writer Nikole Paterson goes to a Dodgers game with her actor boyfriend, his man bun, and his bros, the last thing she expects is a scoreboard proposal. Saying no isn't the hard part--they've only been dating for five months, and he can't even spell her name correctly. The hard part is having to face a stadium full of disappointed fans...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the game with his sister, Carlos Ibarra comes to Nik's rescue and rushes her away from a camera crew. He's even there for her when the video goes viral and Nik's social media blows up--in a bad way. Nik knows that in the wilds of LA, a handsome doctor like Carlos can't be looking for anything serious, so she embarks on an epic rebound with him, filled with food, fun, and fantastic sex. But when their glorified hookups start breaking the rules, one of them has to be smart enough to put on the brakes...</description>

She was &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her fiancé is kidnapped by a callous Argentine crime-family, Mia Keys embarks on a journey that takes her thousands of miles away from the comforts of her Pacific Coast living to the disadvantaged slums of Rosario, Argentina where she is forced to turn into the weapon she had tried so desperately not to become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Check out these great reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Like its protagonist Mia Keys, Rosario is SMART, SEXY, and SASSY!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Rosario is a heart-pounding mix of The Bourne Identity meets Queen of the South!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I felt like I was watching a movie!

  <description>Diane Seuss’s brilliant follow-up to Four-Legged Girl, a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still life with stack of bills phone cord cig butt and freezer-burned Dreamsicle&lt;br /&gt;Still life with Easter Bunny twenty caged minks and rusty meat grinder&lt;br /&gt;Still life with whiskey wooden leg two potpies and a dead parakeet&lt;br /&gt;Still life with pork rinds pickled peppers and the Book of Revelation&lt;br /&gt;Still life with feeding tube oxygen half-eaten raspberry Zinger&lt;br /&gt;Still life with convenience store pecking order shotgun blast to the face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;―from “American Still Lives”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still Life with Two Dead Peacocks and a Girl takes its title from Rembrandt’s painting, a dark emblem of femininity, violence, and the viewer’s own troubled gaze. In Diane Seuss’s new collection, the notion of the still life is shattered and Rembrandt’s painting is presented across the book in pieces―details that hide more than they reveal until they’re assembled into a whole. With invention and irreverence, these poems escape gilded frames and overturn traditional representations of gender, class, and luxury. Instead, Seuss invites in the alienated, the washed-up, the ugly, and the freakish―the overlooked many of us who might more often stand in a Walmart parking lot than before the canvases of Pollock, O’Keeffe, and Rothko. Rendered with precision and profound empathy, this extraordinary gallery of lives in shards shows us that “our memories are local, acute, and unrelenting.”</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;By the world-renowned seismologist, a riveting history of natural disasters, their impact on our culture, and new ways of thinking about the ones to come&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, hurricanes, volcanoes--they stem from the same forces that give our planet life. Earthquakes give us natural springs; volcanoes produce fertile soil. It is only when these forces exceed our ability to withstand them that they become disasters. Together they have shaped our cities and their architecture; elevated leaders and toppled governments; influenced the way we think, feel, fight, unite, and pray. The history of natural disasters is a history of ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Big Ones&lt;/i&gt;, leading seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones offers a bracing look at some of the world's greatest natural disasters, whose reverberations we continue to feel today. At Pompeii, Jones explores how a volcanic eruption in the first century AD challenged prevailing views of religion. She examines the California floods of 1862 and the limits of human memory. And she probes more recent events--such as the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 and the American hurricanes of 2017--to illustrate the potential for globalization to humanize and heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With population in hazardous regions growing and temperatures around the world rising, the impacts of natural disasters are greater than ever before. &lt;i&gt;The Big Ones&lt;/i&gt; is more than just a work of history or science; it is a call to action. Natural hazards are inevitable; human catastrophes are not. With this energizing and exhaustively researched book, Dr. Jones offers a look at our past, readying us to face down the Big Ones in our future.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“A thrilling page-turner.” —Paula Hawkins, author of The Girl on the Train&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Breathtaking . . . As shocking as it is satisfying.” —The New York Times Book Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gripping, intense, stunningly written novel of psychological suspense from the award-winning author of Under the Harrow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claire is a hardworking doctor leading a simple, quiet life in London. She is also the daughter of the most notorious murder suspect in the country, though no one knows it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly thirty years ago, while Claire and her brother slept upstairs, a brutal crime was committed in her family's townhouse. The next morning, her father's car was found abandoned near the English Channel, with bloodstains on the front seat. Her mother insisted she'd seen him in the house that night, but his powerful, privileged friends maintained his innocence. The first lord accused of murder in more than a century, he has been missing ever since. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the police tell Claire they've found him, her carefully calibrated existence begins to fracture. She doesn't know if she's the daughter of a murderer or a wronged man, but Claire will soon learn how far she'll go to finally find the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loosely inspired by one of the most notorious unsolved crimes of the 20th century – the Lord Lucan case – A Double Life is at once a riveting page-turner and a moving reflection on women and violence, trauma and memory, and class and privilege.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A propulsive and ambitious thriller about a woman trying to rescue her twin sister from captivity in North Korea, and the North Korean citizens with whom she forms an unlikely alliance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Star of the North &lt;/i&gt;opens in 1998, when a Korean American teenager is kidnapped from a South Korean beach by North Korean operatives. Twelve years later, her brilliant twin sister, Jenna, is still searching for her, and ends up on the radar of the CIA. When evidence that her sister may still be alive in North Korea comes to light, Jenna will do anything possible to rescue her--including undertaking a daring mission into the heart of the regime. Her story is masterfully braided together with two other narrative threads. In one, a North Korean peasant woman finds a forbidden international aid balloon and uses the valuables inside to launch a dangerously lucrative black-market business. In the other, a high-ranking North Korean official discovers, to his horror, that he may be descended from a traitor, a fact that could mean his death if it is revealed. As the novel progresses, these narrative strands converge and connect in surprising ways, ultimately building to an explosive and unforgettable climax.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A suspense novel from the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Haunting of Maddy Clare...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vermont, 1950. &lt;/b&gt;There's a place for the girls whom no one wants--the troublemakers, the illegitimate, the too smart for their own good. It's called Idlewild Hall. And in the small town where it's located, there are rumors that the boarding school is haunted. Four roommates bond over their whispered fears, their budding friendship blossoming--until one of them mysteriously disappears. . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vermont, 2014.&lt;/b&gt; As much as she's tried, journalist Fiona Sheridan cannot stop revisiting the events surrounding her older sister's death. Twenty years ago, her body was found lying in the overgrown fields near the ruins of Idlewild Hall. And though her sister's boyfriend was tried and convicted of murder, Fiona can't shake the suspicion that something was never right about the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Fiona discovers that Idlewild Hall is being restored by an anonymous benefactor, she decides to write a story about it. But a shocking discovery during the renovations will link the loss of her sister to secrets that were meant to stay hidden in the past--and a voice that won't be silenced. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A gritty and gorgeous debut that follows a cast of gay and transgender club kids navigating the Harlem ball scene of the 1980s and ’90s, inspired by the real House of Xtravaganza made famous by the seminal documentary Paris Is Burning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s 1980 in New York City, and nowhere is the city’s glamour and energy better reflected than in the burgeoning Harlem ball scene, where seventeen-year-old Angel first comes into her own. Burned by her traumatic past, Angel is new to the drag world, new to ball culture, and has a yearning inside of her to help create family for those without. When she falls in love with Hector, a beautiful young man who dreams of becoming a professional dancer, the two decide to form the House of Xtravaganza, the first-ever all-Latino house in the Harlem ball circuit. But when Hector dies of AIDS-related complications, Angel must bear the responsibility of tending to their house alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mother of the house, Angel recruits Venus, a whip-fast trans girl who dreams of finding a rich man to take care of her; Juanito, a quiet boy who loves fabrics and design; and Daniel, a butch queen who accidentally saves Venus’s life. The Xtravaganzas must learn to navigate sex work, addiction, and persistent abuse, leaning on each other as bulwarks against a world that resists them. All are ambitious, resilient, and determined to control their own fates, even as they hurtle toward devastating consequences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in a voice that brims with wit, rage, tenderness, and fierce yearning, &lt;i&gt;The House of Impossible Beauties&lt;/i&gt; is a tragic story of love, family, and the dynamism of the human spirit.</description>

      <![CDATA[I read this in April and struggled with writing a review because I loved it so much. I've seen "Paris is Burning" many times but this novel hit me with an emotional punch I wasn't expecting.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A bewitching new novel of family and self-discovery from the best-selling, award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;A Spool of Blue Thread.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willa Drake can count on one hand the defining moments of her life. In 1967, she is a schoolgirl coping with her mother's sudden disappearance. In 1977, she is a college coed considering a marriage proposal. In 1997, she is a young widow trying to piece her life back together. And in 2017, she yearns to be a grandmother, yet the prospect is dimming. So, when Willa receives a phone call from a stranger, telling her that her son's ex-girlfriend has been shot, she drops everything and flies across the country to Baltimore. The impulsive decision to look after this woman and her nine-year-old daughter will lead Willa into uncharted territory--surrounded by eccentric neighbors, plunged into the rituals that make a community a family, and forced to find solace in unexpected places. A bittersweet, probing novel of hope and grief, fulfillment and renewal, &lt;i&gt;Clock Dance&lt;/i&gt; gives us Anne Tyler at the height of her powers.</description>

  <description>Rachel Jenner is walking in a Bristol park with her eight-year-old son, Ben, when he asks if he can run ahead. It’s an ordinary request on an ordinary Sunday afternoon, and Rachel has no reason to worry—until Ben vanishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Police are called, search parties go out, and Rachel, already insecure after her recent divorce, feels herself coming undone. As hours and then days pass without a sign of Ben, everyone who knew him is called into question, from Rachel’s newly married ex-husband to her mother-of-the-year sister. Inevitably, media attention focuses on Rachel too, and the public’s attitude toward her begins to shift from sympathy to suspicion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she desperately pieces together the threadbare clues, Rachel realizes that the greatest dangers may lie not in the anonymous strangers of every parent’s nightmares, but behind the familiar smiles of those she trusts the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where is Ben? The clock is ticking...</description>

This can't happen here. Not in America. Not to her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon women are not permitted to hold jobs. Girls are not taught to read or write. Females no longer have a voice. Before, the average person spoke sixteen thousand words each day, but now women have only one hundred to make themselves heard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For herself, her daughter, and every woman silenced, Jean will reclaim her voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is just the beginning...not the end. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/i&gt;'s "Best Books to Bring to the Beach This Summer"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of PopSugar, Refinery29, &lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, Bustle, &lt;i&gt;Real Simple&lt;/i&gt;, i09, and Amazon's Best Books to Read in August 2018&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The author of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling &lt;em&gt;The Six&lt;/em&gt; now turns her formidable biographical skills to the greatest crime writer in the world, Agatha Christie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been one hundred years since Agatha Christie wrote her first novel and created the formidable Hercule Poirot.  A brilliant and award winning biographer, Laura Thompson now turns her sharp eye to Agatha Christie. Arguably the greatest crime writer in the world, Christie's books still sell over four million copies each year—more than thirty years after her death—and it shows no signs of slowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But who was the woman behind these mystifying, yet eternally pleasing, puzzlers? Thompson reveals the Edwardian world in which Christie grew up, explores her relationships, including those with her two husbands and daughter, and investigates the many mysteries still surrounding Christie's life, most notably, her eleven-day disappearance in 1926.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agatha Christie is as mysterious as the stories she penned, and writing about her is a detection job in itself. With unprecedented access to all of Christie's letters, papers, and notebooks, as well as fresh and insightful interviews with her grandson, daughter, son-in-law and their living relations, Thompson is able to unravel not only the detailed workings of Christie's detective fiction, but the truth behind this mysterious woman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A car lies at the bottom of an icy ravine. Slumped over the steering wheel, dead, is the most critically acclaimed horror writer of his time. Was it an accident? His son Milo doesn't care. For the first time in his life, he's free. No more nightmarish readings, spooky animal rites, or moonlit visions of his father in the woods with a notebook and vampire make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so he thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milo settles into a quiet routine—constructing model Greek warships and at last building a relationship with his sister Klara, who's home after a failed marriage and brief career as an English teacher. Then Klara hires a gardener to breathe new life into their overgrown estate. There's something odd about him—something eerily reminiscent of their father's most violent villain. Or is Milo imagining things? He’s not sure. That all changes the day the gardener discovers something startling in the woods. Suddenly Milo is fighting for his life, forced to confront the power of fictional identity as he uncovers the shocking truth about his own dysfunctional family—and the supposed accident that claimed his parents’ lives.</description>

      <![CDATA[This novel was suspenseful, eerie, creepy, and it had me on edge. I LOVED it! I definitely felt a Shirley Jackson vibe when reading it. There's something definitely a bit "off" with Milo Crane and his sister Klara. And talk about an unreliable narrator in Milo. I was so unsure about what reality...]]>

  <description>A supernatural New York love story&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emer is just a girl living in New York City who takes the subway, buys ice cream from the bodega on the corner, has writerly aspirations, and lives with her boyfriend, Con. But is this life she lives the only path she’s on? Taking inspiration from the myth of Emer and Cuchulain, loosely based on W. B. Yeats’s play &lt;i&gt;The Only Jealousy of Emer&lt;/i&gt;, and featuring an all-star cast of mythical figures from all over the world, David Duchovny’s darkly funny fantasy novel &lt;i&gt;Miss Subways&lt;/i&gt; is one woman’s trippy, mystical journey down parallel tracks of time and love. On the way, Emer will battle natural and supernatural forces to find her true voice, power, and destiny. A fairy tale of love lost and regained, &lt;i&gt;Miss Subways&lt;/i&gt; is also a love letter to the city that enchants us all: New York.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;THE TOP TEN INTERNATIONALLY BESTSELLING PSYCHOLOGICAL SUSPENSE YOU CAN'T MISS...&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;“A cracking read...&lt;i&gt;Our Little Secret&lt;/i&gt; builds to a deliciously dark conclusion.” —Ruth Ware, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Woman in Cabin 10&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our Little Secret&lt;/i&gt; is a twisted tale of love, pain, and revenge that will stay with the reader long after they turn the last page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say you never forget your first love. What they don’t say though, is that sometimes your first love won’t forget you…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A police interview room is the last place Angela expected to find herself today. It’s been hours, and they keep asking her the same inane questions over and over. “How do you know the victim?” “What’s your relationship with Mr. Parker?” Her ex’s wife has gone missing, and anyone who was close to the couple is a suspect. Angela is tired of the bottomless questions and tired of the cold room that stays the same while a rotating litany of interrogators changes shifts around her. But when criminologist Novak takes over, she can tell he’s not like the others. He’s ready to listen, and she knows he’ll understand. When she tells him that her story begins a decade before, long before Saskia was in the picture, he gives her the floor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A twenty-something young professional, Angela claims to have no involvement. How could she? It’s been years since she and H.P., Mr. Parker that is, were together. As her story unfolds, it deepens and darkens. There’s a lot to unpack… betrayal, jealousy, and a group of people who all have motives for retribution. If Angela is telling the truth, then who’s lying?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Two Truths and a Lie. The girls played it all the time in their tiny cabin at Camp Nightingale. Vivian, Natalie, Allison, and first-time camper Emma Davis, the youngest of the group. The games ended when Emma sleepily watched the others sneak out of the cabin in the dead of night. The last she—or anyone—saw of them was Vivian closing the cabin door behind her, hushing Emma with a finger pressed to her lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a rising star in the New York art scene, Emma turns her past into paintings—massive canvases filled with dark leaves and gnarled branches that cover ghostly shapes in white dresses. The paintings catch the attention of Francesca Harris-White, the socialite and wealthy owner of Camp Nightingale. When Francesca implores her to return to the newly reopened camp as a painting instructor, Emma sees an opportunity to try to find out what really happened to her friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet it's immediately clear that all is not right at Camp Nightingale. Already haunted by memories from fifteen years ago, Emma discovers a security camera pointed directly at her cabin, mounting mistrust from Francesca and, most disturbing of all, cryptic clues Vivian left behind about the camp's twisted origins. As she digs deeper, Emma finds herself sorting through lies from the past while facing threats from both man and nature in the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the closer she gets to the truth about Camp Nightingale, the more she realizes it may come at a deadly price.</description>

  <description>Viola's husband, Cecil, has shut the door behind him for the last time, and their four adult kids seem determined to send her to her grave with worrying. Paris always comes to everybody's rescue - although she doesn't have a clue as to how to save herself. Lewis keeps landing himself in jail. Charlotte knows she's gotten the short end of the stick for years and would just as soon divorce herself from them all. And Janelle is defensive about the course her life has taken. Meanwhile, Cecil has some ideas for taking his hard-working life into his own hands. With her hallmark exuberance and a cast of sassy, resilient characters, McMillan takes us deep into the hearts, minds, and souls of America.</description>

  <description>An exhilarating psychological suspense debut that will propel readers into the darkest edges of friendship, for fans of Fiona Barton, Clare Mackintosh, and Ruth Ware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were six university students from Oxford--friends and sometimes more than friends--spending an idyllic week together in a French farmhouse. It was supposed to be the perfect summer getaway...until they met Severine, the girl next door. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Kate Channing, Severine was an unwelcome presence, her inscrutable beauty undermining the close-knit group's loyalties amid the already simmering tensions. And after a huge altercation on the last night of the holiday, Kate knew nothing would ever be the same. There are some things you can't forgive. And there are some people you can't forget, like Severine, who was never seen again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a decade later, the case is reopened when Severine's body is found in the well behind the farmhouse. Questioned along with her friends, Kate stands to lose everything she's worked so hard to achieve as suspicion mounts around her. Desperate to resolve her own shifting memories and fearful she will be forever bound to the woman whose presence still haunts her, Kate will find herself buried under layers of deception with no one to set her free...</description>

  <description>In The Golem and the Jinni, a chance meeting between mythical beings takes readers on a dazzling journey through cultures in turn-of-the-century New York. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chava is a golem, a creature made of clay, brought to life by a disgraced rabbi who dabbles in dark Kabbalistic magic and dies at sea on the voyage from Poland. Chava is unmoored and adrift as the ship arrives in New York harbor in 1899. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahmad is a jinni, a being of fire born in the ancient Syrian desert, trapped in an old copper flask, and released in New York City, though still not entirely free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahmad and Chava become unlikely friends and soul mates with a mystical connection. Marvelous and compulsively readable, Helene Wecker's debut novel The Golem and the Jinni weaves strands of Yiddish and Middle Eastern literature, historical fiction and magical fable, into a wondrously inventive and unforgettable tale.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a wonderful novel and a joy to read. Chava, the golem, and Ahmad, the jinni, make for compelling characters and I became quite attached to them both. Set in 1899 in New York city, the Jewish and Syrian cultures are an integral part of the story. I like when I read a book and learn somethi...]]>

  <description>An epic and gripping tale of catastrophe and survival, The Passage is the story of Amy—abandoned by her mother at the age of six, pursued and then imprisoned by the shadowy figures behind a government experiment of apocalyptic proportions. But Special Agent Brad Wolgast, the lawman sent to track her down, is disarmed by the curiously quiet girl and risks everything to save her. As the experiment goes nightmarishly wrong, Wolgast secures her escape—but he can’t stop society’s collapse. And as Amy walks alone, across miles and decades, into a future dark with violence and despair, she is filled with the mysterious and terrifying knowledge that only she has the power to save the ruined world.</description>

  <description>Nice guys finish last, but that doesn’t mean they give up the fight. Sometimes it’s necessary to keep trudging through the rain in the hopes of finding a break in the clouds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Townson is a good person. He’s kind, considerate, and the last thing he ever wanted was to hurt anyone. Accidents happen though, and when they do, all that can be done is to pick up the pieces. For William, this means trying to hold together a stagnant relationship while resisting the temptation of Jason Grant, a young man with eyes just as intense as his love. Only the future can promise redemption for mistakes of the past, forcing William to choose between the Coast Guard and the needs of his heart. Can he find his way through the downpour to somewhere warm and dry?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something like Rain is the latest installment of the Something Like… series, bringing shape to another character’s life while checking in with those from previous books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Something Like... series:&lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Something Like Summer&lt;br /&gt;Book 2: Something Like Winter&lt;br /&gt;Book 3: Something Like Autumn&lt;br /&gt;Book 4: Something Like Spring&lt;br /&gt;Book 5: Something Like Lightning&lt;br /&gt;Book 6: Something Like Thunder&lt;br /&gt;Book 7: Something Like Stories – Volume One&lt;br /&gt;Book 8: Something Like Rain</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Love can appear unexpectedly: a chance meeting at a friend’s wedding, the arrival of a handsome new co-worker… or while being robbed at a convenience store.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some, love seems an impossible dream. Growing up gay in small-town Missouri, Jace Holden thought his chance would never come. When he meets Victor—a wild soul and fellow outsider—his chances of finding love go from bleak to a very uncertain &lt;i&gt;maybe&lt;/i&gt;. Bracing his heart, Jace chases after his desire, hoping for a warm hand to hold his tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Something Like Autumn&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of Jace’s life before the events of &lt;i&gt;Something Like Summer&lt;/i&gt;, while also revisiting his time with Benjamin Bentley.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;How far are you willing to go for Mister Tender?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At fourteen, Alice Hill was viciously attacked by two of her classmates and left to die. The teens claim she was a sacrifice for a man called Mister Tender, but that could never be true: Mister Tender doesn't exist. His sinister character is pop-culture fiction, created by Alice's own father in a series of popular graphic novels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a decade later, Alice has changed her name and is trying to heal. But someone is watching her. They know more about Alice than any stranger could: her scars, her fears, and the secrets she keeps locked away. She can try to escape her past, but Mister Tender is never far behind. He will come with a smile that seduces, and a dark whisper in her ear...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by a true story, this gripping thriller plunges you into a world of haunting memories and unseen threats, leaving you guessing until the harrowing end.</description>

  <description>HER PERFECT LIFE IS A PERFECT LIE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a teenager at the prestigious Bradley School, Ani FaNelli endured a shocking, public humiliation that left her desperate to reinvent herself. Now, with a glamorous job, expensive wardrobe, and handsome blue blood fiancé, she’s this close to living the perfect life she’s worked so hard to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ani has a secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s something else buried in her past that still haunts her, something private and painful that threatens to bubble to the surface and destroy everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a singular voice and twists you won’t see coming, Luckiest Girl Alive explores the unbearable pressure that so many women feel to “have it all” and introduces a heroine whose sharp edges and cutthroat ambition have been protecting a scandalous truth, and a heart that's bigger than it first appears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question remains: will breaking her silence destroy all that she has worked for—or, will it at long last, set Ani free?</description>

  <description>The legend begins...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greece in the age of heroes. Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the kingdom of Phthia to be raised in the shadow of King Peleus and his golden son, Achilles. “The best of all the Greeks”—strong, beautiful, and the child of a goddess—Achilles is everything the shamed Patroclus is not. Yet despite their differences, the boys become steadfast companions. Their bond deepens as they grow into young men and become skilled in the arts of war and medicine—much to the displeasure and the fury of Achilles’ mother, Thetis, a cruel sea goddess with a hatred of mortals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, the men of Greece, bound by blood and oath, must lay siege to Troy in her name. Seduced by the promise of a glorious destiny, Achilles joins their cause, and torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus follows. Little do they know that the Fates will test them both as never before and demand a terrible sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Built on the groundwork of the Iliad, Madeline Miller’s page-turning, profoundly moving, and blisteringly paced retelling of the epic Trojan War marks the launch of a dazzling career.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;FROM THE PUBLISHER OF&lt;i&gt; A MAN CALLED OVE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Himself&lt;/i&gt; presents the spellbinding tale of a lonely caregiver and a cranky hoarder with a house full of secrets. Packed with charming eccentricities, greedy heirs, unresolved disappearances, and a whole lot of heart,&lt;i&gt; Mr. Flood&lt;b&gt;'&lt;/b&gt;s Last Resort &lt;/i&gt;is a gripping mystery that examines the space between sin and sainthood, reminding us that the most important forgiveness we can offer is to ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maud Drennan is a dedicated caretaker, but her sunny, capable disposition and snappy quips mask a deep sadness. A tragic childhood event left her in the company of a cast of patron saints who pop in and out of her life like unwelcome tourists. She tries to find solace in her hard work in London...but then she meets the inimitable Mr. Flood.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A menace by all accounts, Cathal Flood is a widower living alone in a Gothic Dorset mansion crawling with collector’s items and feral cats. Stubborn as anything and an extreme hoarder, he has been battling his son’s attempts to move him into an old age home, and rumor has it he sent his last caretaker to the madhouse.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Maud is this insolent old man’s last chance: if she can help him get the house in order, he might be able to fend off the deportation. So the unlikely pair begin to cooperate, connecting over their shared love of folk tales and their suspicion of Gabriel, Cathal’s overbearing son. Still, shadows are growing in the cluttered corners of the mansion, hinting at buried family secrets, and reminding Maud that she doesn’t really know this man at all. When she starts poking around, the forgotten case of a missing local schoolgirl comes to light, and a full-steam search for answers begins.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Full of charming eccentricities, twisted comedy, a whole lot of heart, and Jess Kidd’s “lyrical, lush, and hugely imaginative” (&lt;i&gt;Sunday Express Magazine&lt;/i&gt;) prose, &lt;i&gt;Mr. Flood's Last Resort&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;is a mesmerizing tale that will make you re-examine the space between sin and sainthood, reminding you that when all is said and done, the most important forgiveness that we can offer is to ourselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A captivating debut novel for readers of Celeste Ng's &lt;i&gt;Everything I Never Told You&lt;/i&gt; and Curtis Sittenfeld's &lt;i&gt;Prep&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Most Dangerous Place on Earth&lt;/i&gt; unleashes an unforgettable cast of characters into a realm known for its cruelty and peril: the American high school.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an idyllic community of wealthy California families, new teacher Molly Nicoll becomes intrigued by the hidden lives of her privileged students. Unknown to Molly, a middle school tragedy in which they were all complicit continues to reverberate for her kids: Nick, the brilliant scam artist; Emma, the gifted dancer and party girl; Dave, the B student who strives to meet his parents' expectations; Calista, the hippie outcast who hides her intelligence for reasons of her own. Theirs is a world in which every action may become public: postable, shareable, indelible. With the rare talent that transforms teenage dramas into compelling and urgent fiction, Lindsey Lee Johnson makes vivid a modern adolescence lived in the gleam of the virtual, but rich with the sorrow, passion, and beauty of life in any time, and at any age.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;A lively, sexy, and thought-provoking East-meets-West story about community, friendship, and women’s lives at all ages—a spicy and alluring mix of &lt;em&gt;Together Tea&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Calendar Girls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Every woman has a secret life . . .&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nikki lives in cosmopolitan West London, where she tends bar at the local pub. The daughter of Indian immigrants, she’s spent most of her twenty-odd years distancing herself from the traditional Sikh community of her childhood, preferring a more independent (that is, Western) life. When her father’s death leaves the family financially strapped, Nikki, a law school dropout, impulsively takes a job teaching a "creative writing" course at the community center in the beating heart of London’s close-knit Punjabi community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of a miscommunication, the proper Sikh widows who show up are expecting to learn basic English literacy, not the art of short-story writing. When one of the widows finds a book of sexy stories in English and shares it with the class, Nikki realizes that beneath their white dupattas, her students have a wealth of fantasies and memories. Eager to liberate these modest women, she teaches them how to express their untold stories, unleashing creativity of the most unexpected—and exciting—kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more women are drawn to the class, Nikki warns her students to keep their work secret from the Brotherhood, a group of highly conservative young men who have appointed themselves the community’s "moral police." But when the widows’ gossip offers shocking insights into the death of a young wife—a modern woman like Nikki—and some of the class erotica is shared among friends, it sparks a scandal that threatens them all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Cassandra Bowden is no stranger to hungover mornings. She's a binge drinker, her job with the airline making it easy to find adventure, and the occasional blackouts seem to be inevitable. She lives with them, and the accompanying self-loathing. When she awakes in a Dubai hotel room, she tries to piece the previous night back together, already counting the minutes until she has to catch her crew shuttle to the airport. She quietly slides out of bed, careful not to aggravate her already pounding head, and looks at the man she spent the night with. She sees his dark hair. His utter stillness. And blood, a slick, still wet pool on the crisp white sheets. Afraid to call the police—she's a single woman alone in a hotel room far from home—Cassie begins to lie. She lies as she joins the other flight attendants and pilots in the van. She lies on the way to Paris as she works the first class cabin. She lies to the FBI agents in New York who meet her at the gate. Soon it's too late to come clean—or face the truth about what really happened back in Dubai. Could she have killed him? If not, who did?</description>

  <description>“A highly unusual tale set in a highly unusual Irish village full of dark secrets…Lushly imagined, delightfully original, and very, very funny, it hurtles along from the very first page” (M.L. Stedman, author of &lt;i&gt;The Light Between Oceans).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been abandoned on the steps of an orphanage as an infant, lovable car thief and Dublin charmer Mahony assumed all his life that his mother had simply given him up. But when he receives an anonymous note suggesting that foul play may have led to his mother’s disappearance, he sees only one option: to return to the rural Irish village where he was born and find out what really happened twenty-six years ago.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the moment he sets foot in Mulderrig, Mahony’s presence turns the village upside down. His uncannily familiar face and outsider ways cause a stir among the locals, who receive him with a mixture of excitement (the women), curiosity (the men), and suspicion (the pious).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Determined to uncover the truth about what happened to his mother, Mahony solicits the help of brash anarchist and retired theater actress Mrs. Cauley. This improbable duo concocts an ingenious plan to get the town talking about the day Mahony's mother disappeared and are aided and abetted by a cast of eccentric characters, both living and dead.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Himself &lt;/i&gt;is a simmering mixture—a blend of the natural everyday and the supernatural, folklore and mystery, and a healthy dose of quintessentially Irish humor. The result is a darkly comic crime story in the tradition of a classic Irish trickster tale, complete with a twisting and turning plot, a small-town rife with secrets, and an infectious love of language and storytelling that is a hallmark of the finest Irish writers.</description>

      <![CDATA[Thanks to a review I read on Goodreads which piqued my interest I went ahead and purchased "Himself". I'm so glad that I did! Darkly humorous, part ghost story, part murder mystery, and so much more. This is an amazing, brilliantly written, and magical novel. ]]>

  <description>The last person Alice Shipley expected to see since arriving in Tangier with her new husband was Lucy Mason. After the accident at Bennington, the two friends—once inseparable roommates—haven’t spoken in over a year. But there Lucy was, trying to make things right and return to their old rhythms. Perhaps Alice should be happy. She has not adjusted to life in Morocco, too afraid to venture out into the bustling medinas and oppressive heat. Lucy—always fearless and independent—helps Alice emerge from her flat and explore the country. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But soon a familiar feeling starts to overtake Alice—she feels controlled and stifled by Lucy at every turn. Then Alice’s husband, John, goes missing, and Alice starts to question everything around her: her relationship with her enigmatic friend, her decision to ever come to Tangier, and her very own state of mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tangerine&lt;/i&gt; is a sharp dagger of a book—a debut so tightly wound, so replete with exotic imagery and charm, so full of precise details and extraordinary craftsmanship, it will leave you absolutely breathless.</description>

      <![CDATA[This may not be for everyone but I very much enjoyed this novel. It is definitely reminiscent of "The Talented Mr. Ripley" and this comment by Joyce Carol Oates is spot on: "As if Donna Tartt, Gillian Flynn, and Patricia Highsmith had collaborated on a screenplay to be filmed by Hitchcock—suspens...]]>

  <description>This is almost a love story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellis and Michael are twelve when they first become friends, and for a long time it is just the two of them, cycling the streets of Oxford, teaching themselves how to swim, discovering poetry, and dodging the fists of overbearing fathers. And then one day this closest of friendships grows into something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then we fast forward a decade or so, to find that Ellis is married to Annie, and Michael is nowhere in sight. Which leads to the question, what happened in the years between?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is almost a love story. But it's not as simple as that.</description>

  <description>Lauren Groff is a writer of rare gifts, and &lt;i&gt;Florida&lt;/i&gt; – her first new book since her ‘clear the ground triumph’ &lt;i&gt;Fates and Furies&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;) – is an electrifying, expanding read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a decade ago, Groff moved to her adopted home state of Florida. The stories in this collection span characters, towns, decades, even centuries, but Florida – its landscape, climate, history and state of mind – becomes their gravitational centre. Storms, snakes and sinkholes lurk at the edge of everyday life, but the greater threats and mysteries are of a human, emotional and psychological nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Groff’s evocative storytelling and knife-sharp intelligence first transport the reader, then jolt us alert with a crackle of wit, a wave of sadness, a flash of cruelty, as she writes about loneliness, rage, family and the passage of time. With shocking accuracy and effect, Groff pinpoints the moments and decisions and connections behind human pleasure and pain, hope and despair, love and fury – the moments that make us alive. Vigorous, startling, precise and moving, &lt;i&gt;Florida&lt;/i&gt; is a magnificent achievement.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A dazzling new novel of friendship and redemption in the face of tragedy and loss set in 1980s Chicago and contemporary Paris, by the acclaimed and award-winning author Rebecca Makkai&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1985, Yale Tishman, the development director for an art gallery in Chicago, is about to pull off an amazing coup, bringing an extraordinary collection of 1920s paintings as a gift to the gallery. Yet as his career begins to flourish, the carnage of the AIDS epidemic grows around him. One by one, his friends are dying and after his friend Nico's funeral, he finds his partner is infected, and that he might even have the virus himself. The only person he has left is Fiona, Nico's little sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty years later, Fiona is in Paris tracking down her estranged daughter who disappeared into a cult. While staying with an old friend, a famous photographer who documented the Chicago epidemic, she finds herself finally grappling with the devastating ways the AIDS crisis affected her life and her relationship with her daughter. Yale and Fiona's stories unfold in incredibly moving and sometimes surprising ways, as both struggle to find goodness in the face of disaster.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;A gripping domestic page-turner full of shocking reveals, &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;perfect for fans of Liane Moriarty, Amanda Prowse and Kerry Fisher.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small suburb of Pleasant Court lives up to its name. It's the kind of place where everyone knows their neighbours, and children play in the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabelle Heatherington doesn't fit into this picture of family paradise. Husbandless and childless, she soon catches the attention of three Pleasant Court mothers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ange, Fran and Essie have their own secrets to hide. Like the reason behind Ange's compulsion to control every aspect of her life. Or why Fran won't let her sweet, gentle husband near her new baby. Or why, three years ago, Essie took her daughter to the park - and returned home without her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As their obsession with their new neighbour grows, the secrets of these three women begin to spread - and they'll soon find out that when you look at something too closely, you see things you never wanted to see.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A warm, funny, and whip-smart debut novel about rebellious youth, inconceivable motherhood, and the complications of belonging—to a city, a culture, and a family—when none of them can quite contain who you really are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of us were refugees of the nuclear family&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;. . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-three-year-old artist Andrea Morales escaped her Midwestern Catholic childhood—and the closet—to create a home and life for herself within the thriving but insular lesbian underground of Portland, Oregon. But one drunken night, reeling from a bad breakup and a friend’s betrayal, she recklessly crosses enemy lines and hooks up with a man. To her utter shock, Andrea soon discovers she’s pregnant—and despite the concerns of her astonished circle of gay friends, she decides to have the baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decade later, when her precocious daughter Lucia starts asking questions about the father she’s never known, Andrea is forced to reconcile the past she hoped to leave behind with the life she’s worked so hard to build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A thoroughly modern and original anti-romantic comedy, &lt;em&gt;Stray City&lt;/em&gt; is an unabashedly entertaining literary debut about the families we’re born into and the families we choose, about finding yourself by breaking the rules, and making bad decisions for all the right reasons.</description>

  <description>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe has neither the look nor the voice of divinity, and is scorned and rejected by her kin. Increasingly isolated, she turns to mortals for companionship, leading her to discover a power forbidden to the gods: witchcraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When love drives Circe to cast a dark spell, wrathful Zeus banishes her to the remote island of Aiaia. There she learns to harness her occult craft, drawing strength from nature. But she will not always be alone; many are destined to pass through Circe's place of exile, entwining their fates with hers. The messenger god, Hermes. The craftsman, Daedalus. A ship bearing a golden fleece. And wily Odysseus, on his epic voyage home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is danger for a solitary woman in this world, and Circe's independence draws the wrath of men and gods alike. To protect what she holds dear, Circe must decide whether she belongs with the deities she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.</description>

  <description>A young British couple are driving through France on holiday when they stop for gas. He runs in to pay, she stays in the car. When he returns her car door has been left open, but she's not inside. No one ever sees her again. &lt;p&gt;Ten years later he's engaged to be married; he's happy, and his past is only a tiny part his life now. Until he comes home from work and finds his new wife-to-be is sitting on their sofa. She's turning something over in her fingers, holding it up to the light. Something that would have no worth to anyone else, something only he and she would know about, because his wife is the sister of his missing first love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more and more questions are raised, their marriage becomes strained. Has his first love somehow come back to him after all this time? Or is the person who took her playing games with his mind?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I hadn't read any of Anthony Horowitz's novels until "Magpie Murders," which I loved. And he did it again with this one! A very fun mystery novel to read, with Anthony Horowitz as the actual narrator. Very well done and I'm looking forward to his next book!]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ken Follett is known worldwide as the master of split-second suspense, but his most beloved and bestselling book tells the magnificent tale of a twelfth-century monk driven to do the seemingly impossible: build the greatest Gothic cathedral the world has ever known.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything readers expect from Follett is here: intrigue, fast-paced action, and passionate romance. But what makes &lt;i&gt;The Pillars of the Earth&lt;/i&gt; extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Librarian's note: See alternate cover edition &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34668808-the-pillars-of-the-earth" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[What an incredible story! Who would have thought a novel that centers on the building of a cathedral in the 1100's could be so gripping and exciting. I was a bit intimidated by the 900+ pages but I'm so glad I read it. ]]>

  &lt;strong&gt;#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt; • &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The haunting true story of the elusive serial rapist turned murderer who terrorized California during the 70s and 80s, and of the gifted journalist who died tragically while investigating the case—which was solved in April 2018.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Introduction by Gillian Flynn •&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt; Afterword by Patton Oswalt&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more than ten years, a mysterious and violent predator committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before moving south, where he perpetrated ten sadistic murders. Then he disappeared, eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives in the area.&lt;p&gt;Three decades later, Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, was determined to find the violent psychopath she called "the Golden State Killer." Michelle pored over police reports, interviewed victims, and embedded herself in the online communities that were as obsessed with the case as she was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll Be Gone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;—the masterpiece McNamara was writing at the time of her sudden death—offers an atmospheric snapshot of a moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a portrait of a woman’s obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. Utterly original and compelling, it has been hailed as a modern true crime classic—one which fulfilled Michelle's dream: helping unmask the Golden State Killer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This book is brilliant. Stephen King pretty much said it all in regard to it being "true crime" but so much more. Brilliant. Wish the author could see how much her work is appreciated. What makes the book even more engaging is getting to know Michelle McNamara a little bit. Or maybe more than tha...]]>

  <description>On a day that begins like any other, Hal receives a mysterious letter bequeathing her a substantial inheritance. She realizes very quickly that the letter was sent to the wrong person—but also that the cold-reading skills she’s honed as a tarot card reader might help her claim the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, Hal finds herself at the funeral of the deceased…where it dawns on her that there is something very, very wrong about this strange situation and the inheritance at the centre of it.</description>

  <description>Set in the days of civilization's collapse, &lt;i&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of a Hollywood star, his would-be savior, and a nomadic group of actors roaming the scattered outposts of the Great Lakes region, risking everything for art and humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One snowy night a famous Hollywood actor slumps over and dies onstage during a production of &lt;i&gt;King Lear&lt;/i&gt;. Hours later, the world as we know it begins to dissolve. Moving back and forth in time—from the actor's early days as a film star to fifteen years in the future, when a theater troupe known as the Traveling Symphony roams the wasteland of what remains—this suspenseful, elegiac, spellbinding novel charts the strange twists of fate that connect five people: the actor, the man who tried to save him, the actor's first wife, his oldest friend, and a young actress with the Traveling Symphony, caught in the crosshairs of a dangerous self-proclaimed prophet.</description>

  <description>Alaska, 1974.&lt;br /&gt;Unpredictable. Unforgiving. Untamed.&lt;br /&gt;For a family in crisis, the ultimate test of survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ernt Allbright, a former POW, comes home from the Vietnam war a changed and volatile man. When he loses yet another job, he makes an impulsive decision: he will move his family north, to Alaska, where they will live off the grid in America’s last true frontier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen-year-old Leni, a girl coming of age in a tumultuous time, caught in the riptide of her parents’ passionate, stormy relationship, dares to hope that a new land will lead to a better future for her family. She is desperate for a place to belong. Her mother, Cora, will do anything and go anywhere for the man she loves, even if it means following him into the unknown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, Alaska seems to be the answer to their prayers. In a wild, remote corner of the state, they find a fiercely independent community of strong men and even stronger women. The long, sunlit days and the generosity of the locals make up for the Allbrights’ lack of preparation and dwindling resources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as winter approaches and darkness descends on Alaska, Ernt’s fragile mental state deteriorates and the family begins to fracture. Soon the perils outside pale in comparison to threats from within. In their small cabin, covered in snow, blanketed in eighteen hours of night, Leni and her mother learn the terrible truth: they are on their own. In the wild, there is no one to save them but themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this unforgettable portrait of human frailty and resilience, Kristin Hannah reveals the indomitable character of the modern American pioneer and the spirit of a vanishing Alaska―a place of incomparable beauty and danger. The &lt;i&gt;Great Alone&lt;/i&gt; is a daring, beautiful, stay-up-all-night story about love and loss, the fight for survival, and the wildness that lives in both man and nature.</description>

  <description>Bombay, 1921: Perveen Mistry, the daughter of a respected Zoroastrian family, has just joined her father's law firm, becoming one of the first female lawyers in India. Armed with a legal education from Oxford, Perveen also has a tragic personal history that makes her especially devoted to championing and protecting women's rights. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistry Law is handling the will of Mr. Omar Farid, a wealthy Muslim mill owner who has left three widows behind. But as Perveen goes through the papers, she notices something strange: all three have signed over their inheritance to a charity. What will they live on if they forefeit what their husband left them? Perveen is suspicious. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Farid widows live in purdah: strict seclusion, never leaving the women's quarters or speaking to any men. Are they being taken advantage of by an unscrupulous guardian? Perveen tries to investigate and realizes her instincts about the will were correct when tensions escalate to murder. It's her responsibility to figure out what really happened on Malabar Hill, and to ensure that nobody is in further danger.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;You know Konrad from your various social feeds – sun kissed, gym ripped and always having a better time than you. Or is he?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Konrad Platt needed to get out of town. Heartbroken after his boyfriend left him for another man, Konrad abandoned his life in London for the warm sun and blue surf of LA. Here he attends parties in the Hollywood Hills filled with handsome men and beautiful women, snorts mountains of Adderall, and dances the weekends away at Coachella with each move endlessly documented on social media. He mends his broken heart through dating apps, constantly scrolling through profiles and chatting with a seemingly endless supply of men, each one handsomer than the next. But when one captures his heart, a twisted modern romance takes root that’s thrilling, confusing, and devastating – revealing that underneath this perfectly curated profile is a man desperate for real connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Into? North Morgan shines a coolly mesmerizing light on the modern generation of gay men that are living firmly outside the closet, freed from the shadow of AIDS and elevated by popular culture, but plagued by a new set of problems, insecurities and self-destructions. As the men of Into? swipe right from bed to bed, North Morgan spins a darkly hilarious, and shockingly perceptive story of excess and love that’s like nothing you’ve ever read.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;My name is Amber Reynolds. There are three things you should know about me:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;1. I’m in a coma.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;2. My husband doesn’t love me anymore.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;3. Sometimes I lie.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amber wakes up in a hospital. She can’t move. She can’t speak. She can’t open her eyes. She can hear everyone around her, but they have no idea. Amber doesn’t remember what happened, but she has a suspicion her husband had something to do with it. Alternating between her paralyzed present, the week before her accident, and a series of childhood diaries from twenty years ago, this brilliant psychological thriller asks: Is something really a lie if you believe it's the truth?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A slow-burning romance and a chilling mystery bind two singular men in the suspenseful first book of a new Victorian series from K. J. Charles.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lodging-house keeper Clem Talleyfer prefers a quiet life. He’s happy with his hobbies, his work—and especially with his lodger Rowley Green, who becomes a friend over their long fireside evenings together. If only neat, precise, irresistible Mr. Green were interested in more than friendship...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rowley just wants to be left alone—at least until he meets Clem, with his odd, charming ways and his glorious eyes. Two quiet men, lodging in the same house, coming to an understanding... it could be perfect. Then the brutally murdered corpse of another lodger is dumped on their doorstep and their peaceful life is shattered.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now Clem and Rowley find themselves caught up in a mystery, threatened on all sides by violent men, with a deadly London fog closing in on them. If they’re to see their way through, the pair must learn to share their secrets—and their hearts.</description>
