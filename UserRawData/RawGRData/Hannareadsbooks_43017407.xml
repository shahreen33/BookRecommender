  <description>Travis King is the worst kind of asshole with good looks and enough confidence to last two lifetimes.&lt;br /&gt;Viola Fisher is a goodie two shoes know-it-all who prefers fictional love stories over her own.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing they have in common is their mutual hatred for each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s had a secret crush on him since she was ten, but Travis has always made it very clear the feelings aren’t mutual. He’s cruel, crass and takes every opportunity to get under Viola’s skin. She’s smart, beautiful, and too good to be true. Hating him is her religion, but needing her is his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Viola loathes his very existence, against her better judgment she let him into her bed. Her sexy curves and filthy smart mouth make Travis want her even more and although she’s succumbed to his manwh*re ways, she’s determined to not let that change a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Too bad he has other plans.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viola’s always been off-limits, but Travis is determined to keep crossing that line. She can try to push him away, but he always gets what he wants and he’ll do anything to prove he’s done playing games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until then, they’ll play by their own rules to see who will win the biggest battle yet—love or hate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Checkmate.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Wedding bells are the last thing on twenty-two year old Riley Bishop’s mind, but that’s exactly what he hears after waking up in Vegas next to a woman he just met—his new wife. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He never saw her coming, but she might be worth the risk.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zoey Mitchell is high on life, free spirited, and adventurous. However, learning she married a rowdy cowboy after a night of partying is not what she expected—even for her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;She’s risking it all, gambling with her heart.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Deciding to give their instant marriage a chance, Zoey moves from her big city life to a small town Texas ranch. She has to know if their connection is based on more than just a wild one-night stand before announcing to her family that she got hitched. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One moment changes everything—&lt;i&gt;for better or worse&lt;/i&gt;—and a secret could destroy them both. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**This is a full-length stand-alone novel in the Circle B Ranch series and a spin-off from the Bishop Brothers series. You don’t need to read any of the other books beforehand to enjoy this one!**&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Of all the men on the Icehome beach, Thrand's the most competitive and most aggravating. He's cocky. Arrogant. Turns everything into a rivalry. He's a pain in the you know what. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He also keeps insisting that I kiss him. After all, I'm the one that told him a kiss didn't mean anything. It shouldn't. A kiss is just a kiss as far as humans are concerned. But Thrand's a clone, a race of people called a'ani, and he's been brought up to play hard and to win. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And he wants to win me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But does Thrand want me for the right reasons? Or am I just another conquest?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;It's hard to make friends with the other women at the Icehome camp when you'd rather be dissecting the local fauna. Which is why I'm surprised when one of the big, brawny islanders asks me to help him make a prosthetic leg. I don't know N'dek, but since I'm a scientist, he wants my help. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;And while I'm more into dinosaurs than anatomy, I love a challenge!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we work together, I come to see that N'dek's not just clever and determined, he's also protective and sweet. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;And he kisses like a fiend!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's a distraction I don't need... but he might be everything I've ever wanted. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Too bad he says he's going to resonate to someone else...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>All I want is Hannah. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've resonated, but she avoids me. She has made it very clear that she wants no mate, whether he has two arms or four. But when others leave the Icehome beach camp for a getaway to a fruit-filled cave, Hannah wants to go, and she needs a companion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, we talk...and I realize my female isn't as good as ignoring me as she thinks. She watches me with hungry eyes. She blushes at my bold words. When I touch her? She no longer runs away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is time I show her that a Strong Arm hunter can be the right mate for her, and that four arms can hold her twice as closely as two.</description>

  <description>I’ve had a full life: wife, mom, divorcee…and then alien property. All of that’s changing now that I’m on the ice planet. Here, I’m free again, and I’ve found love once more. Vaza’s older and a widower, but he knows how to make a woman smile both in the furs and out of them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone around me has a baby in their arms or in their belly, though, and it’s hard to be the only one without. I love nothing more than being a mama…and when I hear there’s an orphan at the Icehome camp, I want to adopt him. Vaza and I have so much love to give, but will an alien baby love us back? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Psst! This story does not stand alone. Start with LAUREN’S BARBARIAN! You’ll be glad you did!)&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Resonance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s a given on the ice planet, forced upon you by the parasitic symbiont called the ‘khui’. With resonance, a guy and a girl are paired up because they’ll make great babies. It’s a survival mechanism necessary for this sparsely-populated world we’re stranded on… and romantic, in a weird, alien way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone expects resonance to happen when twenty newcomers are dropped onto the frosty world. I doubt anyone expects the gorgeous, golden god named Ashtar to resonate to someone like me, though. He’s fierce. Flirty. Powerful. Disgustingly handsome. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m… not any of those things. I’m bland. Boring. Clumsy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But resonance seems to think we’d be great together. And Ashtar does, too… &lt;br /&gt;___ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Icehome&lt;/i&gt; series features all of the adventure, humor and community you’ve come to expect in the &lt;i&gt;Ice Planet Barbarians&lt;/i&gt; series, but it stands on its own. You do not need to read the other series (or be caught up) in order to read VERONICA’S DRAGON. I do recommend reading LAUREN’S BARBARIAN to get the full experience. Enjoy!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Beast. Creature. Monster. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dangerous.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All of these things have been said about Gren. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Willa doesn’t believe it, though. She knows that monsters can sometimes come in appealing packages. She knows that for all of his snarls and fearsome appearance, he’d never hurt her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And she knows she has to get Gren away from the Icehome camp, because no one will ever see him as a person, not when he attacks all who come close. Not when he’s tied and treated like an animal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s going to save him… or fall in love. Maybe both. Willa doesn’t mind that he’s a beast, as long as he’s &lt;b&gt;*her*&lt;/b&gt; beast.</description>

  <description>A lush, tropical island on an icy planet makes no sense. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then again, not much makes sense anymore after waking up and finding myself not in bed but on a strange world populated by aliens. Since that moment, I’ve learned that nothing is normal anymore and I’ve got to roll with the punches. I can handle this, though. I’m strong and capable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So… washed up on a tropical island? Got it handled. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Separated from the others in my group? Handled. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Stranded alone with a brutal but delicious alien man that can’t speak English but has great… ahem… body language? Yup, handled. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Add in the fact that my cootie – a symbiont I need to survive – has chosen my big, hulking alien friend as my fated mate? Let’s just say that the situation isn’t the only thing that’s going to be handled. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it isn’t long before I learn that the tropical island paradise is a death trap and we’re all in grave danger, aliens and humans alike. To survive this, I'll need my tempting guy to give me a hand with the situation… good thing he's got four of them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;This romance features all of the adventure, humor and community you’ve come to expect in the &lt;i&gt;Ice Planet Barbarians&lt;/i&gt; series, but it stands on its own. You do not need to read the other series (or be caught up) in order to read LAUREN'S BARBARIAN.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>My life is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swore I would never work at the whiskey distillery with my last name on it, that I would never be a part of my father’s legacy. But when I graduated with my art degree and realized there were no jobs, the devil appeared, and I sold my soul, agreeing to work in the family business if he’d give me the art studio I’d always dreamed of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can’t be that bad, I thought. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I realized my new boss was Logan Becker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Becker brothers have a reputation for being trouble, and since I love trouble, it’s no surprise to me that I’m infatuated by that forbidden fruit the first day I walk into the distillery. That lean, whiskey-eyed, too-hot-for-his-own-good man hates me — and I can’t blame him. His family has been at war with mine for decades, and for good reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beckers and the Scooters are the Montagues and Capulets of Stratford, Tennessee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if he’s Romeo, and I’m Juliet? Well… we all know how that story ends — and for that reason, I tell myself to steer clear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because if my father finds out I’m falling for Logan Becker, my life actually will be over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Logan’s will be, too.</description>

  <description>Marlene's not like the other humans. They weep while she smiles. They look at us with fear, while she entices me with a come-hither look. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I...have no idea why such a bold female resonated to a male like me. I am the most reticent of all the sa-khui tribe, a hunter that never expected to have a family of my own. But resonance chooses, and it has chosen her for me. And Marlene is quite determined to seduce me…and who can say no to such a woman? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This story explores the long-awaited romance of Marlene and Zennek. Even though it is a ‘flashback’ to the beginning of the Ice Planet Barbarians series, it can be read out of order. Enjoy!</description>

  <description>My tribesmates don’t understand her. The other humans think she’s weak. But no one knows my mate like I do. They don’t see her gentle heart or her brave spirit. I know why she struggles. I know how strong she is. And I know I’ll do anything to make her smile. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But can I convince her that she can be happy in this strange new world with me? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This story explores the long-awaited romance of Ariana and Zolaya. Even though it is a ‘flashback’ to the beginning of the &lt;i&gt;Ice Planet Barbarians&lt;/i&gt; series, it can be read out of order.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The growing barbarian tribe is about to celebrate No-Poison Day – a time of love, laughter, and gifts. But all Elly wants is for her mate to be at her side before the brutal season arrives. All Bek wants is a way to quickly return to his female despite the mountains between them. Thanks to the talents of a newcomer… they're both about to get their wish and celebrate the happiest of holidays together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This novella features characters from prior &lt;i&gt;Ice Planet Barbarians&lt;/i&gt; stories and DOES NOT stand alone.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>It should have been a one-night stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never intended to seduce Taushen, but things happened. I don't dwell on the past and while it was great, I'm not looking for a relationship. Of course, try telling that to Taushen. The big blue alien's in love after one night, and it's making things darn awkward. We've got bigger problems than whether or not I'm his woman, like the ‘cargo’ of the space ship that landed here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Taushen's not giving up. He thinks I'm his mate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he'll do anything to keep me.</description>

  <description>Bad day? Try mine on for size. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogue slavers have landed on the ice planet and captured the tribe. The only ones not snatched? Me, a walking human motormouth with no skill except that of incoherent babbling, and Warrek, who's as silent as he is attractive. Two more unlikely people have never been paired together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now we're supposed to form a rescue team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saving the others is either going to bring us closer together - or drive us completely apart. I'm pretty sure the feelings I'm having for my alien companion are as unrequited as they are inappropriate, but since we aren't going to make it out alive, what harm is one teeny, tiny kiss?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knew that one kiss could change everything?</description>

  <description>You'd think a tall woman would fit in on a planet of seven-foot-tall aliens, but even on the ice planet, I'm still a weirdo and an oddity. I'm everything all the other cute, dainty human women aren't. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One guy in particular - the alien Harrec - is determined to embarrass me by pretending he's interested. He's a jokester that flirts like mad and hits on me constantly just to make me feel foolish. He gets under my skin. He makes me so frustrated I want to scream. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a side-trip to a glacier turns into a nightmare and the two of us are forced to survive alone, I see another side to the enticing blue alien. Even with no one else around, his compliments keep coming and I start wondering if the attraction between us... is real.</description>

  <description>I might be the only unmated female in my tribe, but it doesn’t mean I’ve given my heart. I’m waiting. I want resonance, and I won’t settle for anything less. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when an alien ship lands and a handsome stranger steps out, I know he’s the one. His name’s Mardok and he’s fascinatingly different – and distractingly appealing. But Mardok can’t stay on the ice planet, and he says he can take me with him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, I must make a choice. Do I stay and lose my mate forever? Or do I follow him to the stars and leave behind everything I know?</description>

  <description>Seasons ago, I resonated to the quietest of tribesmates, a male content to love me from afar while I was the center of attention. We could have been happy. Despite our differences, I loved him and he loved me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But then a terrible thing happened…and my world was never the same again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now resonance is giving us a second chance, but…I’m afraid. What if what I have with my mate is too broken to be fixed? What if there’s no hope left for us at all?</description>

  <description>On the day the world shook, everything changed for the barbarian tribe. This short story goes back to the event and gives additional insight. How do Rukh and Harlow fare through the disaster? How does the chief handle the destruction of everything he’s ever known? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This one of the &lt;i&gt;Slice of Life Short Stories&lt;/i&gt; and intended to be read after &lt;i&gt;Barbarian’s Taming&lt;/i&gt;. It is NOT a stand alone. It is, however, intended to provide extra character insight for those who want to visit the ice planet for a little bit longer.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>I knew within moments of meeting Mason Holt that he would change my life forever. &lt;br /&gt;I just didn’t realize how much. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my world spirals out of control, he continues to stay by my side, protecting and taking care of me. Being &lt;i&gt;just friends&lt;/i&gt; is all he’s been able to offer, that is until both of our lives are threatened. Now that our relationship is blossoming into something more, I can’t be what &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; needs even if I wished I could. &lt;br /&gt;Bad timing strikes again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I think we can finally be together, someone threatens to tear us apart. I’m not the same girl Mason met three years ago, but I’m determined to fight for what I’ve always wanted—&lt;i&gt;him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**This is book 2 in the Mason &amp;amp; Sophie duet and must be read after Truly Mine. Recommended for ages 18+** &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Calm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One morning, gentle Maylak wakes up and feels a sense of oncoming dread. As the tribe's healer, it is her job to ensure that everyone is safe, happy, and healthy... and they are. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So what can be threatening her people?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moving Day&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Farli helps move Maddie into the new 'girls' cave while avoiding some prospective suitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;These are two &lt;i&gt;Slice of Life Short Stories&lt;/i&gt; set in the ICE PLANET BARBARIANS series and do not stand alone. They should be read &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; BARBARIAN'S TOUCH and are a little bit of sweetness and family life for those waiting for the next full book release.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Newly-mated (and grudge-holding) Liz wants nothing more than to be away from the tribe that’s exiled her man. Raahosh wants to prove to Liz that he can be a good mate, even if he’s ugly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On a honeymoon, they can get to know each other better. Perfect, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This story is an extended epilogue for book 2 of &lt;i&gt;Ice Planet Barbarians&lt;/i&gt; – &lt;i&gt;Barbarian Alien&lt;/i&gt; – and is for readers who want a little more of their favorite couple. Don’t start here! Start with book 1, &lt;i&gt;Ice Planet Barbarians&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The night we met in the dimly lit bar, she looked like a brunette bombshell, and I wanted to learn her deepest secrets. With sun-kissed skin and soulful bedroom eyes, she was pure temptation, and I was mesmerized. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one drink led to two, I craved more of her playful banter and taunting lips. Resisting her wasn’t an option, and we quickly became a desperate mess of tangled limbs and hot kisses. She tasted like the sweetest sin, but I was no saint. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we caught our breaths, and it became obvious that meeting her wasn’t a coincidence, everything changed. Now I must deny her at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;𝐹𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑠. It’s all we can ever be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of lying to myself and keeping her at a distance, I want to pull her close. Sophie’s on my mind more than ever as my instincts to protect her take over. Regardless of my attempts to help, she pushes me away and makes it clear she doesn’t need me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll do whatever it takes to keep her safe, to show her I’m the good guy, but one night takes a tragic turn for the worse when her boyfriend and I start throwing punches. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;𝘈𝘯𝘥 𝘦𝘯𝘥𝘴 𝘸𝘩𝘦𝘯 𝘐’𝘮 𝘢𝘳𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘥 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘮𝘶𝘳𝘥𝘦𝘳.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**TRULY MINE is an angsty, slow-burn, friends to lovers romance wrapped up in a tragically beautiful love story. It's book 1 in the Mason &amp;amp; Sophie duet and must be read before Truly Yours.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Troy Brennan&lt;/b&gt;Every Southie in Boston knows that name. The son of a dead mobster. The heart-throb with steel-blue eyes. "The Fixer" who can make or break you in this city. Oh, and my new husband. &lt;b&gt;Sparrow Raynes &lt;/b&gt;That's me. No one seemed to remember my name up until he barged into my life. But then he caged me. Kidnapped me. And killed every chance I had to run away from the place where we grew up. Put simply, Troy Brennan clipped my wings. I have dreams, big ones, but I doubt he'll ever let me chase them. I have no idea why he decided to take me as his wife. But I do know this: pissing off this man will not do me any good. At all. &lt;b&gt;Sparrow is an Amazon international bestseller.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The highly anticipated conclusion to the Something in the Way series, a forbidden love saga.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lake&lt;br /&gt;It was a hot summer day when I met him on the construction site next to my parents' house. If I’d known then what I do now, would I have kept on walking? Manning was older, darker, experienced—and I’d trusted him when he said the story would only ever be about us. I’d held those words close and challenged fate, but I had lost.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A part of me is still that sixteen-year-old girl squinting up at Manning, but no matter how far I fall or high I soar, I’ll always be a bird without her bear and nothing without him.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Manning&lt;br /&gt;When I close my eyes, I can no longer see her. The decisions I made were to push Lake in the right direction—away from me. But now that she’s gone, would I have made those same choices?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’d walked away like I was supposed to. I’d kept my distance. I’d bent over backward to keep Lake pure, but she’s no longer that girl, and I don’t know if I can stay away anymore. I only know I don’t want to. She’s still everything I want and nothing I should ever have, but if anyone can move the stars, it’s her great bear in the sky.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An epic, three-book saga of forbidden love coming 2017.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a hot summer day when I met him on the construction site next to my parents’ house. Under the sweat and dirt, Manning Sutter was as handsome as the sun was bright. He was older, darker, experienced. I wore a smiley-face t-shirt and had never even been kissed. Yet we saw something in each other that would link us in ways that couldn’t be broken...no matter how hard we tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved Manning before I knew the meaning of the word. I was too young, he said. I would wait. Through all the carefully-chosen words hiding what we knew to be true, through his struggle to keep me innocent, and through infinitely-starry nights—I would wait. But I’d learn that life isn’t always fair. That no matter how much you achieve, none of it matters if you suffer the heartbreak that comes with falling for someone you can never have. Because even though I saw Manning first, that didn’t matter. My older sister saw him next.</description>

  <description>Hail to the king, and watch him reign, this game was somewhat fun, until the finale came… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now we’re here, with carnage and despair, and the only questions left to answer, are the ones that do not appear... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A king loses a war, and a swan sheds her wings, chaos collides with peace, as the crows begin to sing… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enter if you dare, because I swear the end is near, but nothing is as it seems, and everything is so bare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So what the hell is going on at Riverside, &lt;br /&gt;I think, I think... everyone is about to die....</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Note from the author&lt;/b&gt;: Evermore is a &lt;i&gt;bonus&lt;/i&gt; story that revisits Four and Ever from The Peer and the Puppet. It should be enjoyed only after reading The Moth and the Flame, the second novel in the When Rivals Play series. Evermore is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; an official part of the series and is not a required reading to continue the series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In plain terms, Evermore is NOT a standalone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Grab your dancing shoes and put on your prettiest dress. It's prom season in Blackwood Keep and forever can't wait any longer!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four Archer was the toughest girl around. Just ask anyone. She's the street racing daredevil who brought the King of Brynwood Academy to his knees. But watching her boyfriend fawn over his childhood playmate--even though it was just an act--would be her toughest challenge yet. When jealousy rears its ugly head, Four questions if she can handle playing the sideline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever McNamara has the world at his fingertips, but not even a private jet and a seven-figure trust fund can get him out of this rock and a hard place. When a childhood pact puts their fairytale in peril, Ever must risk it all to keep her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evermore is a 15K bonus novella following the events of The Moth and the Flame. It is strongly advised that you read The Peer and the Puppet and The Moth and the Flame before diving in. Content suitable for 18+.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Total control. I need it in every aspect of my life. Some would say that makes me an asshole. A freak. But as long as everything’s exactly how I want it, I’m completely flexible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m kidding. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Okay, I’m not kidding. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lacey needs someone in her life who’s bigger and scarier than her demons, and she wants that man to be me. Her boss. The Viking in a suit.I hope she understands what she’s getting into. This daddy isn’t going to pat her on the head and tell her she’s a good girl for nothing. Especially not when she’s spinning out of control. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Author's note: this book includes depictions of eating disorder recovery.</description>

  <description>Noah Becker is nothing but trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's what Mama told me when I was a kid, kicking his pew in church and giggling at the games we’d play. It's what the town said when his father died and the Becker brothers went wild. And it's on repeat in my mind the day I walk into the whiskey distillery where he works to buy a wedding gift for my fiancé.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's trouble. &lt;br /&gt;Dirty, sweaty, rude trouble. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how many times I repeat it, I can't escape Noah in our small Tennessee town. And the more I run into him, the more he infuriates me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because he sees what no one else does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He sees me—the real me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The me I'm not sure I'm allowed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm Ruby Grace Barnett, the mayor's daughter. Soon to be a politician's wife, just like Mama and Daddy always wanted. Soon to fulfill my family's legacy, just like I always knew I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the boy everyone warned me about makes me question everything, like whether the wedding I'm planning is one I even want. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone says Noah Becker is nothing but trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only I had listened.</description>

  <description>The worst day of my life happened when Brandon died. &lt;br /&gt;We had our entire future mapped out. &lt;br /&gt;Careers, marriage, kids—in that order. &lt;br /&gt;Then the universe threw a curveball and ended it all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I come to terms with everything, I learn I’m carrying his baby. Now I’m living with his roommate, the guy who’s made my life a living hell the past two years. Hunter’s now the one to hold me up when all I want to do is fall. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing my religious parents will never accept the pregnancy out of wedlock, Hunter offers to be my fake husband. While I think he’s gone crazy, it’s the only plan that’ll keep them in my life. So I do whatever it takes to make our relationship believable—kissing, touching, even letting him hold me when we sleep. The lines are so blurred neither of us want to admit we’re no longer pretending. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guilt of what we’re doing eats me alive as I struggle to deal with my emotions. I push him away, but he pulls me closer, showing me how he’s always felt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as I begin to follow my heart, I learn Hunter’s been keeping secrets.&lt;br /&gt;And I’m left to make the hardest decision of my life…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**This is book 2 in the Hunter &amp;amp; Lennon duet and must be read after Baby Mine. Recommended for ages 18+**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THE FLAME&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here lies Louchana Valentine. She was a homeless, orphaned virgin.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never cared what my gravestone would say until I landed in deep with a powerful gangster. Lucky for me, my best friend happens to be ruthless too. I should feel guilty that he’s forced to turn on the man who’s been a father to him. Except I’ve always known that Wren’s soul wasn’t as black as he claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was good.&lt;br /&gt;He was beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;He was mine.&lt;br /&gt;He just didn’t know it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with Wren keeping me safe, I’ve got time left to rewrite the end of my story. But if he has his way, &lt;i&gt;virgin&lt;/i&gt; is already carved in stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE MOTH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve never known anyone as alluring as Lou. Or as frustrating. Since the night she saved my life and stole my wallet for her troubles, I couldn’t stay away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She became my onus.&lt;br /&gt;My light.&lt;br /&gt;My…anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With nowhere to run, I’m forced to trust someone I never expected. At least with Lou safe in Blackwood Keep—&lt;i&gt;far&lt;/i&gt; away from me—I’ll die with my conscience intact. Because she no longer looks at me with friendship in her eyes. Those iridescent blues shine with a different need entirely, and I’ve never been able to deny her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Moth and the Flame returns to the world of Blackwood Keep, rival gangs, and deliciously flawed yet completely addicting characters! This second installment in the When Rivals Play series is a continuation of the events that occurred in The Peer and the Puppet. &lt;/b&gt; Content suitable for ages 18+.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Dear Jerk Across the Street, sorry for accidentally walking in on you and catching an eyeful of your—equipment. And hard pass on the open invitation to join you in the shower “anytime”, A-hole.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That’s the note I should’ve written. Instead I sent a pleasant and apologetic version. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Had I known Phoenix “Nix” Russo would’ve been the neighbor from hell, I’d have told him right where he could shove my words. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nix is the big man on campus with everyone lined up at his games to make sure he knows it. Sure, he’s got piercing blue eyes, abs that don’t quit and a smile that could set fire to a set of panties from a hundred yards away, but he’s also the biggest pain in my ass.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear Pink-Haired Menace, learn how to take a joke and stop being such a kill-joy...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elle Masterson called the cops on one of my parties—again. My sweet talking usually gets me out of trouble, but this time it got me into a nice pair of silver handcuffs. Now I’m on a reputation rehab tour with a stop at a spring break community service project. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Guess who’s my new boss? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now we’re shoulder to shoulder, sweaty, tired and…she’s not anything like I expected. There might just be a heart under that hardass exterior. She’s invading my dreams and I can’t shake the feeling she’s the key to unlocking a piece of me that I’ve hidden away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s only a matter of time until she finds out why I’m really here.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe I can break through her walls and into her heart before that happens...one screw at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**&lt;i&gt;The Second We Met&lt;/i&gt; is a &lt;b&gt;standalone&lt;/b&gt; new adult romance**</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“How long do you last in bed?” Those were her first words to me, swiftly followed up with, “And how big would you say you are?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Persephone Alexander. Math genius. Lover of blazers. The only girl I know who can make Heidi braids look sexy as hell. And she’s on a mission. Lose her virginity by the end of the semester. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walked in on her interview session for potential candidates (who even does that?) and saw straight through her brave front. She’s got a list of Firsts to accomplish like she’s only got months to live. I’ve decided to be her guide for all her firsts except one. Someone’s got to keep her out of trouble. I have one rule, no sex. We even shook on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll help her find the right guy for the job. Someone like her doesn’t need someone like me and my massive...baggage for her first time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drinking at a bar. Check. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Partying all night. Double check. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skinny dipping. Triple check. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s unlike anyone I’ve ever met. The walls I’d put up around my heart are slowly crumbling with each touch that sets fire to my soul. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m the first to bend the rules. One electrifying kiss changes everything and suddenly I don’t want to be her first, I want to be her only. But her plan was written before I came onto the scene and now I’m determined to get her to re-write her future with me.</description>

  <description>I saw her first.&lt;br /&gt;Blonde. Gorgeous. Feisty.&lt;br /&gt;I was &lt;i&gt;smitten.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it didn’t matter because she chose him and he was my best friend and roommate. I’d never be able to compete with that, so I pushed her away instead. It was easy when she lived hours away, and I didn’t have to see her every day, but then she moved in with us. &lt;br /&gt;Now, I’m &lt;i&gt;screwed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To her singing in the shower every morning, dancing in the kitchen while she makes coffee, and doing yoga in our living room, I can’t stop thinking about her in all the wrong ways. She’s not mine and never will be, but that doesn’t stop me from wanting to push her against a wall and claim her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s constantly on me for making messes, bringing chicks home every weekend, and being a smartass when their PDA gets on my nerves. Considering neither of them know how I feel, it’s not fair for the way I act toward them. I should move out so I can get over her for good; however, the selfish part of me can’t let go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the unthinkable happens... &lt;br /&gt;When my best friend dies in a motorcycle accident, the two of us are left to grieve our loss together. Instead of pushing her away, I pull her closer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as we come to terms with our new reality, she finds out she’s pregnant with his baby. &lt;br /&gt;And I’m left to make the &lt;i&gt;hardest&lt;/i&gt; decision of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**BABY MINE is an angsty, emotional, slow-burn romance wrapped up in a heartbreakingly delicious love story. It's book 1 in the Hunter &amp;amp; Lennon duet of the Roommate Duet Series and must be read first.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;It’s been ten years.&lt;br /&gt;He hasn’t stopped loving her for one second. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing the woman who broke my heart a decade ago is something I’m not prepared for. Though I’ve forgiven Savannah, I’ve never forgotten what she did. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it’s time to confront the secret she’s kept from me. Though it won’t be easy, I’m determined to make things right between us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night together is all it takes for our feelings to come rushing back. As memories of us flood in, truths are finally revealed. When the present collides with our past, I’ll do anything to win her back, even when Savannah tries to run again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I’ll stop at nothing for a second chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**Forever Mine is a 35k word novella that introduces you to the Roommate Duet Series. It's suggested to read before Baby Mine, but can be read anytime throughout the series.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Cocky and self-assured, I’m confident when it comes to my skills both on stage and in the bedroom. Everything in my life is perfect, even if I am the last single man standing in our famed rock band. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it wasn’t always this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jayla knew me before I hit it big. Back when I was a skinny teen, chasing dreams without a penny to my name. Now she’s back in my life and so much more than the girl I remember. Fiercely loyal. Beautiful and badass. She walked out of my life before, and I won’t let that happen again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say some songs are better on the second take, and if there’s one thing I know for sure, this is our time for a replay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REPLAY is the final book in the Off Track Records novels, but can also be read as a standalone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REPLAY releases March 14, 2019&lt;br /&gt;BLOGGERS sign up hosted by Give Me Books: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/ReplayEVENTS" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://bit.ly/ReplayEVENTS&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Ren Makavoy is one season away from realizing his Major League dreams. Unfortunately, his bad-boy reputation off the field has landed him in hot water. Ren swears his days of drinking, brawling, and seducing starlets are over, but management sees fit to bring in PR to clean up his act. Determined to prove himself as a reputable catcher, his plans of playing along backfire when he comes face to face with the woman who shattered his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is the last hope of saving his reputation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And things are about to get a hell of a lot hotter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sinfully sexy second-chance romantic dramedy is a stand-alone and spinoff of The Balls in Play Series. Join the rest of the gang from Anything but Minor and Major Love for one last season of love, laughter, and baseball.</description>

  <description>Womanizer. &lt;br /&gt;Casanova. &lt;br /&gt;Heartbreaker. &lt;br /&gt;Skirt-chaser. &lt;br /&gt;And my personal favourite, Mr Steal Your Girl. &lt;br /&gt;I've been called them all. &lt;br /&gt;But still, the women keep on coming. &lt;br /&gt;And coming. &lt;br /&gt;Hundreds of women slide into my DM’s and I slide into their…well, I think you can see where I'm going with this. &lt;br /&gt;Men want to be me and women want to bed me. &lt;br /&gt;Despite what the bunny boilers of San Francisco call me, I go by the name of Buzz. &lt;br /&gt;I'm 6’4” and the proud owner of a six-pack, beard and too many tattoos to count. &lt;br /&gt;I’m a walking wet dream. &lt;br /&gt;For the longest time, I didn’t believe in love. I didn’t even believe in relationships. I couldn’t understand why anybody would willingly choose to have sex with only one person. &lt;br /&gt;Until I met Lori. &lt;br /&gt;She turned my entire world upside down and made me feel things which I didn’t even know I was capable of. But when I couldn’t deal with her career as a honey trapper, I lost her. &lt;br /&gt;But now I want her back. &lt;br /&gt;And I always get what I want. &lt;br /&gt;It’s lucky that I found her again. &lt;br /&gt;It’s unlucky that she has a new boyfriend. &lt;br /&gt;Unlucky for him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***Although Buzz can be read as a standalone, it is advised to read The Honey Trap first as it provides some background to Buzz and Lori's story. The Honey Trap is currently free in Kindle Unlimited.*** &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Second Chance Romance. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Captive. Pet. Lover. Pawn…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darkness lives inside Damir Ravnikar, and that darkness craves one thing: me. Rich, ruthless, and handsome as sin, Damir’s promised me the world to make up for my life’s myriad disappointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But his promise comes with a price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damir intends to use me to hunt down his double-crossing brother. With every jewel, every kiss, I can feel myself losing my morals, my freedom and even my sanity. Because darkness lives inside me, too. He’s laying my deepest secrets bare, and there’s nothing I can do to stop him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Bethany, and I’ve fallen into the lap of luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AUTHOR'S NOTE: Contains dark romantic themes. This book is NOT a standalone and is intended to be read after COME TO DADDY. No cliffhanger.</description>

  <description>Shayla Perkins isn’t the kind of girl who makes the same mistake twice, especially when it comes to Sean “Stitch” Molina. So when he gives her the world’s biggest rejection, that’s it—she’s done. Until the sexy, silent, unavailable Sean makes Shay a very personal offer. Of course, it still doesn’t mean he’s interested in her. Or does it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean has done things in life. Bad things. And he’s paid the price. All he wants now is to make up for his past by doing good in the present. And no one deserves more good than Shay. Beautiful on the inside and out, Shay is the kind of woman who should be cared for and protected—especially from a man like Sean. He’s tried to keep his feelings for her in check, but a single, reckless impulse pulls them closer than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon the two are sharing their biggest dreams and satisfying their deepest desires. But what will happen if the only way to truly give one another want they want most . . . is to let each other go?</description>

  <description>Greed. Jealousy. Lust.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It all started with a bloody palm and a promise. Words beneath the moonlight that I thought would keep us together. Forever.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Deceit. Betrayal. Vengeance.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t see it coming. I didn’t think you had it in you. But what was supposed to bury me—break me—simply remade me as something new. Something hellbent on ruining you, my love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;*This book is a complete stand-alone based on the classic The Count of Monte Christo*&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>If I closed my eyes, I could still see them—all blonde sunshine, ocean-blue eyes, and long limbs. The glint of Lake’s gold bracelet. Pink cotton candy on Tiffany’s tongue. My scenery may have changed from heaven to hell, but some things never would: my struggle to do right by both sisters. To let Lake soar. To lift Tiffany up. The sacrifices I made for them, I made willingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A better man would’ve walked away by now, but I never claimed to be any good. I only promised myself I’d keep enough distance. If I’d learned one thing from my past, it was that love came in different forms. You could love passionately, hurt deep, die young. Or you could provide the kind of firm, steady support someone else could lean on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lake was everything I wanted, and nothing I could ever have. I was nobody before I knew her and a criminal after. The way to love her was to let her shine—even if it would be for somebody else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Book two in the Something in the Way series.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My dick never got me in half as much trouble as my heart...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were high school sweethearts. I was head over heels for her and no one could tell me we weren’t going to last forever. College? Going pro? My family’s money? None of it mattered. She was all I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she ripped my heart out. But I’m not going to let that happen again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s back. Invading my life and acting like she was the wronged one. The pain is still there, but I can’t keep my eyes off her. I can’t stop thinking about her and how much was left unsaid between us. Being this close is making me question everything I thought I knew about her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time everything will be on my terms. Everything…</description>

  <description>Reed Sanders knew the first time he saw the neighbor girl in second grade that she was the one. He even stole his mom’s ring to seal the deal, but he got into trouble for doing it. It’s okay, though, because he knows that one day she’s going to be his wife and he’ll keep giving her the ring until then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cami Evans fell in love with the boy next door when she was seven years old. They spent their whole lives falling for one another until one day she’s taken from him. She spends five years with her father in a cult until she’s able to make her escape and find her way back to Reed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Can true love happen when you’re just a kid? According to Alexa Riley it can! Fall head over heels for this ultra-sweet story of how childhood sweethearts find their way back to one another.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An irresistibly steamy college sports romance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heath Taylor. Laid back. Easy going. Fastest guy on two skates and chill to a fault, at least that’s what they say. Until Kara. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three nights together and I’m done for. Her laugh, her smile, the way my hand curves around her waist. She’s the one. Not a doubt in my mind...until I walk into my last class of the semester. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kara, the woman of my dreams, is my new instructor. My hockey season and her career prospects are on the line. One false move--if anyone finds out--we’re both sunk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the ice I’m a beast that can’t be stopped, but thoughts of her are throwing me off my game. My fingers itch to feel her in my arms again. But risking everything could ruin what we’ve worked so hard for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life has a way of changing the best laid plans. And sometimes you can’t stay away no matter the promises you make...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My first crush. My first heartbreak. My brother’s best friend.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The butterflies in my stomach turned into full blown eagles the second our lips touched. A kiss under the stars that changed our relationship forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a lifetime of wishing, I stared up into Ford’s eyes with his fingers caressing my cheek and my heart racing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The evening ended with my heart bleeding on the ballroom floor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He destroyed my heart two years ago...but now he wants back in my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I won’t fall under his spell. I’ll resist his sexy, scruffy beard, and panty-melting smirk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was over him. Hell, I fully planned to wave to him through my rearview mirror...but with one text, in the middle of the night, I know I'm in over my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ford: I need you.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A deliciously steamy enemies with benefits romance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Declan McAvoy. Voted Biggest Flirt. Highest goal scorer in Kings of Rittenhouse Prep history. &lt;br /&gt;Everyone’s impressed, well except one person…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a blow out in high school, Makenna Halstead and I were happy to never have to cross paths again. Except life has a way of knocking you straight in the teeth with a puck when you least expect it. She hasn’t just returned to my life, she crashed into it like a wrecking ball...into my college kingdom, into my class, and smack dab into the seat next to mine. My new lab partner to be exact. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years we hated each other... I may be King on the ice, but she is the Ice Queen. She has no problem calling me out, doesn’t back down, and her piercing blue eyes have me picturing more than than just my arms wrapped around her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we’re stuck with each other and there’s no getting around that fact that we have to work together. My hockey career hangs in the balance. Problem? Oh, yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t deny it. I want her. More than I ever thought I could want a woman. I’ve got one semester–only four months–to convince her everything she thought about me was wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will my queen let me prove to her I’m the King she can’t live without? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one way to find out...</description>

  <description>A STANDALONE second chance, enemies to lovers romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;My dick never got me in half as much trouble as my heart...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were high school sweethearts. I was head over heels for her and no one could tell me we weren’t going to last forever. College? Going pro? My family’s money? None of it mattered. She was all I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she ripped my heart out. But I’m not going to let that happen again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s back. Invading my life and acting like she was the wronged one. The pain is still there, but I can’t keep my eyes off her. I can’t stop thinking about her and how much was left unsaid between us. Being this close is making me question everything I thought I knew about her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time everything will be on my terms. Everything…</description>

  <description>Daniel Black married the woman of his dreams in a whirlwind of love. She’s his entire world and sometimes he’s a little too obsessed with his wife. So when he discovers their marriage license has been deleted from the state’s records, he loses his mind. Someone in their lives is trying to sabotage his relationship with his one and only, and he’ll burn down the city to find out who it is. The only good thing about it is that now he can give his wife the wedding of her dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blakely loves her husband and everything about their lives. The one thing she can’t seem to make work is her relationship with her father and her stepmother. She tries her best but it’s not good enough, and when they find out that her marriage to Daniel is invalid they jump at the chance for her to finally be rid of him. If there’s one thing she won’t do, it’s give up the man who worships the ground she walks on. She’ll marry him all over again, but will they support her decision?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Look, it’s Christmas, so we went full-on cheese-fest. This hero is hands down one of the craziest we’ve ever written and he’s so obsessed it’s scary. But during the most wonderful time of the year, isn’t that just perfect? Light up a yule log and cuddle up with this precious quickie!</description>

  <description>Prolific Artist. Prima ballerina. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They burned up the Broadway stage together in his stunning debut, &lt;i&gt;Lady in Red&lt;/i&gt;. Now, Zachary Coen and Wilhelmina Allende are household names. They’ve risen to fame. Fallen in love. Bonded over pain and passion for their art. They're partners in life, but perform on separate stages, and it’s the art sometimes that keeps them apart. This Christmas, they’re leaving their big city island behind for a magical isle in the heart of Paris. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s time to rekindle the flame that’s been there from the start, the one that was sparked three years ago on the loggia of the Opera Garnier…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;**Warning: this is fluffy. Full of fluff. The cheesiest of cheese. I'm talking mousse-like levels, like the filling of a French cheesecake. (Yum!) So if high drama is what you're looking for, read their angsty, slow burn of a love story, Pas De Deux: A Dance For Two. Consider this an extended epilogue, set at Christmastime.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Jackson Howell was tall, dark, handsome- and the single most annoying person I'd ever met. Our fathers were best friends, but that didn't mean a thing to us. It seemed like he lived to prank me, and I always responded with anger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first day of preschool, he'd dumped a pail of sand down the back of my favorite yellow dress. In tenth grade, he started a rumor that I had a virginity pact with Jesus. It took almost the whole year for someone to tell me why no guys ever looked at me. It wasn't that I wanted to date anyone, but it would've been nice not to be avoided like the plague.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I moved back to our hometown after college, I was ready to turn over a new leaf where Jackson was concerned. It was time to deal with the feelings I had for him. He wasn't hard to find. Within hours of my return he was serenading me with Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up at the Olive Garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later that night I turned over the Wheel of Fortune card... and Madam Aria explained that Jackson Howell was my destiny.</description>

  <description>The move to World Cup Academy of Gymnastics is the greatest challenge Adrianna has encountered. Punished for Coach Kova's overwhelming desires, she's reeling with resentment while she sits out the first meet of the season. As Adrianna fights to regain her focus, he pushes her body to the extreme, leaving her mentally and physically exhausted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kova underestimates Adrianna's endurance, and gravitates more toward her, despite his internal battle raging within to stay away. They try to disentangle themselves, but the tension between coach and gymnast mounts, engulfing them both in a forbidden world of deception and passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one place where they should never feel alive, is where they find complete absolution. But one slip, one wrong landing, a missed grip, and everything they built can come tumbling down, damaging both their professional and personal lives.</description>

  <description>Cover Reveal: March 12, 2019&lt;br /&gt;Release: March 21-25, 2019&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s how long I was able to stay away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ignore the call back home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could’ve stayed away longer. Could’ve stayed away forever, but I came back for someone who’s now gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving me alone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it’d be safe. That I’d be okay back in a city that’s always felt more like my prison, but then he took notice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noah Kincaid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tormentor, my first crush. My devil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he’s not only after me. Something was taken from him. Something he requires my help with to get back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six years ago, I left this city unscathed by the man who ruled my teenage angst. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now? I don’t think I’ll be as lucky.</description>

  <description>Never trust a man who gets paid to take off his clothes for a living and then uses it as a pick-up line to get girls in bed with him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That should’ve been enough for me to call in sick that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve worked with male cover models like him before and they’re all the same—smooth-talking, sexy as sin, egotistical know-it-alls who think they’re God’s gift to women—all traits I know to steer clear of. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assisting authors comes with many perks—reading on the job, using my organizing skills on a daily basis, drinking coffee by the gallons—but Maverick Kingston barges into my life and demands more than I can handle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we’re forced to road trip across the country together, he pushes every boundary I have and rearranges my thoughts on playing it safe. And when he “accidentally” drops his towel, he makes it very clear what he’s offering and proves he’s packing more than abs of steel under his clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working with him was brutal, but falling for him was unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;And playing by the rules will be impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**This is a complete STANDALONE novel — filled with plenty of humor, steam, &amp;amp; romance! 18 &amp;amp; up only due to explicit sexual content, language, and adult content.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Alena is a princess, and with that comes responsibility. Like marrying the giant caveman King Roman, who looks more like a warrior than a ruler. Everything about him is intense. Especially the way he looks at her. But she's been promised to him, and there's no way out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roman took one look and made up his mind. Princess Alena will be his and no one will stop him from taking her. Everything about her belongs to him now, and waiting one week for a wedding isn't going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This beast of a man might just claim his princess before she has a chance to say "I do."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning: Oh, this is good. It's so, so good. Trust us.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Dove Wheeler doesn’t have many friends. The only one she ever got close to left her to go live with a vampire. Even thinking the word gives her chills, but in the best way possible. She spends hours in the library researching who they are and where they come from, until she can’t stand it any longer and goes looking for them on her own. What she doesn’t expect is to find two of them, a set of twins, that turn her world upside down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once Ezra and Erik Marcellus were changed to vampires, they tried to put everything in their past behind them and start fresh. They love their new family and everything about their new lives, but there’s always the worry that one day they will have to separate. Vampires don’t share their mates, so why does it feel like that’s exactly what they want? When they find a young woman snooping around, suddenly all of their fears come true. They’re both ready to lay their claim, but they’re not prepared for which one she’ll choose.</description>

  <description>Loren River doesn’t understand why her father ever adopted her. All he does is keep her locked up and hidden away from what he calls his “business.” She’s spent most of her life alone and she’s desperate to make friends and have a family of her own. What’s so wrong with wanting to fall in love and become a mom? But life has its own plans for her when she gets caught between her father and a man so dark and deadly she can’t look away. Could the feelings she’s having be more than just fear? Could they possibly be desire, too? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bishop Thorin is worried about the threat to his territory in the city. There’s a rogue vampire on the loose and it’s trying to tear apart all that he’s built. He’s got the weight of the world resting on his shoulders and he needs to fix this. But when a young redhead steps in his way, all that he thought was lost is right in front of him. Can he take away her prison just to give her another?</description>

She hasn’t had her chance to shine, and she’s ready to prove to everyone that she’s not made of glass. When the specter of a slayer comes to their city, she wants to be the one to take him out. But what happens when that’s exactly who she falls for? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valley Sterling is from a long line of men who hunt vampires. It’s not the life he dreamed of as a child, but what else is he supposed to do? He has a legacy to continue and nothing will get in his way…until Ravana is the one to block his path. Can he give up everything he’s ever known for the woman who is supposed to be his enemy?</description>

  <description>Juliet Simon gets herself into all kinds of situations, but breaking into the scary mansion near her college campus has got to take the cake. When she finds more than she bargains for behind closed doors, will her fear take over, or will she fall for the beast? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kane Viscardi is unlike other vampires. He’s spent most of his time hiding away and is alone in the world without a mate. Until one night when there’s an unexpected knock at the door. Suddenly something awakens inside of him for the first time in a century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: It’s the first time we’ve written vampires, so go easy on us. Enjoy this brand new series that features a coven of five and read about how all of them find love.</description>

  <description>Nora Vaughn is living on the streets and trying to keep under the radar. Luck is on her side one day when the hot stranger she’s been watching drops his keycard and she’s able to get into a safe place. What she doesn’t expect is for him to find her naked in the shower and demanding she repay what she’s stolen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smith Prescott is a well-known judge who has worked his entire life to build a reputation. But one look at the young woman in front of him and he’s willing to throw it all away to have her. She’s forcing his hand and his iron will to do the things he’s sworn against. But what’s the point of having all this power if he can’t use it to have her? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This is quick and dirty and dripping with filth. If you love our books Coach, Mechanic, Thief, and Kingpin, then this one will give you all the feels you’re after. Enjoy some quality time in the judge’s chambers.</description>

  <description>Fall in love with my teenage crush - tick &lt;br /&gt;Propose to him on a leap year - tick &lt;br /&gt;Receive a sad look and a whispered 'we can't' - tick, tick, tick. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Austin Hart was my first everything–crush, love, and heartbreak. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven years ago, he broke me to pieces and when my world imploded two years later, I stupidly fell back into his bed, seeking comfort only he could give. Accepting that we would never be together, I left Monroe and let him become a distant memory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years later an opportunity I can’t refuse forces me to make the long trip back to Monroe. &lt;br /&gt;And Monroe means seeing Austin again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d be lying if I said the years haven’t been good to him. He’s undeniably sexy, smoldering, and he still makes my heart flutter regardless of how much I want to dislike him. My body may still react, but my mind will never forget. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I promised myself I’d never fall under his spell again, he has other plans— and the universe has even bigger ones.</description>

  <description>After Kova’s devastating betrayal, Adrianna must become her own champion and place her Olympic dream ahead of all else. In doing so, she ignores the warning signs as both the extreme training and unending heartbreak begin to take their toll. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no atoning for what Kova did. The vow he made cannot be undone. With boundaries set and lines clearly defined, Kova will now have to be the one to relinquish control in order to regain Adrianna’s trust. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the dynamics shift between coach and gymnast, nothing can prepare them for the agonizing truth that is to come. Fighting for a dream becomes only half the battle when Adrianna’s fate is sealed, leaving them both with their biggest challenge yet.</description>

  <description>Lauren brought light to the darkness that haunted my soul, giving me the breath of life I didn’t know existed. Monsters like me don’t deserve the peace she brings, but she doesn’t think I’m the demon I was raised to be. I’ve fooled her as I’ve fooled my father. &lt;br /&gt;But my Dad is onto me, my poker face threatening to break. &lt;br /&gt;He can sense the hitch in his plan, &lt;br /&gt;But he’s hooked, &lt;br /&gt;And his intuition hasn’t stopped him from plotting the ultimate goal. &lt;br /&gt;Riley is ready to use Lauren as the bait my father desperately desires, &lt;br /&gt;But I can’t. &lt;br /&gt;I won’t. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve fallen too hard, &lt;br /&gt;Too fast. &lt;br /&gt;Now I have a choice to make. &lt;br /&gt;Follow my heart and save only one, or shatter it to free many. &lt;br /&gt;Resisting the only love I’ve ever tasted might be harder than destroying the innocent. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Two season tickets. &lt;br /&gt;One genius idea. &lt;br /&gt;Zero interest in a relationship. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The plan is simple: a brand new, hot, preferably funny, definitely single male will fill one of those seats for every Bears game at Soldier Field. And I’ll fill the other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can’t think of a better way to use the season passes I’d bought for my ex-husband. I am a woman of plans, and this one’s foolproof. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until Zach Bowen offers to be my practice round. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s infuriating. Presumptuous and overbearing. And absolutely, undeniably gorgeous. Any woman with a heartbeat would be attracted to him, and mine picks up speed every time he speaks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But as I said, I’m a woman of plans — and I’m not backing down on this one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One night. One game. And then, his time’s up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He can try to change the rules, but here’s the truth: he can’t win if he’s playing the wrong game. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; The Wrong Game is a stand-alone, angsty, enemies-to-lovers sports romance. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>When I was a child he brought me back from the brink of death. Since that day I have borne his mark, a black star in the center of my left palm. The villagers say it brands me as evil. I think it means something far worse. It marks me as his.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The disease that nearly killed me has returned to the village and children are dying. I’m the only one who dares to climb the mountain and learn his secrets. In exchange I’m to clean his house and help with his strange experiments, but Meremon wants more. He wants me. And it isn’t long before I discover that his demands are as twisted as his experiments.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: This story is a dark fantasy romance with scenes of non-consent and dubious consent. Additionally, Meremon is a necromancer and enjoys unusual things. Some sex scenes might be strange or creepy for some readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always with Brianna Hale books, no cheating, and a guaranteed happily ever after. THE NECROMANCER’S BRIDE is a novella of 16,000 words.</description>

  <description>Permission is the conclusion of Grim and Emma Jean's story. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He was my first. &lt;br /&gt;But since then I’ve been programmed to enjoy torture. &lt;br /&gt;Being watched. &lt;br /&gt;Being taken two at a time. &lt;br /&gt;I feel nothing now. I’m empty. Hollow. Lost. &lt;br /&gt;He knows it. He knows I need more. &lt;br /&gt;So, he gives it to me. &lt;br /&gt;My body has never felt such pleasure. &lt;br /&gt;My heart has never endured such pain &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>I loved him first. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jake was my best friend in college-my very straight best friend, until one night he was more. He may have ran after what happened between us, but I never forgot him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When fate puts us in the same place, five years later, he has a fiance by his side. Carina is beautiful, driven, and draws my attention almost as much as he still does. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A game of truth or dare leads to a wild night and a relationship that has our feelings growing into something bigger than any of us intended. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But what happens when our feelings deepen? Can I handle being with two people? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If it means I can have him, I’ll love them both.</description>

  <description>Never trust a man who wears nothing more than a cowboy hat and ripped jeans who asks if you’d like to save a horse and ride a... well, you get the picture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That should’ve been enough for me to walk away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been warned on several occasions about southern men — with their sexy accents, charming manners, and the ability to easily get any woman in bed — which is something I’ll be avoiding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a professional photographer has many perks — traveling around the world, calling all the shots, and working with subject matter that isn’t bad to look at — but Colton Langston with his washboard abs and baby blue eyes, could care less about my current project. He’s trouble, I know it, and he’s determined to make me work for every single photo. When I’m forced into riding lessons, I get way more than I ever bargained for, and by the time my trip is over, I’m in too deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being with him was thrilling, but falling for him was unpredictable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And ignoring him will be impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**This is a complete STANDALONE novel — filled with plenty of humor, steam, &amp;amp; romance! 18 &amp;amp; up only due to explicit sexual content, language, and adult content.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Now available together for the first time, don't miss Opal and Origin, the third and fourth books in Jennifer L. Armentrout's bestselling Lux series. Also includes bonus content exclusive to the print edition! "A thrilling ride from start to finish," says RT Book Reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opal&lt;br /&gt;After everything, I’m no longer the same Katy. I’m different…and I’m not sure what that will mean in the end. When each step we take in discovering the truth puts us in the path of the secret organization responsible for torturing and testing hybrids, the more I realize there is no end to what I’m capable of. The death of someone close still lingers, help comes from the most unlikely source, and friends will become the deadliest of enemies, but we won’t turn back. Even if the outcome will shatter our worlds forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Origin&lt;br /&gt;Daemon will do anything to get Katy back. After the successful but disastrous raid on Mount Weather, he’s facing the impossible. Katy is gone. Taken. Everything becomes about finding her. But the most dangerous foe has been there all along, and when the truths are exposed and the lies come crumbling down, which side will Daemon and Katy be standing on? And will they even be together?</description>

  <description>They say your first kiss should be earned. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mine was stolen by a devil in a masquerade mask under the black Chicago sky. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say the vows you take on your wedding day are sacred. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mine were broken before we left church. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say your heart only beats for one man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mine split and bled for two rivals who fought for it until the bitter end. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was promised to Angelo Bandini, the heir to one of the most powerful families in the Chicago Outfit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then taken by Senator Wolfe Keaton, who held my father’s sins over his head to force me into marriage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say that all great love stories have a happy ending. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I, Francesca Rossi, found myself erasing and rewriting mine until the very last chapter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One kiss. &lt;br /&gt;Two men. &lt;br /&gt;Three lives. &lt;br /&gt;Entwined together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And somewhere between these two men, I had to find my forever.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Bestselling authors Brittainy C. Cherry and Kandi Steiner come together for the first time in an emotional compilation of poetry and prose. Written and collected over the course of more than two years, A Love Letter from the Girls Who Feel Everything is an intimate, honest, and raw assemblage of two women’s feelings in a modern world that often quiets any kind of emotion past indifference. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discussing themes of love, worth, loss and hope, A Love Letter from the Girls Who Feel Everything is a journey of discovery and healing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We are the girls who feel everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is our love letter. To you, to them, to us, to the world, to no one at all. Whether it’s the brightest, sunniest day where everything is perfect, or the darkest, dreariest night of rain where life seems unbearable — we have lived it, we have survived it, and we have felt every, blissful, aching second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s to embracing the feels, to the brave souls that listen to the way their hearts beat and aren’t afraid to ask someone else if they feel those same beats, too. Here’s to the girls, the boys, the love we sometimes share and the love we all-too-often conceal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And more than anything, Reader — here’s to you.”</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A stunning conclusion to the sci-fi romance duology by writing duo Krista &amp;amp; Becca Ritchie, &lt;i&gt;The Last Hope&lt;/i&gt; is filled with twists and turns you'll never see coming.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sacrifice all you have to survive.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imprisoned for weeks on an enemy starcraft, Franny, Court, and Mykal have sat with an unfathomable revelation. But as they fight to stay alive, escaping prison means trusting a young mysterious stranger. He knows everything about their lost histories, and when answers aren’t given freely, the bonded trio are forced to join a mission. One that will determine the fate of humanity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legend says, a baby—the first of her species—has the power to cloak and teleport planets. Tasked with retrieving the infant, Court fears the baby is just a myth, and if they fail, they’ll never find the truth about their origins. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Court and Mykal grow closer, their linked bond becomes harder to hide, and dynamics change when Franny begins to fall for someone new. Vulnerable and with no choice, the hunt for the baby sends the trio on a dangerous path to Saltare-1: a water world where their enemies can’t die and survival comes at a high cost.</description>

  <description>Evangeline Thorne is privileged. &lt;br&gt;Beautiful and popular, if not a little jaded. &lt;br&gt;A chance encounter with a green-eyed stuntman sets off a chain of events that turns her perfect, little world upside down.&lt;br&gt;Short on options and desperate for adventure, she joins the traveling carnival for the summer.&lt;br&gt;Thrust into a world full of drama, deception, and secrecy, Evangeline tries to find herself and protect her heart in the process. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sebastian McAllister is cursed.&lt;br&gt;He knows better than to think otherwise. &lt;br&gt;He’s content to live out the rest of his life traveling the country as one of the four Sons of Eastlake, seeking thrills the only way he knows how. &lt;br&gt;The one thing he doesn’t see coming is the spoiled blond with stars in her eyes. &lt;br&gt;The only problem is, the more time he spends with her, the more hope starts to stir in his dormant heart.&lt;br&gt;Too bad hope is a dangerous thing when you’re a McAllister.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=hs49d1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;

  <description>Bleu has been living an isolated life away from the clan of Gray Ridge. He’s a happy bear shifter, building furniture and being alone…until a little curvy woman literally crashes into his life. When he pulls her from her car after she wraps it around a tree, he is blindsided by the connection. Never before has he wanted a mate, but finding Lola changes all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lola didn’t plan on her deadbeat mom blowing the rent and then skipping town, so she’s without a home. Again. But this time it’s going to be different. Hearing whispers of shifters in Gray Ridge, she takes off in search of something, anything, that can bring some light to her life. When her car slips and she ends up in danger, she never expects her rescuer to be the one to give her everything she’s ever wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will being snowed in lead to steamy nights and mating bites? You betcha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This is a short shifter story filled with sweet, cheesy possessiveness and lots of growling. Obviously. Go ahead and read it. You know you want to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: This book was previously released in Kindle Worlds. It has now been re-covered with bonus material added and is now available on all Amazon platforms in the Kindle Unlimited program. &lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Written like your favorite drama television show, the Palm South University series has been called "a mix of Greek meets Gossip Girl with a dash of Friends." Follow seven college students as they maneuver unrequited love, teacher/student romance, the tangles of “no strings” relationships, love triangles and more. Each “season” has six “episodes,” and just like when your favorite show hits Netflix, you can read just one episode at a time or binge the entire thing. With the perfect mix of angst, emotional romance, and romantic comedy, the Palm South University series is your next guilty addiction. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drama. Lies. Sex. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Palm South University. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The weather isn’t the only thing heating up in South Florida. At a school where fraternities and sororities don’t exactly play by the rules, relationships are bound to be tested. Parties and sex are definitely key ingredients in the Palm South recipe, but what happens when family issues, secret lives, and unrequited love get tossed in the mix? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Follow Cassie, Bear, Jess, Skyler, Erin, Ashlei, and Adam as they tackle college at a small, private beach town university. Written in television drama form, each episode of this serial will pull you deeper and deeper into the world of PSU. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Where the sun is hot and the clothes are scarce, anything can happen.</description>

  <description>KANDY&lt;br /&gt;It was love at first sight when I met Mr. Cane.&lt;br /&gt;He was handsome, broody, tattooed, and rich. For years, he’s been mine. He just didn’t know it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t expecting to fall in love with him, or for him to want me in the ways that he did.&lt;br /&gt;None of it was ever supposed to happen, but after all we’ve done together, it’s too late to turn back now. A once harmless crush had blossomed into so much more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CANE&lt;br /&gt;When we first met, she was just a kid - my best friend’s daughter. A sweet, young girl with a big heart. But now, she’s a young woman who knows what she wants, and all she wants is me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve tried holding back, pretending the connection meant nothing, but my sweet candy cane made it impossible. If anyone finds out, I’ll be ruined. I’ve worked too hard to lose everything I’ve built. But there’s just something about her that tempts me, making me want to sacrifice just about anything to have her.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ISBN13: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48845486-the-hating-game" rel="nofollow"&gt;9780062439604&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nemesis (n.) 1) An opponent or rival whom a person cannot best or overcome.&lt;br /&gt;2) A person’s undoing&lt;br /&gt;3) Joshua Templeman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Hutton has always been certain that the nice girl can get the corner office. She’s charming and accommodating and prides herself on being loved by everyone at Bexley &amp;amp; Gamin. Everyone except for coldly efficient, impeccably attired, physically intimidating Joshua Templeman. And the feeling is mutual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped in a shared office together 40 (OK, 50 or 60) hours a week, they’ve become entrenched in an addictive, ridiculous never-ending game of one-upmanship. There’s the Staring Game. The Mirror Game. The HR Game. Lucy can’t let Joshua beat her at anything—especially when a huge new promotion goes up for the taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Lucy wins this game, she’ll be Joshua’s boss. If she loses, she’ll resign. So why is she suddenly having steamy dreams about Joshua, and dressing for work like she’s got a hot date? After a perfectly innocent elevator ride ends with an earth-shattering kiss, Lucy starts to wonder whether she’s got Joshua Templeman all wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Lucy Hutton doesn’t hate Joshua Templeman. And maybe, he doesn’t hate her either. Or maybe this is just another game.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;You know what they say: save a snare, bang a drummer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kay Fischer is well aware of what they say, and she intends to ignore it completely. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her first step into the world of music journalism ended with a screw-up so royal it deserved a crown, Kay’s been struggling to re-stack the building blocks of her career. Salvation comes in the form of Sherbrooke Station, the latest alt-rock craze to grace Montreal’s legendary music scene. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A front page feature on the band everyone’s talking about seems like a foolproof shot at success, even after Kay meets their drummer. Matt Pearson might have a smile sexy enough to be the eighth deadly sin and a passion for music so powerful it makes her heart ache, but Kay’s got things under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s a professional, goddammit, and a professional would not get tongue-tied over a source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A professional would not find herself opening her door at an hour long past midnight to pull said source inside and lead him to her bed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, that’s not at all what a professional would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Your Rhythm is part of the Sherbrooke Station Quartet, a series of steamy rock star standalones from author Katia Rose. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Morgan is just looking to have a fun spring break until her workaholic mom brings along her new boyfriend. But when she ditches the two of them she ends up lost in a swamp, ankle deep in mud, and facing down a gator the size of Godzilla. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rixen has been praying for God to send him his angel, his rightful mate who will live with him in the swamp and bear his children. When he finds the strawberry-blonde beauty before him in danger, he doesn’t hesitate to save her. Then claim his reward. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Okay, so, um, this is amazing terrible. This is so over the top, it’s on top of over the top. This book is on the level of ridiculous that surpasses all our stunts before this. You know what happens when we team up with Jessa Kane…but this is hands down the best/worst we’ve ever done. And we’re so proud we could wrestle a gator. Spoiler: There’s a lot of animal wrestling ahead. Grab your overalls and bug spray, we’re going in the bayou.</description>

  <description>From bestselling author L.J. Shen, comes a new, &lt;b&gt;standalone&lt;/b&gt;, contemporary romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should have been easy.&lt;br /&gt;I needed the money. He needed a babysitter to keep him from snorting himself to death.&lt;br /&gt;I was cherry-picked especially for him. Responsible. Optimistic. Warm. Innocent.&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that I should have known better.&lt;br /&gt;Alex Winslow. British rock star. Serial heartbreaker. Casanova with whiskey eyes.&lt;br /&gt;“Don’t get near the devil in a leather jacket. He’ll chew you up and spit you out.”&lt;br /&gt;Guess what? I didn’t listen.&lt;br /&gt;I signed the contract.&lt;br /&gt;World tour. Three months. Four Continents. One hundred shows.&lt;br /&gt;My name is Indigo Bellamy, and I sold my soul to a tattooed god.&lt;br /&gt;Problem was, my soul wasn’t enough for Alex Winslow. He ended up taking my body, too.&lt;br /&gt;Then he took my heart.&lt;br /&gt;Then he took my all.</description>

  <description>Not all love stories are written the same way. Ours had torn chapters, missing paragraphs, and a bittersweet ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luna Rexroth is everyone’s favorite wallflower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Caring.&lt;br /&gt;Charitable.&lt;br /&gt;Quiet.&lt;br /&gt;Fake.&lt;br /&gt;Underneath the meek, tomboy exterior everyone loves (yet pities) is a girl who knows exactly what, and who, she wants—namely, the boy from the treehouse who taught her how to curse in sign language.&lt;br /&gt;Who taught her how to laugh.&lt;br /&gt;To live.&lt;br /&gt;To love.&lt;br /&gt;Knight Cole is everyone’s favorite football hero.&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;Athletic.&lt;br /&gt;Rugged.&lt;br /&gt;Popular.&lt;br /&gt;Liar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This daredevil hell-raiser could knock you up with his gaze alone, but he only has eyes for the girl across the street: Luna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Luna is not who she used to be. She doesn’t need his protection anymore.&lt;br /&gt;When life throws a curveball at All Saints’ golden boy, he’s forced to realize not all knights are heroes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, the greatest love stories flourish in tragedy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From USA Today and Washington Post bestselling author L.J. Shen comes an intense, high school enemies-to-lovers romance with a twist.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Penn&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say revenge is a dish best served cold. &lt;br /&gt;I’d had four years to stew on what Daria Followhill did to me, and now my heart was completely iced. &lt;br /&gt;I took her first kiss. &lt;br /&gt;She took the only thing I loved. &lt;br /&gt;I was poor. &lt;br /&gt;She was rich. &lt;br /&gt;The good thing about circumstances? They can change. Fast. &lt;br /&gt;Now, I’m her parents’ latest shiny project. &lt;br /&gt;Her housemate. Her tormentor. The captain of the rival football team she hates so much. &lt;br /&gt;Yeah, baby girl, say it—I’m your foster brother. &lt;br /&gt;There’s a price to pay for ruining the only good thing in my life, and she’s about to shell out some serious tears. &lt;br /&gt;Daria Followhill thinks she is THE queen. I’m about to prove to her that she’s nothing but a spoiled princess. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Daria&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone loves a good old unapologetic punk. &lt;br /&gt;But being a bitch? Oh, you get slammed for every snarky comment, cynical eye roll, and foot you put in your adversaries’ way. &lt;br /&gt;The thing about stiletto heels is that they make a hell of a dent when you walk all over the people who try to hurt you. &lt;br /&gt;In Penn Scully’s case, I pierced his heart until he bled out, then left it in a trash can on a bright summer day. &lt;br /&gt;Four years ago, he asked me to save all my firsts for him. &lt;br /&gt;Now he lives across the hall, and I want nothing more than to be his last everything. &lt;br /&gt;His parting words when he gave me his heart were that nothing in this world is free. &lt;br /&gt;Now? Now he is making me pay. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Evan Bishop is your typical hotshot doctor. &lt;br /&gt;Hardass, brooding, and all business. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of working on the family ranch, Evan broke the mold and became an ER doctor. &lt;br /&gt;He’s good with his hands—in more ways than one—smart as a whip and is the definition of God’s gift to women. Being a gentleman is in his Southern roots, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t flawed. Exclusive dating has never been a top priority and his tragic past makes him stay at arm’s length. Deciding to let loose for a wild night, he takes a page from the Bishop brother’s relationship book and hooks up with a mysterious girl he’ll never have to see again, which is perfect for this self-proclaimed bachelor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily Bell is a city girl through and through but is determined to get away from her family and past. All she wants is a fresh start and to make a name for herself in the medical field. No random hookups and no dating coworkers—that’s her new motto after being burned time and again. When she agrees to attend a wedding as a plus-one, she’s soon ditched and left to drink solo—but not for long. Mr. Suit is the ultimate temptation with his Southern charm, messy blond hair, and irresistible sex appeal. Everything about him screams bad news, but he makes her reconsider her rules just for one night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, some rules are made to be broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They want the same thing—one night of passion then they’ll go their separate ways. No cuddling afterward. No next day phone calls. No awkward goodbyes. Too bad the universe has other plans—one that’ll be obvious when they report to work on Monday morning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is book 2 in the Bishop Brothers series. Each book features a different brother and can be read as a complete standalone. HEA guaranteed!&lt;br /&gt;**Not suitable for readers under 18 due to adult language and sexual content.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>It's said the artist is born of a damaged soul…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wilhelmina Allende is a prima ballerina. When tragedy turns her beloved Paris into a gilded cage, she jumps at the chance to work with one of the most prolific choreographers she’s ever seen. But Zack’s style is &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; out of her comfort zone. So is his teaching method. And his humor. And his everything. He’s a charming little &lt;i&gt;connard&lt;/i&gt;. It’s hard not to like him. &lt;i&gt;Merde&lt;/i&gt;. What has she gotten herself into?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zachary Coen’s first musical is opening on Broadway. Much like his life, it’s anything but conventional, so hiring Mina is simply out of the question. She’s too…classical. Too perfect. She’s all wrong for the role. Then he meets her in person and sees her cracks. Her broken pieces. How unique and beautiful each one is. And he can’t help but notice how her edges seem to fit his…perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when teaming up seems to be working, the monsters they’ve kept hidden threaten to rip it all apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;**Content warning: The hero is a child molestation survivor and hyper focuses on what he eats as a coping mechanism. He is triggered in a scene toward the end. (While it does not get explicit, it may be triggering to some readers.)** &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**2018 Wishing Shelf Independent Book Awards GOLD MEDAL WINNER**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Young. Wealthy. Elite. Attractive. The gentlemen’s secret society at Yale was filled with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Nathaniel Radcliffe, the bane of my existence, was one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the right hand of the American Gods, he was conceited and arrogant. A dangerously handsome man in a tailored custom suit and shiny black oxford loafers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The classroom was our battlefield. We made a sport out of arguing and debating, ready to do anything in order to win over the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deadly opponents, deadlier minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd sworn I'd never give him the upper hand, until...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret I’ve been hiding for the last three years?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He just discovered it… and now he has all the power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prelude in the &lt;i&gt;American Gods&lt;/i&gt; series.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>One decision was all it took for Ethan Fuller’s life to be flipped upside down and for Maci Dane’s twenty-year plan to fall off the rails. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ethan tells Maci about the invisible thread that links two people destined to be together. The road isn’t always smooth, but eventually the two people holding the thread will find their way to each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They found their way together, yet they keep finding themselves apart. Mistake after mistake, lie after lie, grudge after grudge...it may be too much for two people to overcome. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Are Maci and Ethan tied by the invisible thread, or will their thread break before they can find their way to happiness?</description>

  <description>As the bad boy drummer for the multi-platinum band Vail, Ethan Fuller thinks he’s invincible. He acts on impulse and has committed to the stereotypes of the rock star life with no regard for consequences. The one girl who had the power to tame him is just a distant memory. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now that she has landed the opening gig on Vail’s next tour, Maci Dane is on the path to everything she always wanted. Fame, success, and money are trivial compared to her real objective: to break the heart of the one who broke hers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When they meet face to face for the first time in nearly two decades, Ethan is reminded of the one who got away while Maci works tirelessly to hide her past. As she attempts to even the score, feelings from the past are rekindled. Will she give into love or use her power to break him? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Riddle me this...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I am neither dead, nor alive, and I’m not something little Madison can hide.&lt;br /&gt;But you will be dead, by the time this is done...&lt;br /&gt;the timer starts now, and the games have just begun…”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madison Montgomery comes from money and power, but when someone close to her commits the ultimate crime, Madison must live with her tainted name for the rest of her life. When she begins Riverside Preparatory Academy, the private school her father has swept her into in The Hamptons, she hopes for a fresh start. What she wasn't hoping for was the pack of bad boys who run the school; ten, to be exact. When Madison gains the attention of their leader, Bishop Vincent Hayes, a whole new world that she didn't think existed is exposed to her. A whole world that starts and ends with The Elite Kings Club and these boys, are about to flip her world upside down. Secrets are overflowing and family lies are about to be exposed. Is there more to Madison Montgomery than even she knows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About this book: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to admit something right now. The Silver Swan is &lt;i&gt;f*cked&lt;/i&gt;. It might be the most &lt;i&gt;insane&lt;/i&gt; story I've ever written with equally &lt;i&gt;insane&lt;/i&gt; characters. Who knew? You know, when I started this book, it was supposed to be YA. I wanted to write a book that my sisters could read. A book that won't have people look at my mum like &lt;i&gt;"damn... what sort of messed up shit happened to your kid?"&lt;/i&gt;. The angst, the assholeness, the games, the f**kery, the &lt;b&gt;WHAT THE F**KING F**K ARE YOU DOING???!!!...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I cannot even.... anyway, this is a &lt;b&gt;warning&lt;/b&gt; (and the only one I'll give you). It's crazy. I don't compare my work to my others, but this book is f**ked. It will most likely stomp all the f**k over people's hard limits (and not give a sh*t while it's doing it) and will make you second guess all the morals you thought you had.&lt;br /&gt;This most definitely is not looking like a love story right now... more like a..... I don't even....*shakes head* anyway, I apologise now. You asked for it..........</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“I thought I knew who I was, but I was wrong.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Silver Swan&lt;br /&gt;- 1. &lt;i&gt; A girl who is tarnished. Tainted. One who does not fit into the confinement of legend.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Silver Swan&lt;br /&gt;-2. &lt;b&gt;Madison Montgomery.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lied to.&lt;br /&gt;I was cheated.&lt;br /&gt;Resigned to pick up the scraps of empty memories and disarrayed thoughts, I left. After finally cutting the strings of manipulation, I resorted to do what I’ve done since I was a child, something my father drilled into my brain since I could handle my first rifle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Run.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a mere shadow of the girl they all knew.&lt;br /&gt;Lies and deceit change you. They alter your entire outlook on life.&lt;br /&gt;I’m Madison Montgomery, and I want to play a game.&lt;br /&gt;Here’s what happens when I &lt;i&gt;win&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Riddle me this, Mads.&lt;br /&gt;What goes bump in the night,&lt;br /&gt;but is something you can’t see with sight?&lt;br /&gt;You may run, and you may hide.&lt;br /&gt;If by happily ever after, you mean Bonnie &amp;amp; Clyde.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>He’s always protected me since I was eight years old, the neglected girl he took off the street and raised as his own. Laszlo can feel what music needs instinctively. He can tell what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My world shattered the night of my eighteenth birthday and he still hasn’t forgiven me for what I did. I’m not asking him to love me, touch me, take me to bed. What I want goes deeper than that and I have to say this out loud because it’s one thing that music won’t be able to tell him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want what only Laszlo can give me. I want to be his protégé again. And this time, I’m going to be so good for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, maestro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, sir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, daddy.</description>

  <description>Maria&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was trapped. There was nothing left of me. &lt;br /&gt;Then he came and wanted to make me his.&lt;br /&gt;He saved me. He gave me a home, a family. &lt;br /&gt;He made sweet love to me. &lt;br /&gt;I was his Angel. He was my everything. &lt;br /&gt;I thought we would live happily ever after, but there are no happy endings in the mafia life.&lt;br /&gt;I found this out the hard way, as the blood flowed, red as roses…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lyov&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angel. The word meant nothing until I saw her. &lt;br /&gt;I found her in a place worse than hell. She calls me her savior. &lt;br /&gt;But I didn’t save her. I captured the pretty angel and made her mine. &lt;br /&gt;Life was perfect. I had everything I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I was her salvation. She was my redemption.&lt;br /&gt;Until I lost her. &lt;br /&gt;Angels deserve happy endings, but monsters like me don’t.&lt;br /&gt;My darkness became hers, and our happily-ever-after became tainted.</description>

  <description>My life only has one purpose, and it's to protect them—my family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Whether I fight, maim, or kill the enemy, it makes no difference to me. If have to take a bullet for my family, I would embrace death with a goddamn smile on my face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When their safety is compromised, I put my life on the line and made a deal with the devil. I never questioned it, not even once... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;...Until her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All it takes is one glance. With her pretty eyes now imprinted on my soul, the foundation my life has been built on is shifting. My loyalty has become hazy, and my life has a new meaning. There's a pull between us that's undeniable, and a carnal desire that threatens to ruin us both. It has turned me into a man obsessed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My perfect, well-planned life is now in chaos, and a choice needs to be made. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My family…or my obsession?</description>

  <description>Part of &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37539470-team-player" rel="nofollow"&gt;Team Player: A Sports Romance Anthology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jolie Louis is a smart girl. She knows that her best friend, Sage Poirier, is a bad idea. He’s a walking, talking cliché. The Adonis quarterback with the bulging biceps and harem of fangirls trailing behind him on campus like a stench you can’t get rid of. Sadly, that’s also the reason she can’t stay away from him. Well, that and the fact that they’re roommates. Jolie is already straddling the line between friendship and more when Sage comes to her with an offer she cannot refuse: be his fake girlfriend and live for free for the rest of the semester. She tells herself that she can handle it. He’s just the boy she saved ten years ago, right? Wrong. So very wrong. He is a man now, and she is his captive Heart, body, and soul…</description>

Now she’s got a plan be the one on top, and there’s nothing he can do about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Find out what happens when an alpha unleashes a shot of pure, hot dominance.

  <description>Left or right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s that simple, and it isn’t simple at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I turn left, the road will lead me back to the man I promised my life to, the one I’d imagined building a family with, the one who’s done everything in his power to get me back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I turn right, the road will take me to the man I loved first, the man who brought me back to life, the man who would do anything to keep me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew the fork in the road was inevitable; it was the decision I never wanted to make between choices I didn't know I had. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I love them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My heart is destined to exist in two equal halves — one with each man. But one half beats stronger, the vein running deepest, and holds my choice in silence long before I know it for myself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The realization of what I have to do, of the heart I have to break, just might break mine too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left or right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I have to do is take a breath and turn.</description>

  <description>On the northeast side of town, there is a house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The house was once magical, filled with love and joy and plans for the future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside its walls are many things that belong to me — my books, the china from my mother on my wedding day, the beautiful cage once home to two birds, now empty, just like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man who also belongs to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man I no longer wish to keep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man who, no doubt, has not slept, though the sun is rising. Because the house where he waits is where I laid my head to rest every night for eight years. Until last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one who knows me would believe Charlie Pierce, the quiet, bookish girl who never made waves is pulling out of the driveway of a man who isn’t her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they don’t know me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t even know me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say there are two sides to every story, and I suppose in most cases, that’s true. But the one I live inside of? It has three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the northeast side of town, there is a house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is no longer a home.</description>

Shen, comes a new &lt;b&gt;standalone&lt;/b&gt;, enemies-to-lovers romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Célian Laurent.&lt;br /&gt;Manhattan royalty.&lt;br /&gt;Notorious playboy.&lt;br /&gt;Heir to a media empire.&lt;br /&gt;...And my new boss.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could have impressed him, if not for last month's unforgettable one-night stand.&lt;br /&gt;I left it with more than orgasms and a pleasant memory--namely, his wallet.&lt;br /&gt;Now he's staring me down like I'm the dirt under his Italian loafers, and I'm supposed to take it.&lt;br /&gt;But the thing about being Judith "Jude" Humphry is I have nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;Brooklyn girl.&lt;br /&gt;Infamously quirky.&lt;br /&gt;Heir to a stack of medical bills and a tattered couch.&lt;br /&gt;When he looks at me from across the room, I see the glint in his eyes, and that makes us rivals.&lt;br /&gt;He knows it.&lt;br /&gt;So do I. &lt;br /&gt;Every day in the newsroom is a battle.&lt;br /&gt;Every night in his bed, war.&lt;br /&gt;But it's my heart at stake, and I fear I'll be raising the white flag.</description>

  <description>Leighton Wellington has it all. Born with a silver spoon and a career mapped for success, he can’t fail. But Leighton dreams of ditching everything for a life of rock and roll. A little eavesdropping and a tiny bit of blackmail scores him the role as drummer for rock sensation Three Ugly Guys. The gig couldn’t get any sweeter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until the gorgeous, innocent assistant joins the tour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opal Evans can’t escape her past, but she can run from the small town she’s called home. In a group of rock stars, she discovers an idea of family she’s never known. But the secrets she must guard could break even the strongest of wills—especially with how paparazzi circle like vultures. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Leighton she recognizes a kindred spirit, as well as someone willing to bend the rules. But as things spin out of control her relationship with Leighton could hinder his newfound fame. Can she keep things casual when her heart screams for more? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hinder is the third book in the Off Track Records novels but can be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>For seasons, I have waited for her - my perfect mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a tribe full of happy couples, I am alone. But I am not content to remain this way. There are no eligible unmated females left, so I will do whatever it takes to bring females back to our tribe...even if it means doing something wrong. Even if it means I must purchase my mate on the intergalactic black market. I will do anything to possess her, to claim her as my own &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But will my ruthless move turn my female against me before we ever meet? Can she ever forgive a male that bought her freedom?</description>

  <description>I’ve never spent a day without my mate since arriving on the ice planet. I’m happy and in love, and we have a beautiful child together. All that changed when the world shook. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My mate nearly died. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He wakes up from his coma…and he can’t remember me. Or our son. Every memory of the past two years is gone. And that changes everything between us. How can I love someone that doesn’t remember me? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How can I not, when I know he’s still my mate underneath it all?</description>

  <description>As a newcomer to the alien tribe, I've struggled to find my place. It might be because I'm a tad headstrong at times. And yes, I might have thrown a few things at people's heads. But I had a good reason to pitch a fit - my shy sister was stolen away right under my nose. Of course, now she's back and mated. Everyone's happy... except me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I need... affection. &lt;br /&gt;Attention. &lt;br /&gt;Okay, I'm lonely. Really lonely. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Strangely enough, the only person that I think understands what I'm going through is the same blue-skinned brute that stole my sister. It's wrong to hook up with him, even as a mindless fling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except... I'm not so good with the whole 'rules' thing. &lt;br /&gt;And he's not so great with the 'fling' thing.</description>

  <description>When I wake up on the ice planet, I’m scared of everything: this place is cold, silent, and the locals look more like blue devils than aliens. To make matters worse, one of the strangers decides I’m going to be his girlfriend and kidnaps me away from my sister. I’m completely and utterly alone. What’s a girl to do? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, this girl escapes.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course, that means I go from frying pan into the fire, and my situation gets even more dangerous. Just when I have no hope left, a new hero appears. Sure, he’s blue, horned, and has a tail. He’s also fierce, protective, makes me purr... and thinks I'm perfect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But is what we have real or just a mating instinct?  &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>It’s hard being the most popular girl on the ice planet. The alien men are falling all over themselves to impress me in the hopes that I’ll take them to my furs. But they don’t know my secrets – none of them do. And they don’t realize that behind my smile, I just wish they’d go away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t want any of them. I want someone else – someone with a gorgeous blue body, big horns, and the most intense gaze ever. He’s the only one that knows the truth. Maybe with him, I can work through my fears of the past…. but I’m pretty sure he wants more than just friendship. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wants forever, and I’m not sure I can give it.</description>

  <description>'Resonance' is supposed to be a dream - that's when your soulmate is chosen for you. And everyone on the ice planet has hooked up with a big, hunky soulmate of their own... except me. So do I want a mate? Heck yeah. More than anything, all I've ever wanted is to be loved by someone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Except that the soulmate chosen for me? My least favorite person on the darn ice planet. Haeden's the most cranky, disapproving, unpleasant, overbearing male alien... so why is it that my body sings when he gets close? Why is he working so hard to prove to me that he's not as awful as I think he is? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I hate him... don't I?</description>

  <description>The ice planet has given me a second lease on life, so I'm thrilled to be here. Sure, there's no cheeseburgers, but I'm healthy and ready to be a productive member of the small tribe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't anticipate? That there'd be a savage stranger waiting nearby, watching me. And when he takes me captive, the unthinkable happens... I resonate to him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resonance means mating, and children... but I don't know if this guy's ever been around anyone before. He's truly a barbarian in all ways, right down to clubbing me over the head and claiming me as his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why is it that I crave his touch and hunger for more?</description>

  <description>As one of the few humans stranded on the ice planet, I should be happy that I have a new home. Human women are treasured here, and one alien in particular has made it clear that he wants me. It's hard to push away the sexy, flirtatious Aehako, when all I want to do is grab him by his horns and insist he take me to his furs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I've got a terrible secret - the aliens who abducted me are back, and thanks to the translator in my ear, they can find me. My presence here endangers everyone... but can I give up my new life and the man I want more than anything?</description>

  <description>Twelve humans are left stranded on a wintry alien planet. I’m one of them. Yay, me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to survive, we have to take on a symbiont that wants to rewire our bodies to live in this brutal place. I like to call it a cootie. And my cootie’s a jerk, because it also thinks I’m the mate to the biggest, surliest alien of the group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BARBARIAN ALIEN is a sequel to ICE PLANET BARBARIANS. You do not have to read both in order to understand the plot, but the story will be richer if you do!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How to protect your heart: &lt;br /&gt;Let your bodyguard have it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane Cobalt is an American princess. The loyal and painfully curious twenty-three-year-old has inherited immense pressure to preserve the Cobalt legacy. But for Jane — sex, love, and life have been a series of royal failures. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a friends-with-benefits ended in disaster, she's sworn to a “no sex” hiatus for, well, eternity — and she has no intention of letting anyone in her bed and definitely not her heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-eight-year-old Thatcher Moretti is painfully professional. As the stern 24/7 bodyguard to Jane, thinking about unbridled sex with his sweet client is a sin. One that he keeps committing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real act is a hard line he’d never cross. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a family member betrays Jane's trust, the media becomes obsessed with matchmaking the perpetually “single” Jane Cobalt and unwanted attention suddenly compromises her safety. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thatcher would do anything to protect her, and one solution may level the threats: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Become the fake boyfriend to an American princess. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entwined together with boiling chemistry, new “professional” parameters, and an oath, unsaid feelings threaten to rise and change everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;​​The Like Us series is a true series, one continuous timeline, that follows a family of wealthy celebrities and the people that protect them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Like Us Series Reading Order:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;HOW CAN IT BE WRONG &lt;br /&gt;IF IT FEELS SO &lt;i&gt;GOOD&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dating an American princess comes with a massive amount of baggage–all of which I’m willing to carry strapped on my back in quicksand and through seven hells. But Jane Cobalt’s baggage, I’m unprepared for. It comes in the form of her five equally famous and notoriously hard-to-please brothers.  &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;I want Jane.  &lt;br /&gt;Completely.  &lt;br /&gt;Unconditionally.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when there’s a trip scheduled that I can’t be a part of, I only have one option. It’s immoral.  &lt;br /&gt;Something I’d never consider until now.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But, hell, there’s got to be some perks to being a twin. So I’m doing it. I’m switching places with my brother.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Done and done.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It should have been easy.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There were little consequences.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until the storm hit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Like Us series is a true series, one continuous timeline, that follows a family of wealthy celebrities and the people that protect them. It must be read in the following order: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Like Us Series Reading Order:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. Damaged Like Us (Maximoff &amp;amp; Farrow) &lt;br /&gt;2.

  <description>Welcome to Alexa Riley Promises. This series is dedicated to old romances. It’s tropes galore, with all of our usual over-the-top alphas and sweet cheesy goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These short books will focus on traditional and classic tropes while sticking to the Alexa Riley code: no cheating and always with an HEA. That’s our Promise to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr and Mrs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillip has been married to Molly for a year. He’s beyond obsessed with his new wife, to the point that he has to hold his true feelings back. If she knew how crazy he is for her, she might push him away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly is feeling distance growing between them, and she’s worried she’s not enough. One night she walks in on Phillip, and it changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Phillip discovers Molly was in an accident and now has amnesia, he’s going to do all he can to make her fall in love with him again. Holding nothing back this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: It’s just as crazy as it sounds and just as over-the-top ridiculous. If you want to get silly with us and spend a little time away from reality, grab this one up!</description>

  <description>Sean Willis knows the difference between right and wrong. Sure, the bass player of Three Ugly Guys has made his share of mistakes, but when push comes to shove, Sean always chooses the high road. Now, even when things are unraveling with the band, he's the voice of reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Jess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's the only thing he's ever wanted and couldn't have. Not only is she his new roommate, but her boyfriend is the newest addition to 3UG. She's more than off limits, she's a temptress with her unaltered beauty and gentle spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessica Moore has never been the center of anyone's world. In fact, she's familiar with being forgotten. Not too tall, not too pretty, not too smart; she's just Jess. No stranger to scraping by for survival, she finds shelter in Coy Wright, a musician with dreams bigger than life. But when Coy skyrockets to stardom, Jess is thrust into a world in which she doesn't belong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until she discovers an unexpected friendship. Sean treats Jess as someone special, important, and worthy of love. The feelings and desires he stirs within are dangerous, because despite Sean's kindness and affection, she's forever loyal to Coy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when doing the wrong thing feels right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess and Sean's friendship is put to the test, along with alliances in the band.

  <description>He’s hunting me, and there’s nowhere to run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;East Berlin, 1963. I thought I understood the consequences of trying to flee to the West. Death. Imprisonment without trial. Instead I’m being hunted by the most dangerous man in the city, secret police officer Reinhardt Volker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I’m his prize, no longer a traitorous factory girl but his elegant and pampered secretary. He wants to possess me, body, soul – and heart. I’ll do anything to get away from him, but first that means getting closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to feel only hatred for my captor but beneath his uniform I discover a man with a past as scarred as Berlin’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if I don’t escape him soon it will be too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**A full-length dark romance by Brianna Hale</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NETFLIX NEWS! The 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN series is being adapted into a steamy Netflix dramedy series called SEX/LIFE, coming soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a Top 100 Amazon Bestseller and winner of the After Dark Book Lovers Shortie Award for Best Debut of 2016. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Oh. My. God. I can't stop laughing. Or reading. WHAT IS HAPPENING?" - Colleen Hoover, #1 New York Times Bestselling Author&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;School psychologists aren’t supposed to write books about sex. Doing so would be considered “unethical” and “a fireable offense.” Lucky for you, ethics was never my strong suit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending years trying to spice up my sex life, I gave up and took to my journal. Perhaps my gorgeous, cold, number crunching husband simply wasn’t capable of the kind of passion I’d come to expect. After all, my ex-boyfriends—a tattoo artist turned U.S. Marine turned motorcycle club outlaw, a baby-faced punk rocker out on parole, and a heavy-metal bass player—were every bit as tattooed and testosterone-fueled as the leading men in my favorite romance novels. If I couldn’t have that kind of passion again in real life, I could at least write about it. Right? Nobody had to know. It would be my little secret. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, guess what? My husband read that shit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And guess what else? He upped his fucking game. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drunk with power and under the dubious advisement of my best friend and colleague, I began testing the limits—crafting journal entries specifically designed to manipulate Ken’s behavior. For the most part, he responded beautifully … except when he didn’t.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;***Content Warning*** &lt;br /&gt;Owned is a dark erotic romance. Please pay close attention to the use of the words dark, erotic, and romance. It has intense sexual situations, a Master/slave relationship, mild abuse, and some violence. Reader discretion is advised.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"I like you collared, baby. I like you naked, I like you mine.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ellie Stevens has lusted over Kayne Roberts since he first walked into the import/export company she works for a little over a year ago. As Expo’s most important client, Ellie has always kept a safe distance from the man with the majestic blue eyes — until temptation finally gets the better of her. Impulsively, Ellie invites Kayne to one of Expo's infamous company parties her flamboyant boss is notorious for throwing. Unbeknownst to Ellie, the god in the Armani suit isn’t just the suave entrepreneur he portrays himself to be. Underneath the professional exterior is a man with a secret life, dark desires, and nefarious contacts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a hidden corner of a trendy New York City lounge, the spark kindling between the two of them ignites. Unable to resist the sinful attraction, Ellie agrees to leave with Kayne, believing she is finally bedding the man of her dreams. Little does she know when she walks out the door, she’s about to be &lt;i&gt;Owned&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>A Christmas novella where everyone gets their just desserts. &lt;br /&gt;Olive had a major crush on Hank in high school. She was the too-smart, slightly chubby girl who gawked as Hank ran track and made all the cheerleaders swoon. After high school, the two went their separate ways. Olive opened a yoga studio and swore off sweets while Hank traveled the world. No problem, right? At least there wasn't a problem until Hank moved back to town and opened a candy shop across the street from Olive's studio. Now, Olive will do everything she can to shut her old crush down. But Hank has other plans, and all of them end with an Olive sundae.</description>

  <description>TAKE – verb: to reach for and hold in one’s hands or get into one’s possession, power or control. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logan Mitchell is a man who’s always been more than happy to take what he wants. It’s a philosophy that’s proven lucrative in both his business and personal life, and never was it more apparent than the night he laid eyes on Tate Morrison. After pulling out all the stops and convincing the sexy bartender to give him a try—he’s hooked. &lt;br /&gt;Now, Logan finds himself in a predicament that demands more from him than a smart-ass answer and his innate ability to walk away when things get too deep. &lt;br /&gt;He has a choice to make, and it’ll force him to do something he’s never done before—take a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tate Morrison knows all about taking a chance. He took the biggest one of his life the night he showed up at Logan’s apartment to explore his unexpected reaction to the man. &lt;br /&gt;Ever since then, he’s thought about little else.&lt;br /&gt;At first he was convinced his attraction was based solely on his body’s curiosity. But the more time he spends with the silver-tongued lawyer, the more Tate realizes that their physical chemistry is only the beginning. &lt;br /&gt;He’s starting to catch a glimpse of what life with Logan would be like, and it’s one full of excitement and satisfaction—a far cry from what he had in the past with his soon to be ex-wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each man will face their fears as they begin to understand the true meaning of give and take. Their feelings for one another will be tested, as will their very beliefs. But now that they’ve found love where they least expected it, will they be brave enough to reach out and take it?</description>

  <description>Willow Adams has been left with no choice. She’s run away from home and straight to a mail-order bride agency. She has no idea what to expect, but never in her wildest dreams did she anticipate him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dane York needs a marriage of convenience. He doesn’t have time to date, but he needs to have a certain image for his company, and some things are expected. Everything is perfectly planned out… That is, until he lays eyes on his new bride.</description>

  <description>Noelle's voice has captivated Alex, and she's become his greatest obsession. Since he hired her to read audiobooks, listening to her is the only thing that makes his lonely world bearable. Thank God she's never seen him. His scars would only scare her away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex has starred in every fantasy Noelle's had since she first heard his voice over the phone, and reading erotica samples to him only fuels her desire. Listening to him on the other end of the phone is the best part of her day, and she's willing to do anything to please him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Christmas Eve a storm comes through, sending Noelle in search of her reclusive boss. Once she's at his cabin with no place to go, there's only one way to keep warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This is the sweetest, cheesiest, most Christmassy book ever! It's filled with late-night confessions, dirty deeds, and a lifetime of love. If you love this time of year, I've got some cheer for you!</description>

  <description>Camilla Collins hasn't gone home in thirteen years. As much as she loves her family, their tiny hometown in the folds of the Colorado mountains holds too many memories. Memories of a life barely lived and a love barely realized. No matter how she thrives, AJ Jenkins is the man she compares all others too. He just so happens to be the one that broke her heart. Seeing him, seeing the life she might have had with him, has been a very convincing reason to celebrate the holidays in the Pacific Northwest, happy in the rain instead of the snow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AJ Jenkins isn't exactly bitter and frigid. It's the below freezing temperatures, the knee deep snow, and the death of his chronically ill father dragging him down. That is until Cam Collins finally comes home for Christmas. After thirteen years, he'd almost given up on seeing her. And was incredibly happy about it. But thirteen is unlucky for a reason, and apparently that reason is still a klutzy, gorgeous, living memory determined to poke holes in his barely hanging on heart with death defying stilettos.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Is it love, or is she just his good luck charm?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Helena Hunting absolutely delights with this witty and fun standalone contemporary romance.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lilah isn't sure what hurt worse: the day Ethan left her to focus on his hockey career, or the day he came back eight years later. He might think they can pick up just where they left off, but she's no longer that same girl and never wants to be again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan Kane wants his glory days back. And that includes having Lilah by his side. With her, he was magic. They were magic. All he has to do is make her see that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when Lilah might finally be ready to let him in, though, she finds out their reunion has nothing to do with her and everything to do with his game. But Ethan's already lost her once, and even if it costs him his career, he'll do anything to keep from losing her again.</description>

  <description>Mason foster goes through assistants like some people go through tissues. He’s sick and tired of having to replace them, so his best friend and business partner decides to help him out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kennedy Myers is here for a job and nothing else. But when the money is too good to be true, there’s nothing she won’t do to please her new boss. She’s bought and paid for, so who is she to say no? Especially when she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This dirty office romance is over-the-top filthy. If you want a possessive alpha with a bossy mouth, then do what you’re told and get this book! Seriously, though, if Mason asks, just say you bought it. He’s grumpy.</description>

  <description>Aurora Adams has had everything in her life regimented. She's been made to eat certain foods, wear certain clothes, and only do what her mother allows...all for the sake of her dancing career. Life is lonely and cold, but she doesn't have a choice. When her mother decides to send her away for a year of training it's just another blow to her already fragile heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noah Hill has never had passion for much in his life. But one look at Aurora and his world ignites. From the moment he sees her on the stage, he knows she has to be his. When her mother stands in the way, he has no other choice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Aurora finally have a chance to break free, or is she trading one cage for another? When temptation leads to devotion, maybe the truth isn't so important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: He's a billionaire set to kidnap the ballet dancer he sees on stage. What could possibly be any more wonderful!? Get your buns ready because we've got you covered!</description>

  <description>Autumn has always felt a soul-shattering pull to her stepbrother, Hunter. The only problem is that they’ve never met. But this Thanksgiving they’re finally going to meet and when they do, all her desires will be confirmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunter Danvers has lost a lot, and seeing his father marry a nightmare of a stepmother, he thinks he’s lost him, too. He reluctantly comes home for Thanksgiving. And then everything he knows to be true changes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Get stuffed with insta-love, a secret baby, and gravy puns galore! This glossed-over holiday just got a reason to be celebrated, and it has nothing to do with the cranberry sauce!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This is bad. Very bad. He's rubbing off on me. Resident bad boy Ethan Colton is turning me into an irresponsible bad girl.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----- &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rule #2 – When I tell you to come here, you come here.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's still an order, still practically growling at me, commanding me to obey him, but it's more, too. It's fun and flirty, a little playful. I can see why girls fall for him, can see why his devious smirk melts their resistance, because it's doing the same to me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----- &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan is a cocky, arrogant jerk. He's always been that way. Why do girls trip over their own feet just to be with him? I don't know! I'll never understand it. Don't they realize he's just going to ditch them after a couple of weeks? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, he can be nice when he wants to be. It's true that he's ridiculously attractive, too. It's not like I want to stare at him when he walks around shirtless, but it's hard not to notice someone like him. He's got that bad boy smile that makes you want to... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention he's my stepbrother? Ick. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What? You think I'm falling for him? Nope! It's impossible.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Dan might be the enemy of my enemy, but I’m not sure that makes him my friend. He’s definitely not my ‘step brother’, no matter what everyone at school says. Honestly, I don’t know what he’s supposed to be to me. Or what he’s becoming…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Fact: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the yearbook, I’ll be &lt;i&gt;Sophia Ramos: Valedictorian.&lt;/i&gt; Years of honor roll certificates, AP classes, and lugging around an obnoxiously large cello case are about to finally pay off. If everything goes according to plan, I’ll escape these decaying suburbs for a top university across the country. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem? A few years ago, my mom met someone just as broke, just as drunk, and just as impulsive as she is. Approximately five seconds into their relationship, they decided it would be an excellent idea for him—and his son, Dan—to move in with us. (Spoiler alert: it wasn’t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I share a house with none other than Daniel Cole. Even though Dan dropped out two years ago, he’s still the tattooed, bad boy, heartthrob, legend of St. Anthony’s Academy. He and I aren’t supposed to have anything in common. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living together means war. First, Dan and I were at war with each other. Now, our rivalry is giving way to an unlikely alliance—two opposing sides teaming up against a common enemy: our respective parents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is to say, we’ve been hanging out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Question: What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s the thing: My brain is a complex organ. One hundred &lt;i&gt;billion&lt;/i&gt; neurons, each with an average of seven thousand synaptic connections to other neurons. My brain is my ticket out of here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My heart, by contrast, is a pump. It moves blood around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; Dan is off-limits. I &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; I shouldn’t do something I’ll regret. And I &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; how much is at stake (my family, my future).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why can’t I stop thinking about him? Those inscrutable jade eyes. The smile that can say a thousand different things at once. That tattoo curving across his abs…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; better, I &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; that pounding in my chest. And it’s getting harder to ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if I follow my heart, I can never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Answer: There is no such thing as an immovable object.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>Rick's been raising little Gracie for the past five years. She even calls him Daddy, but recently things have started to change, and that name has started to have a whole different feel to it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ty's lived with Rick since he lost his parents in a car accident. Then Gracie came into their lives and the world seemed to light up, but the brotherly feelings he once had are now long forgotten as little Gracie has turned into a woman. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gracie doesn't know what to do with her feelings for Rick and Ty: the two men who once felt like a father and brother to her. They've been her whole world since her mom skipped town, leaving her all alone in a trailer park. But something has to change. She wants them both, and she'll have them one way or another.</description>

  <description>Sensual. Heartbreaking. Passionate. Overwhelming. Maddening. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s the love Finn and I share.&lt;br /&gt;It's the kind you can never recover from. &lt;br /&gt;The kind you never WANT to recover from. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's why we'll do everything and anything to protect it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my past chases me all the way to Outskirts, we have to make a choice. &lt;br /&gt;Let the lies destroy our chance at future together or...bury them deep in the swamp where they belong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a shovel?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Diana Cooper is 18, eager to graduate and go to Yale, and too shy to really look a boy in the eye. No one suspects the sexy lingerie hiding under her vintage dresses. No one suspects the dirty fantasies running through her mind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Brendan and Ian O'Brian, the hot twins next door, are home from UConn for the summer: gorgeous, athletic, basking in popularity. Brendan, the "good twin," attracts everyone with easygoing friendliness. Ian, the "bad twin," leaves a mess of pranks, collisions, girls, and attitude behind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As kids, the O'Brian twins were practically Diana's brothers. But a year away changed everything. Now, Di can barely handle a hello to Brendan. And Ian — well, it’s easier to look the other way and pretend she doesn’t see his smirk. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Right before graduation, Brendan breaks the silence to invite Di for a swim. She figures she’ll test the waters, but that night pulls her into the steamiest deep end imaginable. And it’s just the beginning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can she dive in and live out her fantasies? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can she let the past go and learn to trust? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And when no one’s who they seem — good twin, bad twin, or shy honors student — will her heart tell a different story? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’d never admit it. But she might be over her head.</description>

  <description>Frederic d'Estang: performer, professional villain and my youthful crush. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Graduate student Evie Bell spends her days ghostwriting memoirs and her nights playing out her most intimate sexual fantasies by penning fan fiction. When a famous stage actor bursts into her life, she's drawn to his dark, sensual presence, despite herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He calls me chérie, ma princesse, minette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Paris, Frederic takes Evie firmly in hand, leading her down a sensual path neither of them could have imagined, and pushing them both dangerously near their limits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I call him Daddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evie is wary—fearing Frederic is a villain both onstage and off—but again and again, Frederic draws her in. Yet the closer they become, the more Frederic holds back, wanting to protect Evie from his despicable truth. He isn’t the man she believes him to be, and his secret may very well destroy them.</description>

  <description>Ayla &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The darkness never truly left me. It’s always there, waiting for the right moment to strike. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s been months since I ran away from the nightmare that was slowly killing me. I ran for my life, straight into the arms of a man who I thought would be worse than the nightmare I’d left behind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Little did I know he’d become my savior. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But my happy ending was ripped away from me in a blink of an eye. I had everything…and I lost everything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alessio &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t believe in angels. But then I saw her. I touched her. I kissed her. I made love to her. &lt;br /&gt;In return, she saved my soul. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was no longer unlovable, because my Angel found it in her heart to love me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had her…and then I lost her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I will not stop until I find her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even if it means starting a war and spilling the blood of everyone who gets in my way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will find my Angel.</description>

  <description>From bestselling author L.J. Shen, comes a new, &lt;b&gt;standalone&lt;/b&gt;, contemporary romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should have been easy.&lt;br /&gt;I needed the money. He needed a babysitter to keep him from snorting himself to death.&lt;br /&gt;I was cherry-picked especially for him. Responsible. Optimistic. Warm. Innocent.&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that I should have known better.&lt;br /&gt;Alex Winslow. British rock star. Serial heartbreaker. Casanova with whiskey eyes.&lt;br /&gt;“Don’t get near the devil in a leather jacket. He’ll chew you up and spit you out.”&lt;br /&gt;Guess what? I didn’t listen.&lt;br /&gt;I signed the contract.&lt;br /&gt;World tour. Three months. Four Continents. One hundred shows.&lt;br /&gt;My name is Indigo Bellamy, and I sold my soul to a tattooed god.&lt;br /&gt;Problem was, my soul wasn’t enough for Alex Winslow. He ended up taking my body, too.&lt;br /&gt;Then he took my heart.&lt;br /&gt;Then he took my all.</description>

  <description>Four months ago, I had a one night stand that blew my mind, and literally blew my ‘you know what’.&lt;br /&gt;She’s the one that got away, and I’ve been craving her ever since.&lt;br /&gt;Just the thought of her, just a scent of the perfume she wore, and I’m hard as a rod.&lt;br /&gt;So how do you think I feel now that she’s back in my life?&lt;br /&gt;Great? Excited? Aroused? Ecstatic?&lt;br /&gt;Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;Because having her back in my life is pure torture.&lt;br /&gt;Not only is she my new PA, and I have a strict hands off policy at work, she’s also my father’s spanking new stepdaughter.&lt;br /&gt;That makes her my stepsister.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve heard of keeping it in the family but come on, that’s got to be crossing the line.&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, everything about Carley makes me want to cross the line.&lt;br /&gt;I want to rip her out of her ridiculous new business clothes, breathe in her delectable scent, throw her down on my bed, and show her what I meant to show her the first night I had her.&lt;br /&gt;You know what? Screw the rules!</description>

  <description>Sweet and innocent and lost in the woods. It sounds like the start of a fairy tale. But this is no fairy tale and Ash Carson is no knight in shining armour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He brought me to his tumbledown cabin deep in the forest and now he won't let me leave. refusing point blank to open the door until the blizzard dies down.He might be the most handsome man I've ever met and my only hope of survival but he's also infuriatingly stubborn and what's worse, he won't stop staring at me with hunger in his eyes. I know what that look means and I'm so scared, I can hardly move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know what to do. He's just given me two options, leave or stay. If I leave, I'll freeze to death. If I stay? Well, he's warned me what will happen if I stay. He won't listen to reason, he won't argue. He wants my innocence and he's going to take it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most shocking thing about all of this? I want to let him.</description>

  <description>Where do you go when there's no place to hide?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Country music superstar, Trent Thorne is on the run. The secret he's kept hidden from the world is no longer a secret at all. He trusted the wrong person, a man he'd stupidly thought he was in love with, and instead of a happily ever after all he'd gotten was outted. Unwilling to sit around and watch his private life get plastered all over the news, Trent hits the road and somehow ends up in his best friend Lemon's small hometown of Fate, Texas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He only intends to crash there for one night but in Fate, one night can change everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lance Nichols knows a thing or two about hiding. He's so deep in the closet he can't even see daylight. The former womanizer finally admitted the truth to himself a few years ago but he never thought he'd be able to say the words out loud, not to his family, not to his friends, and certainly not to his secret celebrity crush when the guy stumbles awkwardly into his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the words come easily with Trent. Everything comes easily with him. Talking, touching and even opening up about all the things he’s never told a soul. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fate brought these two together, but will it also tear them apart? One newly outed man refuses to go back in the closet. The other can’t imagine coming out of his. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real world is closing in on their little bubble but before it does, can they figure out how to coexist and be a part of each other’s lives? Can Lance stop hiding and take a chance on love? And what happens if Trent decides to stay a little longer… maybe even forever?</description>

  <description>Never trust a man who answers the door wearing nothing more than a pair of low-cut jeans and a panty-melting smirk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That should've been my first sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I write about guys like him for a living — sexy and charming, yet reluctant to get into a serious relationship. His body screams sex appeal, but his condescending personality makes him a classic f*ckboy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I want &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; to do with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing romance novels comes with its perks — traveling, meeting new people, creating characters from the voices in my head — but Ethan Rochester enters my life and rearranges my preconceived notions about writing what inspires you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting him was fate, but falling for him was inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;And forgetting him will be impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**This is a complete STANDALONE novel — filled with plenty of humor, steam, &amp;amp; romance! 18 &amp;amp; up only due to explicit sexual content, language, and adult content. Previously published as &lt;i&gt;My Week with the Bad Boy&lt;/i&gt; by Brooke Cumberland &amp;amp; Lyra Parish.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"The war continues... A battle for His Angel."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ayla&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wings were ready to fly, but he clipped them. Feather by feather, until I had nothing left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then my savior came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He left a bloodbath to find me. He loves me. He wants his Angel to be free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how can I fly again when my wings are broken?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alessio&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This war isn’t over. If he thought he could break her and just disappear, then he was wrong. I am going to find him and break him like he broke her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a vow to my Angel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promised to let her fly…I promised to save her soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I never break my vows.</description>

  <description>Modelling lingerie for her annoyingly attractive arch-nemesis was not on Christina’s to-do list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, neither was he.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aaron Penn might be the talk of the advertising school they both attend, but to Christina he’s just an egomaniac with a cocky smirk to match. Fast forward to the end of term, when a class project gone wrong has her stripping down to a negligee and letting Aaron photograph her to advertise a line of women’s underwear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She expects suggestive comments and smarmy-eyed stares, but when Aaron gets behind the camera he treats her body like a work of art. Even though all she’s got on is a scrap of satin, the room suddenly feels way too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the tension between them builds to expensive-panty-melting-levels, Christina finds herself caught between falling for the complicated artist who knows just what poses to put her in, and wondering why he acts like such an irritating hotshot around everyone else.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Every Princess needs a Prince Charming…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a masked girl throws herself at Shawn Finch at a costume party, the hotshot football player assumes she’s just another girl trying to get his attention. Except she’s not just any girl. She’s his Cinderella, the nameless girl in the pale blue dress who got away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Desperate to find her, Finch searches for his mystery girl with no luck. So, it must be fate when Finch’s grade point average drops and the school assigns him a tutor not knowing they just handed over his Cinderella. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After having a crush on Finch since the first time she spotted him on campus, one kiss was all she’d ever wanted. But Finch has other plans once he discovers the truth about his tutor.</description>

  <description>He spanked me. I deserved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was just a crush. At first. Then it turned into an obsession. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew he wouldn't want me. Why would he?

  <description>LOVE AND SECOND CHANCES ARE NOT FREE &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the five kids who live at St. Jude’s Home for Court Placed Juveniles, life is a nightmare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carissa, the youngest, has been there the longest. And barely speaks. Rosa is sixteen and pregnant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simon keeps his head down and studies, hoping to get back the life he lost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth and Tommy, in the middle of the darkness, have found each other, and all they want is to be together. But when they get caught making out at school, it puts everyone in danger. Tommy is used to the beatings from their foster father, but when Beth is singled out for punishment, Tommy can’t sit back and let it happen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND ALL DEBTS MUST BE PAID &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens that night rips apart the lives of the five teenagers forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the blood has been spilled, a bargain is made. A deal with the devil that should have solved things. It should have fixed everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But nothing is free - not love, not innocence, and certainly not freedom. And sooner or later, all debts must be paid...</description>

  <description>Sophia Adams has lived her whole life sheltered from the world. Her parents are workaholics, she goes to an all-girls school, and isn’t allowed outside the boundaries that have been set for her. So when she secretly gets a passport and packs a bag the day it arrives, she thinks all of her dreams are finally coming true. That is, until the airport security pulls her out of line and she discovers that maybe she’s more innocent than she thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lincoln Gray owns everything he could ever want. And that includes the dark-haired beauty he catches sight of. One look at Sophia and he’s making sure she’s the carry-on he’s taking to his next stop. She’s too naive to travel the world alone, and luckily for her, he’s the one to protect her. He’s never been told no, and it’s not about to start now. How can a woman resist being given all she’s dreamed of?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This short story is insta-love faster than a Nighthawk (It’s the fastest plane in the world. Trust us, we Googled.) Make sure your tray tables are in their upright and locked position and your laptop is in a bin by itself. We’ve got a filthy little quickie ready to please!</description>

  <description>Milk and honey' is a collection of poetry and prose about survival. About the experience of violence, abuse, love, loss, and femininity. It is split into four chapters, and each chapter serves a different purpose. Deals with a different pain. Heals a different heartache. 'milk and honey' takes readers through a journey of the most bitter moments in life and finds sweetness in them because there is sweetness everywhere if you are just willing to look.</description>

  <description>Alessio… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cold. Ruthless. Killer. I am respected and feared by all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t put on this earth to love or be loved. I was put here to wipe out every last member of the damn Abandonato mafia, to pay them back for my mother’s death. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I find a strange girl hiding, beaten, under my bed, I don’t let her live out of compassion. She’s a trinket, my plaything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ayla… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I thought Alessio was only one more man who wanted to use me, hurt me, and throw me away. I don’t know what it is to trust anymore. I can’t find my heart under the pain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alessio found it. He touched it, and brought it alive again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But if he discovers just how dangerous I am to him…I’ll lose my life.</description>

  <description>Gorgeous, rock-star guys like Chase Delany don't go for girls like me. They go for supermodels and actresses, skinny-girls who never eat and spend all day working out. I'm not that girl. So when he locked his fiery brown eyes on me for the first time, I couldn't quite believe it was really happening to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the second night I spent with him that I'll never forget.</description>

  <description>I stand at the edge of the ocean with my toes buried in the sand. I remove my clothing one piece at a time. No one is around. I'm alone on this beach, so I feel liberated. It's a relief to have finally made the decision to leave this world the same way that I came into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one would miss me. My mom remarried and now has a shiny new stepson to brag about named Jake. I can't stand Jake. He's an alpha male about as perfect as perfect comes. He's a star rugby player, and on the Dean's list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, I'm yanked by the arm, thrown over the shoulder and brought back to shore. It's Jake. As I lay naked in his arms, my eyes transfixed on his pink, smooth lips that curl up at the corners. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Why do I suddenly want to kiss him?</description>

  <description>Adrianna Rossi is no stranger to the rigorous demands required of her body. Years of pain and determination make her one of the best. Olympic glory is the ultimate goal, and she'll do anything to achieve it. Even if that means leaving home to attend World Cup Academy of Gymnastics, a training center that serves one purpose—producing champions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfection, precision, and dedication are required of his athletes. When two time Olympian Konstantin Kournakova is persuaded into training the young hopeful, he immediately regrets it. She doesn't come close to his high standards. As the relentless pursuit of her dream keeps her striving, a passion is ignited within him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kova's power and domination, coupled with Adrianna's fierce tenacity, reveal there is more for her body to learn. Every interaction can be misconstrued, but there’s no mistaking the darkening of his gaze, the lingering of his touch, or the illicit image of his bare skin pressed against hers. Integrity is on the line. One toe off the beam and their forbidden desires could ruin everything they’ve worked for, throwing it all off balance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WARNING: This novel contains explicit content.&lt;/b&gt;</description>
