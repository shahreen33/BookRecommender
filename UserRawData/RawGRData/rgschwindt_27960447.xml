  <description>The world is slowly rebuilding. Bill Arthur is determined to create a society that’s better than the one that died — a society based on liberty and respect for the individual. Not everyone, however, shares Bill’s vision. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Roving gangs wander the countryside raping and pillaging the weak. The remnants of state and federal authority strive to impose martial law on all survivors they meet. In the midst of this sea of violence and despotism, the little town of Rocheport is an island of freedom and enlightenment. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Rocheport’s position is precarious and the last thing Bill needs is the obstructionism still being waged by those who want to see the city take a different path. Facing the pressures from those around him and his own growing desire to step away from the responsibilities of leadership, will Bill let Rocheport fall like so many others? Or will he see his dream take off by leaps and bounds?</description>

  <description>At twenty-nine, Sage Gordon has had it with love. The owner of Sage Earth Gifts, a metaphysical gift shop in the old-money town of Swansea, New York, Sage is content to run her quirky store and enjoy her dog, Rufus, and her two cats, Finlay and Babaloo. She is convinced love isn't for her. As a child, her best friend, Jimmy Cole, the boy she thought she'd marry someday, disappeared in the middle of the night with his family and was never heard from again. Haunted by the loss, she was wary about love as she moved into adulthood, never really connecting with the men she dated, clinging to the hope that Jimmy would return. When she's set up with Caleb Dunlap, a gorgeous marketing executive in New York City, Sage struggles to let go of the past, but she does. Happily, she finds herself engaged ... then ... not so much. If only Caleb had betrayed her before she sent out the save-the-date cards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an obnoxious customer causes Sage's neurotic assistant, Margie, to quit on the spot, Sage finds a friend in Godiva Jones, a woman she hires on the same spot. Godiva, twenty years older than Sage, brings much-needed friendship and wisdom. Having recently broken up with the love of her life, Freddie, Godiva also relates to the pain of heartbreak. She is disturbed, however, when Sage professes that she wants love to look away from her ... forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In no time at all, life takes another turn for Sage when an old friend (and long-time admirer), Adam Canoga, shows up at Sage Earth Gifts to let her know that he's opening a new men's clothing store in town. Discovering she is no longer engaged, he asks her out, but with regret, she tells Adam that she has no interest in dating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sage's resolve to do without love becomes an even greater challenge when an Australian visitor, Benton Bradley, walks into Sage Earth Gifts and impresses Sage with his warmth and Aussie humor. Despite her best efforts to keep love at arm's length, she finds herself developing relationships with both Adam and Benton, two completely different, yet wonderful, men. But Sage is stubborn, still haunted by her past, and finds herself wholly unsure of what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AUTHOR'S NOTE: Love, Look Away is set in the same fictional town (Swansea, NY) as my first romantic comedy, Molly Hacker Is Too Picky! This book is not, however, a sequel or a series. Love, Look Away is a stand-alone novel. Some readers will recognize several characters from Molly, including Molly herself, playing supporting roles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to readers who have never read Molly, but who may wish to do so, rest assured this novel does not give away the ending.</description>

  <description>Join self-confessed Scrabble junkie Todd Kreisman as he embarks on a journey within the online Scrabble community. He was challenged to play 10 opponents of increasing ability, from Jorge (ranked 1065) all the way up to Maria (ranked 1940). Along the way he wrote down every single move he made, every word he played, and exactly what he was thinking when he made that move, and why he did it. It's like being inside his head as he plays! And Todd even made some surprising discoveries about himself with the rapid improvements he made in just 10 short games. Will you take the 10 game challenge? 238 pages with 163 illustrations.</description>

I liked lots of thing about it, in particular his point of view and the clarity of his logic and writing. So imagine, I thought at the time, what he could do in his own professional wheelhouse?

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This mystery thriller reunites Vice President Joe Biden and President Barack Obama for a political mashup full of suspense, intrigue, and laugh out loud bromance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vice President Joe Biden is fresh out of the Obama White House and feeling adrift when his favorite railroad conductor dies in a suspicious accident, leaving behind an ailing wife and a trail of clues. To unravel the mystery, “Amtrak Joe” re-teams with the only man he’s ever fully trusted—the 44th president of the United States. Together they’ll plumb the darkest corners of Delaware, traveling from cheap motels to biker bars and beyond, as they uncover the sinister forces advancing America’s opioid epidemic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part noir thriller and part bromance novel, &lt;i&gt;Hope Never Dies&lt;/i&gt; is essentially the first published work of Obama/Biden fanfiction—and a cathartic read for anyone distressed by the current state of affairs.</description>

  <description>Three years after the catastrophe that almost eliminated the human race, the little town of Rocheport, Missouri struggles to survive. Enemies without and dissension within tax Bill Arthur’s ability to govern the community and bring about the long march back to the 21st century. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Bill learns Rocheport is not alone. Other communities are attempting to create their version of utopia and some of those versions look more like hell than heaven. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As opposition to his dream grows from within the community, Bill finds help from a most unlikely person — an eighteen-year old girl, who also wants to be the leader of Rocheport. The question in Bill’s mind is whose side is she really on? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Troubled City continues the saga of Bill Arthur, armchair libertarian philosopher, former bureaucrat, and survivalist, as he tries to pull together disparate groups to form a community that will endure and bring back civilization.</description>

  <description>Most of the world’s population has died in a mysterious plague. Those who survived did what they needed to in order to see tomorrow’s dawn. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bill Arthur has grand vision: to regain everything that was lost and make the world a better place. Settling in the little town of Rocheport Missouri, he sets out to make his dream reality. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But dreams don’t always come true. Bill finds himself in constant conflict not only with those in his own group who have a different vision of the future, but also with sinister outside forces which threaten the tiny community’s very survival. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Love Is Little continues the story of Bill Arthur and his band of survivors, following their attempts to regain technology and build a better world in the face of insurmountable obstacles and innumerable foes.</description>

      <![CDATA[Dave Shimoda has written a decent little book on Scrabble strategy for the average player. He delivers some enthusiasm and common sense ideas in readable prose.

  <description>Only a handful of survivors, yet the little community of Rocheport is torn by war, repeated attempts at reconciliation are rebuffed, and lack of cooperation threatens everyone's survival as another winter approaches. There is even murder and then an old enemy returns. Through it all, Bill Arthur, former bureaucrat, one-time scholar, student of survival, and armchair libertarian philosopher, tries to hold together the tiny community which is dependent on him and of which he is the reluctant leader. And in the process, make of it the city shining brightly on a hill for all who are in darkness to see. The Shining City is a manifesto, showing how all can live together in peace and harmony if we only trust one another and live by the Golden Rule.</description>

      <![CDATA[One of the things I’ve learned to appreciate about indie fiction is that over-the-top is often a good thing.

  <description>What would you do if you woke one morning and found almost everyone you knew dead? Your spouse, significant other, children, parents, siblings, neighbors? What if, when you went out from your neighborhood, you found out almost everyone, everywhere was dead?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of us don’t have a clue how to survive if stranded in a wilderness, let alone try to survive when most of those we meet may try to kill us. For Bill Arthur, this was the reality he woke up to one September morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In “The Morning Star”, we follow Bill Arthur on his quest to survive in a lawless land and lay the foundation for a new world where his fellow survivors and nature are all too often against him. We follow him on his journey to find a place to call home, follow him as he runs across three people with whom he shares his dream and who are willing to throw their lot in with him and make his dream theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The Morning Star” is a post-apocalyptic tale of what is possible if we only dare to dream.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When ace private detective Justinia Wright is on the case, there’s no such thing as the perfect crime.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem is Miss Wright would rather play the piano or forge a perfect masterpiece. Only when goaded by her brother and assistant, Harry, will she take a case. And then it’s murderers beware! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Justinia Wright Private Investigator Mysteries Omnibus Edition&lt;/i&gt; collects in one volume the first five books in this series. Miss Wright’s been described as a “P.I. with panache” and “a very modern Nero [Wolfe]!” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you like traditional mysteries, such as Nero Wolfe and Hercule Poirot, that are filled with wit, wise-cracking humor, and thrills and spills along the way, then look no further. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get this omnibus edition because the game is definitely afoot!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>In this unique biography of Thomas Jefferson, leading journalist and social critic Christopher Hitchens offers a startlingly new and provocative interpretation of our Founding Father. Situating Jefferson within the context of America's evolution and tracing his legacy over the past two hundred years, Hitchens brings the character of Jefferson to life as a man of his time and also as a symbolic figure beyond it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conflicted by power, Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence and acted as Minister to France yet yearned for a quieter career in the Virginia legislature. Predicting that slavery would shape the future of America's development, this professed proponent of emancipation elided the issue in the Declaration and continued to own human property. An eloquent writer, he was an awkward public speaker; a reluctant candidate, he left an indelible presidential legacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jefferson's statesmanship enabled him to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase with France, doubling the size of the nation, and he authorized the Lewis and Clark expedition, opening up the American frontier for exploration and settlement. Hitchens also analyzes Jefferson's handling of the Barbary War, a lesser-known chapter of his political career, when his attempt to end the kidnapping and bribery of Americans by the Barbary states, and the subsequent war with Tripoli, led to the building of the U.S. navy and the fortification of America's reputation regarding national defense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the background of this sophisticated analysis is a large historical drama: the fledgling nation's struggle for independence, formed in the crucible of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, and, in its shadow, the deformation of that struggle in the excesses of the French Revolution. This artful portrait of a formative figure and a turbulent era poses a challenge to anyone interested in American history -- or in the ambiguities of human nature.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;The new novel by NBA All-Star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, starring brothers Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a force to be reckoned with in the War Office, the young Mycroft Holmes is growing his network of contacts and influence, although not always in a manner that pleases his closest friend, Cyrus Douglas. A Trinidadian of African descent, Douglas has opened a home for orphaned children, while still running his successful import business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a ship carrying a cargo in which Douglas was heavily invested runs aground on the Dorset coast, Mycroft convinces his brother Sherlock to offer his services at the orphanage while Douglas travels to see what can be salvaged. Sherlock finds himself surprisingly at home among the street urchins, but is alarmed to discover that two boys show signs of drug addiction. Meanwhile Douglas also finds evidence of opium use on two dead sailors, and it becomes clear to Mycroft that the vile trade is on the ascent once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travelling to China on the trail of the drug business, Mycroft and Douglas discover that there are many in high places willing to make a profit from the misery of others. Their opponents are powerful, and the cost of stemming the deadly tide of opium is likely to be high...</description>

  <description>A minister who believes Jesus never lived. Murder by means of hari kari. An internet brothel empire. The Cool, Grey City of Love. What does it all mean? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That’s what private detective Justinia Wright and Harry, her brother and sidekick, have to find out. To do so, they have to get the prime suspect off the hook and that puts Tina in the crosshairs of her friend and lover, Lieutenant Cal Swenson of Homicide. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the cold and wintry land of Minnesota Nice, Tina and Harry once again cross paths with those who don’t play nice. Those who’d rather see you dead than at the church lutefisk supper. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But Jesus Never Wept&lt;/i&gt; is the third book in CW Hawes’s Justinia Wright, Private Investigator Mysteries series. Fans of Sharon McCone, Kinsey Milhone, VI Warshawski, and Nero Wolfe will love this whodunit where nothing is as it seems and love does not conquer all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once again the game is afoot. Get in on the mystery today!</description>

  <description>The year is 1953 in a world where World War II never happened, the malaise of the Great Depression lingers on, airships rule the skies, swing is still king, and Streamline Moderne never went out of style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph Stalin has just died and Hall Media has sent star journalists Lady Dru Drummond and Karl Weidner to Moscow to cover the transition of Soviet leadership. Meanwhile, Russian royalists see Stalin’s death as their best opportunity to put a czar back on the throne. But Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy have their own ideas concerning the Soviet state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Dru finds herself in the middle of international intrigue when she is swept off her feet by the dashing Captain Mikhail Turbanev, a key leader in the Czarist cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Moscow Affair is a dieselpunk alternative history packed with romance and adventure, where friendships and love are tested heart and soul.</description>

  <description>A fascinating tour through the evolution of the human diet, and how we can improve our health by understanding our complicated history with food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are few areas of modern life that are burdened by as much information and advice, often contradictory, as our diet and health: eat a lot of meat, eat no meat; whole-grains are healthy, whole-grains are a disaster; eat everything in moderation; eat only certain foods--and on and on. In One Hundred Million Years of Food biological anthropologist Stephen Le explains how cuisines of different cultures are a result of centuries of evolution, finely tuned to our biology and surroundings. Today many cultures have strayed from their ancestral diets, relying instead on mass-produced food often made with chemicals that may be contributing to a rise in so-called "Western diseases," such as cancer, heart disease, and obesity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travelling around the world to places as far-flung as Vietnam, Kenya, India, and the US, Stephen Le introduces us to people who are growing, cooking, and eating food using both traditional and modern methods, striving for a sustainable, healthy diet. In clear, compelling arguments based on scientific research, Le contends that our ancestral diets provide the best first line of defense in protecting our health and providing a balanced diet. Fast-food diets, as well as strict regimens like paleo or vegan, in effect highjack our biology and ignore the complex nature of our bodies. In One Hundred Million Years of Food Le takes us on a guided tour of evolution, demonstrating how our diets are the result of millions of years of history, and how we can return to a sustainable, healthier way of eating.</description>

  <description>It’s been ten years since a mysterious incident in the South China Sea annihilated a US Navy destroyer and its Navy SEAL team. Only one man survived this horrific tragedy. Now, as more of these strange, supernatural events are happening around the world—with deadly consequences—the US Navy calls on sole survivor Harold “Hawk” Masters to put a stop to the evil forces behind these crimes.&lt;br /&gt;Masters reluctantly returns, dispatched to lead an elite team of soldiers like him—all survivors of the terrifying, evil deeds of “the other side.” As these frightening events escalate at an alarming rate, SEAL Team 13 is put to the test, battling malevolent undead creatures that threaten the security of the nation—and the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not everyone supports the government’s new interest in facing off against the unnatural forces that threaten the welfare of its citizens. Could Hawk Masters’ secret military force also be forced to fight shadowy opponents from within?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From world-building author Evan Currie, SEAL Team 13 is a dark, riveting, and action-packed tale of military intrigue and supernatural horror.</description>

  <description>Rand Hart is flying back to the United States on the Hindenburg after a very profitable winter touring the casinos of Europe. His plans for rest and relaxation are put on hold when a wealthy German industrialist offers him a deal he can’t refuse. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the promise of easy money, Hart finds himself in possession of a mysterious box that needs to be delivered to Rio de Janeiro in 6 days. Nothing, though, is ever as simple as it seems. There are others who have an interest in the little box and are determined to stop him from making his delivery. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hart discovers he has entered a high stakes political game where the players are shadowed and more than his delivery money is on the line. He may have unknowingly just gambled away his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rand Hart and the Pajama Putsch is a 22,500 word Dieselpunk alternative history adventure novella with a healthy dollop of romance and a little bit of luck.</description>

  <description>If you think the world is coming to an end, think again: people are living longer, healthier, freer, and happier lives, and while our problems are formidable, the solutions lie in the Enlightenment ideal of using reason and science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the world really falling apart? Is the ideal of progress obsolete? In this elegant assessment of the human condition in the third millennium, cognitive scientist and public intellectual Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophecies of doom, which play to our psychological biases. Instead, follow the data: In seventy-five jaw-dropping graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise, not just in the West, but worldwide. This progress is not the result of some cosmic force. It is a gift of the Enlightenment: the conviction that reason and science can enhance human flourishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far from being a naïve hope, the Enlightenment, we now know, has worked. But more than ever, it needs a vigorous defense. The Enlightenment project swims against currents of human nature–tribalism, authoritarianism, demonization, magical thinking–which demagogues are all too willing to exploit. Many commentators, committed to political, religious, or romantic ideologies, fight a rearguard action against it. The result is a corrosive fatalism and a willingness to wreck the precious institutions of liberal democracy and global cooperation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With intellectual depth and literary flair, Enlightenment Now makes the case for reason, science, and humanism: the ideals we need to confront our problems and continue our progress.</description>

  <description>When high speed internet became widely available a few years ago, growing numbers of people began to worry that their porn use was running out of control. Far from preparing them for fulfilling relationships, viewing an endless stream of porn videos led to unexpected symptoms. Perhaps most surprisingly, for the first time in history erectile dysfunction was becoming a significant problem for young men. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This led to one of the largest informal experiments in the history of science. Tens of thousands of people have tried abstaining from sexually stimulating material in a process they call ‘rebooting’. Many of them reported startling changes, from improved concentration and elevated mood to a greater capacity for real-life intimacy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gary Wilson&lt;/b&gt; has listened to the stories of those who have tried giving up internet porn and related them to an account of how the reward system of the brain interacts with its environment. And now a growing body of research in neuroscience is confirming what these pioneers have discovered for themselves – internet pornography can be seriously addictive and damaging. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Your Brain on Porn&lt;/i&gt; Wilson provides a concise introduction to the phenomenon of internet porn addiction that draws on both first-person accounts and the findings of cognitive neuroscience. In a voice that is generous and humane, he also offers advice for those who want to stop using internet pornography. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The publication of &lt;i&gt;Your Brain on Porn&lt;/i&gt; is a landmark in our attempts to understand, and remain balanced in, a world where addiction is big business.</description>

  <description>Tony Razzolito, AKA the Razzman, is tired of dead-end sales jobs and refuses to get another, despite a huge blowout with his wife. Instead, he decides to pursue his dream of becoming a PI. He just has to figure out how to get started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just hours later, Tony receives a phone call from his friend, Detective Joe Humphrey - his wife has been murdered. The devastating news sends Tony’s emotions on a roller coaster ride he didn’t expect. Yes, their marriage had issues, what marriage doesn't? But now... now he would never have the opportunity to work things out, to make amends, or to say he's sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shocked, pissed off and emotionally overwhelmed, he is determined to find the killer and insists on helping Joe with the investigation. When clues to another woman's death tie the two crimes together, Tony may discover that some secrets about his wife are better left hidden.</description>

  <description>The first definitive biography of Bob Hope, featuring exclusive and extensive reporting that makes the persuasive case that he was most important entertainer of the twentieth century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born in 1903, and until his death in 2003, Bob Hope was the only entertainer to achieve top-rated success in every major mass-entertainment medium, from vaudeville to television and everything in between. He virtually invented modern stand-up comedy. His tours to entertain US troops and patriotic radio broadcasts, along with his all-American, brash-but-cowardly movie character, helped to ease the nation's jitters during the stressful days of World War II. He helped redefine the very notion of what it means to be a star: a savvy businessman, pioneer of the brand extension (churning out books, writing a newspaper column, hosting a golf tournament), and public-spirited entertainer whose Christmas military tours and tireless work for charity set the standard for public service in Hollywood. But he became a polarizing figure during the Vietnam War, and the book sheds new light on his close relationship with President Richard Nixon during those embattled years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob Hope is a household name. However, as Richard Zoglin shows in this revelatory biography, there is still much to be learned about this most public of figures, from his secret first marriage and his stint in reform school, to his indiscriminate womanizing and his ambivalent relationship with Bing Crosby and Johnny Carson. Hope could be cold, self-centered, tight with a buck, and perhaps the least introspective man in Hollywood. But he was also a dogged worker, gracious with fans, and generous with friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hope&lt;/i&gt; is both a celebration of an entertainer whose vast contribution has never been properly appreciated, and a complex portrait of a gifted but flawed man, who, unlike many Hollywood stars, truly loved being famous, appreciated its responsibilities, and handled celebrity with extraordinary grace.</description>

  <description>Arthur P. Besterman, criminal lawyer and reformed alcoholic, was the first to go. Counsel to Vancouver's assorted shifters and grifters, Besterman almost always lost his cases. But a recent victory defending a low-life client might be a clue as to why he as bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat. Then someone takes a pot shot at philandering lawyer Brian Pomeroy after he successfully defends a group of controversial eco-terrorists. All of a sudden lawyers whose clients are less than savoury start second-guessing the ethics of their profession, and going to court becomes possible bloodsport.In a cat-and-mouse game involving the better part of Vancouver's legal community, Pomeroy's firm (the famous Pomeroy, MacArthur, Brovak and Sage from the best-selling &lt;i&gt;Dance of Shiva&lt;/i&gt;) pieces together some very disturbing truths about lawyers and the law. As one sleazy lawyer after another disappears, the reader can't help but ponder the wisdom of Shakespeare's famous dictum, "The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers."</description>

  <description>"Possibly his best travel book...an observant and frequently hilarious account of a trip that took him to 51 Pacific Islands."&lt;br /&gt;TIME&lt;br /&gt;Renowned travel writer and novelist Paul Theroux has been many places in his life and tried almost everything. But this trip in and around the lands of the Pacific may be his boldest, most fascinating yet. From New Zealand's rain forests, to crocodile-infested New Guinea, over isolated atolls, through dirty harbors, daring weather and coastlines, he travels by Kayak wherever the winds take him--and what he discovers is the world to explore and try to understand.</description>

      <![CDATA[Sometimes there is an awkwardness to the prose of Lisette Brodey. It’s almost like she is wrestling you; to push you face to face and say: <br />“Pay Attention. You need to hear this!”<br />I note this because her subject are the poor, the lost, those in pain, the disenfranchised. And Brodey has a feel...]]>

  <description>A ghost story for adults. Like all good coaching inns, the Green Man is said to boast a resident ghost: Dr Thomas Underhill, a notorious seventeenth-century practitioner of black arts and sexual deviancy, rumoured to have killed his wife. However, the landlord, Maurice Allington, is the sole witness to the renaissance of the malevolent Underhill. Led by an anxious desire to vindicate his sanity, Allington strives to uncover the key to Underhill's satanic powers. All the while, the skeletons in the cupboard of Allington's own domestic affairs rattle to get out too.</description>

  <description>What price a meal? Murder?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starving artist Franz Holtmann that is not an academic question. Unable to sell his art in the worst winter the city has seen in years, Holtmann is slowly starving and freezing to death in his garret apartment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a savior appears, who will take care of all his needs. All Holtmann has to do is kill his former employer. At first the idea fills him with revulsion. Hunger, however, as Holtmann learns, is a powerful motivator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he agrees, his mysterious savior showers him with money and promises of more. For Franz Holtmann, it appears the good life is before him. That is until the night he becomes aware of a deadly reality unleashed by unholy rites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the Next Day Brings is a short story rooted in the Cthulhu Mythos tradition of H. P. Lovecraft.</description>

  <description>Hunter S. Thompson, “smart hillbilly,” boy of the South, born and bred in Louisville, Kentucky, son of an insurance salesman and a stay-at-home mom, public school-educated, jailed at seventeen on a bogus petty robbery charge, member of the U.S. Air Force (Airmen Second Class), copy boy for &lt;i&gt;Time,&lt;/i&gt; writer for &lt;i&gt;The National Observer, &lt;/i&gt;et cetera. From the outset he was the Wild Man of American journalism with a journalistic appetite that touched on subjects that drove his sense of justice and intrigue, from biker gangs and 1960s counterculture to presidential campaigns and psychedelic drugs. He lived larger than life and pulled it up around him in a mad effort to make it as electric, anger-ridden, and drug-fueled as possible.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now Juan Thompson tells the story of his father and of their getting to know each other during their forty-one fraught years together. He writes of the many dark times, of how far they ricocheted away from each other, and of how they found their way back before it was too late. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He writes of growing up in an old farmhouse in a narrow mountain valley outside of Aspen—Woody Creek, Colorado, a ranching community with Hereford cattle and clover fields . . . of the presence of guns in the house, the boxes of ammo on the kitchen shelves behind the glass doors of the country cabinets, where others might have placed china and knickknacks . . . of climbing on the back of Hunter’s Bultaco Matador trail motorcycle as a young boy, and father and son roaring up the dirt road, trailing a cloud of dust . . . of being taken to bars in town as a small boy, Hunter holding court while Juan crawled around under the bar stools, picking up change and taking his found loot to Carl’s Pharmacy to buy Archie comic books . . . of going with his parents as a baby to a Ken Kesey/Hells Angels party with dozens of people wandering around the forest in various stages of undress, stoned on pot, tripping on LSD . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; He writes of his growing fear of his father; of the arguments between his parents reaching frightening levels; and of his finally fighting back, trying to protect his mother as the state troopers are called in to separate father and son. And of the inevitable—of mother and son driving west in their Datsun to make a new home, a new life, away from Hunter; of Juan’s first taste of what “normal” could feel like . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We see Juan going to Concord Academy, a stranger in a strange land, coming from a school that was a log cabin in the middle of hay fields, Juan without manners or socialization . . . going on to college at Tufts; spending a crucial week with his father; Hunter asking for Juan’s opinion of his writing; and he writes of their dirt biking on a hilltop overlooking Woody Creek Valley, acting as if all the horrible things that had happened between them had never taken place, and of being there, together, side by side . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And finally, movingly, he writes of their long, slow pull toward reconciliation . . . of Juan’s marriage and the birth of his own son; of watching Hunter love his grandson and Juan’s coming to understand how Hunter loved &lt;i&gt;him;&lt;/i&gt; of Hunter’s growing illness, and Juan’s becoming both son and father to his father . . .</description>

  <description>There are places we were never meant to go... &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt;A woman searching for a sister lost at sea. A man bent on finding lost treasure. A mother who has lost all hope. A maniac who believes all life exists for his pleasure. The man who would keep them all safe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Together, they will all seek below the waves for treasures long buried, and riches beyond belief. But those treasures hide something. Something ancient, something dark. A creature that exists only to feed on those that would enter into its realm. A creature... of The Deep.</description>

  <description>A debilitating disease. A tantalizing, yet dangerous, breakthrough cure. Will it be life and love or death and destruction?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of his beloved wife’s death, Detective Chris Ravello’s life is in shambles. Overwhelmed by grief and dogged by an unrelenting, devastating disease, Chris abruptly resigns as the NYPD’s Chief of the Division of Medical Crimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But his hopes for a healthier, less-troubled life are short-lived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A harrowing near-death experience forces Chris to submit to a series of risky, ill-advised, and experimental treatments that will either cure him or kill him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Chris’ best friend, NYPD Detective Kevin Kennedy, investigates a series of perplexing and appalling deaths, he uncovers a disturbing truth – Ravello’s cure has already killed four other patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when all seems lost, hope comes from the unlikeliest of sources – an old nemesis making incredible claims:&lt;br /&gt;Michelle Ravello is alive and he can lead the detectives to her and their killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But can Kennedy and Ravello trust one sociopath to catch another? And what is the terrible price they must pay for his cooperation?</description>

  <description>Four months have passed since Edmund Lowell vanished in Minneapolis. The police have done little to find the homeless transient and his desperate mother finally turns to Private Investigator Justinia Wright to find her son. The former CIA operative hates missing person cases, and refuses this one--until Mr. Lowell agrees to pay a hefty retainer. Even so, it takes the constant badgering of her brother, Harry, to get her to actually work on the case. And when she does, her investigation takes her into the world of the homeless where she uncovers a dark and sinister secret. Festival of Death introduces us to private eye Justinia Wright and her "Watson," her brother and majordomo, Harry, as they work to ferret out the secrets lurking in the dark side of the Twin Cities."</description>

When eccentric billionaire, Ellis Holloway, hires renegade marine biologist, Sam Aston, to investigate the legend of a monster in a remote Finnish lake, Aston envisions an easy paycheck and a chance to clear his gambling debts. But he gets much more. There is something terrible living beneath the dark waters of Lake Kaarme and it is hungry. As the death toll mounts, Aston faces superstitious locals, a power-hungry police chief, and a benefactor's descent into madness as he races to find the legendary beast of the lake.</description>

  <description>Over the course of his 60 years, Christopher Hitchens has been a citizen of both the United States and the United Kingdom. He has been both a socialist opposed to the war in Vietnam and a supporter of the U.S. war against Islamic extremism in Iraq. He has been both a foreign correspondent in some of the world's most dangerous places and a legendary bon vivant with an unquenchable thirst for alcohol and literature. He is a fervent atheist, raised as a Christian, by a mother whose Jewish heritage was not revealed to him until her suicide. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In other words, Christopher Hitchens contains multitudes. He sees all sides of an argument. And he believes the personal is political.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is the story of his life, a life lived large.</description>

      <![CDATA[I suppose it can be said that I am going through my Christopher Hitchens phase. And, when being honest to myself, I read him because he is both fascinating and funny. His views are complex and nuanced; not everyone’s cup of scotch. Still, they draw you into his mind. Hitch-22, his memoir, relies...]]>

  <description>Meet Dani Greene—a fourth-generation maple syrup maker dealing with a first-class troublemaker…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The annual pre-Thanksgiving pancake-eating contest is a big event in Sugar Grove, New Hampshire. It’s sponsored by the Sap Bucket Brigade, aka the firefighters auxiliary, and the Greene family farm provides the syrup. But when obnoxious outsider Alanza Speedwell flops face first into a stack of flapjacks during the contest, Greener Pastures’ syrup falls under suspicion.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dani knows the police—including her ex-boyfriend—are barking up the wrong tree, and she’s determined to pull her loved ones out of a very sticky situation. The odds may be stacked against her, but she’s got to tap the real killer before some poor sap in her own family ends up trading the sugar house for the Big House…</description>

  <description>Prehistoric creatures have again invaded Crater Lake National Park &lt;br /&gt;…and this time there’s more than one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DINOSAUR LAKE II: Dinosaurs Arising &lt;br /&gt;by Kathryn Meyer Griffith &lt;br /&gt;Henry Shore has been Chief Park Ranger at Crater Lake National Park for thirteen years now and thought the days when he’d had to fight a rogue dinosaur that lived in the caves below the lake were long over. &lt;br /&gt;Until one of his park rangers, to save a visitor’s life, is in a deadly struggle out in the woods with a new breed of dinosaur worse than the last one. It’s as big as a man, but this one is a young one. And growing. &lt;br /&gt;Then more of the creatures begin to show up everywhere, threatening people and destroying the tranquility and safety of his beloved park. &lt;br /&gt;A tourist trolley filled with fifteen people is snatched up off the crater’s rim by another version of the younger one…but this one has grown into a giant with fangs, claws and a deadly tail. &lt;br /&gt;And this one has wings. &lt;br /&gt;Ugly Gargoyles, Henry calls them. &lt;br /&gt;For this one isn’t alone. &lt;br /&gt;They’re flying beyond the park’s boundaries into the neighboring towns. &lt;br /&gt;So Henry, with the help of his son-in-law, a paleontologist named Justin, and a band of brave park rangers, and a few good soldiers, must not only protect his park and his people from monsters once more but find their lair and destroy it and them before the creatures kill again. ***</description>

  <description>M. J. Holliday has the unusual ability to talk to the dead. But when it comes to a vengeful ghost and a mysterious drowning, this time she may be in over her head…. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THAT SINKING FEELING &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kidwella Castle in northern Wales is rumored to be haunted by a deadly ghost—the Grim Widow, who allegedly drowns unsuspecting guests in the castle’s moat. Not long after M. J. and her crew arrive at the castle to film their ghost-hunting cable TV show, Ghoul Getters, two new victims are added to the Widow’s grisly roster. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fear ripples through the castle, especially when it’s discovered that the victims may have had help into their watery graves from the land of the living. The local inspector suspects father-son serial killers, but M. J. thinks that theory is all wet. To catch the true culprit she will need to dive deep into the castle’s past and bring some long buried secrets to the surface.</description>

  <description>On June 8, 2010, while on a book tour for his bestselling memoir, &lt;i&gt;Hitch-22&lt;/i&gt;, Christopher Hitchens was stricken in his New York hotel room with excruciating pain in his chest and thorax. As he would later write in the first of a series of award-winning columns for "Vanity Fair," he suddenly found himself being deported "from the country of the well across the stark frontier that marks off the land of malady." Over the next eighteen months, until his death in Houston on December 15, 2011, he wrote constantly and brilliantly on politics and culture, astonishing readers with his capacity for superior work even in extremis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the course of his ordeal battling esophageal cancer, Hitchens adamantly and bravely refused the solace of religion, preferring to confront death with both eyes open. In this account of his affliction, he describes the torments of illness, discusses its taboos, and explores how disease transforms experience and changes our relationship to the world around us. By turns personal and philosophical, Hitchens embraces the full panoply of human emotions as cancer invades his body and compels him to grapple with the enigma of mortality.</description>

  <description>Ulysses S. Grant's life has typically been misunderstood. All too often he is caricatured as a chronic loser and inept businessman, fond of drinking to excess; or as the triumphant but brutal Union general of the Civil War; or as a credulous and hapless president whose tenure came to symbolize the worst excesses of the Gilded Age. These stereotypes don't come close to capturing adequately his spirit and the sheer magnitude of his monumental accomplishments. A biographer at the height of his powers, Chernow has produced a portrait of Grant that is a masterpiece, the first to provide a complete understanding of the general and president whose fortunes rose and fell with dizzying speed and frequency.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before the Civil War, Grant was flailing. His business ventures had been dismal, and despite distinguished service in the Mexican War, he ended up resigning from the army in disgrace amid recurring accusations of drunkenness. But in the Civil War, Grant began to realize his remarkable potential, soaring through the ranks of the Union army, prevailing at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign and ultimately defeating the legendary Confederate general Robert E. Lee after a series of unbelievably bloody battles in Virginia. Along the way Grant endeared himself to President Lincoln and became his most trusted general and the strategic genius of the war effort. His military fame translated into a two-term presidency, but one plagued by corruption scandals involving his closest staff. All the while Grant himself remained more or less above reproach. But, more importantly, he never failed to seek freedom and justice for black Americans, working to crush the Ku Klux Klan and earning the admiration of Frederick Douglass, who called him 'the vigilant, firm, impartial, and wise protector of my race." After his presidency, he was again brought low by a trusted colleague, this time a dashing young swindler on Wall Street, but he resuscitated his image by working with Mark Twain to publish his memoirs, which are recognized as a masterpiece of the genre. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With his famous lucidity, breadth, and meticulousness, Chernow finds the threads that bind these disparate stories together, shedding new light on the man whom Walt Whitman described as "nothing heroic... and yet the greatest hero." His probing portrait of Grant's lifelong struggle with alcoholism transforms our understanding of the man at the deepest level. This is America's greatest biographer, bringing movingly to life one of America's finest but most underappreciated presidents. The definitive biography, &lt;i&gt;Grant&lt;/i&gt; is a grand synthesis of painstaking research and literary brilliance that makes sense of all sides of Grant's life, explaining how this simple Midwesterner could at once be so ordinary and so extraordinary.</description>

  <description>An ancient predator has been reborn in the caves beneath Crater Lake…and it’s hungry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ex-cop Henry Shore has been Chief Park Ranger at Crater Lake National Park for eight years and he likes his park and his life the way it’s been. Safe. Tranquil. Predictable. But he’s about to be tested in so many ways. First the earthquakes begin…people begin to go missing…then there’s some mysterious water creature that’s taken up residence in the caves below Crater Lake and it’s not only growing in size, it’s aggressive and cunning…and very hungry. &lt;br /&gt;And it’s decided it likes human beings. To eat.&lt;br /&gt;And it can come up onto land.&lt;br /&gt;So Henry, with the help of his wife, Ann; a young paleontologist named Justin; and a band of brave men must not only protect his park and his people from the monster but somehow find where it lives and destroy it…before it can kill again. ***</description>

  <description>The death of Christopher Hitchens in December 2011 prematurely silenced a voice that was among the most admired of contemporary writers. For more than forty years, Hitchens delivered to numerous publications on both sides of the Atlantic essays that were astonishingly wide-ranging and provocative. The judges for the PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay, posthumously bestowed on Hitchens, praised him for the way he wrote “with fervor about the books and writers he loved and with unbridled venom about ideas and political figures he loathed.” He could write, the judges went on to say, with “undisguised brio, mining the resources of the language as if alert to every possibility of color and inflection.” He was, as Benjamin Schwarz, his editor at &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt; magazine, recalled, “slashing and lively, biting and funny—and with a nuanced sensibility and a refined ear that he kept in tune with his encyclopedic knowledge and near photographic memory of English poetry.” And as Michael Dirda, writing in the &lt;i&gt;Times Literary Supplement&lt;/i&gt;, observed, Hitchens “was a flail and a scourge, but also a gift to readers everywhere.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author of five previous volumes of selected writings, including the international bestseller &lt;i&gt;Arguably&lt;/i&gt;, Hitchens left at his death nearly 250,000 words of essays not yet published in book form. &lt;i&gt;And Yet…&lt;/i&gt; assembles a selection that usefully adds to Hitchens’s oeuvre. It ranges from the literary to the political and is, by turns, a banquet of entertaining and instructive delights, including essays on Orwell, Lermontov, Chesterton, Fleming, Naipaul, Rushdie, Pamuk, and Dickens, among others, as well as his laugh-out-loud self-mocking “makeover.” The range and quality of Hitchens’s essays transcend the particular occasions for which they were originally written. Often prescient, always pugnacious, and formidably learned, Hitchens was a polemicist for the ages. With this posthumous volume, his reputation and his readers will continue to grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christopher Hitchens was the cartographer of his own literary and political explorations. He sought assiduously to affirm—and to reaffirm—the ideas of secularism, reason, libertarianism, internationalism, and solidarity, values always under siege and ever in need of defending. Henry James once remarked, “Nothing is my last word on anything.” For Hitchens, as for James, there was always more to be said.</description>

  <description>When President James Garfield was shot, no one in the United States was more dismayed than his Vice President, Chester Arthur. For years Arthur had been perceived as unfit to govern, not only by critics and his fellow citizens but by his own conscience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From his promising start, Arthur had become a political hack, a shill for Roscoe Conkling, and Arthur knew better even than his detractors that he failed to meet the high standard a president must uphold. And yet, from the moment President Arthur took office, he proved to be not just honest but courageous, going up against the very forces that had controlled him for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arthur surprised everyone--and gained many enemies--when he swept house and courageously took on corruption, civil rights for blacks, and issues of land for Native Americans. His short presidency proved to be a turning point of American history, in many ways a preview of our own times, and is a sterling example of how someone can "rise to the occasion."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This beautifully written biography tells the dramatic, untold story of a virtually forgotten American president, a machine politician and man-about-town in Gilded Age New York who stumbled into the highest office in the land only to rediscover his better self, right when his nation needed him.</description>

      <![CDATA[Presidential biographies are something of a sub-genre and I found myself wondering how many I had read. Not many. So why this one; of all places to start? I guess it has to do with my fascination with gilded age New York and the unpredictability of life and politics. Who was this Arthur guy anywa...]]>

  <description>Are we doing enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you concerned about the state of our planet and hope that governments and corporations will find a sustainable way for us to live? If you do not think about it too hard, that may work, but will it? Left on their own, with drivers of popularity and profits, I am not too convinced that it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The missing part of this equation is you and me. Individuals who believe that corporations and governments can do better. Individuals who believe that through action, we can buy a bit more time to develop and implement solutions to our critical issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I hear a groan out there when you read the word ‘actions’? Do not worry! Most of the actions that I am referring to will not only help save the planet, but will benefit you right away through saving money, time, better health, and having a happier life in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sustainability goes beyond controlling our consumption and pollution. There are key social, political, and economic areas that need to be addressed as well, and there are several steps that individuals can take to help in these areas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who feel we could do more, this book is for you and is loaded with actionable activities, the reasons for doing them, and explores why we are not doing them already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every journey starts with a first step. Hopefully this book will lead to those first sustainable steps and that will change the world.</description>

  <description>Dave Robicheaux has spent his life confronting the age-old adage that the sins of the father pass onto the son. But what has his mother's legacy left him? Dead to him since youth, Mae Guillory has been shuttered away in the deep recesses of Dave's mind. He's lived with the fact that he would never really know what happened to the woman who left him to the devices of his whiskey-driven father. But deep down, he still feels the loss of his mother and knows the infinite series of disappointments in her life could not have come to a good end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While helping out an old friend, Dave is stunned when a pimp looks at him sideways and asks him if he is Mae Guillory's boy, the whore a bunch of cops murdered 30 years ago. The pimp goes on to insinuate that the cops who dumped her body in the bayou were on the take and continue to thrive in the New Orleans area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave's search for his mother's killers leads him to the darker places in his past and solving this case teaches him what it means to be his mother's son. &lt;i&gt;Purple Cane Road&lt;/i&gt; has the dimensions of a classic-passion, murder, and nearly heartbreaking poignancy-wrapped in a wonderfully executed plot that surprises from start to finish.</description>

A little, fog, a companion, a death, some mood, a few clichés (“The game’s afoot!), and you are good to go.

      <![CDATA[The medieval mystery holds an odd appeal. Those times are long departed and yet we want to impose a format that is modern in its sensibility. Much is known of the middle ages and we can see much we recognize in, say, the writings of Chaucer. Michael Jecks is surely one of the most skilled practit...]]>

  <description>'Grappig,' zei mr. Moto, 'hoe het leven soms aan een heel dun en o zo teer draadje kan hangen. Ik heb ú niet gedood mr. Kingman, omdat u verstand heeft van vliegtuigen. U hebt mij niet uit de weg geruimd, omdat u er nog geen kans toe hebt gekregen.'&lt;br /&gt;De dunne, tere draad van Kingmans leven wordt korte tijd later door mr. Moto, vriendelijk, doch beslist, afgesneden. Dat is één spion minder, maar het aantal kapers op de kust is daarmee nog niet uitgeput. Het doet mr. Moto echter genoegen dat hij niet opnieuw tot zulke drastische maatregelen behoeft over te gaan. Hij komt bijtijds tussenbeide om de vruchten te plukken van het werk dat anderen hebben verzet. En lacht dan. Niet uitbunding, maar fijntjes en ingetogen, zoals men van een Japans geheim agent mag verwachten. Maar dit is dan ook de laatste keer.</description>

  <description>In mid-1962, Playboy founder Hugh Hefner was given a partial transcript of an interview with Miles Davis. It covered jazz, of course, but it also included Davis’s ruminations on race, politics and culture. Fascinated, Hef sent the writer—future Pulitzer-Prize-winning author Alex Haley, an unknown at the time—back to glean even more opinion and insight from Davis. The resulting exchange, published in the September 1962 issue, became the first official Playboy Interview and kicked off a remarkable run of public inquisition that continues today—and that has featured just about every cultural titan of the last half century.&lt;br /&gt;To celebrate the Interview’s 50th anniversary, the editors of Playboy have culled 50 of its most (in)famous Interviews and will publish them over the course of 50 weekdays (from September 4, 2012 to November 12, 2012) via Amazon’s Kindle Direct platform. Here is the interview with the journalist Hunter S. Thompson from the November 1974 issue.</description>

      <![CDATA[Ian Fleming was a complex outcome of strange and dramatic times. His novels are unique and much better written than most people think. And his character, like Sherlock Holmes, is immortal. This interview is fascinating and covers a lot of ground. And yet you leave it with the sense that Fleming g...]]>

  <description>When Chelsea Handler needs to get a few things off her chest, she appeals to a higher power - vodka. You would too if you found out that your boyfriend was having an affair with a Peekapoo or if you had to pretend to be honeymooning with your father in order to upgrade to first class. Welcome to Chelsea's world - a place where absurdity reigns supreme and a quick wit is the best line of defense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this hilarious, deliciously skewed collection, Chelsea mines her past for stories about her family, relationships, and career that are at once singular and ridiculous. Whether she's convincing her third-grade class that she has been tapped to play Goldie Hawn's daughter in the sequel to Private Benjamin, deciding to be more egalitarian by dating a redhead, or looking out for a foulmouthed, rum-swilling little person who looks just like her... only smaller, Chelsea has a knack for getting herself into the most outrageous situations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea&lt;/i&gt; showcases the candor and irresistible turns of phrase that have made her one of the freshest voices in comedy today.</description>

  <description>It should be an open–and–shut case. Canada’s leading radio–show host, Kevin Brace, has confessed to killing his young wife. He had come to the door of his luxury condominium with his hands covered in blood and told the newspaper deliveryman: “I killed her.” His wife’s body lay in the bathtub of their suite, fatal knife wound just below the sternum.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now all that should remain is legal procedure: document the crime scene, prosecute the case, and be done with it. The trouble is, Brace refuses to talk to anyone—including his own lawyer—after muttering those incriminating words. With the discovery that the victim was actually a self-destructive alcoholic, the appearance of strange fingerprints at the crime scene, and a revealing courtroom cross-examination, the seemingly simple case begins to take on all the complexities of a hotly–contested murder trial.</description>

  <description>There are many ways of crushing the human spirit: few in the workplace know this better than aggressively targeted employees. The National Standard of Canada is an important risk-mitigation tool for ensuring all workplaces are psychologically healthy and safe. About five percent of Canadian employees are targeted by workplace mobbing and can be traumatized by the ganging-up tactics. Mobbing awareness creates empowerment for those targeted, their families, bystanders, all levels of management and business leaders. Extensive research, the survivors' courageous stories and a business case describe the pervasive social and economic impacts. An Inconvenient Whistleblower creates awareness, assists the targeted employees and describes effective actions that reduce the damaging consequences of workplace aggression. You will discover: the contradictions between the respectful workplace policies and the harsh realities of mentally injurious workplaces; how the targeted employees are humiliated, intimidated and often forced out of their workplaces; a transitional process that successfully helps survivors recover from their mobbing experiences; and numerous mental-health protection strategies that improve employee engagement and productivity while reducing preventable social, health care and economic costs. Jean Jones is a workplace mobbing specialist and a passionate advocate for workplace mental health. As well, Jean is a business coach, who will be certified as a Solution-Focused Brief Coach in 2013. Her solution-focused coaching approach empowers clients and reinforces their resourcefulness. Jean received a M.A. at the University of Toronto specializing in organizational change management and business coaching. Previously she directed corporate expansions and project management operations. Prior to change management consulting, Jean directed municipal amalgamation projects, following numerous years of senior municipal administration. For many years, Jean was the administrator, on alternating days, of two municipalities in Central Ontario. She lives in Lindsay, Ontario."</description>

  <description>In 1938, Nazi Germany prepares to extend its reach far beyond its borders. The key to domination lies in a secret that would make their army not only unbeatable, but un-killable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MI-6, knowing that something potentially devastating is developing, recruits scholar and novelist John Ronald Reuel Tolkien to travel to Germany to find out what this might be, using the German popularity of his children’s novel THE HOBBIT as cover. Joining him there is MI-6 agent Ian Fleming, still years away from his own writing career but posing as a Reuters journalist. Together, Tolkien and Fleming will get to the heart of the secret – and they will face a fury greater than even their prodigious imaginations considered possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both an astounding work of suspense and a literary treasure trove to delight fans of either author, NO DAWN FOR MEN is a nonstop adventure.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Blood Books are now available in "Blood Ties" TV tie-in editions. View our TV tie-in feature page here here.&lt;/b&gt;Vicki Nelson, formerly of Toronto’s homicide unit and now a private detective, witnesses the first of many vicious attacks that are now plaguing the city of Toronto. As death follows unspeakable death, Vicki is forced to renew her tempestuous relationship with her former partner, Mike Celluci, to stop these forces of dark magic—along with another, unexpected ally…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry Fitzroy, the illegitimate son of King Henry VIII, has learned over the course of his long life how to blend with humans, how to deny the call for blood in his veins. Without him, Vicki and Mike would not survive the ancient force of chaos that has been unleashed upon the world—but in doing so, his identity may be exposed, and his life forfeit.</description>

  <description>Exciting new approach to biography by an acclaimed historian and biographer: King Edward Vll (Bertie) seen through the eyes of the women in his life. Entertaining and different, this enjoyable study of a flawed yet characterful Prince of Wales wears its scholarship lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edward Vll, who gave his name to the Edwardian Age and died in 1911, was King of England for the final 10 years of his life. He was 59 when at last he came to power. Known as Bertie, and the eldest son of Victoria and Albert, he was bullied by both his parents.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His mother, Queen Victoria, the first and most powerful woman in his life, blamed Bertie's scandalous womanising for his father's early demise. Although Bertie was heir to the throne, she refused to give him any proper responsibilities, as a result of which he spent his time eating (his waist measurement was 48 inches and his nickname was 'Edward the Wide'), betting on race-horses and shooting grouse. He was married off to Alexandra of Denmark, who was beautiful but infantile, lavishing her affection on her doggies and pet bunnies.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bertie's numerous mistresses included the society hostess Daisy Brook ('Babbling Brook') and the gorgeous but fragile Lillie Langtry (with whom 'played house' in a specially built hide-away home). The last of the women in his life was the clever and manipulative Alice Keppel. He always placed her at dinner next to his most important guests, because of her grasp of politics, her brilliant conversation and her formidable skills at the Bridge table.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Bertie finally became king, he did a good job, especially in foreign policy. This colourful book gives him due credit, while painting a vivid portrait of the age in all its excess and eccentricity, hypocrisy and heartbreak.</description>

  <description>Three years after giving up drink, Jowita Bydlowska found herself throwing back a glass of champagne like it was ginger ale. "It's a special occasion," she said to her boyfriend. And indeed it was. It was a party celebrating the birth of their first child. It also marked Jowita's immediate, full-blown return to alcoholism and all that entails for a new mother who is at first determined to keep her problem a secret. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her trips to liquor stores are in-and-out missions. Perhaps she's being paranoid, but she thinks people tend to notice the stroller. Walking home, she stays behind buildings, in alleyways, taking discreet sips from a bottle she's stored in the diaper bag. She know she's become a villain: a mother who drinks; a mother who endangers her child. She drinks to forget this. And then the trouble really starts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jowita Bydlowska's memoir of her relapse into addiction is an extraordinary achievement. The writing is raw and immediate. It places you in the moment--saddened, appalled, nerve-wracked, but never able to look away or stop turning the pages. With brutal honesty, Bydlowska takes us through the binges and blackouts, the self-deception and less successful attempts to deceive others, the humiliations and extraordinary risk-taking. She shines a light on the endless hunger of wanting just one more drink, and one more again, while dealing with motherhood, anxiety, depression--and rehab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her struggle to regain her sobriety is recorded in the same unsentimental, unsparing, sometimes grimly comic way. But the happy outcome is evidenced by the existence of this brilliant book: she has lived to tell the tale.</description>

  <description>It is 1965, and Charles Ashworth has attained the plum position of bishop of Starbridge, an honor that keeps him in a heady whirl of activity that would exhaust the most seasoned corporate executive. With the invaluable support of his minions and his attractive, unsinkable wife, Ashworth stands against the amorality and decadence of the age—"Anti-Sex Ashworth." He slays his opponents by being a tough, efficient, confident churchman, the torments of his past long since dead and buried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the unexpected, the unthinkable, strikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly Ashworth finds himself staring into the chasm of all the lies hes been telling himself for years: about his marriage, his children, even his views on the Church. And as he suspects his old nemesis and dean, Neville Aysgarth, of drinking too much, of financial chicanery, of—God forbid—having an affair, Ashworth discovers to his horror that he is tempted to commit the very acts that he has so publicly denounced....</description>

  <description>In 1963, when traditional values are coming under attack, a young woman in her twenties, Venetia Flaxton, becomes disastrously involved with her best friend's father, the powerful, dynamic but ultimately mysterious Dean of Starbridge Cathedral. Yet, as a married man and a senior Churchman, Aysgarth has nothing to offer her but an admiration which spirals out of control into an obsessive love. As Aysgarth begins to take scandalous risks to further their friendship, pressures rise and the dangers multiply. Venetia finds herself trapped in a desperate web of love and lies from which it seems impossible to escape. Witty, compassionate and compelling, Scandalous Risks explores not only the reality of sin and the fantasy of sexual obsession, but the overpowering human need for redemption, love and lasting happiness.</description>

  <description>The Assault on Tony's is an unapologetic, unsentimental, and at times exuberant examination of the joys and sorrows of intoxication, combining the inimitable unflinching eye and grim wit of John O'Brien, author of Leaving Las Vegas. Barricaded in a bar called Tony's while a riot rages outside, the characters that people The Assault on Tony's are united by their desire to drink to the end, no matter what the consequences. In this stark and darkly humorous novel, social alliances are forged and challenged as each member of this macabre party ignores his fears in favor of keeping his tumbler full to the brim. As time goes on and the liquor supply starts to dwindle, the novel reaches a gritty intensity as it exposes the highs and lows of the human spirit.</description>

  <description>Tightly plotted and fast paced, &lt;em&gt;Girl Crazy&lt;/em&gt; is a cinematic ride through one man’s obsession with a younger woman. Justin, a dissatisfied community college teacher, meets Jenna and is attracted at once to her mixture of toughness, vulnerability and ripe sexuality. Jenna is unlike anyone Justin has ever known -- through her he discovers a world of drugs and sex, casual violence and intimidation that at first frightens and then thrills him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justin falls deeper into Jenna’s thrall, particularly as her erratic behaviour keeps him guessing. When Jenna ends the relationship abruptly, Justin finds he isn’t willing to let go of this new life, or of Jenna, without a fight.</description>

  <description>Apes! Sex fiends! Gangsters! Mad scientists! Tentacles! Yes, this MEGAPACK has them all, no less than 25 lurid tales ripped from the pages of pulp fiction magazines. For The Pulp Fiction Megapack, we selected stories with great pulp titles. (Where else are you going to find stories like "Blood for the Vampire Dead," "Mistress of Snarling Death," or "When Super-Apes Plot"?) Of course, these stories were all written in a different time, with different standards of what was acceptable. They are decidedly NOT politically correct by modern standards. Please go into them aware of this fact, and if you are offended by racism, stereotypes, bad writing, sadism, or anything else prevalent in cheap literature of the early 20th century...well, this may not be the right ebook for you. But if you can sit back and enjoy these stories for what they are-simple titlations from another era-you may find some surprising treats. Included are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BLOOD FOR THE VAMPIRE DEAD, by Robert Leslie Bellem&lt;br /&gt; MISTRESS OF SNARLING DEATH, by Paul Chadwick&lt;br /&gt; FIANCES FOR THE DEVIL'S DAUGHTER, by Russell Gray&lt;br /&gt; THE SHRIEKING POOL, by G. T. Fleming-Roberts&lt;br /&gt; DEATH MATES FOR THE LUST-LOST, by Hugh J. Gallagher&lt;br /&gt; THE DOGS OF PURGATORY, by Hugh Pendexter&lt;br /&gt; WHEN MANHATTAN SANK, by George S. Brooks&lt;br /&gt; BRIDE OF THE APE, by Harold Ward&lt;br /&gt; BLOOD-BAIT FOR HUNGRY MERMAIDS, by John Wallace&lt;br /&gt; SHIP OF THE GOLDEN GHOUL, by Lazar Levi&lt;br /&gt; BLACK POOL FOR HELL MAIDENS, by Hal K. Wells&lt;br /&gt; DEATH FLIGHT, by Robert Wallace&lt;br /&gt; THE SCALPEL OF DOOM, by Ray Cummings&lt;br /&gt; SATAN DRIVES THE BUS, by Wyatt Blassingame&lt;br /&gt; SERVANT OF THE BEAST, by L. Patrick Greene&lt;br /&gt; THE DEAD BOOK, by Howard Hersey&lt;br /&gt; WHEN SUPER-APES PLOT, by Anthony Wilder&lt;br /&gt; THE YELLOW CURSE, by Lars Anderson&lt;br /&gt; THE BRAIN OF MANY BODIES, by E. A. Grosser&lt;br /&gt; TONG TORTURE, by Emile C. Tepperman&lt;br /&gt; THE RAY OF MADNESS, by Captain S. P. Meek&lt;br /&gt; THE TERRIBLE TENTACLES OF L-472, by Sewell Peaslee Wright&lt;br /&gt; THE APE-MEN OF XLOTLI, by David R. Sparks&lt;br /&gt; THE FLOATING ISLAND OF MADNESS, by Jason Kirby&lt;br /&gt; THE CORPSE ON THE GRATING, by Hugh B. Cave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don't forget to search this ebook store for more entries in the "Megapack" series, covering science fiction, fantasy, horror, mystery, westerns, and much, much more!</description>

  <description>Mobbing is a destructive social process in which individuals, groups, or organizations target a person for ridicule, humiliation, and removal from the workplace. It can lead to deteriorating physical and mental health, workplace violence, and even suicide. Studies indicate that as many as 37% of American workers have experienced workplace abuse at some time in their working lives. Overcoming Mobbing is an informative, comprehensive guidebook written for the victims of mobbing and their families who often can't make sense of the experience or mobilize resources for recovery. In an engaging, reader-friendly style, the book distinguishes mobbing from bullying in that it takes place within organizational or institutional settings and involves organizational dynamics. Mobbing is not about the occasional negative experience at work; it is ongoing negative acts, both overt and covert, over time, that erode workers' confidence in themselves and in their workplaces and that no amount of sophistication or maturity can make sense of. Duffy and Sperry, leading authorities on this special type of aggression, provide effective strategies for recovery from mobbing as well as for prevention, and they demystify the experience through the use of case vignettes. More than a simple self-help book, this volume brings the concept and terminology relating to mobbing into the public vocabulary by virtue of its strong foundation in psychological and organizational research. It offers a detailed presentation of the causes and consequences of mobbing, helps readers avoid falling into the trap of misplacing blame, and holds organizations at the center of responsibility for preventing the abuse. In addition to those who have experienced mobbing themselves, this book is an invaluable resource for workplace managers and human resources personnel who wish to prevent or reverse mobbing within their own professional settings.</description>

In just a few years, Steve Jobs accomplished the impossible - Apple was now a Trillion dollar juggernaut in Music, Books, Smart-Phones, Tablets, Laptops and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anatomy of an Apple reveals the often overlooked, misunderstood or misrepresented lessons that made it all possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anatomy of an Apple is an engaging and knowledgeable romp through technology which turns the abstract business concepts behind Apple's astounding comeback into easily digestible everyday business lessons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meticulous myth-busting of major Technology history, through surgical cross-examination, combines with an unforgettable storytelling of Apple's tale of redemption and renewal that doesn't disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From start to finish, you will be treated to a feast of life changing anecdotes, piquant down and dirty myth-busting and utterly refreshing, setting-the-record-straight facts and figures that explain what it took for Apple to return from the brink of disaster.</description>

      <![CDATA[Ben Klaiber has brought us a fascinating and almost religious apologia for Steve Jobs and Apple. At times it reads like it was put together by a committee at Apple chaired by Steve Jobs' and Tim Cooks' mothers. Once you accept that premise, however, sit back and read a detailed and clearly writte...]]>

  <description>Born in 1934, Peter Gzowski covered most of the last half of the century as a journalist and interviewer. This biography, the most comprehensive and definitive yet published, is also a portrait of Canada during those decades, beginning with Gzowski's days at the University of Toronto's &lt;em&gt;The Varsity&lt;/em&gt; in the mid 1950s, through his years as the youngest-ever managing editor of Maclean's in the 1960s and his tremendous success on CBC's &lt;em&gt;Morningside&lt;/em&gt; in the 1980s and 1990s, and ending with his stint as a &lt;em&gt;Globe and Mail&lt;/em&gt; columnist at the dawn of the 21st century and his death in January 2002.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gzowski saw eight Canadian Prime Ministers in office, most of whom he interviewed, and witnessed everything from the Quiet Revolution in Qubec to the growth of economic nationalism in Canada's West. From the rise of state medicine to the decline of the patriarchy, Peter was there to comment, to resist, and to participate. Here was a man who was proud to call himself Canadian and who made millions of other Canadians realize that Canada was, in what he claimed was a Canadian expression, not a bad place to live.</description>

  <description>The first volume in Hunter S. Thompson’s bestselling &lt;i&gt;Gonzo Papers&lt;/i&gt; offers brilliant commentary and outrageous humor, in his signature style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally published in 1979, the first volume of the bestselling “Gonzo Papers” is now back in print. &lt;i&gt;The Great Shark Hunt&lt;/i&gt; is Dr. Hunter S. Thompson’s largest and, arguably, most important work, covering Nixon to napalm, Las Vegas to Watergate, Carter to cocaine. These essays offer brilliant commentary and outrageous humor, in signature Thompson style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ranging in date from the &lt;i&gt;National Observer&lt;/i&gt; days to the era of &lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Great Shark Hunt&lt;/i&gt; offers myriad, highly charged entries, including the first Hunter S. Thompson piece to be dubbed “gonzo”—“The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved,” which appeared in &lt;i&gt;Scanlan's Monthly&lt;/i&gt; in 1970. From this essay a new journalistic movement sprang which would change the shape of American letters. Thompson's razor-sharp insight and crystal clarity capture the crazy, hypocritical, degenerate, and redeeming aspects of the explosive and colorful ‘60s and ‘70s.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780062457738&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. &lt;em&gt;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k&lt;/em&gt; is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, &lt;em&gt;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k&lt;/em&gt; is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.</description>

  <description>One day a forest violently grows in the place of a small New Mexico town, the remnants of which are quickly overrun by the forest's inhabitants — every manner of ghoul, beast, or monster imaginable. So what comes next? Naturally, guided tours! But what happens when the so-called indestructible tram breaks down in the middle of the forest of nightmares? In The Haunted Forest Tour, James A. Moore and Jeff Strand collaborate to blend horror and humor into an absurd and horrific tale. Get your ticket punched, enjoy your ride, and please keep your hands in the trolley at all times!</description>

  <description>At once an incredible adventure narrative and a penetrating biographical portrait, &lt;i&gt;The River of Doubt&lt;/i&gt; is the true story of Theodore Roosevelt’s harrowing exploration of one of the most dangerous rivers on earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The River of Doubt—it is a black, uncharted tributary of the Amazon that snakes through one of the most treacherous jungles in the world. Indians armed with poison-tipped arrows haunt its shadows; piranhas glide through its waters; boulder-strewn rapids turn the river into a roiling cauldron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After his humiliating election defeat in 1912, Roosevelt set his sights on the most punishing physical challenge he could find, the first descent of an unmapped, rapids-choked tributary of the Amazon. Together with his son Kermit and Brazil’s most famous explorer, Cândido Mariano da Silva Rondon, Roosevelt accomplished a feat so great that many at the time refused to believe it. In the process, he changed the map of the western hemisphere forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, Roosevelt and his men faced an unbelievable series of hardships, losing their canoes and supplies to punishing whitewater rapids, and enduring starvation, Indian attack, disease, drowning, and a murder within their own ranks. Three men died, and Roosevelt was brought to the brink of suicide. &lt;i&gt;The River of Doubt&lt;/i&gt; brings alive these extraordinary events in a powerful nonfiction narrative thriller that happens to feature one of the most famous Americans who ever lived.&lt;br /&gt;From the soaring beauty of the Amazon rain forest to the darkest night of Theodore Roosevelt’s life, here is Candice Millard’s dazzling debut.</description>

  <description>Isabel Hart is afraid of two things, the maze at Trencarrow where she got lost as a young child, and the lake where her brother David saved her from drowning in a boating accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her twenty-first birthday and the announcement of her engagement imminent, Isabel decides it is time for her to face her demons and ventures into the maze. There she sees something which will alter her perceptions of herself and her family forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isabel’s widowed aunt joins the house party, where her cousin confides she is in love with an enigmatic young man who surely cannot be what he pretends, for he is surely too dashing for homely Laura?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Henry, Viscount Strachan and his mother arrives, ostensibly to use her ball as an arena for finding a wife, Isabel is determined not to like him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As more secrets are revealed, Isabel doubts she has chosen the right man, although her future fiancé has more vested in this marriage than Isabel realizes and has no intention of letting her go easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Isabel be able to put her preconceptions of marriage behind her and take charge of her own life, or is she destined to be controlled by others forever?</description>

  <description>For centuries, the werewolves of Toronto have managed to live in peace and tranquility, hidden quietly away on their London, Ontario farm. But now, someone has learned their secret—and is systematically massacring this ancient race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only one they can turn to is Henry Fitzroy, Toronto-based vampire and writer of bodice rippers. Forced to hide from the light of day, Henry can’t hunt the killer alone, so he turns to Vicki Nelson for help. As they race against time to stop the murderer, they begin to fear that their combined talents may not be enough to prevent him from completing his deadly plan.</description>

  <description>Sealed away through unending centuries in a sarcophagus never meant to be opened, he had patiently waited for the opportunity to live again, for the chance to feed on the unwary and grow strong. Now, at last, the waiting had come to an end. Brought to the Egyptology Department of Toronto's Royal Ontario Museum, the seals and spells that imprisoned him chipped away by his discoverers, he reached forth to claim the minds and souls of the unsuspecting city dwellers, to begin building an empire for himself and his god. And only three people had even a hint that anything was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Henry Fitzroy, 450-year-old vampire, it began with a haunting, inescapable image of the sun, a terrifying symbol of death to one such as he. Fearing for his sanity, he called upon his sometime-lover and comrade in supernatural investigations, ex-cop Vicki Nelson, for help. And even as the two struggled to cope with Henry's obsession, Vicki's closest friend and former partner, Police Detective Mike Celluci was following up on two mysterious deaths at the museum, certain he was looking at murders not accidents - and equally convinced that the killer was a mummy brought back from the dead!</description>

  <description>The study of sexual physiology - what happens, and why, and how to make it happen better - has been a paying career or a diverting sideline for scientists as far-ranging as Leonardo da Vinci and James Watson. The research has taken place behind the closed doors of laboratories, brothels, MRI centers, pig farms, sex-toy R&amp;amp;D labs, and Alfred Kinsey's attic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Roach, "the funniest science writer in the country" (Burkhard Bilger of 'The New Yorker'), devoted the past two years to stepping behind those doors. Can a person think herself to orgasm? Can a dead man get an erection? Is vaginal orgasm a myth? Why doesn't Viagra help women or, for that matter, pandas? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 'Bonk', Roach shows us how and why sexual arousal and orgasm, two of the most complex, delightful, and amazing scientific phenomena on earth, can be so hard to achieve and what science is doing to slowly make the bedroom a more satisfying place. 16 illustrations.</description>

  <description>For Kivrin, preparing an on-site study of one of the deadliest eras in humanity's history was as simple as receiving inoculations against the diseases of the fourteenth century and inventing an alibi for a woman traveling alone. For her instructors in the twenty-first century, it meant painstaking calculations and careful monitoring of the rendezvous location where Kivrin would be received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a crisis strangely linking past and future strands Kivrin in a bygone age as her fellows try desperately to rescue her. In a time of superstition and fear, Kivrin--barely of age herself--finds she has become an unlikely angel of hope during one of history's darkest hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Connie Willis draws upon her understanding of the universalities of human nature to explore the ageless issues of evil, suffering, and the indomitable will of the human spirit.</description>

  <description>Six shots. Five dead. One heartland city thrown into a state of terror. But within hours the cops have it solved: a slam-dunk case. Except for one thing. The accused man says: You got the wrong guy. Then he says: Get Reacher for me. And sure enough, from the world he lives in—no phone, no address, no commitments–ex–military investigator Jack Reacher is coming. In Lee Child’s astonishing new thriller, Reacher’s arrival will change everything—about a case that isn’t what it seems, about lives tangled in baffling ways, about a killer who missed one shot–and by doing so give Jack Reacher one shot at the truth.…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gunman worked from a parking structure just thirty yards away–point-blank range for a trained military sniper like James Barr. His victims were in the wrong place at the wrong time. But why does Barr want Reacher at his side? There are good reasons why Reacher is the last person Barr would want to see. But when Reacher hears Barr’s own words, he understands. And a slam-dunk case explodes. Soon Reacher is teamed with a young defense lawyer who is working against her D.A. father and dueling with a prosecution team that has an explosive secret of its own. Like most things Reacher has known in life, this case is a complex battlefield. But, as always, in battle, Reacher is at his best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving in the shadows, picking his spots, Reacher gets closer and closer to the unseen enemy who is pulling the strings. And for Reacher, the only way to take him down is to know his ruthlessness and respect his cunning–and then match him shot for shot…</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;In the Hugo-Award winning &lt;i&gt;Hominids&lt;/i&gt;, Robert J. Sawyer introduced a character readers will never forget: Ponter Boddit, a Neanderthal physicist from a parallel Earth who was whisked from his reality into ours by a quantum-computing experiment gone awry - making him the ultimate stranger in a strange land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that book and in its sequel, &lt;i&gt;Humans&lt;/i&gt;, Sawyer showed us the Neanderthal version of Earth in loving detail - a tour de force of world-building; a masterpiece of alternate history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in &lt;i&gt;Hybrids&lt;/i&gt;, Ponter Boddit and his Homo sapiens lover, geneticist Mary Vaughan, are torn between two worlds, struggling to find a way to make their star-crossed relationship work. Aided by banned Neanderthal technology, they plan to conceive the first hybrid child, a symbol of hope for the joining of their two versions of reality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after an experiment shows that Mary's religious faith - something completely absent in Neanderthals - is a quirk of the neurological wiring of Homo sapiens brains, Ponter and Mary must decide whether their child should be predisposed to atheism or belief. Meanwhile, as Mary's Earth is dealing with a collapse of its planetary magnetic field, her boss, the enigmatic Jock Krieger, has turned envious eyes on the unspoiled Eden that is the Neanderthal world . . . &lt;br /&gt;Hybrids is filled to bursting with Sawyer's signature speculations about alternative ways of being human, exploding our preconceptions of morality and gender, of faith and love. His Neanderthal Parallax trilogy is a classic in the making, and here he brings it to a stunning, thought-provoking conclusion that's sure to make &lt;i&gt;Hybrids&lt;/i&gt; one of the most controversial books of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>It began with the call no daughter ever wants to get, the call that told private investigator Vicki Nelson her mother had died. Mrs. Nelson's coworker at the Queen's University Life Science Department told Vicki that the cause of death was a heart attack, and that they'd be waiting for her to arrive in Kingston to make the funeral arrangements. But what started as an all too normal personal tragedy soon became the most terrifying case of Vicki's career. For when Marjory Nelson's body mysteriously disappeared from the funeral home, Vicki, her sometime lover and fellow investigator, vampire Henry Fitzroy, and her former homicide squad partner, Detective-Sergeant Mike Celluci, realized that there was something unnatural about her mother's demise. Vicki swore she'd find the culprit, and see that her mother was properly laid to rest. But what she hadn't counted on was that someone at Queen's University seemed determined to keep Mrs. Nelson on the job -- alive or dead!</description>

  <description>Attempting to deconstruct America's joyless obsession with sobriety, &lt;b&gt;The Modern Drunkard&lt;/b&gt; offers today's befuddled drinkers a comprehensive and instructive manual on the delights of alcohol culture, how to be a good drunk, how to drink, and how to do it well. Through articles, anecdotes, cartoons, and illustrations pulled from our long and happy history of drinking alcohol, Frank Kelly Rich campaigns to revive the lost art of tippling and taps a deep vein of boozy lore and legend through the ages, uncovering etiquette and expertise from some of history's greatest guzzlers.</description>

  <description>What are the repercussions of calling another story your own? Patrick Rush, journalist, single father, and failed novelist, joins a creative writing circle in an inspiring atmosphere of menace and fear. Throughout Toronto, a murderer strikes randomly, leaving bodies mutilated and dismembered, and taunting the police with cryptic notes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The group reads each other their own dark, unsettling tales. Angela tells of child-stealer Sandman. Patrick, though, finds fantasy and reality blurring. Is the maniac at large the Sandman? What does Angela really know? And does the killer stalk his pursuer? Only when his son is snatched does Patrick journey toward the elusive figure.</description>

  <description>A stolen child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ancient evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A father’s descent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the literary masterpiece that holds the key to his daughter’s salvation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Professor David Ullman is among the world’s leading authorities on demonic literature, with special expertise in Milton’s Paradise Lost. Not that David is a believer—he sees what he teaches as a branch of the imagination and nothing more. So when the mysterious Thin Woman arrives at his office and invites him to travel to Venice and witness a “phenomenon,” he turns her down. She leaves plane tickets and an address on his desk, advising David that her employer is not often disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That evening, David’s wife announces she is leaving him. With his life suddenly in shambles, he impulsively whisks his beloved twelve-year-old daughter, Tess, off to Venice after all. The girl has recently been stricken by the same melancholy moods David knows so well, and he hopes to cheer her up and distract them both from the troubles at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what happens in Venice will change everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, in a tiny attic room at the address provided by the Thin Woman, David sees a man restrained in a chair, muttering, clearly insane . . . but could he truly be possessed? Then the man speaks clearly, in the voice of David’s dead father, repeating the last words he ever spoke to his son. Words that have left scars—and a mystery—behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When David rushes back to the hotel, he discovers Tess perched on the roof’s edge, high above the waters of the Grand Canal. Before she falls, she manages to utter a final plea: Find me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is an unimaginable journey for David Ullman from skeptic to true believer. In a terrifying quest guided by symbols and riddles from the pages of Paradise Lost, David must track the demon that has captured his daughter and discover its name. If he fails, he will lose Tess forever.</description>

      <![CDATA[I am a fan of Pyper, though at times reluctant; mainly because he so often scares the crap out of me. In this book he takes his ubiquitous theme of fatherhood and goes for broke. His scenes move from exotic Venice to the bleak US midwest and the flight/pursuit of demons with Milton ringing his ea...]]>

  <description>It wasn't Leonard Dykes's writing style that offended. But something in his unpublished tome seemed to lead everyone who read it to a very unhappy ending. Now four people are dead, including the unfortunate author himself, and the police think Nero Wolfe is the only man who can close the book on this novel killer. So the genius sleuth directs his sidekick to set a trap… and discovers that the truth is far stranger—and far bloodier—than fiction.</description>

      <![CDATA[I have always considered this story one of the best in the series and return to it often. What makes Nero Wolfe books work is not so much the unchanging setting; the brownstone, dinners, beer and Archie, but the departures from the norm. Murder by the book contains a taut mystery concerning what...]]>

  <description>In this accessible and groundbreaking book--filled with the moving stories of real people--medical doctor and bestselling author Gabor Maté shows that emotion and psychological stress play a powerful role in the onset of chronic illness, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, multiple sclerosis and many others, even Alzheimer's disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;When the Body Says No &lt;/i&gt;is an impressive contribution to research on the physiological connection between life's stresses and emotions and the body systems governing nerves, immune apparatus and hormones. With great compassion and erudition, Gabor Maté demystifies medical science and, as he did in &lt;i&gt;Scattered Minds&lt;/i&gt;, invites us all to be our own health advocates.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Seriously Funny Writing By Today's Most Celebrated Authors&lt;/strong&gt;At last, a premier showcase of fifty-four great literary humorists and masters of the journalistic jab, the social spoof, the parodic proof, the satire, the tirade, and the send-up. Here are those "last laughs" and "wit's end" pieces everyone turns to first but then loses in back issues of favorite magazines and newspapers, including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merrill Markoeon Networking with angels&lt;br /&gt;Garry Trudeau on re-retranslating Madonna&lt;br /&gt;David Sedaris on reviewing school Christmas Plays&lt;br /&gt;John Updike on cross-dressing with J. Edgar Hoover&lt;br /&gt;Also included are riotous contributions from Henry Alford, Jon Stewart, and David Ives, as well as millennial maxims by Mark O'Donnell, gardening advice by Mertensia Corydalis, and highlights from Randy Cohen's savvy "News Quiz."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by The Thurber House</description>

  <description>The tsunami of cheap credit that rolled across the planet between 2002 and 2008 was more than a simple financial phenomenon: it was temptation, offering entire societies the chance to reveal aspects of their characters they could not normally afford to indulge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Icelanders wanted to stop fishing and become investment bankers. The Greeks wanted to turn their country into a pinata stuffed with cash and allow as many citizens as possible to take a whack at it. The Germans wanted to be even more German; the Irish wanted to stop being Irish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Lewis's investigation of bubbles beyond our shores is so brilliantly, sadly hilarious that it leads the American reader to a comfortable complacency: oh, those foolish foreigners. But when he turns a merciless eye on California and Washington, DC, we see that the narrative is a trap baited with humor, and we understand the reckoning that awaits the greatest and greediest of debtor nations.</description>

  <description>Having survived Borneo, Amazonia, and the Congo, the indefatigable Redmond O’Hanlon sets off on his next adventure: his own perfect storm, in the wild waters off the northern tip of Scotland. Equipped with a fancy Nikon, an excessive supply of socks, and no seamanship whatsoever, O’Hanlon joins the commercial fishing crew of the &lt;i&gt;Norlantean&lt;/i&gt;, a deep-sea trawler,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt; to stock a bottomless hull with their catch, even as a hurricane roars around them. Rich in oceanography, marine biology, and uproarious humor, &lt;i&gt;Trawle&lt;/i&gt;r is Redmond O’Hanlon at his finest.</description>

  <description>A modern classic in which John le Carré expertly creates a total vision of a secret world, &lt;i&gt;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&lt;/i&gt; begins George Smiley's chess match of wills and wits with Karla, his Soviet counterpart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now beyond a doubt that a mole, implanted decades ago by Moscow Centre, has burrowed his way into the highest echelons of British Intelligence. His treachery has already blown some of its most vital operations and its best networks. It is clear that the double agent is one of its own kind. But which one? George Smiley is assigned to identify him. And once identified, the traitor must be destroyed.</description>

  <description>On Long Island, a farmer finds a duck pond turned red with blood. On the Lower East Side, two boys playing at a pier discover a floating human torso wrapped tightly in oilcloth. Blueberry pickers near Harlem stumble upon neatly severed limbs in an overgrown ditch. Clues to a horrifying crime are turning up all over New York, but the police are baffled: There are no witnesses, no motives, no suspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grisly finds that began on the afternoon of June 26, 1897, plunged detectives headlong into the era's most baffling murder mystery. Seized upon by battling media moguls Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst, the case became a publicity circus. Reenactments of the murder were staged in Times Square, armed reporters lurked in the streets of Hell's Kitchen in pursuit of suspects, and an unlikely trio — a hard-luck cop, a cub reporter, and an eccentric professor — all raced to solve the crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What emerged was a sensational love triangle and an even more sensational trial: an unprecedented capital case hinging on circumstantial evidence around a victim whom the police couldn't identify with certainty, and who the defense claimed wasn't even dead. &lt;i&gt;The Murder of the Century&lt;/i&gt; is a rollicking tale — a rich evocation of America during the Gilded Age and a colorful re-creation of the tabloid wars that have dominated media to this day.</description>

  <description>Are you plagued by fears, phobias, or panic attacks? Do you toss and turn at night with a knot in your stomach, worrying about your job, your family, work, your health, or relationships? Do you suffer from crippling shyness, obsessive doubts, or feelings of insecurity?&lt;br /&gt;What you may not realize is that these fears are almost never based on reality. Anxiety is one of the world’s oldest cons. When you’re anxious, you’re actually fooling yourself. You are telling yourself things that simply aren’t true. See if you can recognize yourself in any of these distortions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;All-or-Nothing Thinking:&lt;/b&gt; “My mind will go blank when I give my presentation at work, and everyone will think I’m an idiot.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fortune Telling:&lt;/b&gt; “I just know I’ll freeze up and blow it when I take my test.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mind Reading&lt;/b&gt;: “Everyone at this party can see how nervous I am.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Magnification:&lt;/b&gt; “Flying is so dangerous. I think this plane is going to crash!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Should Statements:&lt;/b&gt; “I shouldn’t be so anxious and insecure. Other people don’t feel this way.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emotional Reasoning:&lt;/b&gt; “I feel like I’m on the verge of cracking up!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Self-Blame:&lt;/b&gt; “What’s wrong with me? I’m such a loser!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mental Filter:&lt;/b&gt; “Why can’t I get anything done? My life seems like one long procrastination.”&lt;br /&gt;Now imagine what it be like to live a life that’s free of worries and self-doubt; to go to sleep at night feeling peaceful and relaxed; to overcome your shyness and have fun with other people; to give dynamic presentations without worrying yourself sick ahead of time; to enjoy greater creativity, productivity and self-confidence.&lt;br /&gt;Does that sound impossible? The truth is you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; defeat your fears. In &lt;i&gt;When Panic Attacks&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Burns takes you by the hand and shows you how to overcome every conceivable kind of anxiety. In fact, you will learn how to use more than forty simple, effective techniques, and the moment you put the lie to the distorted thoughts that plague you, your fears will immediately disappear. Dr. Burns also shares the latest research on the drugs commonly prescribed for anxiety and depression and explains why they may sometimes do more harm than good.&lt;br /&gt;This is not pop psychology but proven, fast-acting techniques that have been shown to be more effective than medications. &lt;i&gt;When Panic Attacks&lt;/i&gt; is an indispensable handbook for anyone who’s worried sick and sick of worrying.</description>

Brief therapy and inpatient settings are also discussed in detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step-by-step instructions are provided on how to tailor the program to follow cognitive therapy treatment protocols for a range of diagnoses, including depression, anxiety, personality disorders, panic disorder, substance abuse, and complex, multiple problems. Also outlined are ways to use MIND OVER MOOD to pinpoint the development of specific cognitive, affective, and behavioral skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The volume is richly illustrated with case examples and sample client-therapist dialogues in every chapter. Guidance is offered on how to review home exercises and worksheets in session and how to perform effective guided discovery. The authors also provide a detailed chapter on setting therapy goals. Creative ways for engaging clients who have negative reactions to a manual are described, as are strategies for maintaining collaboration with clients with personality disorders. Each chapter concludes with a "troubleshooting guide," which therapists can use to navigate impasses, and the book itself concludes with an informative chapter on therapist training and MIND OVER MOOD. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>First discovered and then painstakingly edited and annotated by Nicholas Meyer, &lt;i&gt;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&lt;/i&gt; relates the astounding and previously unknown collaboration of Sigmund Freud with Sherlock Holmes, as recorded by Holmes's friend and chronicler, Dr. John H. Watson. In addition to its breathtaking account of their collaboration on a case of diabolic conspiracy in which the lives of millions hang in the balance, it reveals such matters as the real identity of the heinous professor Moriarty, the dark secret shared by Sherlock and his brother Mycroft Holmes, and the detective's true whereabouts during the Great Hiatus, when the world believed him to be dead.</description>

  <description>In the spirit of his savagely funny and national best-seller Parliament of Whores, Give War a Chance is P. J. O'Rourke's number one New York Times best-selling follow-up. O'Rourke runs hilariously amok by tackling the death of Communism, sanctimonious liberals, and America's perennial bad guy Saddam Hussein in a series of classic dispatches from his coverage of the 1991 Gulf War. Here is our most mordant and unnervingly funny political satirist on: Kuwait City after the Gulf War: "It looked like all the worst rock bands in the world had stayed there at the same time." On Saddam Hussein, O'Rourke muses: "He's got chemical weapons filled with ... chemicals. Maybe he's got The Bomb. And missiles that can reach Riyadh, Tel Aviv, Spokane. Stock up on nonperishable foodstuffs. Grab those Diet Coke cans you were supposed to take to the recycling center and fill them up with home heating oil. Bury the Hummel figurines in the yard. We're all going to die. Details at eleven."</description>

  <description>"The indispensable critic on the indispensable writer." -Geoffrey O'Brien, &lt;i&gt;New York Review of Books&lt;/i&gt;. A landmark achievement as expansive, erudite, and passionate as its renowned author, &lt;i&gt;Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human &lt;/i&gt;is the culmination of a lifetime of reading, writing about, and teaching Shakespeare. Preeminent literary critic-and ultimate authority on the western literary tradition-Harold Bloom leads us through a comprehensive reading of every one of the dramatist's plays, brilliantly illuminating each work with unrivaled warmth, wit and insight. At the same time, Bloom presents one of the boldest theses of Shakespearean scholarships: that Shakespeare not only invented the English language, but also created human nature as we know it today.</description>

  <description>Detective Dave Robicheaux has fought too many battles: in Vietnam, with killers and hustlers, with police brass, and with the bottle. Lost without his wife's love, Robicheaux's haunted soul mirrors the intensity and dusky mystery of New Orleans' French Quarter -- the place he calls home, and the place that nearly destroys him when he becomes involved in the case of a young prostitute whose body is found in a bayou. Thrust into the world of drug lords and arms smugglers, Robicheaux must face down a subterranean criminal world and come to terms with his own bruised heart in order to survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Murder at the Vicarage&lt;/i&gt; marks the debut of Agatha Christie’s unflappable and much beloved female detective, Miss Jane Marple. With her gift for sniffing out the malevolent side of human nature, Miss Marple is led on her first case to a crime scene at the local vicarage. Colonel Protheroe, the magistrate whom everyone in town hates, has been shot through the head. No one heard the shot. There are no leads. Yet, everyone surrounding the vicarage seems to have a reason to want the Colonel dead. It is a race against the clock as Miss Marple sets out on the twisted trail of the mysterious killer without so much as a bit of help from the local police.</description>

  <description>An old-fashioned London Hotel is not quite as reputable as it makes out! When Miss Marple comes up from the country for a holiday in London, she finds what she's looking for at Bertram's Hotel: traditional decor, impeccable service and an unmistakable atmosphere of danger behind the highly polished veneer. Yet, not even Miss Marple can foresee the violent chain of events set in motion when an eccentric guest makes his way to the airport on the wrong day!</description>

  <description>In utter disbelief, Jane Marple read the letter addressed to her from the recently deceased Mr Rafiel - an acquaintance she had met briefly on her travels. He had left instructions for her to investigate a crime after his death. The only problem was, he had failed to tell her who was involved or where and when the crime had been committed. It was most intruguing. Soon she is faced with a new crime - the ultimate crime - murder. It seems someone is adamant that past evils remain buried...</description>

  <description>British agent Bernard Samson, whom we last met in &lt;i&gt;Spy Hook&lt;/i&gt;, is suffering the consequences of having meddled when he was instructed to steer clear. Far from being thanks for ferreting out what appeared to be in evidence of an unprecedented breach of security in the Secret Service, he is on the run from arrest or issued by the Service, naming him a traitor.&lt;p&gt;Now he is hiding in Berlin; hiding on a rundown, dangerous dead-end street that crashes up against the Wall and harbors the destitute, the illegal, and the lost. Samson knows how to make himself it in and disappear – he's had a lifetime of sanctioned practice – but he's worried that he's played into London's hands: "I've put myself in prison. . . And they don't even have the bother or the expense of it." As the weeks pass, Samson slowly realizes that the Service knows where he is; they've even continued to pay his salary. But they don't seem to care about him one way or the other. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when word finally comes that he can return to London – all charges dropped, no board to face, no tribunal – the invitation take Samson by surprise. But he is much less surprised to learn that the strings attached to this promise of freedom could bind him for life. And when, back at London's Central, he is offhandedly given an assignment in Vienna, Samson is reminded of something he once told a young Service recruit: the more casual the briefing, the more hazardous the operation. In fact, even before Samson lands in Vienna, he has taken the first, irreversible steps toward the center of a web of Secret Service mystery and subterfuge even more complex, and more perilous, and he had feared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spy Line&lt;/i&gt; – a brilliant successor to &lt;i&gt;Spy Hook&lt;/i&gt; is, in its own right, a superb thriller. It is Len Deighton at his most exciting and suspenseful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Bill Maher is on the forefront of the new wave of comedians who have begun to influence and shape political debate through their comedy. He is best known not just for being funny, but for advocating truth over sensitivity and taking on the political establishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maher first came to national attention as the host of the hit ABC-TV program &lt;i&gt;Politically Incorrect&lt;/i&gt;, where he offered a combustible mixture of irreverence and acerbic humor that helped him to garner a loyal following, as well as a reputation for being a controversial bad boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill Maher's popular new HBO television show, &lt;i&gt;Real Time&lt;/i&gt;, has put Maher more front and center than ever before. Partic-ularly one regular segment on the show, entitled "New Rules," has been a hit with his ever-growing legion of fans. It is the part of the show during which Maher takes serious aim, bringing all of his intelligence, incisiveness, wit, and his signature exasperation to bear on topics ranging from cell phones ("I don't need my cell phone to take pictures or access the Internet. I just need it to make a phone call. From everywhere! Not just the places it likes!") to fast food ("No McDonald's in hospitals. I'm not kidding!) to the conservative agenda ("Stop claiming it's an agenda. It's not an agenda. It's a random collection of laws that your corporate donors paid you to pass.")&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His new book, the first since his bestselling &lt;i&gt;When You Ride ALONE You Ride with bin Laden&lt;/i&gt;, brings these brilliantly conceived riffs and rants to the written page. Appropriately titled &lt;i&gt;New Rules&lt;/i&gt;, the book will collect some of the best of the rules derived from previously written material and will also contain substantial new material, including some longer form "editorials"--of course with a twist and bite that only Bill Maher can deliver.</description>

      <![CDATA[One of the things that makes Bill Maher so funny is that he really doesn't care what you think. It's all about what he thinks and he somehow makes that work. He drips with righteous sarcasm, larded with voluptuary sanctimony. And if that last line doesn't make sense yet - read the book. New Rules...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&lt;/i&gt; is the best chronicle of drug-soaked, addle-brained, rollicking good times ever committed to the printed page. It is also the tale of a long weekend road trip that has gone down in the annals of American pop culture as one of the strangest journeys ever undertaken.</description>

  <description>When the quiet Little Vestry of St. Matthew's Church becomes the blood-soaked scene of a double murder, Scotland Yard Commander Adam Dalgliesh faces an intriguing conundrum: How did an upper-crust Minister come to lie, slit throat to slit throat, next to a neighborhood derelict of the lowest order? Challenged with the investigation of a crime that appears to have endless motives, Dalgliesh explores the sinister web spun around a half-burnt diary and a violet-eyed widow who is pregnant and full of malice--all the while hoping to fill the gap of logic that joined these two disparate men in bright red death. . . .</description>

  <description>Auric Goldfinger is the richest man in England—though his wealth can’t be found in banks. He’s been hoarding vast stockpiles of his namesake metal, and it’s attracted the suspicion of 007’s superiors at MI6. Sent to investigate, Bond uncovers an ingenious gold-smuggling scheme, as well as Goldfinger’s most daring caper yet: Operation Grand Slam, a gold heist so audacious it could bring down the world economy and put the fate of the West in the hands of SMERSH. To stop Goldfinger, Bond will have to survive a showdown with the sinister millionaire’s henchman, Oddjob, a tenacious karate master who can kill with one well-aimed toss of his razor-rimmed bowler hat.</description>

  <description>For Bernard Samson, the end is near.In the concluding volume of Len Deighton's superb trilogy that began with &lt;em&gt;Faith&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hope,&lt;/em&gt; Bernard Samson continues to peel away the mystery surrounding the cold-blooded murder of his sister-in-law, Tessa, on the streets of Berlin. Although his wife, Fiona, has come back from the cold and is now in the West, his family is in tatters, and Samson has no where to turn for answers. Only his childhood friend Werner Volkman seems to offer the charity that Samson craves, but Volkmann is reluctant to get involved with any quest for the truth, no matter who is doing the asking. And as always, hovering above all Samson does and tries to be is the persistent memory of his father -- a deadly force to be reckoned with, even now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deighton's back and better than ever. Packed with action, incident and intrigue, &lt;em&gt;Charity&lt;/em&gt; brings to a triumphant conclusion a series of 10 novels that represents one of the greatest achievements in modern fiction.</description>

  <description>A brainwashed James Bond has tried—and failed—to assassinate M, his boss. Now Bond has to prove he is back on form and can be trusted again. All 007 has to do is kill one of the most deadly freelance hit men in the world: Paco “Pistols” Scaramanga, the Man with the Golden Gun. But despite his license to kill, 007 is no assassin, and on finding Scaramanga in the sultry heat of Jamaica, he decides to infiltrate the killer’s criminal cooperative—and realizes that he will have to take him out as swiftly as possible. Otherwise 007 might just be the next on a long list of British Secret Service numbers retired by the Man with the Golden Gun...</description>

  <description>The tragic end to James Bond’s last mission—courtesy of Ernst Stavro Blofeld—has left 007 a broken man and of little use to the British Secret Service. At his wit’s end, M decides that the only way to snap his best agent out of his torpor is to send him on an impossible diplomatic mission to Japan. Bond’s contact there is the formidable Japanese spymaster Tiger Tanaka, who agrees to do business with the West if Bond will assassinate one of his enemies: a mysterious Swiss botanist named Dr. Guntram Shatterhand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shatterhand is not who he seems, however, and his impregnable fortress—known to the locals as the “Castle of Death”—is a gauntlet of traps no gaijin has ever penetrated. But through rigorous ninja training, and with some help from the beautiful and able Kissy Suzuki, Bond manages to gain access to Shatterhand’s lair. Inside lurks certain doom at the hands of 007’s bitterest foe—or a final chance to exact ultimate vengeance.</description>

  <description>Ian Fleming’s fifth James Bond novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Bond is marked for death by the Soviet counterintelligence agency SMERSH in Ian Fleming’s masterful spy thriller, and the novel that President John F. Kennedy named one of his favourite books of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMERSH stands for ‘Death to Spies’ and there’s no secret agent they’d like to disgrace and destroy more than 007, James Bond. But ensnaring the British Secret Service’s most lethal operative will require a lure so tempting even he can’t resist. Enter Tatiana Romanova, a ravishing Russian spy whose ‘defection’ springs a trap designed with clockwork precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her mission: seduce Bond, then flee to the West on the Orient Express. Waiting in the shadows are two of Ian Fleming’s most vividly drawn villains: Red Grant, SMERSH’s deadliest assassin, and the sinister operations chief Rosa Klebb-five feet four inches of pure killing power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bursting with action and intrigue, From Russia with Love is one of the best-loved books in the Bond canon-an instant classic that set the standard for sophisticated literary spycraft for decades to come.</description>

  <description>Successful London lawyer Carter Graham has power, sex appeal, and a well-ordered life. Everything has gone according to plan, including her recent marriage to Kim Betz, an investment banker with the right combination of looks and position. On the surface it appears to be a match made in heaven. The only problem is Kim’s ex-wife. Sophie begins to follow Carter like a shadow, making outrageous claims about Kim’s involvement in the occult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convincing herself that Sophie is mad, Carter moves ahead with her life. But something is amiss–and as Sophie’s stories are corroborated by other unwelcome disclosures from Kim’s past, Carter is thrown into a terrifying web of suspicion and betrayal, pushing her sanity to the edge. In desperation, Carter seeks help from Nicholas Darrow, the charismatic priest of St. Benet’s Healing Center. Though a religious skeptic, Carter hopes to stem the tide of darkness that threatens to envelop her life–and begins a compelling journey into the very nature of good and evil, wisdom and redemption. . . .</description>

  <description>Deftly combining the sacred and the profane—the unmistakable hallmark of her fiction over the past decade—Susan Howatch gives us a spellbinding, suspenseful and psychologically intense new novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The financial heart of London—the City—is an adrenaline-charged square mile deep in recession in the 1990s, a place where sex is just another commodity to be bought and sold in the marketplace. And the City is where the life of Gavin Blake, who sells sex to high flyers, is finally about to unravel.&lt;br /&gt;In the center of the City is St. Benet’s, a church that ministers to the casualties of this affluent but amoral society. Carta Graham, the St. Benet’s fundraiser, is at once attracted to Gavin when they meet through a mutual friend, but slowly she realizes that she has entered a relationship far more complex than she could ever have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gavin is desperate to escape from his world of prostitution, pornography and violence, but as his involvement with Carta and St. Benet’s deepens, the dangers that encircle him escalate until his life itself is on the line. Carta is determined to help him—but will their mysterious journey together be lifesaving or soul-destroying? All she can do is fight her hardest to help Gavin survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistently surprising and powerfully moving, &lt;i&gt;The Heartbreaker&lt;/i&gt; is Susan Howatch’s most gripping novel yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>It began with a ghost in his bedroom. A tormented soul hungry for vengeance, The sort of nocturnal visitation that even a five-hundred-year-old vampire like Henry Fitzroy found tiresome. It would lead Vicki Nelson, PI, into her most deadly investigation yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wraith is determined that Henry and Vicki track down its killer - and is prepared to use a little persuasion by way of the innocent inhabitants of Toronto to ensure their support. Forced to investigate, Vicki discovers a host of souls in desperate torment and evidence to suggest that trailing the killer will only lead to further deaths - starting with her own.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;By a Duke professor and the former chairperson of DSM 4, the leading critic of the proposed revisions to the "bible of psychology," the DSM, which promises to greatly widen the bounds of mental illness, explores the remarkable resilience and self-healing power of the "normal brain"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5 for short) is scheduled for release in May 2013. The DSM is the bible of psychiatry; the go-to place to find out who is sick and who is not. Because it will radically stretch the boundaries of what is and what is not a psychiatric illness, DSM 5 will dramatically change how lives are lived. Under DSM 5's new definitions, millions of people now considered normal will be diagnosed as mentally ill, causing unnecessary, costly, and sometimes dangerous treatments for misidentified 'patients' who don't really need them.&lt;br /&gt;Will the DSM 5 destroy what is considered normal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances argues that DSM 5 offers a radical and reckless set of proposals that will overnight turn 'normal' people into 'mental patients'. Everyday aches, pains, disappointments, stresses, and existential sufferings are being reframed as mental illnesses with such exuberance that it is getting hard for anyone to get through life without a psychiatric diagnosis. Is grief a useful, inevitable and poignant sign of a broken heart or is it Major Depressive Disorder? Are temper tantrums a normal part of childhood or a sign of mental illness? Are you nervous about an upcoming presentation or job interview or do you have Mixed Anxiety Depression? If you don't remember a face or a fact once in a while, do you have Dementia?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances maintains we all have psychiatric symptoms from time to time, but this doesn't mean we are all flirting with mental illness. Whenever we arbitrarily add a new 'disease', we subtract from what previously was 'normal' and lose something of ourselves in the process. Not all human suffering can or should be labeled and treated away. The grief and sorrows, the stresses, the disappointments, the aches and pains, the slings and arrows, the innate and acquired inequalities, the set-backs, the stumbles, the emotional gut-shots; this is part of life and of living in a complex and not always fair society- they should not all to be explained away as psychiatric disease.</description>

  <description>Something big, weird and hungry is out on the bayou, and as one after another of the locals start disappearing, deputy sheriff Lexie Smith is on the case. Helping her are her old high-school buddies: Cam DeSelle, local vet and bait-store owner; Troy Pitre, the town's mechanic; sex-toy saleslady Carla Fontanelli; and young Father Mike and Sister Joanie, Alcide's source of spiritual strength and juicy gossip. Adding to Lexie's worries are some meth-dealing gangbangers in town for a big drug deal and a category 3 hurricane bearing down on all of them. As one horror unfolds, another plays out to its deadly conclusion at Fort St. Jesus Bait and Tackle.</description>

  <description>For a decade, beginning in 1660, an ambitious young London civil servant kept an astonishingly candid account of his life during one of the most defining periods in British history. In &lt;b&gt;Samuel Pepys&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; Claire Tomalin offers us a fully realized and richly nuanced portrait of this man, whose inadvertent masterpiece would establish him as the greatest diarist in the English language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against the backdrop of plague, civil war, and regicide, with John Milton composing diplomatic correspondence for Oliver Cromwell, Christopher Wren drawing up plans to rebuild London, and Isaac Newton advancing the empirical study of the world around us, Tomalin weaves a breathtaking account of a figure who has passed on to us much of what we know about seventeenth-century London. We witness Pepys’s early life and education, see him advising King Charles II before running to watch the great fire consume London, learn about the great events of the day as well as the most intimate personal details that Pepys encrypted in the Diary, follow him through his later years as a powerful naval administrator, and come to appreciate how Pepys’s singular literary enterprise would in many ways prefigure our modern selves. With exquisite insight and compassion, &lt;b&gt;Samuel Pepys&lt;/b&gt; captures the uniquely fascinating figure whose legacy lives on more than three hundred years after his death.</description>

  <description>An inexperienced CSIS agent, Lucas Young, infiltrates a collective of performance and conceptual artists dubbed Apollo's Army. After assuming the identity of an experimental poet, Lucas joins the group on a cross-country tour of Canada in the summer of 2010. Along the way, this 21st century troupe of court jesters crash a poetry reading in Banff, represent a fictional country in a multi-cultural parade in Calgary, resurrect Louis Riel as a guitar-god in Saskatchewan, heckle debaters at an arts symposium in Winnipeg, and storm a Toronto printing press to publish their manifesto. Hands of the Tyrants is a satirical romp that laughingly offers a noisy raspberry to the absurd machinations of the art world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;LOST CITY, FOUND&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a well-connected American archaeologist, Cassandra Rubicon, disappears while exploring the lost Mayan city of Xitaclan, the incident becomes a case for FBI agents Mulder and Scully. They are investigators assigned to the X-Files, the strange and inexplicable cases the FBI wants to keep hidden -- cases involving the paranormal, the supernatural, and possibly, the extraterrestrial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mulder thinks there may be more to this case than simply a missing team of scientists -- namely ancient curses, blood sacrifices, and deadly reptilian monsters lost in the jungles since before history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scully is, as always, more skeptical and likely to provide the logical explanations for her partner's unorthodox speculations. Meanwhile, a covert U.S. military commando team has been sent to investigate, and destroy, a strange electronic signal received from &lt;i&gt;beneath&lt;/i&gt; the ruins -- a signal aimed upwards, at the stars...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cover illustration by Cliff Nielson&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(from back cover of book)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Short Summary:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the most ambitious and exciting &lt;i&gt;X-Files&lt;/i&gt; adventure to date, Mulder and Scully fly to the Yucatan jungle to investigate a missing team of archaelogists. Their exploration leads to a strange electronic signal coming from beneath ancient ruins � a signal aimed upward, at the stars....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Biography:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin J. Anderson's first &lt;i&gt;X-Files&lt;/i&gt; adventure, &lt;i&gt;Ground Zero,&lt;/i&gt; became a #1 international bestseller. He is also the author of the critically acclaimed novels Blindfold, Climbing Olympus, and (with coauthor Doug Beason) &lt;i&gt;Virtual Destruction, III Wind,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Assemblers of Infinity.&lt;/i&gt; His work has been nominated for the Nebula and Bram Stoker Awards. His current projects include a third &lt;i&gt;X-Files&lt;/i&gt; novel, based on characters created by Chris Carter.</description>

      <![CDATA[You could do much worse than this noir classic. One of the things that always jumps out when you read from the Golden Age of Mystery is the quality of the writing. Dashiel Hammet's wordcraft is exceptional, along with archetypical detective Sam Spade and the story of the missing bird. This is con...]]>

  <description>Introducing James Bond: charming, sophisticated, handsome, chillingly ruthless and licensed to kill. This, the first of Ian Fleming's tales of secret agent 007, finds Bond on a mission to neutralize a lethal, high-rolling Russian operative called simply "le Chiffre" -- by ruining him at the Baccarat table and forcing his Soviet spymasters to "retire" him. It seems that lady luck is taken with 007 -- le Chiffre has hit a losing streak. But some people just refuse to play by the rules, and Bond's attraction to a beautiful female agent leads him to disaster and an unexpected savior...</description>

  <description>"Listen, Bond," said Tiffany Case. "It’d take more than Crabmeat Ravigotte to get me into bed with a man. In any event, since it’s your check, I’m going to have caviar, and what the English call 'cutlets,' and some pink champagne. I don’t often date a good-looking Englishman and the dinner’s going to live up to the occasion."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Tiffany Case, a cold, gorgeous, devil-may-care blonde; the kind of girl you could get into a lot of trouble with—if you wanted. She stands between James Bond and the leaders of a diamond-smuggling ring that stretches from Africa via London to the States. Bond uses her to infiltrate this gang, but once in America the hunter becomes the hunted. Bond is in real danger until help comes from an unlikely quarter, the ice-maiden herself …</description>

  <description>A Lancia Spyder with its hood down tore past him, cut in cheekily across his bonnet and pulled away, the sexy boom of its twin exhausts echoing back at him. It was a girl driving, a girl with a shocking pink scarf tied round her hair. And if there was one thing that set James Bond really moving, it was being passed at speed by a pretty girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Bond rescues a beautiful, reckless girl from self-destruction, he finds himself with a lead on one of the most dangerous men in the world—Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE. In the snow-bound fastness of his Alpine base, Blofeld is conducting research that could threaten the safety of the world. To thwart the evil genius, Bond must get himself and the vital information he has gathered out of the base and keep away from SPECTRE's agents.</description>

  <description>Eight people. One weekend. Eight lives forever changed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the mid-1960s, at an elite college in the quaint town of Barrie Hill, Connecticut, a group of literary-minded students met regularly off-campus at the Vanessa Grand Hotel. Often late into the night, they would discuss the day’s news, analyze literature, philosophize, trade barbs, and socialize. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Twenty years after graduation, in 1986, the group’s founder, Clare Dreyser, organizes a weekend reunion. Seven former Barrie Hillers and one guest get together, eager to re-create an extraordinary time in their lives and reunite with old friends. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the outset, and baffling the group, Leah Brent displays a brash, condescending attitude for nearly everyone and everything. To the chagrin of actor Bart Younger, Leah immediately lays out the unwelcome mat for his wife, Aimee. No one, not even Leah’s husband, Colin, is immune to her wrath, but Leah is relentless in her bizarre and cruel quest to bring down her primary target: Clare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the reunion progresses, the Barrie Hillers strive to enjoy their time together as they become enmeshed in personal dramas, struggle with matters of ethics, and weather escalating uncertainties that threaten to destroy their lives. By Saturday night, the second day of the reunion, karma makes a surprising and shocking visit. As the Barrie Hillers’ time together draws to an end, each is changed forever. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Scarborough is a low-income, culturally diverse neighborhood east of Toronto, the fourth largest city in North America; like many inner city communities, it suffers under the weight of poverty, drugs, crime, and urban blight. &lt;i&gt;Scarborough&lt;/i&gt; the novel employs a multitude of voices to tell the story of a tight-knit neighborhood under fire: among them, Victor, a black artist harassed by the police; Winsum, a West Indian restaurant owner struggling to keep it together; and Hina, a Muslim school worker who witnesses first-hand the impact of poverty on education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there are the three kids who work to rise above a system that consistently fails them: Bing, a gay Filipino boy who lives under the shadow of his father's mental illness; Sylvie, Bing's best friend, a Native girl whose family struggles to find a permanent home to live in; and Laura, whose history of neglect by her mother is destined to repeat itself with her father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scarborough&lt;/i&gt; offers a raw yet empathetic glimpse into a troubled community that locates its dignity in unexpected places: a neighborhood that refuses to be undone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Catherine Hernandez&lt;/b&gt; is a queer theatre practitioner and writer who has lived in Scarborough off and on for most of her life. Her plays &lt;i&gt;Singkil&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kilt Pins&lt;/i&gt; were published by Playwrights Canada Press, and her children's book &lt;i&gt;M is for Mustache: A Pride ABC Book&lt;/i&gt; was published by Flamingo Rampant. She is the Artistic Director of Sulong Theatre for women of color.</description>

  <description>"Moonfleet" (1898) begins as a mystery and an adventure story, a tale of smuggling set among the cliffs, caves, and downs of Dorset. What will be the outcome of the conflict between smugglers and revenue men? How can the hero, John Trenchard, discover the secret of Colonel John Mohune's treasure? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the book progresses these two interwoven themes resolve themselves into a third and richer one, with the friendship and suffering of both John Trenchard and the craggy, taciturn Elzevir Block. Falkner's feeling for history and for the landscape of his Dorset setting combine with his gift for storytelling to turn Moonfleet into a historical romance of moving intensity.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Do you keep a can of chaw in your work bag? Do you have a few recipes for squirrel in your back pocket? You’re not alone, so do the authors&lt;/b&gt;. Do you spend a lot of time a. huntin’ b. fishin’ c. cussin’ or d. all of the above? In &lt;i&gt;The Total Redneck Manual&lt;/i&gt;, there is no wrong answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you’re cruising in your pickup yelling “truck yeah”, have a bird dog named “Buddy”, consider yourself a “dime store cowgirl”, or are aspiring to all three, there’s something in this country-fried cultural document for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a loving celebration of an all-American cultural icon, but it’s also a hands-on working book that can help anyone better enjoy the great outdoors.  In true &lt;i&gt;Field &amp;amp; Stream&lt;/i&gt; fashion, it offers tried and true tips on 200+ essentials from picking the right hunting dog to fixing just about anything with duct tape and paracord, to frying up catfish and hushpuppies just like grandma used to make. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But being a redneck isn’t all hunting and fishing. It’s . . . largely hunting and fishing, according to the authors. But you’ll also learn how to open a beer bottle with just about anything, spit with deadly accuracy, and kit out the truck of your dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So, kick off your boots, crack open a cold one, take a seat on the porch, and learn from the best. </description>
