  <description>Eat Happy has 154 delicious grain-free, gluten-free recipes that are also free of any processed sugars. There are meats, fish, sides, soups, starters, casseroles, slow cooker recipes, breakfast dishes, and even desserts to satisfy any sweets craving you might have, all with virtually no sugar. If you are low carb, paleo, are wanting to keep autoimmune issues at bay, or just want to lose extra weight, Eat Happy gives you comfort food where you won’t miss the sugars or grains so your body and brain can feel happy from eating real foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2012, after almost ten years of being gluten free due to celiac, Anna Vocino found she was gaining weight faster than a tick on a labradoodle. Turns out the culprit wasn’t overeating or too much fat in the diet, but the pesky sugars and grains in all those gluten free comfort foods. When Anna started podcasting with Fitness Confidential author Vinnie Tortorich, she adapted her entire way of eating to go what Tortorich coined: NSNG—No Sugars No Grains. Sure enough, the weight dropped off, the inflammation due to celiac finally calmed down, and for the first time in her life, she learned what it meant to be truly happy about food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of Anna’s recipes are delicious, easy to make, and so satisfying, you won’t even know you’re eating healthy. Craving rich, decadent chocolate pots with fresh cream that are delicious but not fattening? Wanna make a grain-free pizza crust that actually helps you lose weight? Dying for pancakes, but you’ve committed to avoiding carbs? How about hearty shepherd’s pie, tater tots, sizzling ginger rice, all made with cauliflower instead of high carb rice and potatoes? Eat Happy offers low carb comfort foods to please the entire family.</description>

  <description>Ruth Croome, a Blackamoor heiress, was supposed to get married in a gorgeous wedding gown, made from her father’s exquisite fabrics. Instead, they eloped to Gretna Green and upon returning, their carriage was beset by highwaymen and she witnessed the murder of her new husband. Now, four years later, with a child, she wants to move on with her life. A marriage of convenience will do. Ruth already had a love for the ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Wilky is really the heir to the Wycliff barony—which he never told Ruth. Too much danger. So many secrets. When he was nearly beaten to death and sold into impressment, he thought Ruth had died, too. Ready for revenge, he finally returns and discovers Ruth alive—with a son who could only be his—and she is furious to discover he lied to her. Now it’ll take more than remembered passion if he hopes to win his reluctant wife back...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each book in the Advertisements for Love series is STANDALONE:&lt;br /&gt;* The Bittersweet Bride&lt;br /&gt;* The Bashful Bride&lt;br /&gt;* The Butterfly Bride&lt;br /&gt;* The Bewildered Bride</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Liza Palmer will have readers cheering as she explores friendship, true love, and self-acceptance i&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;n this "engaging and poignant" (Jennifer Weiner) novel. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone seems to be getting on with their lives except Maggie. At twenty-seven, she's still serving coffee at Joe's while her friends are getting married, having babies, and thriving in their careers. And now Olivia, Maggie's best friend since grade school, is getting married too. The man in Maggie's life? Well there isn't one, except the guy she has a crush on, Domenic, who works with her at the coffee shop. Oh, and her dog, Solo (the name says it all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Olivia comes to town and asks Maggie to be her maid of honor, Maggie is thrilled... but she can't help comparing herself to the new and "improved" Olivia. Way back then, they befriended each other because they both struggled with their weight. Now grown up, Maggie is still shopping in the "women's section" while Olivia went and had gastric-bypass surgery in search of the elusive size 2. But as the wedding nears, Olivia's seemingly perfect life starts to unravel, and Maggie realizes that happiness might not be tied to a number on the scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this wonderful novel, Liza Palmer is both witty and wise, giving a voice to women everywhere who have ever wished they could stop obsessing... and start living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Kudos to Liza Palmer." -&lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Palmer's likable characters and snappy dialogue make this novel stand out from the crowd." -&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;"In a word: genuine." -&lt;i&gt;Herald Sun&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When upstairs valet meets downstairs maid, the line between work and play blurs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Toogood dreamed of being valet to a great man…before he was laid off andblacklisted. Now he’s stuck in small-town Lively St. Lemeston until London’s Season opens and he can begin his embarrassing job hunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His instant attraction to happy-go-lucky maid Sukey Grimes couldn’t come at a worse time. Her manners are provincial, her respect for authority nonexistent, and her outdated cleaning methods — well, the less said about them, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind John’s austere façade, Sukey catches tantalizing glimpses of a lonely man with a gift for laughter. Yet her heart warns her not to fall for a man with one foot out the door, no matter how devastating his kiss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he lands a butler job in town — but there’s a catch. His employer, the vicar, insists Toogood be respectably married. Against both their better judgments, he and Sukey come to an arrangement. But the knot is barely tied when Sukey realizes she underestimated just how vexing it can be to be married to the boss…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Contains a butler with a protective streak a mile wide, and a maid who enjoys messing up the bed a whole lot more than making it.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A seductive thief&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady’s maid Molly Wilkins is done with thieving—and cheating and stabbing and all the rest of it. She’s determined to keep her hands to herself, so she really shouldn’t be tempted to seduce her employer’s prim and proper companion, Alice. But how can she resist when Alice can’t seem to keep her eyes off Molly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Finds her own heart&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in her life, Alice Stapleton has absolutely nothing to do. The only thing that seems to occupy her thoughts is a lady’s maid with a sharp tongue and a beautiful mouth. Her determination to know Molly’s secrets has her behaving in ways she never imagined as she begins to fall for the impertinent woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Has been stolen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an unwelcome specter from Alice’s past shows up unexpectedly at a house party, Molly volunteers to help the only way she knows how: with a little bit of mischief.</description>

  <description>Anthony Ryan's debut novel Blood Song - book one of the Raven's Shadow series - took the fantasy world by storm. The sequels, Tower Lord and Queen of Fire were both New York Times bestsellers. Now, Anthony Ryan returns to the world of this acclaimed fantasy series with The Wolf's Call, which begins a thrilling new story of razor-sharp action and epic adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PEACE NEVER LASTS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaelin Al Sorna is a living legend, his name known across the Realm. It was his leadership that overthrew empires, his blade that won hard-fought battles - and his sacrifice that defeated an evil more terrifying than anything the world had ever seen. Yet he cast aside his earned glory for a quiet life in the Realm's northern reaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now whispers have come from across the sea of an army called the Steel Horde, led by a man who believes himself a god. Vaelin has no wish to fight another war, but when he learns that Sherin, the woman he lost long ago, has fallen into the Horde's grasp, he resolves to confront this powerful new threat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To this end, Vaelin travels to the realms of the Merchant Kings, a land ruled by honour and intrigue. There, as the drums of war thunder across kingdoms riven by conflict, Vaelin learns a terrible truth: that there are some battles that even he cannot hope to win</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes you have to hit rock bottom to rise again…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hilarious new heartbreaker from Mhairi McFarlane!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there’s one thing worse than being fired from the grottiest restaurant in town, it’s coming home early to find your boyfriend in bed with someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reeling from the indignity of a double dumping on the same day, Georgina snatches at the next job that she’s offered – barmaid in a newly opened pub, which just so happens to run by the boy she fell in love with at school: Lucas McCarthy. And whereas Georgina (voted Most Likely to Succeed in her school yearbook) has done nothing but dead-end jobs in the last twelve years, Lucas has not only grown into a broodingly handsome man, but also has turned into an actual grown-up with a business and a dog along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Lucas again not only throws Georgina’s rackety present into sharp relief, but also brings a dark secret from her past bubbling to the surface. Only she knows the truth about what happened on the last day of school, and why she’s allowed it to chase her all these years…</description>

  <description>Includes the bonus novel &lt;i&gt;Wild Cowboy Ways&lt;/i&gt; by Carolyn Brown!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First rule of life on the run: never get attached. Nevada Sweet knows that better than anyone-it's just too dangerous to stay put. And until now, she's never wanted to. But she gets more than she bargained for when she walks into the Chestnut Creek Café looking for a job. Despite the protective wall she's built, her coworker Joseph has her imagining a life she isn't yet convinced she deserves...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Unforgiven, New Mexico has always been home, Joseph "Fishing Eagle" King still feels like an outsider-no matter how much he tries to give back to his Navajo community. Beneath Nevada's biting wit, he glimpses a similar vulnerability. Against all odds, Joseph finds himself falling for her, and it's clear she's not as unaffected as she pretends. When her past finally catches up with her, she'll have to decide whether to keep running, or fight for what's hers.</description>

  <description>In the heart of Venice, a woman is sacrificed to a forgotten god, sparking a mystery lost for thousands of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Penelope Bryne is ridiculed by the academic community for her quest to find the remnants of Atlantis, but when an ancient and mysterious script is found at a murder site, she flies to Venice determined to help the police before the killer strikes again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penelope has spent her entire life trying to ignore the unexplainable and magical history of Atlantis, but when she meets the enigmatic Alexis Donato, everything she believes will be challenged. Little does she know, Alexis has spent the last three years doing his best to sabotage Penelope’s career so doesn’t learn the truth—Atlantis had seven magicians who survived, and who he has a duty to protect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Alexis draws her into the darkly, seductive world of magic and history, Penelope will have to use her heart as well as her head if she is to find the answers she seeks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the new MOSE system due to come online, and Carnivale exploding around them, Penelope and Alexis will have to work together to stop the killer and prevent dark magic from pulling Venice into the sea.</description>

  <description>The first novel in a beautiful, heartbreaking new trilogy from Paullina Simons, the international bestselling author of Tully and The Bronze Horseman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can true love ever die?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julian lives a charmed life in Los Angeles. Surrounded by friends, he is young, handsome, and runs a successful business. Everything changes after he has a fateful encounter with a mysterious young woman named Josephine. Julian’s world is turned upside down by a love affair that takes him—and everyone else in his life—by storm. For the two new lovers, the City of Angels is transformed into a magical playground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Josephine is not what she seems and carries secrets that threaten to tear them apart—seemingly forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A broken man, his faith in tatters, Julian meets a mysterious stranger who tells him how to find Josephine again if he is willing to give up everything and take a death-defying trip from which no one has ever returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins Julian and Josephine’s extraordinary adventure of love, loss, and the mystical forces that bind people across time and space. It is a journey that propels Julian toward an impossible choice which will lead him to love fulfilled…or to oblivion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tiger Catcher takes readers from the depths of despair to the dizzying heights of joy in the first novel of an unforgettable trilogy of love lost and found. For all fans of Outlander, The Time Traveler’s Wife, and Jojo Moyes.</description>

  <description>All she wanted was a kiss…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What she got, was fiery passion…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily Howard knows she is destined to be a spinster. She has accepted this fate, but that doesn't stop her from wanting to experience kissing. What she doesn't expect, is for Griffin Crawford, the handsomest man in the world, to do the honors. Or for all her female relations to discover her in his embrace. Naturally, marriage is instantly mentioned, but since Emily knows this is not what Griffin wants, she tries to escape him, her family and the ensuing scandal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Emily flees the Camberly ball in the wake of their kiss, Griffin goes in pursuit. He will not allow his sister-in-law's determined friend to risk her safety for any reason. And risk it she will if she means to return to her countryside home by herself. But the longer he remains in her company, the more he is tempted to kiss her again. If only he could risk falling in love and remain in England forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The next book in the new lush Scottish historical series from &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author, May McGoldrick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maisie Murray is the picture of docility, quiet and compliant in the eyes of her family. To her activist friends, however, she's a fearless crusader for women's rights. In the wake of the Peterloo Massacre, Maisie and a friend found the Edinburgh Female Reform Society, and she carries the banner for universal suffrage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niall Campbell, a hero of the wars, a decorated officer of the Royal Highland Regiment, is battle weary and searching for stability in his life. A fierce warrior by training and a poet at heart, Niall walks away from the shining career that lies ahead of him, to the dismay of his superiors. In saving his sister when a protest turns violent, he meets Maisie. Their relationship begins as one of experience versus idealism, of scars versus hope. Soon, however, he finds in Maisie the heart he longs for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Niall's sister is arrested and disappears, he quickly realizes his life is not his own, for the British authorities have a mission for him to accomplish in exchange for his sister's freedom. Overnight, Maisie loses Niall, her friend, and her home. And the wake of the riots that sweep through the cities of Scotland, Maisie's own sister Isabella is branded a traitor to the crown, and the family must flee to the Highlands. Here in the heart of the Highlands, Maisie runs into Niall again. He has a new name and carries a message of hope―but Niall has a task to complete―and their future rests on their ability to overcome the forces that divide them, or―for the future of Scotland―she must stop the man who owns her heart.</description>

  <description>Private Investigator Kira Vance spends her days navigating the intricate labyrinth of Houston’s legal world, and she knows all of its shadowy players and dark secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a seemingly normal day, she’s delivering a report to her top client when suddenly everything goes sideways and the meeting ends in a bloodbath. Twenty-four hours later, the police have no suspects but one thing is clear: a killer has Kira in his sights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiercely independent, Kira doesn’t expect—or want—help from anyone, least of all an unscrupulous lawyer and his elite security team. Instead, she launches her own investigation, hoping to uncover the answers that have eluded the police. But as Kira’s hunt for clues becomes more and more perilous, she realizes that she alone may hold the key to finding a vicious murderer. And she knows she must take help wherever she can find it if she wants to stay alive.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Is it the perfect escape? &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Whitaker Island is more than a getaway. For Tessa Jenkins, the remote strip of land in Washington state is a sanctuary. Fleeing from a shattering scandal, she has a new name, a chance at a new beginning, and a breathtaking new view: Hansen Rye. It’s hard not to crush on Whitaker’s hottest handyman. At six-foot-three and all kinds of fine, he’s also intensely private—and the attraction between them soon simmers dangerously out of control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;…or a private trap for two lovers?&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a devastating family tragedy, Hansen finds the pebbled shores of the faraway island to be an ideal refuge. Letting down his guard for the sexy, impulsive Tessa is an unexpected pleasure. But there’s another newcomer to Whitaker. He’s no stranger to Hansen. And when he’s murdered, the crime casts a threatening shadow. As suspicion falls on Hansen, all his secrets are about to collide with Tessa’s. Now the pasts they were determined to outrun are catching up to them. So is a killer who’s putting their love—and their lives—on the line.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Hanna Keller runs her family's Tea House, serving up scrumptious snacks and tantalizing teas but when a customer keels over from a poisoned cuppa, Hanna and her tea-leaf reading grandma will have to catch a killer in the first of the new cozy mystery series from Julia Buckley.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanna Keller and her family run Maggie's Tea House, an establishment heavily influenced by the family's Hungarian descent and specializing in a European-style traditional tea service. But truthfully, one of the shop's largest draws is Hanna's eccentric grandmother, who's known for her remarkable ability to read the future in the leaves at the bottom of their customers' cups. Lately, however, her readings have become alarmingly ominous...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanna is also an avid teacup collector and especially takes pride in the Anna Weatherley butterfly cup she recently procured. But the exquisite piece of porcelain soon becomes the center of a murder investigation, when it's suspected of delivering poison to one of the guests at their most recent event. Hanna's determined to find the true killer, exonerate her family, their business, and in the process, reclaim her beautiful Budapest Butterfly.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A young lady's tarnished reputation might cost her everything in this first book in the Disreputable Debutantes series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shy, bookish Sophie Brightwell is expected to make an advantageous match to improve her family's fortunes. However, Sophie's plans to make a spectacular debut go horribly awry when she and her three closest friends are expelled from a young ladies' academy for unbecoming conduct. Since the ton will be sure to close their doors on these disgraced debutantes, they determine that unconventional means need to be employed in the husband-hunting market. Rakehells—the beau monde's wickedest members—might be the only men willing to overlook a young lady's besmirched reputation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But how does one catch a rake?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nate Hastings, the devil-may-care Viscount Malverne, is the older brother of Sophie’s best friend, fellow disgraced debutante Lady Charlotte. When a terribly foxed Nate accidentally compromises Sophie, Charlotte strikes a wicked bargain: in order to avoid a scandal and the parson's mousetrap, Nate must help Sophie snare a husband. But as Nate fulfills his obligation and begins to instruct the lovely Sophie in the art of luring rakes, he soon finds himself battling his own fierce attraction to her.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;USA Today&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; bestselling series proves it's tough to resist a sexy cowboy with a Texas drawl and heart of gold! Includes a bonus novella by Annie Rains! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A WILD COWBOY WITH A BIG HEART&lt;br /&gt;Ever since losing his best friend in a motorcycle accident, Taggart Baker wants to make every moment count. No dare is too dangerous, no adventure too crazy for this cowboy. But after one bad brush with the law, he realizes it's time to ditch his hooligan friends and grow up. Now he's running his own ranch next to the Longhorn Canyon spread in Texas. Still, no one would ever call him tame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nikki Grady has worked too hard for her RN license just to throw it away for some reckless cowboy who shows up in her emergency room after a barroom brawl. But she can't help being drawn to Tag's sense of humor and those crystal blue eyes. The more time they spend together, the more she sees his good heart. But just as Tag seems ready to settle down for good, his troubled past comes calling-and this time he won't be able to walk away so easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Includes the bonus novella &lt;i&gt;A Wedding on Lavender Hill &lt;/i&gt;by Annie Rains: &lt;/b&gt;When an event planner is asked to create the perfect wedding in just three days, she must turn to the last person she wants to ask for help -- the infuriating owner of the house on the hilltop.</description>

  <description>Baron. Physician. Smuggler. Sir Harland Hayward is living a double life as an aristocrat by day and a criminal by night. As a doctor, Harland has the perfect cover to appear in odd places in the dead of night, a cover he uses to his advantage to bring in all sorts of illicit cargo from across the English Channel. He's chosen this life to save his family from financial ruin, but he draws the line at taking advantage of the honest and trustworthy Katherine Wright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katherine has returned to Dover to find that her family is working for a mysterious new crime boss. Growing up in a family of smugglers, she knows it's only a matter of time before they are caught—and killed. So after her brother is shot, she convinces her family to move away and start over. After they honor their last contract, of course. With her injured brother and elderly father unable to work, Katherine reluctantly steps back into the life she had left behind. And straight into the path of the merciless Harland Hayward.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Hellions of Halstead Hall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;They're the scandalous Sharpes, five hell-raising siblings tainted by a shocking family legacy. Now each faces a daunting ultimatum: marry by year's end—or kiss their inheritance good-bye.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the two decades since a tragic "accident" took the lives of his parents, Oliver Sharpe, the Marquess of Stoneville, has survived the scandal surrounding that fateful night by living as an unrepentant rakehell. And with his grandmother vowing to disinherit him if he doesn't settle down and wed, he plans to fulfill the bargain in true Sharpe style—by bringing home a fake fiancée from a brothel! But his scheme is derailed when he rescues an American beauty in a dire predicament instead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maria Butterfield came to London to track down her groom-to-be, who's gone missing, but her engagement won't stop Oliver from getting what he wants: her, in his bed. His rebellious masquerade may call his grandmother's bluff, but it's soon made all too real—by a love that tempts him to be a hellion no more.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The clock is ticking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fearsome Gray Box operative Gideon Stone is devoted to his work and his team. He's never given reason to doubt his loyalty...until he's tasked with investigating Willow Harper, a beguiling cryptologist suspected of selling deadly bio-agents on the black market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He knows she's innocent. He knows she's being framed. And he knows that without him, Willow will be dead before sunrise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrust into the crossfire of an insidious international conspiracy, Gideon will do anything to keep Willow safe...even if that means waging war against his own.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A stunning debut for author Evie Dunmore and her Oxford Rebels, in which a fiercely independent vicar's daughter takes on a duke in a fiery love story that threatens to upend the British social order.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;England, 1879.&lt;/i&gt; Annabelle Archer, the brilliant but destitute daughter of a country vicar, has earned herself a place among the first cohort of female students at the renowned University of Oxford. In return for her scholarship, she must support the rising women's suffrage movement. Her charge: recruit men of influence to champion their cause. Her target: Sebastian Devereux, the cold and calculating Duke of Montgomery who steers Britain's politics at the Queen's command. Her challenge: not to give in to the powerful attraction she can't deny for the man who opposes everything she stands for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian is appalled to find a suffragist squad has infiltrated his ducal home, but the real threat is his impossible feelings for green-eyed beauty Annabelle. He is looking for a wife of equal standing to secure the legacy he has worked so hard to rebuild, not an outspoken commoner who could never be his duchess. But he wouldn't be the greatest strategist of the Kingdom if he couldn't claim this alluring bluestocking without the promise of a ring...or could he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Locked in a battle with rising passion and a will matching her own, Annabelle will learn just what it takes to topple a duke....</description>

  <description>First in a new series from national bestselling author Kylie Logan, The Scent of Murder is a riveting mystery following Jazz Ramsey as she trains cadaver dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way Jazz Ramsey figures it, life is pretty good. She’s thirty-five years old and owns her own home in one of Cleveland’s most diverse, artsy, and interesting neighborhoods. She has a job she likes as an administrative assistant at an all-girls school, and a volunteer interest she’s passionate about—Jazz is a cadaver dog handler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jazz is working with Luther, a cadaver dog in training. Luther is still learning cadaver work, so Jazz is putting him through his paces at an abandoned building that will soon be turned into pricey condos. When Luther signals a find, Jazz is stunned to see the body of a young woman who is dressed in black and wearing the kind of make-up and jewelry that Jazz used to see on the Goth kids back in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s even more shocked when she realizes that beneath the tattoos and the piercings and all that pale make up is a familiar face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lead detective on the case is an old lover, and the murdered woman is an old student. Jazz finds herself sucked into the case, obsessed with learning the truth.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Award-winning author Sonali Dev launches a new series about the Rajes, an immigrant Indian family descended from royalty, who have built their lives in San Francisco...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a truth universally acknowledged that only in an overachieving Indian American family can a genius daughter be considered a black sheep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Trisha Raje is San Francisco’s most acclaimed neurosurgeon. But that’s not enough for the Rajes, her influential immigrant family who’s achieved power by making its own non-negotiable rules:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;·       Never trust an outsider&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;·       Never do anything to jeopardize your brother’s political aspirations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;·       And never, ever, defy your family&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trisha is guilty of breaking all three rules. But now she has a chance to redeem herself. So long as she doesn’t repeat old mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up-and-coming chef DJ Caine has known people like Trisha before, people who judge him by his rough beginnings and place pedigree above character. He needs the lucrative job the Rajes offer, but he values his pride too much to indulge Trisha’s arrogance. And then he discovers that she’s the only surgeon who can save his sister’s life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the two clash, their assumptions crumble like the spun sugar on one of DJ’s stunning desserts. But before a future can be savored there’s a past to be reckoned with...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A family trying to build home in a new land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man who has never felt at home anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a choice to be made between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Return to Alaska's Grizzly Harbor where danger strikes with arctic precision and love thaws the coldest hearts in the newest romantic suspense from the USA Today bestselling author of SEAL's Honor.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Mariah McKenna lands in the hospital with a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction she knows she didn’t cause, she realizes her cheating, vindictive husband would rather have a dead wife than a divorce. Afraid that he will succeed in killing her next time, Mariah goes to Grizzly Harbor to hire one of the Alaska Force special operatives to help her survive long enough to finally live a little.&lt;br /&gt;Griffin Cisneros traded in a comfortable future for boot camp, where he learned the virtue of patience and focus—skills that served him well as a Marine sniper. Few things get to him these days, but something about Mariah’s mix of toughness and vulnerability gets right under his skin. Until it’s clear she’s the one thing in the world that might melt the ice in stoic, reserved Griffin, whether he likes it or not. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If he can just keep her alive...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The timeless romance, soaring passion—and gorgeous men—of Scotland comes to modern-day America. And the rules of love will never be the same…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isabel Buchanan is fiery, funny, and never at a loss for words. But she is struck speechless when her mother returns from a trip to Scotland with a six-foot-tall, very handsome souvenir. Izzy’s mother is so infatuated by the fellow that Izzy has to plan their annual Highland Games all by herself. Well, not completely by herself. The Highlander’s strapping young nephew has come looking for his uncle…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alasdair Blackmoor has never seen a place as friendly as this small Georgia town—or a girl as brilliant and beguiling as Izzy. Instead of saving his uncle, who seems to be having a lovely time, Alasdair decides he’d rather help Izzy with the Highland Games. Show her how to dance like a Highlander. Drink like a Highlander. And maybe, just maybe, fall in love with a Highlander. But when the games are over, where do they go from here?</description>

  <description>The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Summer Wives&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Certain Age&lt;/em&gt; creates a dazzling epic of World War II-era Nassau—a hotbed of spies, traitors, and the most infamous couple of the age, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bahamas, 1941. Newly-widowed Leonora “Lulu” Randolph arrives in Nassau to investigate the Governor and his wife for a New York society magazine. After all, American readers have an insatiable appetite for news of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, that glamorous couple whose love affair nearly brought the British monarchy to its knees five years earlier. What more intriguing backdrop for their romance than a wartime Caribbean paradise, a colonial playground for kingpins of ill-gotten empires?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so Lulu imagines. But as she infiltrates the Duke and Duchess’s social circle, and the powerful cabal that controls the islands’ political and financial affairs, she uncovers evidence that beneath the glister of Wallis and Edward’s marriage lies an ugly—and even treasonous—reality. In fact, Windsor-era Nassau seethes with spies, financial swindles, and racial tension, and in the middle of it all stands Benedict Thorpe: a scientist of tremendous charm and murky national loyalties. Inevitably, the willful and wounded Lulu falls in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Nassau’s wealthiest man is murdered in one of the most notorious cases of the century, and the resulting coverup reeks of royal privilege. Benedict Thorpe disappears without a trace, and Lulu embarks on a journey to London and beyond to unpick Thorpe’s complicated family history: a fateful love affair, a wartime tragedy, and a mother from whom all joy is stolen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stories of two unforgettable women thread together in this extraordinary epic of espionage, sacrifice, human love, and human courage, set against a shocking true crime . . . and the rise and fall of a legendary royal couple.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NEVER FALL IN LOVE WITH A COWBOY&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Jessa Mae Love is done with relationships. No matter how tempting he might be, she cannot--will not--fall for a man like Lance Cortez. The outrageously handsome cowboy is practically a living legend in Colorado, as famous for riding bulls as he is for breaking hearts. What would a big-time rodeo star like him see in a small-town veterinarian who wears glasses, rescues animals, and cries when watching rom-coms? Turns out, &lt;i&gt;plenty.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; Raising bulls, riding the circuit, and looking after his ailing father--Lance never stands still for long. Yet Jessa catches his attention, and the more she tries to resist him, the more he wants her. When she agrees to move to the ranch to keep an eye on Lance's dad, Jessa tells him they have to keep it professional: no flirting, no sweet talk, and definitely no kissing. But with Jessa now living under his roof, that's easier said than done . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Freddy Carlton knows she should be focusing on her lines for The Austen Playbook, a live-action TV event where viewers choose the outcome of each scene, but her concentration’s been blown. The palatial estate housing the endeavor is now run by the rude (brilliant) critic who’s consistently slammed her performances of late. James “Griff” Ford-Griffin has a penchant for sarcasm, a majestic nose and all the sensitivity of a sledgehammer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She can’t take her eyes off him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Griff can hardly focus with a contagious joy fairy flitting about near him, especially when Freddy looks at him like that. His only concern right now should be on shutting down his younger brother’s well-intentioned (disastrous) schemes—or at the very least on the production (not this one) that might save his family home from the banks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead all he can think of is soft skin and vibrant curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he’s reluctantly dragged into her quest to rediscover her passion for the stage and Freddy is drawn into his research on a legendary theater star, the adage about appearances being deceiving proves abundantly true. It’s the unlikely start of something enormous…but a single revelation about the past could derail it all.</description>

  <description>TAUNTING TEMPTATION &lt;br /&gt;Aria Dunning slapped Tynan Rutland's handsome face with great satisfaction. The beautiful colonist was not about to sacrifice her virtue just so her royalist father could marry her off to an unscrupulous English earl. Rutland would never wed her—he'd toy with her body and her heart, then toss her aside with a contemptuous flash of his steel-gray eyes. Aria vowed not to succumb to his arrogant seduction... no matter how much she craved the savage power of his embrace! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAUNTING DESIRE &lt;br /&gt;Rutland stalked his golden-haired prey like the experienced hunter he was. She was defiant, she was stubborn, and he'd have her just the same. He would mold her soft curves to his lean, muscular frame and silence her protests with a fiery kiss. He'd teach her what a sweet victory surrender could bring. Her full red lips would sigh her pleasure, her brilliant emerald eyes would darken with desire, and she would be his for a lifetime of love's Rebel Passion</description>

  <description>Self-made man Aidan Iverson has seen more closed doors in his thirty years than he’s ever cared to count. As a member of the elite Duke’s Den, he has all the money he could possibly need, but the one thing he can’t purchase is true power. If roguish Aidan can’t buy his way into society’s hallowed halls, he’ll resort to a more extreme measure: marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought up to be a proper lady, the only thing Diana Ashby desires is to be left alone to the creation of her own devices. But when her dreams are crushed, she must find another way to secure the future of her invention. Knowing his desire to enter her world, Diana strikes a deal to arrange Aidan’s marriage to the perfect lady—as long as that lady isn’t her. She doesn’t need any distractions from her work, particularly of the sinfully handsome variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Diana and Aidan set out to find him an aristocratic match, neither are prepared for the passion that ignites between them or the love they can’t ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Duke’s Den, can happiness ever be a winning prospect?</description>

  <description>Here is the novel that started it all- the first book in J.D. Robb's number-one &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling In Death series, featuring New York homicide detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas and Roarke. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is the year 2058, and technology now completely rules the world. But New York City Detective Eve Dallas knows that the irresistible impulses of the human heart are still ruled by just one thing: passion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When a senator's daughter is killed, the secret life of prostitution she'd been leading is revealed. The high-profile case takes Lieutenant Eve Dallas into the rarefied circles of Washington politics and society. Further complicating matters is Eve's growing attraction to Roarke, who is one of the wealthiest and most influential men on the planet, devilishly handsome... and the leading suspect in the investigation.</description>

  <description>#1 New York Times bestselling author Sandra Brown returns with a potent fusion of tantalizing suspense and romance, in a thriller about a reckless pilot caught in a race against time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rye Mallett, a fearless “freight dog” pilot charged with flying cargo to far-flung locations, is often rough-spoken, usually unshaven, and he never gets the regulation eight hours of shut-eye before a flight; but he does have a rock-solid reputation: he will fly in the foulest weather, day or night, and deliver the goods safely to their destination. So, when Rye is asked to fly into a completely fogbound Northern Georgia town and deliver a mysterious black box to a Dr. Lambert, he doesn’t ask why–he just ups his price. As Rye’s plane nears the isolated landing strip, more trouble than inclement weather awaits him. He is greeted first by a sabotage attempt that causes him to crash land, and then by Dr. Brynn O’Neal, who claims she was sent for the box in Dr. Lambert’s stead. Despite Rye’s firm “no-involvement” policy when it comes to other people–especially gorgeous women he doesn’t trust–he knows that something about his mysterious cargo just isn’t adding up. Soon Rye and Brynn are in a treacherous 48-hour race to deliver the box before time runs out. With the hours slipping by and everyone from law enforcement officials to hired thugs hot on their heels, the two must protect their valuable cargo from those who would kill for it–that is, if they can trust each other.</description>

  <description>What could two troubled souls from different walks of life have in common? Maybe everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andra Lawler lives isolated at her family’s horse ranch, imprisoned by the memories of an assault in college. When she needs help training her foals, she hires a Haitian-Creole cowboy from New Orleans with a laugh as big as the Montana sky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LJ Delisle can’t stand the idea that Andra might be lonely—or eating frozen TV dinners. He bakes his way into her kitchen with a lemon velvet cake, and offers her cooking lessons that set them on the road to romance. But even their love can’t escape the shadow of what they've been through. Despite their growing friendship and his gentle rapport with the horses, LJ is still an outsider facing small-town suspicions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before they can work through their issues, LJ is called home by a family emergency. In the centuries-old, raggedly rebuilt streets of New Orleans, he must confront memories of Hurricane Katrina and familiar discrimination. And Andra must decide if she’s brave enough to leave the shelter of the ranch for an uncertain future with LJ.</description>

  <description>No one ever said big dreams come easy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Nesto Vasquez, moving his Afro-Caribbean food truck from New York City to the wilds of Upstate New York is a huge gamble. If it works? He’ll be a big fish in a little pond. If it doesn’t? He’ll have to give up the hustle and return to the day job he hates. He’s got six months to make it happen—the last thing he needs is a distraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jude Fuller is proud of the life he’s built on the banks of Cayuga Lake. He has a job he loves and good friends. It’s safe. It’s quiet. And it’s damn lonely. Until he tries Ithaca’s most-talked-about new lunch spot and works up the courage to flirt with the handsome owner. Soon he can’t get enough—of Nesto’s food &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; of Nesto. For the first time in his life, Jude can finally taste the kind of happiness that’s always been just out of reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An opportunity too good to pass up could mean a way to stay together and an incredible future for them both…if Nesto can remember happiness isn’t always measured by business success. And if Jude can overcome his past and trust his man will never let him down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is approximately 94,000 words</description>

But what happens when the woman you fall in love with swears she'll only marry you as a last resort? &lt;i&gt;Rogue Most Wanted &lt;/i&gt;is the next book in the sparkling, romantic &lt;i&gt;Cavensham Heiress &lt;/i&gt;series by Janna MacGregor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHE NEEDS TO MARRY SOMEONE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Theodora Worth needs to marry fast in order to keep her estate. It’s been her heart and home for years, and she’ll not lose it to anyone. There’s just one problem—as a woman who was raised in isolation by her grandfather, she’s completely incapable of pouring a cup of tea, never mind wooing a man. She’ll need a little matchmaking help from her sprightly next-door neighbor in order to find a convenient husband…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;IT’S JUST NOT GOING TO BE HIM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lord William Cavensham’s heart was broken years ago, and since that day he vowed to never love again. But his spirited Great Aunt Stella is determined he’ll marry or not inherit a single penny from her. And she’s got just the woman in mind—her beautiful and completely hapless next-door neighbor, Thea…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thea and Will agree there’s no sense in marrying each other. Will wholeheartedly believes he’s incapable of love, and Thea refuses to marry the first man she’s practically met. But Will may be the rogue Thea wants the most after all…</description>

  <description>Hemdeep Singh knows exactly what he wants. With his intelligence and determination, he has what it takes to build his own legacy away from Bharat, Inc. and the empire his father created. But when his brother calls him home, Hem puts his dreams on hold once again to help save the company he walked away from. That’s when he encounters the devastating Mina Kohli in the Bharat boardroom, and he realizes he’s in for more than he had bargained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mina will do whatever it takes to regain control of her mother’s law firm, even if it means agreeing to an arranged marriage. Her newest case assignment is to assist Bharat in the midst of a potential takeover. It could be the key to finally achieving her goal while preventing her marriage to a man she doesn’t love—as long as her explosive attraction to Hem doesn’t get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Mina and Hem work to save Bharat, they not only uncover secrets that could threaten the existence of the company, but they also learn that in a winner-takes-all game, love always comes out on top.</description>

  <description>Ms. Kane writes like no other, says Romantic Times of Andrea Kane's breath-catching, dramatic mixture of romance and danger. Now, in this dazzling sequel to The Gold Coin, she continues her suspenseful tale of two beautiful cousins, so alike even their own family mistakes them, so enmeshed in a web of deceit that their very lives are at risk.... All her life, Breanna Colby has lived on the precipice of fear, her only joy the recent reunion with her beloved cousin Anastasia. With her violent father now locked away in jail, the repressed young woman can emerge from her cocoon and pursue all the joys she's been denied. But she finds -- to her terror -- that not all the shadows have lifted, and an evil from the past stalks both her and Anastasia. When authorities are unable to help with this assassin lurking in the darkness, the Colbys turn to the brilliant, unconventional Royce Chadwick, England's foremost expert on finding people who don't want to be found. Hard, detached Royce has always been a loner who operates by his own set of rules. He has little patience for weakness. Delicate Breanna Colby is an eye-opener to him, for beneath her fragile exterior ties a core of steel. As the two face overwhelming danger side by side, Royce discovers a woman he never dreamed existed -- one who, despite his cynicism, he is losing his heart to. But their future together can never be -- not unless Royce kills the assassin before the assassin kills them.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;48 hours&lt;br /&gt;2 covert operatives&lt;br /&gt;1 chance to get it right&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddox Kinkade is an expert at managing the impossible. Tasked with neutralizing a lethal bioweapon, she turns to the one person capable of helping her stop the threat of pandemic in time: the love of her life, back from the dead and mad as hell at her supposed betrayal. Recruiting Cole to save millions of lives may be harder than resisting the attraction still burning between them, but Maddox will do whatever it takes...even if it destroys her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Maddox crashes back into Cole Matthews' life, he wants to fight back. He wants to hate her. But the crisis is too strong to ignore, and soon the two former lovers find themselves working side-by-side in a breakneck race to stop a world-class killer with a secret that could end everything.</description>

And her sensational career is headed for the stratosphere with a million-dollar movie deal and an explosive encounter with the man every woman in America wants. But long-hidden secrets surface with her waking passions, forcing her to flee her lover, her family—even her own fame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a cloistered convent childhood in France to New York, from Hollywood to Paris and on through the squalid back streets of Europe, Fleur Savagar will set out in search of the woman she's yet to be... a woman willing to risk and dare… willing to face deception and betrayal... willing to learn the grown-up rules of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the poignant and ultimately triumphant story of a young woman determined to make her own way in a world glittering with money, ambition, and revenge.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The scandalously handsome Samson Carlisle is not the deceiving nobleman Lady Olivia was searching for...but he's the lover she fervently desires.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A lady's heart is a tempting plaything for the Duke of Scandal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He stands apart from other men—a dark, tall, breathtaking figure of seductive masculinity. With a smile, he can topple the defenses of even the most proper maiden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with a single whisper, she will be his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wife in name only, Lady Olivia Shea has returned to London in a rage, determined to confront her new husband, who vanished months ago with her inheritance on their wedding night. Yet this hauntingly familiar man who stands before her—this face and form she adores—is not her deceiving Edmund but the blackguard's twin brother, Samson Carlisle, Duke of Durham. Samson knows of his sibling's penchant for perfidy and he graciously offers to help the exquisite Olivia locate the missing rogue and recover her stolen fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Olivia fears that accompanying this mysterious, dangerous, eminently desirable man would be courting the most devastating sort of scandal—especially since it is now Samson's arms she aches to feel surrounding her, and his kiss she longs to taste</description>

  <description>The ethereal Lady Aurinia lived in danger from the powerful who would use her for their own ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet she freely aided those in need, even knowing that love was forever denied her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powerful in ways unspoken, the warrior Macsen had breached the mystical defenses surrounding Lady Aurinia's ancient hall, for desperation drove him to seek the help of her healing hands--and her open heart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But could the bond they'd formed--fine as gossamer, strong as steel--withstand the firestorm of a marauding Viking horde?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A brand new romantic comedy from New York Times bestseller Tessa Bailey!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgette Castle’s family runs the best home renovation business in town, but she picked balloons instead of blueprints and they haven’t taken her seriously since. Frankly, she’s over it. Georgie loves planning children’s birthday parties and making people laugh, just not at her own expense. She’s determined to fix herself up into a Woman of the World... whatever that means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase one: new framework for her business (a website from this decade, perhaps?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase two: a gut-reno on her wardrobe (fyi, leggings are pants.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase three: updates to her exterior (do people still wax?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase four: put herself on the market (and stop crushing on Travis Ford!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living her best life means facing the truth: Georgie hasn’t been on a date since, well, ever. Nobody’s asking the town clown out for a night of hot sex, that’s for sure. Maybe if people think she’s having a steamy love affair, they’ll acknowledge she’s not just the “little sister” who paints faces for a living. And who better to help demolish that image than the resident sports star and tabloid favorite?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis Ford was major league baseball’s hottest rookie when an injury ended his career. Now he’s flipping houses to keep busy and trying to forget his glory days. But he can’t even cross the street without someone recapping his greatest hits. Or making a joke about his… bat. And then there's Georgie, his best friend’s sister, who is not a kid anymore. When she proposes a wild scheme—that they pretend to date, to shock her family and help him land a new job—he agrees. What’s the harm? It’s not like it’s real. But the girl Travis used to tease is now a funny, full-of-life woman and there’s nothing fake about how much he wants her...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love burns white-hot in this first scorching romance in an all-new trilogy about a family of firefighters from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Play-by-Play novels and the Hope series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firefighter Jackson Donovan doesn't look back—as a rule. So when his past comes roaring back to life in the form of not-so-damsel-in-distress Becks Benning, the last thing he wants to do is relive old times. No matter how tempting she makes it seem...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now thanks to his two interfering brothers, Becks is living with them while she looks for a new place and tries to pick up the pieces of her tattoo business that went up in flames. Which means a grown up, smokin' hot Becks is in his house, sharing meals, and digging up old wounds. And despite his better judgement, the more time he spends with this smart, artistic, incredible woman the more he wants her in his bed—and his future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Becks always had it bad for Jackson. Unfortunately for her, not much has changed—he's still honorable, hard-working, sexy as sin—and closed off. But there's more than one way to get to a man's heart and if Jackson doesn't want to recall old memories, she'll just have to help him make new ones. Because now that she's found Jackson again, she's not letting him go.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The animal world is full of mysteries. Why do dogs slurp from their drinking bowls while cats lap up water with a delicate flick of the tongue? How does a tiny turtle hatchling from Florida circle the entire northern Atlantic before returning to the very beach where it hatched? And how can a Komodo dragon kill a water buffalo with a bite only as strong as a domestic cat's?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These puzzles - and many more besides - are all explained by physics. From heat and light to electricity and magnetism, &lt;i&gt;Furry Logic&lt;/i&gt; unveils the ways that more than 30 animals exploit physics to eat, drink, mate and dodge death in their daily battle for survival. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, science journalists Matin Durrani and Liz Kalaugher introduce the great physicists whose discoveries helped us understand the animal world, as well as the animal experts of today who are scouring the planet to find and study the animals that seem to push the laws of physics to the limit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Presenting mind-bending physics principles in a simple and engaging way, &lt;i&gt;Furry Logic &lt;/i&gt;will appeal both to animal lovers and to those curious to see how physics crops up in the natural world. It's more of a 'howdunit' than a whodunit, though you're unlikely to guess some of the answers.</description>

  <description>Unforgettable characters, sizzling romance, and riveting suspense: These are the trademarks of beloved author Judith McNaught. With millions of devoted fans and ten New York Times bestsellers to date, McNaught is a writer whose work just gets better with each new novel-and Every Breath You Take is the book readers have been waiting for. Returning to the lavish Chicago setting of her popular novel Paradise, and revisiting some of that book's characters as well, this story will captivate in inimitable Judith McNaught style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High atop a snow-covered hill, the stately old Wyatt mansion is perched like a crown, its stone spires pointing upward, its stained glass windows glowing like colorful jewels. Such opulence means success and, surely, happiness. But on the eve of wealthy philanthropist Cecil Wyatt's eightieth birthday, all the money in the world won't bring back his missing grandson, William Wyatt. The only thing for certain: Foul play was involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The family, the police, the media-all have tried in vain to discover the young man's fate. Now suspicion has turned shockingly toward William's own half-brother, the rather distant and enigmatic Mitchell Wyatt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Donovan never dreamed that a chance romantic encounter on a tropical island paradise would tag her as a suspect in a high-society murder case. But after Kate tangles with the darkly charismatic Mitchell Wyatt, she finds herself cast in a shadow of guilt and mistrust. As the Chicago police tighten their net, it will take all of Kate's ingenuity to clear her name. With her calm, cool wit, and the help of a man who may or may not be a dangerous catch, Kate vows to claim the life and love she desires.</description>

  <description>A debut psychological thriller about a woman who moves with her family to the gothic seaside house where her husband grew up--and where 15 years ago another family was brutally slaughtered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah and Patrick are happy. But after her mother's death, Sarah spirals into depression and overdoses on sleeping pills. While Sarah claims it was an accident, her teenage children aren't so sure. Patrick decides they all need a fresh start and he knows just the place, since the idyllic family home where he was raised has recently come up for sale. There's only one catch: for the past fifteen years, it has become infamous as the "Murder House", standing empty after a family was stabbed to death within its walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patrick believes they can bring the house back to its former glory, so Sarah, uprooted from everything she knows, pours her energy into painting, gardening, and giving the rotting old structure the warmth of home. But with locals hinting that the house is haunted, the news that the murderer has been paroled, strange writing on the walls, and creepy "gifts" arriving on the doorstep at odd hours, Sarah can't shake the feeling that something just isn't right. Not with the house, not with the town, or even with her own, loving husband--whose stories about his perfect childhood suddenly aren't adding up. Can Sarah uncover the secrets of the Murder House before another family is destroyed?</description>

It was a one-shot deal for both of them. Or so they thought.... Because when Chase comes home, he learns that he's very legally hitched to the feisty captain. And, funnily enough, it's not bothering him at all....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their mistaken union is strictly against air force rules. There'll be hell to pay if it's discovered. But the sex is so very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Career-driven Chase knows he has to give Rina up, for both their sakes. And he'll think about it--once he has the willpower to leave her bed....</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Bestselling author Vanessa Kelly returns with an enthralling new series about the men of the Kendrick clan—and the women who claim their hearts . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Lady Ainsley Matthews, heiress and darling of the &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt;, was expected to make a magnificent match. Instead she’s hiding on a remote Scottish estate, terrified that her vicious former fiancé will use her pregnancy to force her into marriage. One man can help her—Royal Kendrick, son of a distinguished Highland clan. Though a mistake drove them apart long ago, Royal is the only person Ainsley trusts to protect her baby—even if that means agreeing to never see either of them again . . .&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Scarred in body and soul by war, Royal suddenly has a purpose—caring for an innocent babe and thereby helping the woman he can’t stop loving. But when Ainsley ultimately returns to Scotland, determined to be a real mother to her child in spite of the risk, there’s only one solution: marriage. And only one likely outcome: surrendering to the desire that’s simmered between them for so long, no matter how dangerous it may be . . .&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Julie Anne Long comes the second book in an exciting new historical romance series, the first since her beloved Pennyroyal Green series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He has devil's blood in his veins.&lt;/i&gt; At least, that's always been the legend. How else could the Duke of Brexford's notorious bastard son return from the dead? The brutal decade since Lucien Durand, Lord Bolt, allegedly drowned in the Thames forged him into a man who always gets what—and who—he wants. And what he wants is vengeance for his stolen birthright...and one wild night in Angelique Breedlove's bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angelique recognizes heartbreak when the enigmatic Lord Bolt walks into The Grand Palace on the Thames, and not even his devastating charm can tempt her to risk her own ever again. One scorching kiss drives home the danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the space between them springs a trust that feels anything but safe. And the passion—explosive, consuming—drives Lucien to his knees. Now his whole life depends on proving his love to a woman who doesn't believe in it...because his true birthright, he now knows, is guardian of Angelique Breedlove's heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Who knew love would be her secret weapon?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cassandra Benton has always survived by her wits and wiles, even working for Bow Street alongside her twin brother. When injury takes him out of commission, Cass must support the family by taking on an intriguing new case: George, Lord Northbrook, believes someone is plotting to kill his father, the Duke of Ardmore. Decades before, the duke was one of ten who formed a wager that would grant a fortune to the last survivor. But someone can't wait for nature to take its course—and George hopes a seasoned investigator like Cass can find out who.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cass relishes the chance to spy on the &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt;, shrewdly disguised as handsome Lord Northbrook's notorious "cousin." What she doesn't expect is her irresistible attraction to her dashing employer, and days of investigation soon turn to passionate nights. But with a killer closing in and her charade as a lady of the &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt; in danger of collapsing at any moment, Cass has no choice but to put her life—and her heart—in the hands of the last man she ought to trust.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;HAPPILY-EVER-AFTER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London socialite Amelia-Rose Baxter is nobody’s fool. Her parents may want her to catch a title, but she will never change who she is for the promise of marriage. Her husband will be a man who can appreciate her sharp mind as well as her body. A sophisticated man who loves life in London. A man who considers her his equal―and won’t try to tame her wild heart...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;IN THE HIGHLANDS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rough, rugged Highlander Niall MacTaggert and his brothers know the rules: the eldest must marry or lose the ancestral estate, period. But Niall’s eldest brother just isn’t interested in the lady his mother selected. Is it because Amelia-Rose is just too. . . Free-spirited? Yes. Brazen? Aye. Surely Niall can find a way to soften up the whip-smart lass and make her the perfect match for his brother for the sake of the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;JUST GOT A WHOLE LOT HOTTER.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead it’s Niall who tempts Amelia-Rose, despite her reservations about barbarian Highlanders. Niall finds the lass nigh irresistible as well, but he won’t make the mistake his father did in marrying an Englishwoman who doesn’t like the Highlands. Does he have what it takes to win her heart? There is only one way to find out...</description>

  <description>“Sharp...sets a bittersweet love story within the cut-throat world of academic research, a great pairing [Rothman] explores with heart [and] smarts.” – Publishers Weekly (starred review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily Apell arrives in Justin McKinnon’s renowned research lab with the single-minded goal of making a breakthrough discovery. But a colleague in the lab, Aeden Doherty, has been working on a similar topic, and his findings threaten to compete with her research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Emily’s surprise, her rational mind is unsettled by Aeden, and when they end up working together their animosity turns to physical passion, followed by love. Emily eventually allows herself to envision a future with Aeden, but when he decides to leave the lab it becomes clear to her that she must make a choice. It is only years later, when she is about to receive a prestigious award for the work they did together, that Emily is able to unravel everything that happened between them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Refreshing...Asks urgent questions about female ambition. Fans of Lab Girl have found a worthy successor.” -- Real Simple</description>

  <description>Desperate to escape a loveless marriage and society’s constraints, pampered heiress Sophia Hathaway jilts her groom, packs up her paints and sketchbook, and assumes a new identity, posing as a governess to secure passage on the Aphrodite. She wants a life of her own: unsheltered, unconventional, uninhibited. But it’s one thing to sketch all her wildest, most wanton fantasies, and quite another to face the dangerously handsome libertine who would steal both her virtue and her gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To any well-bred lady, Benedict “Gray” Grayson is trouble in snug-fitting boots. A conscienceless scoundrel who sails the seas for pleasure and profit, Gray lives for conquest—until Sophia’s perception and artistry stir his heart. Suddenly, he’ll brave sharks, fire, storm, and sea just to keep her at his side. She’s beautiful, refined, and ripe for seduction. Could this counterfeit governess be a rogue’s redemption? Or will the runaway heiress’s secrets destroy their only chance at love?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Who says women don't go to war? From Vikings and African queens to cross-dressing military doctors and WWII Russian fighter pilots, these are the stories of women for whom battle was not a metaphor.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman warrior is always cast as an anomaly--Joan of Arc, not G.I. Jane. But women, it turns out, have always gone to war. In this fascinating, lively, and wide-ranging book, historian Pamela Toler draws from a lifetime of scouring books for mentions of women warriors to tell their stories and to consider why women go to war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomyris, ruler of the hard-riding Massagetae, and her warriors killed Cyrus the Great of Persia when he sought to invade her lands. She herself hacked off his head in revenge for the death of her son. The West African ruler Amina of Hausa, a contemporary of Elizabeth I, led her fierce warriors in a campaign of territorial expansion for more than thirty years. Like Elizabeth, she refused to marry; unlike Elizabeth, she never claimed to be a Virgin Queen. Contemporary accounts of medieval sieges in Europe describe women using firearms, participating in night raids, joining in the defense of breaches in the walls, and fighting hand-to-hand at the improvised barricades that often provided a last line of defense. Among the examples of female samurai in Japan are the Joshigun, a group of thirty seriously combat-trained women who fought against the forces of the Meiji emperor in the late 19th century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the stories of those who commanded from the rear and those who fought in the front lines, those who fought because they wanted to, because they had to, or because they could. Considering the ways in which their presence has been erased from history, Toler concludes that women have always fought: not in spite of being women but because they are women.</description>

  <description>“April Hunt’s romantic suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat.”—New York Times bestselling author Lori Foster &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone is watching their every move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a lifetime spent in and out of hospitals, Zoey Wright is tired of playing it safe. She’s ready to take charge of her own life and get out of her comfort zone, starting with a new job as a CSI agent. But when her childhood crush Knox Steele gets pulled onto her case, Zoey needs to put her feelings for him aside or more women will die at the hands of the serial killer preying on her hometown. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former Army Ranger Knox Steele is back in Washington to help his brothers open an elite private security firm. He never expected to stumble onto a crime scene, or see his best friend’s little sister working it. Zoey is all grown up now, and the attraction between them is electric, despite his best efforts to resist it. But all that changes for Knox when he realizes the victims have one thing in common . . . and Zoey might be next.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A Moonlit Night, a Sleeping Village, and an Unaccountable Murder...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the dead of the night, a man in an evening dress is found murdered, locked in the stocks on the village green. Unfortunately for Superintendent Hannasyde, the deceased is Andrew Vereker, a man hated by nearly everyone, especially his odd and unhelpful family members. The Verekers are as eccentric as they are corrupt, and it will take all Hannasyde's skill at detection to determine who's telling the truth, and who is pointing him in the wrong direction. The question is: who in this family is clever enough to get away with murder?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Death in the Stocks is rare and refreshing."--The Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Miss Heyer's characters act and speak with an ease and conviction that is refreshing as it is rare in the ordinary mystery novel."--Times Literary Supplement</description>

  <description>Tristan Wemyss, Earl of Trentham, never expected he'd need to wed within a year or forfeit his inheritance. But he is not one to bow to the matchmaking mamas of the ton. No, he will marry a lady of his own choosing. And the lady he chooses is the enchanting neighbor living with her family next door. Miss Leonora Carling has beauty, spirit and passion; unfortunately, matrimony is the last thing on her mind . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Leonora, Tristan's kisses are oh-so-tempting, but once bitten, forever shy, she has determinedly turned her back on marriage. But Tristan is a seasoned campaigner who will not accept defeat. And when a mysterious man attempts to scare Leonora and her family from their home, Tristan realizes he's been given the perfect excuse to offer his services—as protector, seducer and, ultimately, husband.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this reader favorite from &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; bestselling author Lori Foster, a bachelor is about to fall for the one woman who isn't easily swayed by his charm... &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Security consultant Sebastian Sinclair agrees to be sold at a bachelor auction. As much as he hates the wealthy crowd he's pandering too, he's a strong believer in the cause. But when his friend outbids everyone else to hook him up with her unsuspecting sister, he's hopelessly fascinated with the one woman who seems to have no interest in him...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brandi Sommers really means it when she says "Oh, you shouldn't have" to her older sister's outrageous birthday gift--a five-day dream vacation to a lovers' retreat. Lover included. What's she going to do in paradise with the sexy stranger Sebastian Sinclair? If Sebastian has any say in all of this, the answer is &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;First published in 1998&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;These men are dark, bold, and brave. And there is only one woman who can bring them to their knees...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Famed and brilliant, Lady Alexandra Lane has always known how to look out for to herself. But nobody would ever expect that she has darkness in her past—one that she pays a blackmailer to keep buried. Now, with her family nearing bankruptcy, Alexandra strikes upon a solution: Get married to one of the empire’s most wealthy eligible bachelors. Even if he does have the reputation of a devil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE TAKES NO PRISONERS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piers Gedrick Atherton, the Duke of Redmayne, is seeking revenge and the first step is securing a bride. Winning a lady’s hand is not so easy, however, for a man known as the Terror of Torcliff. Then, Alexandra enters his life like a bolt of lightning. When she proposes marriage, Piers knows that, like him, trouble haunts her footsteps. But her gentleness, sharp wit, independent nature, and incredible beauty awakens every fierce desire within him. He will do whatever it takes to keep her safe in his arms.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the remote Rocky Mountains, lives depend on the Search &amp;amp; Rescue brotherhood. But in a place this far off the map, trust is hard to come by and secrets can be murder...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ice rescue diver Derek Warner never meant to be a hero. But when two little girls go missing, he's the first in line to bring them home-even if that means scouring the wilderness with the woman he once loved and lost, Artemis Rey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Artemis has never stopped wanting Derek. Now, racing to find the girls before it's too late, minutes turn to hours. Night falls. Old flames rekindle. And a danger grows in the darkest wilderness that may be more than even the Search and Rescue brotherhood can hope to face...</description>

  <description>Relationships are a thing of the past for Eva Montgomery. Her current motto? You can’t spell “manipulative” without &lt;i&gt;man&lt;/i&gt;. But Eva has needs, and a one-night-stand at her best friend’s wedding is the perfect way to kick off her new approach to singledom. Then a job opportunity puts her in the same city with the guy she can’t forget . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthony Castillo is a perpetual bachelor—no strings, just flings—a status he maintains by being honest about his intentions and never looking back. So why is he still thinking about the firecracker of a woman who rocked his world at his cousin’s wedding? It’s a question he refuses to answer, until she comes crashing back into his life, taking his emotional walls down with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her father doubts her ability to make it in LA, Eva vows to go big and prove him wrong. With her athletic background, she’s an ideal candidate for stunt work. But first she’ll need training, and the instructor is none other than her former hookup, Anthony Castillo. Except he’s not as cocky as she remembers and he’s definitely still sexy as sin. The only problem is . . . Anthony doesn’t want her anywhere near his stunt school—or his heart.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the remote Rocky Mountains, lives depend on the Search &amp;amp; Rescue brotherhood. But in a place this far off the map, trust is hard to come by and secrets can be murder...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the captain of Field County's ice rescue dive team, Callum Cook is driven to perfection. But when he meets new diver Louise "Lou" Sparks, all that hard-won order is obliterated in an instant. Lou is a hurricane. A walking disaster. And with her, he's never felt more alive... even if keeping her safe may just kill him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lou's new to the Rockies, intent on escaping her controlling ex, and she's determined to make it on her own terms... no matter how tempting Callum may be. But when a routine training exercise unearths a body, Lou and Callum find themselves thrust into a deadly game of cat and mouse with a killer who will stop at nothing to silence Lou — and prove that not even her new Search and Rescue family can keep her safe forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;As one of the owners of London’s most infamous and scandalous gambling hall, The Underworld, Luke Reese looks like a man who has it all.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But underneath his swagger lies a pain which no amount of liquor, women or card games can ease. Because, nine months ago, Luke’s son was stolen by his half-brother, Lord Dursley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luke knows the agony of growing up without a family, and he will not allow his son to suffer the same fate. So when evidence leads him to Coventry and a mysterious governess named Georgina, Luke doesn’t hesitate in tracking her down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But nothing is ever as simple as it seems in the London ton. And soon, Luke is facing his most dangerous gamble yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dare he risk losing his heart to find his son?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Captain T.K. Reaper only cares about his men; until he ends up falling for the one woman who can rescue his team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reaper has lived his entire life without love. Living on the edge with no fear, Reaper and his team volunteered for Project Mayhem — a top-secret experiment that uses a serum to enhance physical abilities in order to fight terrorism. Reaper believed the experiment would help save lives, but the serum only ends up taking them. Forced to go on the run, Reaper escapes the lab with his men, only to realize that they need the serum to survive. He has only one choice; return to the lab, and steal the source of the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caroline Cotter used to be a spoiled Senator’s daughter; now, she’s a victim. Kidnapped and held against her will to make the serum used for Project Mayhem, Caroline gives up hope of ever being free again… until Reaper enters, and frees her from her dark prison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet the jungle outside is full of terrors, and government officials are hot on their tail. Reaper plans to keep the relationship between him and Caroline platonic, but undeniable attraction and explosive desire, coupled with Caroline’s adoration that he saved her from certain death, make it hard to resist the love story blossoming between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will Reaper choose? His romance with Caroline, or the sacred vow he’s made to the brothers willing to die by his side?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thrills and action are on every turn of the page in the first book of the &lt;i&gt;Operation Mayhem&lt;/i&gt; series. Packed with adventure, heat, and a slight paranormal twist, &lt;i&gt;Mayhem’s Warrior&lt;/i&gt; is a dark romantic suspense novel readers will delightfully devour.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When three friends impulsively buy a lottery ticket, they never suspect the many ways their lives will change—or that for each of them, love will be the biggest win of all.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kit Averin is anything but a gambler. A scientist with a quiet, steady job at a university, Kit’s focus has always been maintaining the acceptable status quo. A sudden windfall doesn’t change that, with one exception: the fixer-upper she plans to buy, her first and only real home. It’s more than enough to keep her busy, until an unsettlingly handsome, charming, and determined corporate recruiter shows up in her lab—and manages to work his way into her heart...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ben Tucker is surprised to find that the scientist he wants for Beaumont Materials is a young woman—and a beautiful, sharp-witted one at that. Talking her into a big-money position with his firm is harder than he expects, but he’s willing to put in the time, especially when sticking around for the summer gives him a chance to reconnect with his dad. But the longer he stays, the more questions he has about his own future—and who might be in it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What begins as a chilly rebuff soon heats up into an attraction neither Kit nor Ben can deny—and finding themselves lucky in love might just be priceless...</description>

  <description>Aurora Huntley, free-spirited sister to the earl of Pembourne, lives under the dark shadow of the black diamond. The victim of threats from privateers who believe her brother possesses the precious stone, Aurora is a virtual prisoner in her own home. She now faces a fate worse than death: an arranged marriage to an uninspiring suitor. Craving adventure and freedom, Aurora has no choice but to do something shocking, something scandalous....For two hundred pounds, a handsome stranger agrees to help Aurora stage her own ruin. But her kiss stuns him, and her name shocks him. She is a Huntley, and he is Julian Bencroft, the new duke of Morland. For generations their families have been bitter enemies because of the black diamond. Now, joining forces to claim the treasure, Julian and Aurora discover a love that is far more precious than any jewel. But first, they must conquer the evil that surrounds them -- or surrender their newfound joy to the diamond's age-old legacy of betrayal.</description>

  <description>Winner -- N.N.Light Award for Best Romance 2016.&lt;br /&gt;Bronze Medal Winner -- Circle Of Books Rings Of Honor Awards 2016&lt;br /&gt;Finalist -- The Golden Box Book Publishing Golden Book Award 2017&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It is dangerous to become attached to a du Lac. He will break your heart, and you will not recover.” So prophesies a wizened healer to Annis, daughter of King Cerdic of Wessex. If there is truth in the old crone’s words, they come far too late for Annis, who defies father, king, and country to save the man she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alden du Lac, once king of Cerniw, has nothing. Betrayed by Cerdic, Alden’s kingdom lies in rubble, his fort razed to the ground and his brother Merton missing, presumably dead. He has only one possession left worth saving: his heart. And to the horror of his few remaining allies, he gives that to the daughter of his enemy. They see Annis, at best, as a bargaining chip to avoid war with her powerful father. At worst, they see a Saxon whore with her claws in a broken, wounded king.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alden has one hope: When you war with one du Lac, you war with them all. His brother Budic, King of Brittany, could offer the deposed young king sanctuary—but whether he will offer the same courtesy to Annis is far less certain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Du Lac Chronicles has a recommended reading age of 16+</description>

  <description>Kristen Petersen doesn't do drama, will fight to the death for her friends, and has no room in her life for guys who just don't get her. She's also keeping a big secret: facing a medically necessary procedure that will make it impossible for her to have children.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Planning her best friend's wedding is bittersweet for Kristen—especially when she meets the best man, Josh Copeland. He's funny, sexy, never offended by her mile-wide streak of sarcasm, and always one chicken enchilada ahead of her hangry. Even her dog, Stuntman Mike, adores him. The only catch: Josh wants a big family someday. Kristen knows he'd be better off with someone else, but as their attraction grows, it's harder and harder to keep him at arm's length.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Friend Zone&lt;/i&gt; will have you laughing one moment and grabbing for tissues the next as it tackles the realities of infertility and loss with wit, heart, and a lot of sass.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A heartwarming story about love, family, and taking risks that matter&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabby Langdon has always tried to make people happy. She even went to law school to please her father, and now she's a highly successful-albeit bored-attorney. But Gabby secretly dreams of being a writer, so for once she does something for herself-she signs up for a writing class taught by best-selling novelist Caden Marshall. There's only one problem: her brooding, sexy professor is a distraction she can't afford if she's finally going to get the life she truly wants. &lt;br /&gt;Recently divorced and suffering from the world's worst case of writer's block, Caden is in Angel Falls to get his life back on track. He's focused on teaching and providing a stable and loving home for his young daughter, Ava. The last thing he needs is to jeopardize his new job, which means keeping plenty of distance between himself and his talented new student-no matter how tempted he is by Gabby's beauty, kind heart, or the sparks that fly whenever they're together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Angel Falls series: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Then There Was You&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Way You Love Me&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A bad boy wrapped in a sexy, muscled, grown-up package might be worth a little risk… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly Webster has always followed the rules. After an ugly scandal tore apart her childhood and made her the focus of the media’s harsh spotlight, she vowed to live an ordinary life. No fame. No impropriety. No pain. Then she meets Zachary Fox, a tattooed bad boy rocker with a voice like whiskey and sin, and a touch that could become an addiction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A one-night stand with the hottest rock star on the planet, that’s all it was meant to be…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fox promises scorching heat and dangerous pleasure, coaxing Molly to extend their one-night stand into a one-month fling. After that, he’ll be gone forever, his life never again intersecting with her own. Sex and sin and sensual indulgence, all with an expiration date. No ties, no regrets. Too late, Molly realizes it isn’t only her body that’s become addicted to Fox, but her heart…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Bourne Matrimonial Agency has one rule: Never fall in love with a client, which shouldn't be a problem when one’s faking an engagement to the rogue across the street . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ainsley Bourne needs the family business to succeed. But one obstacle stands in her way—Reed Sterling, the huge, handsome, former prize fighter and owner of the gaming hell across the street. His scandalous customers scare off all her marriage-minded patrons and since the devilish brute has no intention of relocating, she sets out to ruin his unsavory establishment. Yet when a vile suitor from her past reappears, Ainsley hastily claims an attachment to the first man who comes to mind . . . Mr. Sterling, to be exact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reed doesn’t know who is more surprised by Miss Bourne’s declaration. She clearly hates him, and he’d never admit their arguments simmer with unrequited attraction. Something about the pleading look in her eyes calls to Reed, and against his better judgment, he quickly plays the part of the besotted fiancé.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretending to be in love requires a convincing charade. But with each tantalizing touch and every scandalous kiss, Ainsley starts to wonder if Reed was ever really the enemy at all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Inverness, 1820&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perched on the North Sea, this port town―by turns legendary and mythological―is a place where Highland rebels and English authorities clash in a mortal struggle for survival and dominance. Among the fray is a lovely young widow who possesses rare and special gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WANTED: Isabella Drummond&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A true beauty and trained physician, Isabella has inspired longing and mystery―and fury―in a great many men. Hunted by both the British government and Scottish rebels, she came to the Highlands in search of survival. But a dying ship’s captain will steer her fate into even stormier waters. . .and her heart into flames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;FOUND: Cinaed Mackintosh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cast from his home as a child, Cinaed is a fierce soul whose allegiance is only to himself. . .until Isabella saved his life―and added more risk to her own. Now, the only way Cinaed can keep her safe to seek refuge at Dalmigavie Castle, the Mackintosh family seat. But when the scandalous truth of his past comes out, any chance of Cinaed having a bright future with Isabella is thrown into complete darkness. What will these two ill-fated lovers have to sacrifice to be together…for eternity?</description>

As Finn came of age, he had secrets, too—the clandestine nights spent with an earl's daughter. But her promise of forever ended in betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driven by a past that haunts her, Lady Lavinia Kent seeks redemption in London's underworld, engaged in a daring cause inspired by the young man to whom she gave her innocence, and who then proved himself a scoundrel by abandoning her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When their paths cross again, they can't deny the yearning and desire that still burns. As they discover the truth behind the deceptions that tore them apart, Finn and Lavinia must fight to reclaim what they've lost, no matter how dangerous—because love is worth the risk...</description>

  <description>The river runs wild …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife Officer Charlotte “Charlee” Tanner still carries the guilt of a tragic drowning accident that occurred on her watch. She hoped moving back home to the wilds of central Florida would provide a safe haven—until she learns the death was no accident, and she’s the intended target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;… But no wilder than their passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tough and decisive, Lieutenant Hunter Boudreau loves his new job as a law enforcement officer with the Florida Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife Conservation Commission. Charlee is his best friend, so when she comes under fire, he’s not letting her out of his sight until the killer is caught. But Charlee won’t sit by and let anyone else die for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As danger closes in and Charlee and Hunter’s attraction threatens to consume them, Charlee has to decide if she can trust Hunter. And to save Charlee, Hunter will have to trust her, too.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;There’s no resisting a desire like this…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MMA fighter Miles Dartman’s casual arrangement with personal shopper Maxi Nevar would be many men’s fantasy. She seeks him out, they have mindblowing sex, she leaves. Rinse, repeat. Yet lately, Miles wants more. And when Maxi requests his services via the Body Armor security agency, he’s ready to finally break through her defenses—and protect her day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Receiving a large inheritance has brought chaos and uncertainty into Maxi’s life. Her ex has resurfaced, along with lots of former “friends,” and someone is making mysterious threats. Then there’s Miles, who doesn’t ask for anything…except her trust. Pleasure is easy. Now Maxi has to give her heart as well as her body…or risk losing a man who could be everything she needs.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sasha.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He’s dark and mysterious.&lt;/b&gt; Quiet and lethal. &lt;br /&gt;An Irish mobster. &lt;br /&gt;Pure sin wrapped up in a beautiful package. &lt;br /&gt;But there’s also something off about him. &lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t feel anything. He shows no emotions. &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I question his humanity. &lt;br /&gt;He hasn’t spoken to me in two years. Not a single word. &lt;br /&gt;But we share a secret, he and I. &lt;br /&gt;And if it ever comes out, I have no doubt in my mind… &lt;br /&gt;He won’t have a problem killing me too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ronan.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve slain for her. I’ll do it again. &lt;br /&gt;When it comes to Sasha, there isn’t a line I won’t cross. &lt;br /&gt;I watch her. She doesn’t know it. &lt;br /&gt;She thinks I hate her. Sometimes, I think I might too. &lt;br /&gt;But I’m always there, lurking in the shadows. &lt;br /&gt;Craving her. Trying to keep the beast within at bay. &lt;br /&gt;I’ll keep her safe. I’ll slaughter anyone who tries to hurt her. &lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can’t do… is protect her from myself. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An enchanting Regency romance with a fairy-tale twist from an always witty and delightful &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author who Tessa Dare calls "a romance treasure."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duncan Wentworth tried his hand at rescuing a damsel in distress once long ago, and he's vowed he'll never make that mistake again. Nonetheless, when he comes across Matilda Wakefield in the poacher-infested and far-from-enchanted woods of his estate, decency compels him to offer aid to a lady fallen on hard times. Matilda is whip-smart, she can read Duncan's horrible penmanship, and when she wears his reading glasses, all Duncan can think about is naughty Latin poetry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matilda cannot entrust her secrets to Duncan without embroiling him in the problems that sent her fleeing from London, but neither can she ignore a man who's honorable, a brilliant chess player, and maddeningly kissable. She needs to stay one step ahead of the enemies pursuing her, though she longs to fall into Duncan's arms. Duncan swears he has traded in his shining armor for a country gentleman's muddy boots, but to win the fair maid, he'll have to ride into battle one more time.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Alisha Rai returns with the first book in her sizzling new &lt;i&gt;Modern Love&lt;/i&gt; series, in which two rival dating app creators find themselves at odds in the boardroom but in sync in the bedroom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhiannon Hunter may have revolutionized romance in the digital world, but in real life she only swipes right on her career—and the occasional hookup. The cynical dating app creator controls her love life with a few key rules: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nude pics are by invitation only &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- If someone stands you up, block them with extreme prejudice &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Protect your heart &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only there aren't any rules to govern her attraction to her newest match, former pro-football player Samson Lima. The sexy and seemingly sweet hunk woos her one magical night... and disappears. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhi thought she'd buried her hurt over Samson ghosting her, until he suddenly surfaces months later, still big, still beautiful—and in league with a business rival. He says he won't fumble their second chance, but she's wary. A temporary physical partnership is one thing, but a merger of hearts? Surely that’s too high a risk…</description>

And a surprise that just might be waiting for them under the mistletoe. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bow Street Runner Daffin Oakleaf abhors Christmas. Carol singing and holiday cheer only remind him of a dark time. When a close friend calls on him for help, Daffin is happy to capitalize on the distraction. But when he learns the lovely Lady Regina is the one in danger, he’s to become bodyguard to the captivating woman…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regina has one mission: to find a night of passion in the arms of a gentleman. Considered firmly on the shelf, Regina has given up on marriage—but that doesn’t mean she wants to be denied the pleasure married ladies experience. Daffin has long captured her attention…and when a threat calls him to her side, the sparks between them ignite. But how can a hired bodyguard find his way into Regina’s noble heart?</description>

  <description>A spectacularly rich novel spanning fifty years in the history of a nation, a family, and a love affair. Set in the noble Mexican city of Puebla, this is the beautifully romantic story of Emilia Sauri, a charmed young woman in love with two men--one, a quixotic activist who heeds the call of the revolution, the other, a stable and devoted doctor who helps Emilia realize her own gift for healing.t</description>

  <description>When gunslinging Amani Al'Hiza escaped her dead-end town, she never imagined she'd join a revolution, let alone lead one. But after the bloodthirsty Sultan of Miraji imprisoned the Rebel Prince Ahmed in the mythical city of Eremot, she doesn't have a choice. Armed with only her revolver, her wits, and her untameable Demdji powers, Amani must rally her skeleton crew of rebels for a rescue mission through the unforgiving desert to a place that, according to maps, doesn't exist. As she watches those she loves most lay their lives on the line against ghouls and enemy soldiers, Amani questions whether she can be the leader they need or if she is leading them all to their deaths.</description>

  <description>Jessie and Carl have made a terrible mistake. They should have been more careful. When Jonah came to their cabin in the Maine woods, asking to use the phone, they should never have let him in. But he told them his campsite had been robbed and he was stranded with no money and no gear. Jessie took pity on him. She was thinking about her own missing daughter, Sylvie, and hoping she was receiving the same kindness—wherever she was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So, they invite him in, share their dinner with him, offer him a bed for the night. And they discover that this stranger at their table knows all about them. About Sylvie, their troubled daughter; about the secrets they haven't revealed to each other during forty years of marriage. By morning, they realize the young man has no intention of leaving. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jessie and Carl are now captives in their own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The reader, too, is held captive by this novel that seems to unfold in real time. Over the next twenty-four hours, as Jonah's threats escalate, the couple struggle to outwit him and stay alive. Their attempts to escape force them to change roles, one discovering hidden strength, the other giving in to long-concealed weakness. Exposed, brutalized, and lost, each fights to hold on to sanity at a time when the edge of madness has never seemed so near. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cynthia Thayer is a novelist who has taken her talent for drawing familiar characters—people we really know—to a new level. In this taut psychological thriller, she pushes them to their limits and shakes their secrets free.</description>

The supposed daughter of Viscount Mayo is in fact a common woman of uncommon appearance. And if her domineering mother has her say, she is going to keep up the charade—and take London society by storm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Duchess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her golden hair and violet eyes, Elizabeth has men falling at her feet, but only one has captured her heart— John Campbell, the rakishly handsome Duke of Argyll.

  &lt;b&gt;Real Recipes to Feed Your Inner Plastic&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BURN COOKBOOK is a hilarious, delicious must-have cookbook for chefs (and wannabes) everywhere! Jonathan Bennett (that's right, Aaron Samuels himself) dishes out a tasty parody of &lt;i&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/i&gt;, serving up behind-the-scenes stories from the movie alongside awesome recipes for treats that your favorite mean girls &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be enjoying in Girl World. Like math, the language of food is the same in every country, and this cookbook is packed with amazing creations like Fetch-uccine Alfredo, You Go, Glenn (Hot) Cocoa, and Just Stab Caesar Salad. Written with the help of rock star chef Nikki Martin, Jonathan also shares his favorite recipes from his own childhood, like his mom's famous stuffed shells, mandarin chicken salad, and other specialties that will round out any special event. Perfect for happy hour (don't forget it's from 4:00 to 6:00 PM), Wednesdays, or when sweatpants are the only thing that fits, THE BURN COOKBOOK is a must-own book for any food lover still trying making fetch happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When poverty forces Sarah Davenport to take up a position as a governess, she is warned that Lord Randall is arrogant and overbearing. But no one warns her that he is also devastatingly handsome and that she will find herself falling in love with him. Or that, when danger threatens, she will find herself having to trust him. Regency Romance by Amanda Grange; originally published by Robert Hale [UK]</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He's her very own Texas Ranger...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years ago Jamie Danby was the only survivor of a senseless killing spree. Because the killer was never found, Jamie has lived her life in hiding, waiting for the worst. Now she's in danger again and she's not sure she can handle it. Until one sexy, rugged, gorgeous man strides into her life, determined to protect her at any cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kell Harding is a Texas Ranger—and how! They don't make 'em tougher. Jamie soon finds out that they don't make 'em hotter either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Kell plans only to keep Jamie safe—not keep her forever. As soon as his assignment is done, so is he.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, that's what he thinks….</description>

  <description>In a vast, mysterious house on the cliffs near Dover, the Silver family is reeling from the hole punched into its heart. Lily is gone and her twins, Miranda and Eliot, and her husband, the gentle Luc, mourn her absence with unspoken intensity. All is not well with the house, either, which creaks and grumbles and malignly confuses visitors in its mazy rooms, forcing winter apples in the garden when the branches should be bare. Generations of women inhabit its walls. And Miranda, with her new appetite for chalk and her keen sense for spirits, is more attuned to them than she is to her brother and father. She is leaving them slowly -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slipping away from them -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when one dark night she vanishes entirely, the survivors are left to tell her story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Miri I conjure you "&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a spine-tingling tale that has Gothic roots but an utterly modern sensibility. Told by a quartet of crystalline voices, it is electrifying in its expression of myth and memory, loss and magic, fear and love.</description>

  <description>One of romance's best-loved authors, Sandra Brown creates love stories whose "larger than life heroes and heroines make you believe all the warm, wonderful, wild things in life."* Now the "New York Times" bestselling author delivers a powerfully erotic and deeply moving tale of a woman reunited with her first and only love--a man who wants what she denied him ten years ago.... &lt;br /&gt;In A Class By Itself &lt;br /&gt;Dani Quinn knew Logan Webster would be at her high school reunion. Yet she had come in order to prove to herself that she was not afraid to see him again. Her departure years before from both Logan and the small Texas town where they were sweethearts had been abrupt, painful, and not of her choosing. Worst of all, she'd never had the chance to tell Logan the truth of why she had to leave. Now she would not only have a chance to explain, but to ask him for a favor. Handsome, charming, and dangerously charismatic, Logan exudes all the power and confidence of a self-made success. He listens as Dani describes her work for a charitable foundation and expresses her hope that he will donate one of his properties for a much-needed summer camp. Logan agrees, but with one shocking proviso: that Dani fulfill the intimate promise she made to him years ago. It is meant to be a coldhearted business transaction...but this time when Dani is once again compelled to leave without an explanation, nothing can keep Logan from following. *Rendezvous&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"From the Trade Paperback edition."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A lady with a noble mission. A duke looking for redemption. A forbidden love that cannot be denied…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Daphne Hallworth is ready to celebrate the holidays with her family. But when they accidentally leave her home alone, Daphne uses the time to work on her dream—opening a home for unwed mothers. But her quest isn’t problem-free: She’s in a battle to win the property for the home against her brother’s best friend-turned-enemy, Paul Barstowe, Duke of Southart. And that’s not all: someone has stolen her personal diary, which holds secrets that could devastate her family. Daphne has always harbored private feelings for the man her family scorns…though perhaps striking a bargain with the handsome Duke will solve both their problems?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul, long considered good for nothing, aims to open a hospital to honor his brother and restore his reputation. So when a conflict over the land brings him straight into Daphne’s life, they make a deal: He will help her find her diary if Daphne can change her family’s opinion of him. But before he can win her family’s affection, he has to win hers first. Maybe love was the answer to their family feud all along?</description>

  <description>'Against the backdrop of old New Orleans and the antebellum South, Bride of a Stranger spins out a spellbinding tale of romance, suspense, and murder.' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claire is too innocent to suspect that her marriage is a cruel farce,believing instead that the dangerous accidents that keep appearing in her path are just that accidents. She wedded Justin Leroux suddenly and silently.He was the tall dark stranger of her girlhood dreams, and had finally come to take her away. She returns with him to Sans Songe, the Leroux family plantation in Louisiana. A near-fatal accident on the road to the plantation does not bode well for her future there. And indeed, many nasty surprises await her at the plantation itself. Voodoo magic, poisoned food, and a murder mystery force Claire into a stalemate. She is helpless within the bosom of her frigid and isolating new family, while her husband has yet to come to her bed. He may even be hoping for her destruction, as she is drawn into an ever more tangled web of passion and intrigue. In a harsh world where love means danger, Claire struggles just to survive.</description>

  <description>Combining sexual chemistry with a touch of adventure, this first book of a clever, wildly romantic historical trilogy is a very entertaining Regency-set version of the popular James Bond spy novels and films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a most coveted invitation—a glittering ball attended by all the important people of the ton. But Mariah, a ravishing beauty thought by all to be the catch of the season, never expected to find true love amid the shadows. The mysterious man she meets there ignites a passion within her she never thought possible. When he starts a clandestine midnight courtship in her bedroom, Mariah is scandalized—and enthralled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry Sinclair is a man of secrets who would do anything to protect those in his charge. But when he lays eyes on the stunning Mariah, duty and desire collide. Though every man in London lusts for her, he knows the fiery attraction between them is unparalleled. But in a world where trust can turn to treason and scandal can topple the throne, Harry and Mariah will fight a perilous fight for their precious love—and their lives.</description>

To make matters worse, she's just discovered she's expecting--and now the dark-hearted Italian is claiming her once more...this time as his wife!</description>

  <description>Three months has been Gladie Burger’s limit when it comes to staying in one place. That’s why Gladie is more than a little skeptical when her Grandma Zelda — who is more than a little psychic — recruits her into the family’s matchmaking business in the quaint small town of Cannes, California. What’s more, Gladie is also highly unqualified, having a terrible track record with romance. Still, Zelda is convinced that her granddaughter has her clairvoyant “gift.” But when the going gets tough, Gladie wonders if this gift has a return policy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Zelda’s neighbor drops dead in his kitchen, Gladie is swept into his bizarre family’s drama. Despite warnings from the (distractingly gorgeous) chief of police to steer clear of his investigation, Gladie is out to prove that her neighbor’s death was murder. It’s not too long before she’s in way over her head — with the hunky police chief, a dysfunctional family full of possible killers, and yet another mysterious and handsome man, whose attentions she’s unable to ignore. Gladie is clearly being pursued — either by true love or by a murderer. Who will catch her first?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;First love is always the sweetest. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, Abigail Linton devoted herself to caring for her aging parents and the children of her siblings. Now, eager to make her own life, she takes a position as governess on the neighboring estate. It shouldn’t matter that her absentee employer is Maxwell Bryce, the Duke of Rothwell, the infamous rake who once broke her youthful heart. Surely he’s forgotten her, for he hasn’t set foot on his estate for fifteen years. At least, that is, until he arrives unexpectedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max is incensed to meet his sister’s new governess. But why does Abby appear just as displeased to see him when it was she who’d rejected him all those years ago? Why is he so drawn to the independent spinster she has become? And why is there a sparkle in her beautiful blue eyes that suggests they might have a second chance at love?</description>

  <description>First published in 1959, Shirley Jackson's &lt;i&gt;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/i&gt; has been hailed as a perfect work of unnerving terror. It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of a "haunting"; Theodora, the lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powers—and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A humorous book about history's worst plagues—from the Antonine Plague, to leprosy, to polio—and the heroes who fought them&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1518, in a small town in France, Frau Troffea began dancing and didn’t stop. She danced herself to her death six days later, and soon thirty-four more villagers joined her. Then more. In a month more than 400 people had died from the mysterious dancing plague. In late-nineteenth-century England an eccentric gentleman founded the No Nose Club in his gracious townhome—a social club for those who had lost their noses, and other body parts, to the plague of syphilis for which there was then no cure. And in turn-of-the-century New York, an Irish cook caused two lethal outbreaks of typhoid fever, a case that transformed her into the notorious Typhoid Mary and led to historic medical breakthroughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout time, humans have been terrified and fascinated by the plagues they've suffered from. &lt;i&gt;Get Well Soon&lt;/i&gt; delivers the gruesome, morbid details of some of the worst plagues in human history, as well as stories of the heroic figures who fought to ease their suffering. With her signature mix of in-depth research and upbeat storytelling, and not a little dark humor, Jennifer Wright explores history’s most gripping and deadly outbreaks.</description>

  <description>James Hunter cannot forget the night he rescued Eugenia O'Rourke from a terrifying ordeal-- how she felt in his arms, warm and vulnerable. Now working in the Home Office by day, he doesn't find it difficult to assume the role of her rake protector by night....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gina is painfully aware that James witnessed her deepest humiliation. Her biggest fear was her captor's return, but as midnight strikes she's more afraid of being the object of James's pity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But pity is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what James feels....</description>

  <description>SILK. SANDSTONE. JASMINE. PEACOCK BONES. &lt;br /&gt;What would you risk to hold onto a love that only happens once?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CALCUTTA, INDIA - 1833&lt;br /&gt;Jemdanee Kumar is living beyond the seams of her soul trying to erase the one and only man who continues to haunt her body and mind: Mr. Ridley. She knows he is coming for her despite trying to bury him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he arrives into Calcutta to claim her, he begins to knot her into everything he is by making them both kneel to the dark passion neither of them can tame. Will the ropes stretch far enough to break the bond? Or will it tighten and twist them into a peril too dangerous to embrace? &lt;br /&gt;​&lt;br /&gt;Themes include humor, BDSM, mystery, and romance. Lots of it! &lt;br /&gt;BOOK TWO of the Whipping Society Saga&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE: Unlike most historical romances where the hero &amp;amp; heroine's attraction and love for each other stops at a mere one book, this full length book is the one of three (Full length book episodes!) following the highly charged, erotic saga of a couple through the rise and fall and storms of their relationship. Every book is tied up in own way.&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;BOOK 1, Mr. Ridley&lt;br /&gt;BOOK 2, The Devil is French&lt;br /&gt;BOOK 3, Reborn (Available 8/28/2017).</description>

  <description>First published in 2001, American Gods became an instant classic, an intellectual and artistic benchmark from the multiple-award-winning master of innovative fiction, Neil Gaiman. Now, discover the mystery and magic of American Gods in this 10th anniversary edition. Newly updated and expanded with the author's preferred text, this commemorative volume is a true celebration of a modern masterpiece by the one, the only, Neil Gaiman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A storm is coming....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Locked behind bars for three years, Shadow did his time, quietly waiting for the magic day when he could return to Eagle Point, Indiana. A man no longer scared of what tomorrow might bring, all he wanted was to be with Laura, the wife he deeply loved, and start a new life. But just days before his release, Laura and Shadow's best friend are killed in an accident. With his life in pieces and nothing to keep him tethered, Shadow accepts a job from a beguiling stranger he meets on the way home, an enigmatic man who calls himself Mr. Wednesday. A trickster and rogue, Wednesday seems to know more about Shadow than Shadow does himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life as Wednesday's bodyguard, driver, and errand boy is far more interesting and dangerous than Shadow ever imagined. It is a job that takes him on a dark and strange road trip and introduces him to a host of eccentric characters whose fates are mysteriously intertwined with his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, Shadow will learn that the past never dies; that everyone, including his beloved Laura, harbors secrets; and that dreams, totems, legends, and myths are more real than we know. Ultimately, he will discover that beneath the placid surface of everyday life, a storm is brewing - an epic war for the very soul of America - and that he is standing squarely in its path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relevant and prescient, American Gods has been lauded for its brilliant synthesis of "mystery, satire, sex, horror, and poetic prose"</description>

  <description>When danger lurks behind a familiar face…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Successful architect Rachel Granger loves her job and her life, but when a terrorist on the FBI’s most wanted list targets her, there’s only one man she can trust. She hasn’t seen Jake in years but her former college friend told her he’d always be there for her and she definitely needs him now. Even though her feelings for him go far deeper than friendship and just being around him risks her heart, she would do anything to keep those she loves safe from a madman bent on unleashing hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one man from her past can help&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FBI Special Agent Jake Evers made the biggest mistake of his life when he let Rachel slip through his fingers over two years ago. It doesn’t matter that he hasn’t seen her since then—if she needs him, he’ll be there. When he learns that she’s the target of a domestic terror cell, he’ll do everything in his power to keep her safe. He’s never gotten over her and won’t risk losing her again now that she’s reappeared in his life. But the threat is more widespread than they realized and now it’s a race against time to keep her and scores of innocent civilians alive.</description>

  <description>Nina Sheridan desperately needs a timeout vacation. With a fiancé who can't even remember how she takes her coffee, Nina wants some distance to rethink her engagement. Flying halfway around the world from England to a mountain town in Colorado should do the trick. But when she finds a gorgeous man at her rental cabin, Nina's cold, lonely adventure suddenly heats up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owner of the house, Holden "Max" Maxwell is surprised by the beautiful woman who turns up at his door. But when Nina becomes ill, Max spends days nursing her back to health. A private man with a broken heart, Max finds himself drawn to the strong-willed woman. Soon it becomes impossible for Nina and Max to deny their growing attraction to one another. Yet even as these two wounded lovebirds think about taking a chance on a relationship, a dangerous secret from Max's past emerges-and threatens to end their love for good.</description>

  <description>Malicious lies, drugs and a videotape are the reasons young lovers Sara Jamison and Mike Andrews have spent the last eight years apart, each believing the other betrayed them. Sara has no clue where Mike's been all these years, but she knows where she's been busy raising their son. Two weeks after he accused her of cheating and disappeared from her life, Sara discovered she was something she never expected to be, an unwed pregnant teenager. But with the love and support of her annoyingly alpha-male family, she's managed to make a good life for herself and her young son. She even owns her own business, Sara's Bakery, which she's built into a thriving success. Sure, she works too hard and her social life is nonexistent, but for the most part, she is content. Until the day Detective Mike Andrews walks into her bakery and back into her life.....</description>

  <description>A Cry For Help&lt;br /&gt;It only takes one phone call and Navy SEAL Drake Avery is rushing back to Tennessee in the middle of the night. His sisters are in danger and he will do whatever it takes to protect them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A New Twist&lt;br /&gt;Now is not the time for a relationship, but damned if Drake doesn’t cross paths with a smokin’ hot kindergarten teacher named Karen Eastman. Miss Eastman has Drake thinking naughty thoughts when he needs to have his head in the game. He never thought he’d be hot for teacher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demons from the Past&lt;br /&gt;Part of the hell of going home is that you know everyone, and they know you. Just when you think you can trust someone, they can turn on a dime. Old and new enemies are thrilled to discover Drake has a beautiful new weakness: Karen. But messing with the women in his life, is a mistake. You mess with the bull, you get the horns.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;One reluctant heir&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone else had asked for his help publishing a naughty novel, Ash would have had the sense to say no. But he’s never been able to deny Verity Plum. Now he has his hands full illustrating a book and trying his damnedest not to fall in love with his best friend. The last thing he needs is to discover he’s a duke’s lost heir. Without a family or a proper education, he’s had to fight for his place in the world, and the idea of it—and Verity—being taken away from him chills him to the bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;One radical bookseller&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Verity wants is to keep her brother out of prison, her business afloat, and her hands off Ash. Lately it seems she’s not getting anything she wants. She knows from bitter experience that she isn’t cut out for romance, but the more time she spends with Ash, the more she wonders if maybe she’s been wrong about herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;One disaster waiting to happen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ash has a month before his identity is exposed, and he plans to spend it with Verity. As they explore their long-buried passion, it becomes harder for Ash to face the music. Can Verity accept who Ash must become or will he turn away the only woman he’s ever loved?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Content Warning: off page domestic violence, off page neglect of child, epileptic seizure</description>

  <description>Set against the dazzling opulence and dangerous intrigue of the 17th c. Spanish court of King Philip IV, this is the story of lovely, spirited young Juana de Arrelanos. Taken against her will from her home and from Jaime de Nueva, the man she loves, she is brought to the massive, magnificent Castillo Benaventes, the home of Bartolomé, Duque de Valenzuela - the man to whom she must be wed. Within the castle's heavy walls the rebellious Juana finds an atmosphere of secrecy, almost of conspiracy, and a number of cunning, sinister figures, chief among whom is the sardonic Felipe Tristán, the Duque's protector and mercenary, behind whose scarred face lie memories of horror Juana can only guess at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the greatest horror is reserved for Juana, and for Juana alone. For the young Duque she is forced to marry, she discovers, is a cruel caricature of a man, a person twisted in mind and body. His wealth and rank can supply Juana with undreamed-of luxury - but also with incredible suffering, for the perfumed silks of the master bedchamber conceal the depravity of an unbalanced mind. Juana's brave attempts to escape from the marriage are dealt with harshly, and, to her limitless despair, she finds herself irrevocably betrothed to the terrifying, unbalanced Duque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, against all hope, there is a way out. Swift and brutal action by the arrogant Felipe can insure Juana's escape from the secrets and treachery of the Castillo Benaventes. But Felipe's protection, she fears, may be more dangerous than his enmity, and all too soon he begins to demand a humiliating payment....</description>

  <description>Killer Chevy Bankes is a master of disguise, and just paroled, he's coming after the woman who sent him to jail, the beautiful antiques expert Beth Denison. A set of antique dolls brings Beth into his sight, and inspire Chevy's disturbing crimes as he draws closer to Beth and her young daughter. Chevy sends the dolls to Beth one-by-one and she soon realizes that these antiques carry the same marks as his victims, signaling that the final piece in his collection will be for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neil Sheridan gave up his FBI shield five years ago, but his best friend Rick, a cop, pulls him in as a consultant on a case involving a serial killer who is eerily similar to a murderer Neil encountered in the past. The investigation leads Neil to Beth's doorstep, and he is certain she isn't telling him the truth. Neil is the only one who can get through Beth's defenses and, as they grow closer, discover the secrets that Beth is hiding about her fateful night with Chevy.</description>

  <description>Alina, Princess of the Picts, had betrayed Brand—and earned his undying hatred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their reckless affair had once cost him all he had called his own. Now, restored to his former wealth and power, duty demanded that Athelbrand of Northumbria abduct the fugitive princess from a nunnery. With his country on the brink of war, Brand must deliver Alina to his king before he can have his revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their love was burned by loss and treachery, yet as danger gathers around them, their passion once again bursts into flame. This time would the sacrifice be too great for Brand to bear…or would love finally be his ultimate redemption?</description>

  <description>Once beloved by London's fashionable elite, Hartley Sedgwick has become a recluse after a spate of salacious gossip exposed his most-private secrets. Rarely venturing from the house whose inheritance is a daily reminder of his downfall, he’s captivated by the exceedingly handsome man who seeks to rob him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since retiring from the boxing ring, Sam Fox has made his pub, The Bell, into a haven for those in his Free Black community. But when his best friend Kate implores him to find and destroy a scandalously revealing painting of her, he agrees. Sam would do anything to protect those he loves, even if it means stealing from a wealthy gentleman. But when he encounters Hartley, he soon finds himself wanting to steal more than just a painting from the lovely, lonely man—he wants to steal his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Content Warning from Author: This book includes a main character who was sexually abused in the past; abuse happens off page but is alluded to.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When it comes to demons, always read the fine print. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jesse James Dawson was an ordinary guy (well, an ordinary guy with a black belt in karate) until one day he learned his brother had made a bargain with a demon. Jesse discovered there was only one way to save his brother: put up his own soul as collateral, and fight the demon to the death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jesse lived to free his brother-and became part of a loose organization of Champions who put their own souls on the line to help those who get in over their heads with demons. But now experienced Champions are losing battles at a much higher rate than usual. Someone has changed the game. And if Jesse can't figure out the new rules, his next battle may be his last...</description>

  <description>As joint owner of London’s most notorious gambling hall, The Underworld, Cole Hewitt spends his days surrounded by wealth and looks every inch the debonair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unknown to most, he was born a bastard, and knows better than anyone the fine line between the elite and the slums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he falls for the beautiful Lady Gemma Amberson, sister to the Duke of Kent, Cole knows that his past means he will never be considered worthy of her. However Cole has no intention of being cast aside again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still Cole’s attraction to Gemma hasn’t gone unnoticed – and there are those who wish to thwart his plans, for the darkest of reasons. Cole may be used to getting his own way. But the question is: how far will he go to get it?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Don't invite him in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's what they told you to do when you met a vampire. But Jessica Adams was powerless to resist him. His voice enveloped her like a lover's embrace, his eyes pierced her very soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She told herself it was just a dream. A nightmare she'd had every midnight since she started filming Midnight Kiss. Maybe it was the accidents on the set. Or because Matthew Griffon's writing was so seductive, his vampire so real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment she met the reclusive Griffon, Jessica was powerfully drawn to him. His ebony eyes, the way he hid from the public light, the dark secrets he concealed... they all seemed oddly familiar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just who was this Matthew Griffon -- creator of a character, or her midnight lover in the flesh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;43 LIGHT STREET: Where suspense and romance meet&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>The author of Undefeated and Risky Business has another sexy hero for you to meet…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Destiny Falls, New York, home of Bomb Squad—an ice hockey team full of rugged military heroes. A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity has the team captain packing his bags for greener pastures, but saying good-bye to the woman who’d captured his heart is easier said than done…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After being wounded in combat, Brandon Theroux lives every day like it’s his last. He never could have imagined that the sleek mechanics of his prosthetic leg would open so many doors, including minor celebrity status as a fitness model and a well-earned reputation as a rakish playboy. The only door it hasn’t opened is the one to Harper Johnson’s bedroom.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Harper has too much self-respect to join the ranks of Brandon’s “carpe diem” conquests, but when she needs someone to keep the peace in the tavern she owns, Brandon offers his help—as long as she agrees to a very tempting trade. It isn’t long before the two realize that a deal struck between friends who can’t keep their hands off each other has the potential to be a whole lot hotter than either of them is prepared to handle…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Destiny Falls, New York, home of Bomb Squad—an ice hockey team full of rugged military heroes. The team’s battling a losing streak, but the season’s biggest game changer is one player’s second chance with the one who got away…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yoga instructor Marlena Brodie is always up for a challenge, and her new job of snapping Bomb Squad out of their rut is definitely that, even though it means being in close contact with Liam McAllister, her high school crush gone bad. She can feel the damage pouring off of him—but also a wild and sexy strength that calls to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Army turned Liam McAllister into a man, but as a combat medic, he saw far too much to ever be whole again. He’s not interested in the civilian world beyond his job as a carpenter, but he never stopped wondering what might have been with Marlena—and it isn’t long before she’s crashed through his carefully constructed walls. He longs for a new beginning with her, but to be the man she deserves, he’ll have to step out of his defensive zone and score the most important play of his life…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Books in the Bomb Squad hockey series:&lt;br /&gt;Risky Business (Bomb Squad #1)- August 2014&lt;br /&gt;Undefeated (Bomb Squad #2) - November 2014&lt;br /&gt;Game Changer (Bomb Squad #3) - April 2015</description>

  <description>Shiloh Harrison was hoping for a few days off to recover from a particularly nasty assignment, preferably with the help of the talented hands (and, well, the rest of his body too) of her sexy boyfriend, Vincent. But when a group of vampires takes an entire trailer park hostage, there’s nothing to do but make her apologies and get to the scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such is the life of a Federal Marshal in the Paranormal Investigators Unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet this isn’t like her typical track-and-nab case: something is going on that has vampires scared, and it takes all her strength not to imagine what could frighten such powerful creatures. Unfortunately, she doesn’t have that option. Her boss is MIA, someone is snatching vampires, and there’s a ticking clock that can only end one way: a bloodbath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless she can stop it.</description>

  <description>Pregnant and alone—not a situation Mandy Fielding ever expected to find herself in, especially not while living with the man who owns her heart and is her baby’s father. Rocco isn’t a whole man, and hasn’t been since his return from Afghanistan. Just where they go from here, she doesn’t know.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The past is more real than the present in covert operative Rocco Silas’ mind. His girlfriend, Mandy--the only woman he’s ever loved--adores his son as if he were her own. And now, she and Rocco are expecting their first child. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rocco’s been in this spot before, and its ending was the stuff of nightmares. He’s coming to believe there’s only one way to break that terrible cycle…</description>

  <description>EVERYTHING’S HOTTER IN TEXAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Marine Force Recon captain Cullen Loughman learns that his father’s been kidnapped, he will do whatever it takes to find him. In order to achieve his mission, Cullen will need to team up with the best of the best—someone who just happens to be the most stunning woman he’s ever laid eyes on…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn’t the first rodeo for ex—Air Force pilot Mia Carter. Still, Cullen’s bad-boy good looks and charm are distracting her from duty. . .and it appears that the feeling is mutual. As Mia and Cullen make their descent into a dark, dangerous world, their attraction reaches the boiling point. But is their desire worth the risk when a ruthless enemy is waiting in the wings—or will their Lone Star love conquer all?</description>

Then the last will and testament of Ellis' father - to whom Ford Edge has been temporarily assigned - confronts her with a choice between either losing her home or marrying Ellis' illegitimate elder brother. Gabriel Brandon is a total stranger and a Colonel in the New Model Army.</description>

  <description>Marianne thought her new neighbor, Lord Ravensford, would be a gentleman, but she was sadly disillusioned. Mistaking her for a lightskirt, he offered to make her his mistress, insulting her beyond measure. Equally, Lord Ravensford had desperately wanted to convince her of his respectability. Then danger and intrigue make them join forces, and they find themselves caught up in a desperate adventure that swept them to the shores of revolutionary France. But was it necessity that had brought them together, or was it something more?</description>

  <description>Eighteen years ago, young Tess McPhail left her tiny hometown of Wintergreen, Missouri, population 1,713. She headed for Nashville--and never looked back. Now one of country music's brightest lights, "Mac" McPhail is a millionaire many times over. Her career is her life. At thirty-five, Mac has no time for marriage, children, or kinfolk--until her sisters insist she come home to help care for their widowed mother...Mac isn't thrilled about spending a month in Wintergreen. But her visit home turns out to be far from dull. After almost two decades of public adoration, she is suddenly a nonperson--insulted by her jealous older sister, enraged by her intractable mother, and ignored by Kenny Kroneck, the next-door neighbor she mercilessly taunted all through high school. Now a handsome divorce who dotes on his teenage daughter, Kenny is widely respected in the community--and refuses to give Mac the time of day. But once she discovers that Kenny's daughter is a promising country music talent, Mac assumes the role of mentor--and everything changes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gradually, the famous Mac McPhail becomes an integral part of life in Wintergreen. The priceless gifts of family and community open her heart to the sweet rewards of caring and commitment. And as the feigned indifference between Mac and Kenny turns to playful bickering, then passion, the complicated life of a superstar is forever changed--by the simple joys of love...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Grace Burrowes introduces us to the unconventional Wentworth family in this charming Regency romance with a Cinderella twist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A funny thing happened on the way to the gallows...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minute, London banker Quinn Wentworth is facing execution. The next, he's declared the long-lost heir to a dukedom. Quinn has fought his way up from the vilest slums, and now he's ready to use every dirty trick he knows to find the enemy who schemed against him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There was just one tiny problem...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane Winston, the widowed, pregnant daughter of a meddlesome prison preacher, crosses paths with Quinn in jail. Believing his days are numbered, Quinn offers Jane marriage as a way to guarantee her independence and provide for her child. Neither thinks they'll actually have a future together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;They were wrong.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's a wealthy gutter rat out for vengeance. She's a minister's daughter who must turn a marriage of desperation into a proper ducal union. Are they doomed from the start or destined for a happily-ever-after?</description>

  <description>Ryder Sherbrooke is a fun-loving rake with a secret. When he travels to Jamaica to solve the mystery of the supernatural goings-on at the Sherbrooke sugar plantation, he finds another mystery as well --- a sophisticated nineteen-year-old girl, Sophia Stanton-Greville, who wants to bed him. And not, he believes, because she is simply enthralled with his handsome self or his boundless charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophia has successfully controlled every man in her orbit until she meets Ryder Sherbrooke, a man she knows immediately is different from the others, a man she sees as one of hell's own sons. Ryder, confident as only a successful rake can be when it comes to knowing women, sets out to teach her who is in charge. It's said she already has three lovers. Is she indeed the outrageous tease she appears? A seductress? Or is she an innocent with an ugly and terrifying secret?</description>

She's a hot dish.&lt;br /&gt;But are they ready for the main course?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie Bocuse dreams of managing a chic Manhattan restaurant. In the meantime she's waitressing at her sister's French bistro in Brooklyn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the regulars is Quinn O'Brien, not only the best reporter in New York but the most handsome. He'll do anything for a story, even break hearts, though Natalie swears hers will stay untouched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Quinn offers Natalie a waitressing job at his parents' Irish Pub in Manhattan, she can't refuse.

Now Quinn will do anything to stop the presses. Pursuing the greatest story of his life, his own love story, Quinn's going to need his luck of the Irish to win Natalie's heart-or else it's c'est la vie...</description>

  <description>Defense attorney Brynn Holloran is right at home among cops, criminals, and tough-as-nails prosecutors. With her sharp wit and pointed words, she has a tendency to intimidate, and she likes it that way. She’s a force to be reckoned with in the courtroom, but in her personal life, she’s a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a vicious murderer she once helped prosecute resurfaces and starts a killing spree to wipeout those who put him behind bars, one thing becomes clear: Brynn needs to run for her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no help from the police, Brynn is forced to take matters into her own hands, turning to a private security firm for protection. But when Brynn defies advice and gets involved in the investigation, even the former Secret Service agent assigned to protect her may not be able to keep her safe. With every new clue she discovers, Brynn is pulled back into the vortex of a disturbing case from her past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the clock ticks down on a manhunt, Brynn’s desperate search for the truth unearths long-buried secrets and reignites a killer’s fury.</description>

IT SEEMS THE PROPER LORD FARLEY HAS BEHAVED IN A DECIDEDLY IMPROPER MANNER ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Lindford, Viscount Farley, has returned from the Orient, feted and celebrated ... until his past catches up with him. It seems the Viscount's randy ways have resulted in the juiciest scandal of the season: he has brought his natural-born children into his household to raise. Now, abandoned by his fiancee and hounded by the gossips, he has retreated to his country estate, only to find his children more than a handful of trouble. Worse, the most tempting woman on earth is right next door ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phoebe Churchill's peaceful country life, tending her cottage and rearing her abandoned niece, is disrupted when Viscount Farley becomes her new neighbor. Undoubtedly, his powerful build and sensual charm have lured countless women to abandon all reason ... except for Phoebe -- she's far too wise to be seduced by a heartbreaker. But when she agrees to help James manage his unruly household, she finds herself drawn to the man whose lingering kisses leave her yearning for so much more. And before she knows it, a stunning twist of events will lead her toward an impossible task: teaching a notorious heartbreaker the true meaning of love ...</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;A rootless foster child, Julie Mathison had blossomed under the love showered upon her by her adoptive family. Now a lovely and vivacious young woman, she was a respected teacher in her small Texas town, and she passionately lived her ideals. Julie was determined to give back all the kindness she'd received; nothing and no one would ever shatter the perfect life she had fashioned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zachary Benedict was an actor/director whose Academy Award-winning career had been shattered when he was wrongly convicted of murdering his wife. After the tall, ruggedly handsome Zack escaped from a Texas prison, he abducted Julie and forced her to drive him to his Colorado mountain hideout. She was outraged, cautious, and unable to ignore the instincts that whispered of his innocence. He was cynical, wary, and increasingly attracted to her. Passion was about to capture them both in its fierce embrace...but the journey to trust, true commitment, and proving Zack's innocence was just beginning....&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>An enchanting new novel from &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Hannah Howell that will make you believe in the power of destiny--and desire--all over again. . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She Sees His Face Everywhere. . .&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lady Alethea Vaughn Channing is haunted by a vision of a man in danger--the same man who she has seen in dreams time and time again. She doesn't even know his name, and yet she feels the connection between them, knows she is the only one standing between him and disaster. &lt;b&gt;. . .Yet They Have Never Met&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But rakish Lord Hartley Greville is capable of protecting himself, as he has proven more than once in his perilous work as a spy for the crown. If he's to carry out his duty, he'll need to put aside the achingly beautiful woman with the strange gift. And yet, when Alethea's visions reveal a plot that could endanger children, Hartley will not be able to ignore the destiny that binds them together--or resist the passion burning between them. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Hannah Howell and &lt;i&gt;If He's Wicked&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Fans will gladly follow Howell from the Scottish Highlands to London for her new trilogy." --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"The superbly talented Howell never disappoints." --&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Elizabeth Hoyt brings us the first book in her sexy and sensual Greycourt Series!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freya de Moray is many things: a member of the secret order of Wise Women, the daughter of disgraced nobility, and a chaperone living under an assumed name. What she is not is forgiving. So when the Duke of Harlowe, the man who destroyed her brother and led to the downfall of her family, appears at the country house party she's attending, she does what any Wise Woman would do: she starts planning her revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christopher Renshaw, the Duke of Harlowe, is being blackmailed. Intent on keeping his secrets safe, he agrees to attend a house party where he will put an end to this coercion once and for all. Until he recognizes Freya, masquerading amongst the party revelers, and realizes his troubles have just begun. Freya knows all about his sins—sins he'd much rather forget. But she's also fiery, bold, and sensuous—a temptation he can't resist. When it becomes clear Freya is in grave danger, he'll risk everything to keep her safe. But first, Harlowe will have to earn Freya's trust-by whatever means necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Features a bonus novella from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Grace Burrowes!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>BLINDED BY PASSION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful Lady Rose, the fiercely independent mistress of Somerford, reluctantly agrees to hire a bold Viking warrior, Gunnar Olafson, and his mercenaries to protect her undefended lands. But although Gunnar takes her breath away --- with his steel-hard muscles and eyes afire with undisguised yearning --- she dares not trust him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Gunnar is not what he seems.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Jo Goodman introduced the incomparable Dennehy Women—five sisters with a passion for life and love. In&lt;/i&gt; Only In My Arms, &lt;i&gt;she concludes her enchanting series with the unforgettable Mary Frances Dennehy, a woman torn between a steadfast faith and a passionate love...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A man about to die... &lt;br /&gt;A woman ready to live...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torn between devotion and a secret yearning for adventure and fulfillment, Mary Frances Dennehy makes her choice. Shocking her family, she leaves the convent and her cloistered existence behind and sets out in search of a new life. But for a woman alone, the West can be a hostile and treacherous place. And no one is in more dangerous—and irresistible—than Ryder McKay. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faithful to the Apaches who raised him, now sentenced to hang for a crime he didn't commit, Ryder is desperate enough to seize one last chance for freedom. Taking Mary Dennehy hostage, the army scout plots his daring escape into the mountains only to find himself with a woman he never expected, one who makes him feel fully alive and hungry for more. Now, with danger closing in, a breathtaking bid for freedom becomes a journey into forbidden passion that will test two lovers' faith and challenge their hearts.</description>

  <description>Indi Wilcox has a bad track record with race-car drivers--and the skid marks on her heart to prove it. So when she's forced to team up with Todd Peters, NASCAR's number one bad boy, to grant the wish of a terminally ill child, she vows to keep things professional. Todd isn't sure what he thinks about the new Miracles caseworker. Except that she's gorgeous--and steaming mad. Not that he blames her. He accidentally let down one of her kids. Determined to prove to Indi that he's not just another spoiled NASCAR star, Todd sets out to make things right. With every combustible moment they share, deeper feelings take over. Giving up total control might be the scariest--or the best--risk they ever take.</description>

  <description>In a world where to go against a king's word means death--she must decide if forbidden love is worth the risk.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Raedwyn--daughter of King Raedwald of the East Angles--has just wed one of her father's ealdorman. Although highborn women wed to strengthen political alliances, rather than for love, Raedwyn still hopes for a happy marriage like that of her parents'. But her optimism is shattered on her wedding night, for her new husband is callous and rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raedwyn's life shifts unexpectedly when outlaws ambush her husband's party on their journey back to his long ship. She finds herself captive of a bitter, vengeful warrior who has a score to settle with her father. Raedwyn is his bargaining tool. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caelin, the outlaw's enigmatic son, follows his father on his quest for revenge. Fiercely loyal to her own father, Raedwyn isn't prepared for her wild attraction to Caelin--or for its consequences. Their love is forbidden--but it will not be denied.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This first instalment in Jayne Castel's THE KINGDOM OF THE EAST ANGLES series is for fans of Historical Fiction, Historical Romance and Adventure. Readers who love Diana Gabaldon, Bernard Cornwell and Elizabeth Chadwick should enjoy this epic romance adventure set in Dark Ages Britain. Although each novel follows on historically, this series can be read as separate, standalone, romances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DARK UNDER THE COVER OF NIGHT was a Quarter-finalist in the Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award, 2013--Romance category.</description>

  <description>"A blindfolded rollercoaster ride" with a staggering pace that promises to keep you up all night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SSgt. Ryder was born, bred, and enhanced as a warrior, but when he returns home to his new wife--exiled from the Army along with the rest of his disgraced team--he faces mounting anger and paranoia. Something shady followed Ryder back from the desert, and he disappears to protect his wife, but his departure leaves a vacuum filled with intrigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren Ryder married thinking she had finally found stability, until her new husband disappeared. In six months, she's lost everything that mattered, and now a madman has her in his sights. Ryder's return lands her in deeper danger from a formidable enemy. As the threats escalate, so does the heat, but even if Ryder can save Lauren from the forces mounting against them, will they survive what he has become?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The chemistry between Lauren and Ryder jumped off the pages. Exactly why we read romance." (Beth Rhodes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Military trained, medically enhanced, designed to kill. The Team Fear novels are fast paced, with twists and turns and a side of steamy. The surviving members of Team Fear are out of the military and in a world of secrets, lies, and cover-ups in this new romantic suspense series by Cindy Skaggs.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Katy Regnery,&lt;/b&gt; comes a tale of regret, betrayal, kidnapping, loss, madness, abuse, passion, love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this modern retelling of Hansel and Gretel, thirteen-year-old foster children Griselda and Holden escape from their abductor after three years of brutal captivity, and try to cross the Shenandoah River on foot. Tragically, one of them makes it to safety, but the other is left behind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years later, Griselda's boyfriend drags her to a fight club grudge match, and her world is turned upside down when she watches Holden step into the ring. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the connection between them is fierce, bitter regret, simmering rage, and a tangle of physical and emotional scars lie between them, just as dangerous as the white water of the Shenandoah. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never Let You Go is a story of fear and hope, defeat and survival, and two people--once profoundly broken--who discover that love is the only thing that can make them whole again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Due to profanity, scenes of physical abuse and very strong sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18. (Note: Children are not sexually abused in this book.)** &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All novels in the ~a modern fairytale~ collection are written as fundraisers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never Let You Go is part of the ~a modern fairytale~ collection, which includes six standalone, completely unrelated novels inspired by beloved fairy tales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Librarian Note: Alternate Cover Edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35724658-never-let-you-go" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN: B00YOI1EW2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In this modern-retelling of &lt;i&gt;Beauty and the Beast,&lt;/i&gt; Savannah Carmichael, betrayed by an unreliable source, returns to her hometown of Danvers, Virginia with her once-promising journalism career in ruins. Given the opportunity to get back in the game by writing a patriotic human interest piece, Savannah turns her attention to the town hermit, Asher Lee, a wounded veteran who returned to Danvers eight years ago, and hasn’t been seen since. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an IED explosion in Afghanistan took Asher’s hand and disfigured half of his face, he's lived a quiet life on the outskirts of Danvers where the locals respect his privacy…that is, until Savannah Carmichael comes calling in a borrowed sundress with a plate of homemade brownies. When Asher agrees to be interviewed by Savannah, he starts feeling things for the beautiful reporter that he hasn’t felt in years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misfits in small-town Danvers, Savannah and Asher create a bond right away, touching each other’s hearts in ways neither thought possible. When a terrible mistake threatens to drive them apart, they’ll have to decide if the love they found in one another’s arms is strong enough to fight for their hard-won happily ever after.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The guy she wants…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Growing up on the coast of Maine with a revolving door of foster siblings, Caitlyn Michaud spent one intense and passionate year falling in love with her foster brother, Heath. Then he left without a word. The betrayal devastated Caitlyn and made her vow to forget the compelling bad boy. But forgetting his sensual touch and their deep all-consuming friendship is easier said than done.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Isn’t the guy she needs…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Determined to move on, in college Caitlyn has risen above her small town impoverished roots and has joined a sorority, reinvented her appearance, and landed the right boyfriend. Pre-law major and frat president, Ethan, is thoughtful and always laughing, and he makes her feel happy, calm. He also gives her the social acceptance she craves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the perfect world she tried so hard to attain is ripped apart when Heath appears one night out of nowhere. Caitlyn remembers all the reasons why she loves him, even if they don’t make sense to anyone but her. Out of the military, Heath is as brooding and intense as ever, and he is determined not only to win her back, but to exact revenge on everyone who kept him from her…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And when one love allows her to breathe, but the other feels as essential to her life as air, how does she choose between them?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>When Alysin decided to surprise her boyfriend at work with dinner, the surprise was on her. Since he was going at it with his secretary on the conference table, she packed a bag and called her BFF. Jolie and Alysin had been traveling the country, working as digital nomads for ten years ever since graduation. Taking this as a sign it was time for a new move, they decided to take a cruise, regroup, and make a plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she meets Mr. Bedroom Eyes. Following her lead, they pretend to be married so that she can rid herself of the guy who started hitting on her before the boat left the dock. Though it was supposed to be a momentary arrangement, he asks her to take it one step farther. Then another and another. The cruise promises to be memorable in every way that matters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, Alysin learns that she won't have to fake an orgasm if she's with someone who knows what to do, that not all men suck, but the best ones suck really well, and that sometimes what starts out as something pretend, can fast become something completely real. Will the woman who lives life with no regrets, regret that she made that stupid rule about not exchanging names and contact info?</description>

  <description>When county sheriff Cab Johnson gets a hunch, he’s learned to trust it, and his hunch tells him Rose Bellingham is in a peck of trouble. Bad enough he’s in love with her, bad enough she’s already engaged to Jason Thayer. He’s got to figure out what she’s hiding before he loses her for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose can’t stand one more person meddling in her business, even if that person is a handsome, eligible sheriff. She’s been controlled for far too long. But since her fiancé’s father is both her boss and landlord, she can’t dump Jason until she’s got somewhere to run. She’s found the perfect place: a patch of forest outside town. But with Cab watching her every move, she’s hard pressed to finish her hideaway so she can make her escape. Meanwhile, she’s not the only one with problems. Can she find a way to help her friends, too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when Cab solves one mystery, more pop up. Where does Rose keep disappearing to? What’s wrong with Mia Start? Why is Hannah Chatham lying to her fiancé? At least he’s let Rose know he’s interested. And if he’s not mistaken, she’s interested, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose’s hideaway is perfect, until her friends invade it to escape their own troubles. Can she trust them to keep its whereabouts a secret? Does she want to hide from Cab anymore? Now that Jason’s out of the picture, is it safe to follow her heart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When two unexpected visitors arrive with secrets of their own, Chance Creek must brace for its deadliest night ever. Can Cab figure out the connections between all the mysteries fast enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or will Rose and her friends pay the ultimate price?</description>

With her intended often preoccupied, Aslyn finds herself drawn to a darkly handsome entrepreneur who seems to understand her so well. Surely a lady of her station should avoid Mick Trewlove. If only he weren’t so irresistible . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As secrets are about to be exposed, Mick must decide if his plan for vengeance is worth risking what his heart truly desires.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A slow-burning romance and a chilling mystery bind two singular men in the suspenseful first book of a new Victorian series from K. J. Charles.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lodging-house keeper Clem Talleyfer prefers a quiet life. He’s happy with his hobbies, his work—and especially with his lodger Rowley Green, who becomes a friend over their long fireside evenings together. If only neat, precise, irresistible Mr. Green were interested in more than friendship...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rowley just wants to be left alone—at least until he meets Clem, with his odd, charming ways and his glorious eyes. Two quiet men, lodging in the same house, coming to an understanding... it could be perfect. Then the brutally murdered corpse of another lodger is dumped on their doorstep and their peaceful life is shattered.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now Clem and Rowley find themselves caught up in a mystery, threatened on all sides by violent men, with a deadly London fog closing in on them. If they’re to see their way through, the pair must learn to share their secrets—and their hearts.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heartwarming holiday read &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;from &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Carolyn Brown&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Nash Lamont is a man about as solitary as they come. That's exactly why ranch life in middle-of-nowhere Happy, Texas suits him. So what the heck is he doing letting a beautiful widow and her three rambunctious children temporarily move in? Before he knows it, they're stringing Christmas lights and decorating the tree... and he's having the time of his life. But after everything he's been through, Nash knows this kind of happiness doesn't last.&lt;br /&gt;Kasey Dawson thought she'd never get over the death of her husband. Nash, with his strong hands and infinite patience, is stirring something she hasn't felt in a long time. Kasey knows the sexy cowboy isn't telling her everything about this past, though. And she refuses to risk heartbreak all over again. But her kids have a plan of their own: Nothing will keep them from having a real family again-even if it takes a little help from Santa himself.&lt;u&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Happy, Texas series: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Toughest Cowboy in Texas&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Long, Tall Cowboy Christmas&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Luckiest Cowboy of All&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A charming small-town Christmas romance filled with family, love, and hope from the &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Last Chance series. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Tis the season in Shenandoah Falls and the first time Willow Peterson has been home in years. But she's determined to fulfill the wishes of her recently deceased best friend and restore Eagle Hill Manor to its former glory-all in time to host the perfect holiday wedding. She just has to get the owner of the historic inn to hire her. Unfortunately, that means dealing with Scrooge himself... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the death of his wife, David Lyndon has a bah-humbug approach to Christmas. But as December counts down and the wedding planning is in full swing, it's harder and harder to stay immune to the charms of Willow, especially when he sees how much joy she brings his eight-year-old daughter. After a simple kiss under the mistletoe turns into something more, David is hoping he can turn the magic of the holiday season into the love of a lifetime.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;All wrapped up . . . &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more game. That's all that stands between NHL star Asher Westmore and a major career milestone. But then his brother bashes him against the hockey boards, sidelining him for months. Over Christmas holidays, no less. If staying off the ice doesn't drive him crazy, staying with his family will. The only bright spot amidst the mistletoe and twinkle lights: His best friend, Emma, is a physical therapist. And working out with her improves his body and his spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last time. Emma Callaway was in trouble the minute she and Asher added benefits to their friendship. How is she supposed to resist a funny, caring guy who makes her toes curl? Her heart was safe while he lived in a different state. Now that he's back home recuperating, though, it's only a matter of time before she blurts out her feelings. Emma's only hope is that with a little holiday magic, she'll get the best Christmas gift of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"With the perfect blend of hockey, heart, and heat, Maybe This Time is a winner!" --- USA Today bestselling author Debbie Mason</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Some of Ben Sedgwick's favorite things: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Helping his poor parishioners&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baby animals&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shamelessly flirting with the handsome Captain Phillip Dacre&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an unconventional upbringing, Ben is perfectly content with the quiet, predictable life of a country vicar, free of strife or turmoil. When he's asked to look after an absent naval captain's three wild children, he reluctantly agrees, but instantly falls for the hellions. And when their stern but gloriously handsome father arrives, Ben is tempted in ways that make him doubt everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some of Phillip Dacre's favorite things: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;His ship&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;People doing precisely as they're told&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Touching the irresistible vicar at every opportunity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillip can't wait to leave England's shores and be back on his ship, away from the grief that haunts him. But his children have driven off a succession of governesses and tutors and he must set things right. The unexpected presence of the cheerful, adorable vicar sets his world on its head and now he can't seem to live without Ben's winning smiles or devastating kisses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the midst of runaway children, a plot to blackmail Ben's family, and torturous nights of pleasure, Ben and Phillip must decide if a safe life is worth losing the one thing that makes them come alive.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Christi Caldwell’s Wicked Wallflowers series burns hot as two rivals meet in the flesh and feel the heat…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adair Thorne has just watched his gaming-hell dream disappear into a blaze of fire and ash, and he’s certain that his competitors, the Killorans, are behind it. His fury and passion burn even hotter when he meets Cleopatra Killoran, a tart-mouthed vixen who mocks him at every turn. If she were anyone else but the enemy, she’d ignite a desire in him that would be impossible to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one can make Cleopatra do anything. That said, she’ll do whatever it takes to protect her siblings―even if that means being sponsored by their rivals for a season in order to land a noble husband. But she will not allow her head to be turned by the infuriating and darkly handsome Adair Thorne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s only one thing that threatens the rules of the game: Cleopatra’s secret. It could unravel the families’ tenuous truce and shatter the unpredictably sinful romance mounting between the hellion…and a scoundrel who could pass for the devil himself.</description>

She's seen enough of the world to believe in passion, and won't accept a marriage without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Wallflower Makes a Dangerous Bargain...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bastard son of a duke and king of London's dark streets, Devil has spent a lifetime wielding power and seizing opportunity, and the spinster wallflower is everything he needs to exact a revenge years in the making. All he must do is turn the plain little mouse into an irresistible temptress, set his trap, and destroy his enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the Promise of Passion...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there's nothing plain about Felicity Faircloth, who quickly decides she'd rather have Devil than another. Soon, Devil's carefully laid plans are in chaos, and he must choose between everything he's ever wanted...and the only thing he's ever desired.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ewan Mostyn thinks a job as a duke's daughter's bodyguard will be easy―but Lady Lorraine has a few tricks up her sleeve that spark an undeniable passion...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiercely loyal to his friends and comrades, Ewan Mostyn is the toughest in a group of younger sons of nobility who met as soldiers and are now trying desperately to settle back into peaceful Society. Ewan trusts his brawn more than his brains, but when he's offered a job watching the Duke of Ridlington's stubbornly independent daughter, he finds both are challenged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Lorraine wants none of her father's high-handed ways, and she'll do everything in her power to avoid her distressingly attractive bodyguard―until she lands herself in real trouble. Lorraine begins to see Ewan's protectiveness in a new light, and she can only hope that her stoic guardian will do for her what he's always done―fight for what he wants.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Welcome back to New York Times bestseller Sandra Hill’s Cajun country, where love heats up the Louisiana bayou&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former Chicago cop Simone LeDeux is back home in the bayou, sharing a double wide in the Pearly Gates trailer park to help her mama recover from surgery. Her one rule: &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; Cajun men. Loved and left by too many double-crossing Cajuns, Simone puts bad experience to good use by opening Legal Belles: an agency that uncovers cheating spouses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly she’s confronting a two-timer about to swindle his wife out of millions and antagonizing New Orleans bigwigs over an illegal sex club. Adam Lanier learns of the dangerous game Simone is playing . . . and the sexy single dad comes to her aid. Known as a rogue in the courtroom and a player in the bedroom, the ragin’ Cajun has Simone &lt;em&gt;triply&lt;/em&gt; on guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With their crazy chemistry, danger on their trail, and infamous LeDeux relative Tante Lulu working her magical matchmaking, the bayou has never been this steamy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heartwarming stand-alone novella from New York Times best-selling author Elizabeth Hoyt!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Rutledge, Viscount d'Arque, really rather loathes Christmas. The banal cheerfulness. The asinine party games. And, worst of all, the obligatory trip to the countryside. His grandmother, however, loves the holiday - and Adam loves his grandmother, so he'll brave the fiercest snowstorm to please her. But when their carriage wheel snaps, they're forced to seek shelter at the home of the most maddening, infuriating, and utterly beguiling woman he's ever met....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah St. John really rather loathes rakes. The self-satisfied smirks. The sly predatory gazes. Oh, and the constant witty banter rife with double meaning. But in the spirit of the season, she'll welcome this admittedly handsome viscount into her home. But as the snowstorm rages, the Yule log crackles, and the tension rises, Sarah and Adam find themselves locked in a fiery, passionate kiss. If love is the true meaning of Christmas, it's the one gift this mismatched pair can't wait to unwrap.</description>

  <description>Dominic Alistair, Marquis of Vidal and fiery son of the notorious Duke of Avon, has established a rakish reputation that rivals his father's, living a life of excess and indulgence. He is a bad lot a rake and seducer, reckless, heedless, and possessed of a murderous temper. He is known by friend and foe alike as the "Devil's Cub." Yet as the handsome and wealthy heir to a Dukedom, he is considered a good prospect on the marriage market. Vidal currently has his eye on the young, lovely, and unintelligent Sophia Challoner, and Sophia's greedy mother is more than happy to encourage his dubious attentions. Banished to the Continent after wounding his opponent in a duel, Vidal decides to abduct the silly aristocrat bent on seducing him into marriage and make her his mistress instead. In his rush, however, he seems to have taken the wrong woman?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intelligent, practical Mary Challoner knew wicked Vidal, wouldn't marry her sister, despite her mother's matchmaking schemes. So Mary coolly prepared to protect her naive sister by deceiving Vidal. Substituting herself for her young sister, she certainly hadn't expected the nobleman to kidnap and take her to France. She had little notion he would grimly hold her to her part of the bargain. Now he had left her, and she was alone, a stranger in a strange land, prey to the intrigues of glittering, heartless, 18th century Paris. Only one person could rescue her--the Marquis himself. But how could she ever trust this man? How could she even hope to overcome the contempt in which he held her? And how could even the sudden flowering of her love ever bridge the terrible gap between them?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Smart, sexy, and oh-so romantic." -Mary Balogh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Miss Charlotte Windham, the best way to maintain her spinsterhood-and her independence-is a teeny, tiny brush with scandal. She chooses wealthy, handsome upstart Lucas Sherbourne as her unwitting accomplice. He's intelligent, logical, and ambitious. What Charlotte doesn't count on is that one kiss will lead them straight to the altar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sherbourne has no love for polite society, nor is he keen on being anybody's husband of last resort. He is attracted to Charlotte's boldness, though-and her family's influence. Without a title, he knows he'll never truly be part of their world, even as he and Charlotte inch closer to a marriage that means much more than convenience. But a scheming business partner is about to test that tenuous trust, forcing Sherbourne to make a drastic choice: his wealth or his wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Windham Brides series:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Trouble with Dukes&lt;br /&gt;Too Scot to Handle&lt;br /&gt;No Other Duke Will Do&lt;br /&gt;A Rogue of Her Own&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Every once in a while, you need to get away from it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a woman on the edge, shaken and shattered after a breakup that felt like it tore my entire world apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best friend, sick of watching me drown in misery and melancholy, harassed me until I agreed to go with her on a week-long wilderness retreat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She promised days spent bonding and getting in touch with our inner bad-asses. &lt;br /&gt;It was supposed to be all about the two of us roughing it and making do with the bare minimum. She assured me we were going to be pushed to our limits in ways that were unimaginable. Neither one of us could have ever guessed just how right she was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowhere in the glossy brochure did it say anything about the fact I was going to have to battle the insufferable but deliciously rugged and sexy trail guide instead of the elements. The brochure also forgot to mention the part that warned when you left civilization behind, there was no place to pack your inhibitions and fears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told that I would be facing a week where the only thing I should expect was the unexpected. However, no one mentioned that I was going to have to fight for my life…and my heart as soon as I ventured into the unknown. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a pro at hiding from my feelings but when it came time to face a real threat, one that could change everything, I learned I was more of a no surrender, no retreat kind of girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retreat is a standalone novel, the first in the Getaway series which centers on the hardheaded and brokenhearted Warner brothers and the women that dare to love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These boys are very good at putting the wild in wilderness.</description>

  <description>Sarah Piper's lonely, threadbare existence changes when her temporary agency sends her to assist a ghost hunter. Alistair Gellis—rich, handsome, scarred by World War I, and obsessed with ghosts—has been summoned to investigate the spirit of nineteen-year-old maid Maddy Clare, who is haunting the barn where she committed suicide. &lt;br /&gt;Since Maddy hated men in life, it is Sarah's task to confront her in death. Soon Sarah is caught up in a deperate struggle. For Maddy's ghost is real, she's angry, and she has powers that defy all reason. Can Sarah and Alistair's assistant, the rough, unsettling Matthew Ryder, discover who Maddy was, where she came from, and what is driving her desire for vengeance—before she destroys them all?</description>

  <description>Under the reign of Louis XV, corruption and intrigue have been allowed to blossom in France, and Lord Justin Alastair, the notorious Duke of Avon, known for his coldness of manner, his remarkable omniscience, and his debauched lifestyle. Society believes the worst of Justin, who is clearly proud of his sobriquet, 'Satanas'. In a dark Parisian back alley, he is accosted by Leon, a young person dressed in ragged boy's clothing running away from a brutal rustic guardian. The Duke buys Leon, a redheaded urchin with strangely familiar looks, who is in fact Leonie, and she serves him with deep devotion. The Duke suspected the truth about his page--she was really none other than the wicked Comte de Saint Vire's legitimate daughter, deprived of her heritage by the comte's dastardly desire for a male heir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the splendours of Versailles and the dignified mansions of England, Justin begins to unfold his sinister plans, and Leonie shoulds play a fine part in Duke's long-over-due schemes to avenge himslef on the Comte de St Vire. The duke's plan was simple: parade delicately handsome Leonie in front of his enemy and transforming her into the toast of the town, before his innocent ward reclaim her birthright, destroying her true father in the process. But the duke hadn't expected Leonie's breathtaking transformation or the tender emotions she awoke--and he'd already set his dangerous scheme in motion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While, titian-haired Leonie, ward of the dashing Duke of Avon, has all Paris at her feet. Yet her true origins remained shrouded in mystery. And neither the glittering soirees nor the young aristocrats who so ardently courted her could still the question that plagued her young heart. Just one man held the secret, the one she feared most in the world--the iron-willed Comte de Saint-Vire, deadly enemy of the Duke. He would give her the answer--for a price. But could she betray the man she secretly, helplessly loved? And could this proud young beauty hear to face the truth when it came?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;“Sexy, emotional, funny . . . Dimon gives it all to her readers.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Bestselling Author Jill Shalvis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say it takes a thief to catch a thief, and Harrison Tate is proof. Once a professional burglar, he now makes a lawful living tracking down stolen art. No one needs to know about his secret sideline, “liberating” artifacts acquired through underhanded methods. At least until one of those jobs sees him walking in on a murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabrielle Wright has long been estranged from her wealthy family, but she didn’t kill her sister. Trouble is, the only person who can prove it is the sexy, elusive criminal who shouldn’t have been at the island estate on that terrible night. She’s not expecting honor among thieves—or for their mutual attraction to spark into an intense inferno of desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the guise of evaluating her family’s art, Harris comes back to the estate hoping to clear Gabby’s name. But returning to the scene of the crime has never been riskier, with their hearts and lives on the line.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44046322-romancing-the-scot" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN B0746MLYFZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this stunning series starter by USA Today bestselling author May McGoldrick, meet the new generation of Penningtons...five brothers and sisters of passion and privilege. Enter their aristocratic world…where each will fight injustice and find love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugh Pennington—Viscount Greysteil, Lord Justice of the Scottish Courts, hero of the Napoleonic wars—is a grieving widower with a death wish. When he receives an expected crate from the continent, he is shocked to find a nearly dead woman inside. Her identity is unknown, and the handful of American coins and the precious diamond sown into her dress only deepen the mystery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace Ware is an enemy to the English crown. Her father, an Irish military commander of Napoleon’s defeated army. Her mother, an exiled Scottish Jacobite. When Grace took shelter in a warehouse, running from her father’s murderers through the harbor alleyways of Antwerp, she never anticipated bad luck to deposit her at the home of an aristocrat in the Scottish Borders. Baronsford is the last place she could expect to find safety, and Grace feigns a loss of memory to buy herself time while she recovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugh is taken by her beauty, passion, and courage to challenge his beliefs and open his mind. Grace finds in him a wounded man of honor, proud but compassionate. When their duel of wits quickly turns to passion and romance, Grace’s fears begin to dissolve…until danger follows her to the very doors of Baronsford. For, unknown to either of them, Grace has in her possession a secret that will wreak havoc within the British government. Friend and foe are indistinguishable as lethal forces converge to tear the two lovers apart or destroy them both.</description>

  <description>Ex-military. Tall. Chiselled. Intelligent and arrogant. And so hot he's on fire. That's Ethan Taggart. Male to the max. Toni Crawford, computer genius turned PI, can't stop looking at him and Ethan's returning the favour. Nice and slow. Those piercing blue eyes of his are about to melt her down but...nothing doing. Toni has to stay cool. Focus on the assignment: the teenage daughter of a multimillionaire just vanished in plain sight. Chasing down leads, investigating every freaky angle, pushing past the boundaries of a hellish underworld of sex and drugs, Ethan and Toni are forced to work closely to stalk an unseen enemy with a taste for cruel games. Risking their lives to save the missing girl is only half the battle. Their blazingly sensual attraction grows every second, until there's no turning back. Their passion is about to explode...and Ethan and Toni soon find that danger breeds the hottest desire of all...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lessons In Love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A governess must never be alone with a man. &lt;i&gt;Her reputation mustn't have even a hint of scandal.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She must never reveal personal emotions. &lt;i&gt;No matter how strong the provocation by her employer.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A governess never questions her employer's commands. &lt;i&gt;Even when he's tempting her to forsake respectability for desire?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She must never, ever, fall in love with someone above her station. &lt;i&gt;Especially a rake—no matter how devastating his kisses may be.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexandra Gallant is a governess extraordinaire—and if it weren't for that unfortunate incident at her last position, she wouldn't now be forced into the employ of Lucien Balfour, the most notorious rake in London. Though the sinfully attractive earl hired her to teach his young cousin, his seductive whispers and toe-curling kisses suggest he has something far less respectable in mind...and that will never happen. For although Lucien seems determined to teach her about pleasure, she has a few lessons to teach him about love!</description>

  <description>Savannah's brother was killed in a cage fight with Mike "Red Reaper" Larson after a savage punch to the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Mike shows up at the funeral, he’s nothing like Savannah expected. Gone is the fierce, brutal beast she’s seen in the cage. In his place is a beautiful man torn with guilt, seeking forgiveness, and willing to do anything to ease her pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her family doesn’t approve, but her heart doesn’t stand a chance. Irresistibly drawn together, neither of them can deny the intoxicating desire unleashed between them, turning their pain into the most exquisite pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But every time Mike steps into the cage, Savannah knows she could lose him too. She can’t go through that again, but how can she let go of the one man who sets her body and soul on fire?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A war widow alone…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellie Meeks promised her pilot husband that if anything happened to him, she would live her life to the fullest. Three years later, she is still alone, raising the twins he never met. She has no interest in dating or meeting men—until one snowy night when a stranger helps her get her sick kids safely home. That stranger turns out to be a former Army Ranger and a member of the elite Rocky Mountain Search &amp;amp; Rescue Team. He’s also tall, rugged… and irresistibly sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;All it takes is one kiss…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Moretti came to Colorado to get Iraq out of his head, using the adrenaline of extreme sports and high-risk mountain rescues to keep his mind off the past. But getting involved with Ellie might be the riskiest thing he’s ever done. It’s not just their explosive chemistry. There’s something about Ellie that gets inside him, opening him to feelings he’s tried hard to ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;When passion ignites…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellie feels alive in Jesse’s arms and happier than she ever thought she’d feel again. But their relationship comes at a price for him, and soon Ellie sees that she must help Jesse fight the demons of his past to protect the love of a lifetime—and save the heart of a hero.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Set in New York City’s Gilded Age, Joanna Shupe’s Avon debut introduces an English beauty with a wicked scheme to win the man she loves—and the American scoundrel who ruins her best laid plans…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Honora Parker must get engaged as soon as possible, and only a particular type of man will do. Nora seeks a mate so abhorrent, so completely unacceptable, that her father will reject the match—leaving her free to marry the artist she desires. Who then is the most appalling man in Manhattan? The wealthy, devilishly handsome financier, Julius Hatcher, of course….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julius is intrigued by Nora’s ruse and decides to play along. But to Nora’s horror, Julius transforms himself into the perfect fiancé, charming the very people she hoped he would offend. It seems Julius has a secret plan all his own—one that will solve a dark mystery from his past, and perhaps turn him into the kind of man Nora could truly love.</description>

  <description>England, 1776: Lord Gareth de Montforte is known as an irresponsible rake with a heart of gold. When he takes a bullet for boldly thwarting a stagecoach robbery, he is stunned to discover that the beautiful young woman he has heroically rescued, Juliet Paige, is his deceased brother’s American fiancée, accompanied by her infant daughter. Despite his brother the duke's refusal to acknowledge Juliet, Gareth is determined to do right by the courageous woman who crossed an ocean to give her baby her rightful name. But Juliet is wary of marrying this black sheep aristocrat, even while she is hopelessly charmed by the dashing devil. Never has she met anyone who embraces life so thoroughly, who makes her laugh, who loves her so well. And, even when it seems the odds are against them, Juliet has absolute faith that Gareth will go beyond the call of duty, risking his life itself to give her and her daughter a home — and a love that will last a lifetime.</description>

  <description>Corporate raider Matthew Farrell had come a long way from the poor, scruffy kid of Indiana's steel mills. A long way from the country club where, feeling like an outsider, he had dared to fall in love with a beautiful blonde named Meredith Bancroft, and known a once-in-a-lifetime passion and betrayal that still haunted his memory... Now world leaders courted him, the media watched his every move, and he was ready to move in on the Bancroft empire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cool, poised executive in her family's legendary department store chain, Meredith had once defied her father for the sexually magnetic, intense Matt Farrell -- and their brief, ill-fated marriage was the disastrous outcome. Now, as the Bancroft firm is threatened by a hostile takeover, Meredith is forced to confront Matt. As tensions build between them, bittersweet memories rise to the surface, leaving them suspicious, restless, and uncertain. Will they be able to believe in each other -- and grasp the tender miracle that is before them?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A stand-alone novella from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Elizabeth Hoyt!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss Mary Whitsun is far too intelligent to fall for the rakish charms of a handsome aristocrat. But when the gentleman in question approaches her in a bookshop, mistaking her for his fiancee, Lady Johanna Albright, the flirtatious encounter only raises more questions. Could Mary, a servant raised in a St Giles orphanage, actually be Lady Joanna's long-lost twin sister? If so, Mary has been betrothed since birth&lt;b&gt;---&lt;/b&gt;to the rakishly handsome artistocrat himself . . .&lt;br /&gt;Henry Collins, Viscount Blackwell, is far too intrigued by Mary to let her go so easily. He's drawn to her sharp mind, indomitable spirit, and the fiery way in which she dismisses him---ladies simply don't dismiss Lord Blackwell. But as Mary makes her first hesitant steps into society, she can't help but wonder if she truly has a place in Henry's world---or in his heart.&lt;br /&gt;</description>
