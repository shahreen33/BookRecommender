  <description>&lt;b&gt;What do you do when you realize nothing in your life is what you’ve believed it to be?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arionna Jacobs' world is turned upside down when she loses her mother in a tragic accident. She’s forced to leave her old life behind and move in with her father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dace Matthews, a teaching assistant at Arionna's new college, is torn in two, unable to communicate with the feral wolf caged inside him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they meet, everything they thought they knew about life unravels. Dace has intimate access to Arionna’s mind, and something deep within her fights to rise to the surface. They don’t understand what’s happening to them or why, and they’re running out of time to sort out the strange occurrences around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their meeting sets an ancient Norse prophesy of destruction in motion, and what destiny has in store for them is bigger than either could have ever imagined. Unless they learn to trust themselves and one another, they may never resolve the mystery surrounding who they are to one another, and what that means for the world.</description>

  <description>I’d never forgotten him—a man I’d yet to meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Griffin Quinn was my childhood pen pal, the British boy who couldn’t have been more different from me. Over the years, through hundreds of letters, we became best friends, sharing our deepest, darkest secrets and forming a connection I never thought could break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one day it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, out of the blue, a new letter arrived. A scathing one—one with eight years of pent-up anger. I had no choice but to finally come clean as to why I stopped writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Griffin forgave me, and somehow we were able to rekindle our childhood connection. Only now we were adults, and that connection had grown to a spark. Our letters quickly went from fun to flirty to downright dirty, revealing our wildest fantasies. So it only made sense that we would take our relationship to the next level and see each other in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Griff didn’t want to meet. He asked that I trust him and said it was for the best. But I wanted more—more Griff, in the flesh—so I took a big chance and went looking for him. People have done crazier things for love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I found could change everything.</description>

  <description>-Tink- &lt;br /&gt;From the moment I befriended him, I set a conspiracy in motion. &lt;br /&gt;A revolution. &lt;br /&gt;Kill Peter Pan. &lt;br /&gt;And I was their ultimate weapon. &lt;br /&gt;I was also none the wiser, falling hopelessly and irrevocably in love with him as the years went by. &lt;br /&gt;Just as they hoped I would. &lt;br /&gt;But their plan comes to a screeching halt when Peter vanishes into thin air, something I’ll learn has nothing to do with Rosewood at all. &lt;br /&gt;You see, Peter never truly loved me...because he loved a wench instead. &lt;br /&gt;He lied to me, he used me, he left me, and he broke me. &lt;br /&gt;Forever altering me in ways that incite revenge when Hook sweeps in with revelations and the ultimate truth. &lt;br /&gt;Peter may have turned his back on me, but in the end, he and his precious little Wendy will choke on every last tear I once shed. &lt;br /&gt;And I’ll have Hook to thank for that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-Hook- &lt;br /&gt;It’s no secret I always despised Peter Pan. &lt;br /&gt;A common threat amongst the factions, I should’ve killed him when I had the chance, long before he sank his claws deep into Tinksley’s heart. &lt;br /&gt;But his death at my hands wasn’t what the plan called for, despite how I felt for her. &lt;br /&gt;I’d always been drawn to the girl, innocently enough at first…until that vile abomination marked her with his stamp, unleashing a sense of propriety I had no rights to. &lt;br /&gt;Didn’t matter—he had her...and I wanted her. &lt;br /&gt;Then like magic, he disappeared. &lt;br /&gt;I thought my time had come, but the road to owning Tinksley’s heart comes with a price. &lt;br /&gt;A price so dark and depraved it strips her of her purity and awakens the beast within. &lt;br /&gt;All because of the truth. &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, there is honor in revenge, and it will be my utmost pleasure to watch as Peter Pan finally meets his maker. &lt;br /&gt;His maker who will soon be my Queen. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Beautiful, perfect and everything he needs. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caitie Russell's big brother is getting married. As the proud owner of Holiday Magic, Caitie is the obvious choice to organise the perfect Christmas wedding. Piece of cake, right?&lt;br /&gt;If it weren't for one gorgeous man-shaped problem...&lt;br /&gt;Her brother's best friend, Brecken Miller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was her first crush.&lt;br /&gt;Her first kiss.&lt;br /&gt;And he doesn’t even remember it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction worker Brecken Miller is a modern-day Scrooge. &lt;br /&gt;The confirmed bachelor would rather pull his nails out than celebrate Christmas, until he sees Caitie again. &lt;br /&gt;Like a moth to a flame he’s drawn to her.&lt;br /&gt;But there’s a problem with fire. It always leaves a scar.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;COMING 10-10-19&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Graduation is meant be a new beginning. For me, it might be the end.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sneaking off to Vegas was supposed to be fun and exciting. Nothing more than a getaway with my best friend to celebrate surviving high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I can’t shake the feeling someone’s watching. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to enjoy my newfound freedom, we hit the strip and meet Tristan, a wildly popular magician who’s worshipped by adoring fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burned by guys like him before, I resist his advances. Yet, his smoldering blue eyes compel me, and I can’t help falling under his spell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the world erupts in chaos, and Tristan’s magic act turns out to be more than just an illusion, my entire life changes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, I’m catapulted into a world where angels walk among us, and Tristan is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some are out to destroy us.&lt;br /&gt;Some will protect us.&lt;br /&gt;The real question is, which side is Tristan on?</description>

She takes angelic mythology from Judeo-Christian tradition, then uses that to build a paranormal world without feeling overly religious.<br /><br />In this first book of a new series, high school senio...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;When six musicians come together to form an all-girl country band, The Sweethearts of Country Music are born. But can they balance their musical worlds with their personal lives?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C.C. DeVera plays to the beat of her own drum. As the percussionist for the Lipstick Outlaws, she prefers to stay out of the spotlight, safe in the shadows of her band mates. C.C.’s not one to make waves, but when her family wants to set her up on yet another disastrous blind date—for her sister’s wedding, no less—she finally puts her foot down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And tells a little white lie. That she already has a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dalton Gregory's job on the crew is a challenge, but he loves life on the road with the Outlaws. His little crush on the band's beautiful drummer makes the long hours even more worth it. There’s something about C.C. that makes his palms sweat, and his heart pound out its own rhythm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, C.C.’s family shows up at one of their gigs, wanting to meet her new mystery man. After she pulls Dalton into the act, things quickly get out of hand. It’s a mad scramble to keep up the charade, but what happens when their fake relationship starts to edge its way into reality?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can they both set aside their fears and admit they’re not pretending anymore? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The Sweethearts of Country Music series includes six books by six different authors. Each novel features a member of the band as she struggles to balance music and love. &lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Some men deserve redemption. Some men are worthy of salvation. I'm not one of them. My name is Michael Kincaid, and I've got so much blood on my hands, I'll never wash clean. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For ten years, I've tried to outrun my gangbanger past by burying myself in my work with the DEA. I've tried like hell to forget the day I damned my soul and lost everything…my family, my home, and the only girl I've ever loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still can't outrun it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how far I go, January James haunts me. Being without her is killing me, but what other choice do I have? We were still kids the first time I vowed to protect her. Instead, I destroyed her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now one of my enemies—a local gang member—has it out for her. He isn't going to stop until she gives him the territory I left her all those years ago. I swore I'd never set foot in Los Angeles again, but January needs my protection, and I'm not nearly strong enough to say no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She deserves better than me, but she's mine anyway. It's time to stop running and fight for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's an angel. I'm the devil on her shoulder. And this is my swan song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it's over, I'll either be the monster at the end of this book…or I'll be the man she deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fight for You is the first book in a series of interconnected full-length novels featuring law enforcement officers willing to do whatever it takes to protect the women who need them most. Each book can be read as a standalone, has no cheating, and a guaranteed HEA.</description>

  <description>What do a wrong number text, a burning building, and a quirky florist have in common? &lt;br /&gt;A hunky firefighter with an extra-large…hosepipe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In hindsight, I never should have opened that text message. The last thing I needed first thing on a Monday was a picture of some stranger’s, um, eggplant, in my inbox. &lt;br /&gt;I also should have replaced the batteries in my fire alarm, because my Friday night did not need to end with my apartment building going up in flames. &lt;br /&gt;But it’s fine. It’s fine. Everything is fine. &lt;br /&gt;I’m only lying in a hospital bed with more split ends than I’ve ever had, almost all my Earthly possessions have turned to ash, and apparently, they don’t serve wine to patients in this place. &lt;br /&gt;But like I said, it’s fine. &lt;br /&gt;Until he walks in. &lt;br /&gt;The guy who saved my life. My hero. Noah Jacobs. &lt;br /&gt;And the universe is amusing itself at my expense, because the dirty photo I woke up to on Monday? &lt;br /&gt;It’s his.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Meet the Blackthorne men, each one as hot, fast, and smooth as the whisky that built the family fortune, and the yachts and race cars that bear their name. From proud Scottish stock, Blackthornes never lose. But, one by one, the seven sexy men in this family are about to risk everything when they fall for strong and beautiful women who test their mettle in life…and love.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ROSS&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ross Blackthorne likes his cars fast and his women faster. As the third son, he’s accustomed to living his life without the pressure to succeed that his older brothers face. But when he crashes his race car during a public event, his father decides enough is enough. It’s time for Ross to step up and join the family business. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Holly Brooks has her hands full running operations at the Blackthorne Distillery in Lexington, Kentucky. The last thing she needs is to babysit an unrepentant playboy who doesn’t have any interest in learning what it takes to make world-class bourbon. &lt;br /&gt;Ross only intends to stay for as long as it takes to convince his father he’s better suited to driving fast—but working in close proximity to Holly is more interesting than he expected. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can daredevil Ross convince good girl Holly that he’s worth the risk? Or is their budding relationship doomed to crash and burn? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Don't miss these sexy, heartwarming, emotion-filled books by seven bestselling authors: Barbara Freethy, Julia London, Lynn Raye Harris, Cristin Harber, Roxanne St. Claire, Christie Ridgway and Samantha Chase. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Devlin #1 – Barbara Freethy &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jason #2 – Julia London &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ross #3 – Lynn Raye Harris &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Phillip #4 – Cristin Harber &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Brock #5 – Roxanne St. Claire &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Logan #6 – Samantha Chase &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trey #7 – Christie Ridgway&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Lynn Raye Harris’s Novels:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“This is an amazing display of great story telling. I loved every second of it.” - The Romance Book Club &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Lynn Raye Harris is explosive!” - Goodreads &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“...Harris proves she knows how to keep her readers coming back for more.” - Julie Johnson &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Reading this book was an unforgettable experience.” - From the Bottom of a Frappe &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Congratulations Ms. Harris you have earned yourself a new dedicated fan. Just keep the wonderful stories coming down the line.” - Romance Witch Reviews &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Harris is a master at giving readers kick-ass intrigue mixed with heart-warming moments and she’s become my can’t-be-missed military romance author.” - Romantic Reads and Such on Dangerously HOT &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Once you start you are in for a roller coaster of a read!” - Twin Sisters Rockin’ Reviews &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Harris also does a fantastic job of weaving romance and suspense together effortlessly. It's never out of place or overbalances the other. It's this perfect combination that will have your heart pounding and then leave you panting.” - Dirty Girl Romance &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole book. I could not put it down.” - Goodreads &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“I felt every page.” - Goodreads &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“I hate using those overused and often over the top statements like: “ This is the best book in the series so far” and “Lynn Raye Harris has done it again”. However... This is the best book in series and Lynn didn't just do it again, she somehow did it better.</description>

  <description>Meet the Blackthorne men, each one as hot, fast, and smooth as the whisky that built the family fortune, and the yachts and race cars that bear their name. From proud Scottish stock, Blackthornes never lose. But, one by one, the seven sexy men in this family are about to risk everything when they fall for strong and beautiful women who test their mettle in life…and love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TREY – Christie Ridgway &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the oldest of the wealthy and well-connected Blackthornes, Trey always puts family first. To end his parents’ separation, he heads to France, only to find that Paris has much more to offer than one missing mother. But Trey’s not the sort to slow down even when a beautiful and free-spirited American volunteers to play tour guide. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mia Thomas won’t take no for an answer, however, and soon Trey is questioning his all work, no play, and no commitment lifestyle. Then a family secret is revealed, and he must once and for all decide the kind of man he truly wants to be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Get the whole series!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DEVLIN - Barbara Freethy &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;JASON - Julia London &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ROSS - Lynn Raye Harris &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PHILLIP - Cristin Harber &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BROCK - Roxanne St. Claire &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;LOGAN - Samantha Chase &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TREY - Christie Ridgway</description>

As a child he was often overlooked – quite literally – due in part to retreating into himself after his parents’ deaths. During that time he found solace in movies, which led to his choice of career.

  <description>He promised me forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he boarded a plane for a college a thousand miles away and never returned. A decade later there’s a ring on my finger with a new promise from a new love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as my life falls into place, pretty as the pages of a magazine, my world is knocked over. The moment he touches me everything around me begins to crack, exposing all the lies I’ve told myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every glance reminds me. Every touch ignites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things aren’t how they used to be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love isn’t easy.</description>

  <description>Two university students thrown together in the midst of a raging storm, one a Shibari expert, the other an instinctive submissive. &lt;br /&gt;As the flood waters rise, so does Kasinda’s panic. When she allows Cree to use his expertise to ease her fears, she finds herself healing from the trauma of her past.&lt;br /&gt;The floodwaters may soon subside, but their passion for each other is just beginning to grow. Cree may be the rigger, but it’s Kas who has his emotions in knots.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Releasing as part of the 2019 &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/sinistercollections" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sinister Fairy Tales Collection&lt;/a&gt; and part of the Dark Paranormal &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/ryzeseriesgr" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ryze Series&lt;/a&gt;, but can be read as a Standalone!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Megara&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know the story. &lt;br /&gt;How it ended. &lt;br /&gt;He survived and conquered each task. &lt;br /&gt;Became the hero of all heroes. &lt;br /&gt;And in the end he became a legend. &lt;br /&gt;What no one told you is that I was there. I was helping him . . . and when he ascended, I was left behind to rot. &lt;br /&gt;Herakles never knew I sold my soul for his success—he didn’t need to. Had I been enough on my own, he would’ve chosen to stay. &lt;br /&gt;Instead, he rose to full glory. &lt;br /&gt;I was dragged straight to Hades. &lt;br /&gt;Beaten. &lt;br /&gt;Violated. &lt;br /&gt;Broken. &lt;br /&gt;Eventually, mutated. &lt;br /&gt;I lost track of him for nearly three millennia, but I’ve found him. &lt;br /&gt;I will kill him. &lt;br /&gt;He chose to become a god; I was forced to become a nightmare. &lt;br /&gt;Now it’s time for us to meet again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Herakles&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I abandoned my family mere moments before the Greek pantheon fell. &lt;br /&gt;‘Till this day the whispers accuse me. &lt;br /&gt;Had I been there, perhaps they could’ve been saved. &lt;br /&gt;But I no longer gave a fuck. &lt;br /&gt;Funny how vanity can blind a male to what really matters. &lt;br /&gt;It took less than a year on Olympus before I began searching for her again. &lt;br /&gt;I never found her. &lt;br /&gt;Now, two-in-a-half-thousand years later, here I am. &lt;br /&gt;Alone. &lt;br /&gt;Empty. &lt;br /&gt;An immortal ghost, simply getting by. &lt;br /&gt;I should’ve never left her. &lt;br /&gt;The only thing I had was hoping the last of her mortal days, wherever she ended up, were happy . . . &lt;br /&gt;Joke’s on me. &lt;br /&gt;A darkened, twisted version of my female returns, demanding my head for every one of my sins. &lt;br /&gt;And she shall have it. &lt;br /&gt;But first, I’m saving her from her curse. &lt;br /&gt;I’ll sacrifice every ounce of my sanity left to free her . . . right before I let her end me once and for all.</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;USA Today Bestselling Author&lt;/i&gt; K Webster, comes a &lt;b&gt;dark, fantasy romance standalone&lt;/b&gt; novel! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a cold, empty castle, a young queen is dying. &lt;br /&gt;Weak. Fragile. Disgraced. &lt;br /&gt;But Queen Whitestone is not alone in her final days. &lt;br /&gt;She has her beloved sister. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until a wicked king rides onto her land. &lt;br /&gt;Arrogant. Insufferable. Demanding. &lt;br /&gt;King Bloodsun has come with an offer…peace in trade for a bride. &lt;br /&gt;He wants the princess. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The fiery king won’t take no for an answer. &lt;br /&gt;He vows to keep the cold queen captive until she gives in to his demands. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A queen bows for no one, though. &lt;br /&gt;Not even when she’s frail and fading away. &lt;br /&gt;She’ll tap into her strength, protecting the only family she has left. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The king is about to learn why they call her the cruel one… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;They don’t even &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; each other…so how could they ever fall in love?&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Between raising her smart, sassy daughter and starting her own architecture firm, the last thing on Abigail Harper's mind is a relationship. Especially one with the immature owner of the local pub, who’s hired her to design his expansion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braden McKenna loves his fun and carefree life as the owner of the town watering hole, the &lt;em&gt;Shamrock&lt;/em&gt;. And being in close proximity to the uptight architect revamping the pub only solidifies his desire to stay single. Abby is . . . &lt;em&gt;complicated&lt;/em&gt;, and Braden doesn’t do complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Abby’s daughter thinks Braden might be just what her mother needs. And when she teams up with Holiday Junction’s group of meddling matchmakers, Abby and Braden might undergo a renovation of the romantic variety. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can they both stop stubbornly clinging to their independence long enough to give love a shot?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;FALLING FOR THE WRONG GUY is the fourth book in the LOVE IN HOLIDAY JUNCTION series of standalone romances. Each fun and flirty story is set in the small town of Holiday Junction, WA and can be read on its own, but you’ll probably enjoy reading them in order more. If you love small town romances with strong heroines, swoony heroes, and a quirky cast of characters, download today!&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Together they’ll unravel the secrets of the universe&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astrophysicist Olivia Romano has always preferred to stay close to her family in Brooklyn—even at the expense of her academic career. But with her advisor missing in action and an unscrupulous professor undermining her work, she’s forced to rely on the reformed-hacker-turned-elite-computer-genius whose sexy smile she can’t get out of her head. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicholas DeSantis cut ties with his family at eighteen, running away from his old-school Italian American neighborhood to make it big in Silicon Valley. When Livie comes to him for help, he can’t resist the project &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; the quirky woman behind it. Moving into the Romano house in his old neighborhood seems like the perfect short-term solution, if he can just continue to avoid his own family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while living together makes working with Livie easier, fighting his growing attraction to her becomes a whole lot harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Livie’s research is sabotaged, Nick takes a huge risk to get her the proof she needs to salvage her career. Moving forward means leaving Brooklyn and spreading her wings at last—just when Nick might finally be ready to put down some roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is approximately 89,000 words&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;From the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;A Discovery of Witches&lt;/i&gt;--now a hit TV series airing Sundays on AMC and BBC America, and streaming on Sundance Now and Shudder--comes a novel about what it takes to become a vampire. &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the battlefields of the American Revolution, Matthew de Clermont meets Marcus MacNeil, a young surgeon from Massachusetts, during a moment of political awakening when it seems that the world is on the brink of a brighter future. When Matthew offers him a chance at immortality and a new life free from the restraints of his puritanical upbringing, Marcus seizes the opportunity to become a vampire. But his transformation is not an easy one and the ancient traditions and responsibilities of the de Clermont family clash with Marcus's deeply held beliefs in liberty, equality, and brotherhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast-forward to contemporary Paris, where Phoebe Taylor--the young employee at Sotheby's whom Marcus has fallen for--is about to embark on her own journey to immortality. Though the modernized version of the process at first seems uncomplicated, the couple discovers that the challenges facing a human who wishes to be a vampire are no less formidable than they were in the eighteenth century. The shadows that Marcus believed he'd escaped centuries ago may return to haunt them both--forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A passionate love story and a fascinating exploration of the power of tradition and the possibilities not just for change but for revolution, &lt;i&gt;Time's Convert&lt;/i&gt; channels the supernatural world-building and slow-burning romance that made the All Souls Trilogy instant bestsellers to illuminate a new and vital moment in history, and a love affair that will bridge centuries.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;All's fair in love and war…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four months ago, DEA agent Tristan Riley nearly lost his life and the disabled ballerina who stole his heart. Now his relationship with Lillian Maddox is stronger than ever, and he wants nothing more than to put Teplo and the Vetrov case behind him. But when Elijah Noel and the deadly Vetrov drug appear in Los Angeles, Tristan is thrust right back into the middle of his worst nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to stop a vicious gang war and keep the drug out of Pedro Francisco's hands, the DEA agent finds himself wading into unfamiliar gang territory. The stakes are high, and the body count is even higher. Los Angeles is nothing like Seattle…and Francisco's people are a whole new level of terrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the DEA jeopardizes Lillian's safety and loses their one shot at finding the Vetrov drug, Tristan walks away from his job to save her life. With a rogue ATF agent and Michael Kincaid at his side, he will stop at nothing to bring her home safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outnumbered, outgunned, and with his back against the wall, Tristan will find his resolve tested in ways he never could have imagine. Making a deal with the devil was never in his plans, but he'll do whatever it takes to save his ballerina one last time…even if he has to catapult the entire West Coast into a drug war unlike they've ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rapture is the final book in the erotic and suspenseful Teplo Trilogy. This series deals with adult themes not suitable to readers under the age of 18.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;No strings.&lt;br /&gt;No commitments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are the terms Mila Lawson offers Roman Gregory when they find themselves living together in Santa Cruz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a violent gang gunning for him and a cartel threatening to go to war, the last thing the ATF agent should be thinking about is claiming his daughter's twenty-two-year-old best friend. But after four long years of lusting after the gorgeous little blonde from afar, once Roman has her, he's not willing to give her up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She may be off-limits, but something about Mila drives him wild. There's nothing sweet about the things he wants to do to her, and nothing gentle about the way he takes her. She makes him crave a future he never envisioned for himself…one so much better than he ever dreamed was possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep her, he'll be forced to face the daughter he adores. To save her, he'll break every rule in the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing will stand in his way. Not his daughter. Not the gang hunting him. Not even the law itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deny Me includes the first three novellas in Ayden K. Morgen's Her Best Friend's Father series, plus 40 pages of bonus content. No cheating, with a guaranteed HEA.</description>

  <description>Just Ten Seconds&lt;br /&gt;That’s all it took for my life to change forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left my posh life in Manhattan and escaped to the Hudson Valley in hopes of a fresh start. It wasn’t until I happened upon a bereavement group when I finally found a place I felt understood. I told them my husband was dead when, really, I was the one who had died inside. It was also where I saw the smoldering gaze of Dean Delgado, the single father whom I’d helped just days before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just Ten Seconds&lt;br /&gt;That’s all he wishes he had with his late wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite Dean’s widowed status, he has a robust thirst for life. He’s a protector and a giver. A man who fixes things with his hands, is devoted to his child, and wants to spend his days with me. I try to avoid him, knowing a woman with my past has no business being in this man’s life. With every run-in, he makes me laugh. With every touch, he ignites me. And with every second, he makes me feel like myself again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just Ten Seconds&lt;br /&gt;That’s all it took for me to fall in love with Dean Delgado.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm in too deep and my secrets are about to be exposed. I only hope he can forgive me for the lies I never meant to tell.</description>

  <description>It’s good to be me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to my last name, money is no object. According to the ladies, I’m charming.&lt;br /&gt;And if I do say so myself, and I do, I’m good looking too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m used to getting my way. Every. Single. Time. That is until Mallory Wray, a brunette beauty, lands in Hawaii. Now my new favorite pastime is how to bed the gorgeous co-ed. Again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An escape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll call it what it is. But there are worse places to spend the next three months than in paradise. A fresh start without the chill of Colorado or cheating exes is exactly what I need. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is going to ruin this for me, especially not gorgeous playboys. That is until I decide to throw caution to the wind and fall right into Evan Ashford’s bed. Unlike him, I can’t separate my heart from my head, so I get out before I get hurt. Again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I left my broken heart on the mainland, but now I’m starting to wonder if Evan can heal it. Here goes everything . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold onto your heart because Evan Ashford is about to steal it. Escape to paradise with this alpha playboy in the Playboy in Paradise Trilogy, an Emotional, Contemporary, New Adult Bestselling Romance.</description>

  <description>No one needs that many hookups! &lt;br /&gt;Not even soon to be major league pitcher, Theo Von Bremen.&lt;br /&gt;So, I help him by routinely thinning out his contact list—because I’m the best roommate ever. And he’s optimal baby daddy material. &lt;br /&gt;For me—not Amanda 1, 2, or 3.&lt;br /&gt;But since the man can’t take a hint; I’ll continue to spray his sheets with my perfume and accidentally leave my panties in his laundry. &lt;br /&gt;That has to be enough to break a man eventually. Right?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;From the New York Times bestselling author of the Pucked series comes a romantic comedy about instant attraction, second chances, and not-so-little white lies.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I need an escape from the demands, the puck bunnies, and the notoriety that come with being an NHL team captain. I just want to be a normal guy for a few weeks. So when I leave Chicago for some peace and quiet, the last thing I expect is for a gorgeous woman to literally fall into my lap on a flight to Alaska. Even better, she has absolutely no idea who I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lainey is the perfect escape from my life. My plan for seclusion becomes a monthlong sex fest punctuated with domestic bliss. But it ends just as abruptly as it began. When I’m called away on a family emergency, I realize too late that I have no way to contact Lainey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, a chance encounter throws Lainey and me together again. But I still have a lie hanging over my head, and Lainey’s keeping secrets of her own. With more than lust at stake, the truth may be our game changer.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There’s a fine line between I hate you and I want you.&lt;br /&gt;Once you cross it, there’s no going back.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blaze Townsend: &lt;b&gt;I hate you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charisma Rossi: &lt;b&gt;I hate you more.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s been expecting this ever since their latest showdown. She had good reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hottest guy she’s ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;Former fling.&lt;br /&gt;Dumped her in front of all her friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;At her own party.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So no, she’s not about to forgive and forget just because he sits next to her in class. He thinks all he has to do is turn on those baby blues, and she’ll melt right back into his arms. &lt;i&gt;Please.&lt;/i&gt; She’d be crazy to let this cocky player affect her again.

There’s absolutely no way he can have the girl &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the game. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why can’t he stop trying to win her back?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can this wide receiver score the girl or will he make the biggest fumble of his life?</description>

It’s enemies-to-lovers, although the extent of the “enemies” part can be debated. There’s also a healthy balance of angst and humor to go along with the romance. And don’t f...]]>

  <description>What do you do when you’re the reigning kissing booth champion but the only person you want to kiss is your best friend’s brother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me make this clear right here, right now: I, Halley Dawson, do not care that Preston Wright is kissing other women. &lt;br /&gt;Not a lick. Not at all. Nuh-uh-freakin’-uh.&lt;br /&gt;I do care that he’s doing it six feet away from me behind a gaudy velvet curtain—making him my competition in this year’s kissing contest.&lt;br /&gt;Why do I care, you ask? Because I’ve had an unfortunate crush on the insufferable idiot since I was sixteen years old, but I also know it’s never going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;He’s the Creek Falls bachelor to die for, and I’m the Creek Falls racoon lady who puts peanut butter sandwiches out for them every night.&lt;br /&gt;I’m not going to let him break my four-year-long reign—no matter how many times he breaks the rules and slides the curtain across to do the one thing he’s not allowed to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiss me.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A new standalone, laugh-out-loud romantic comedy by New York Times bestselling author Helena Hunting.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cosy Felton is great at her job—she knows just how to handle the awkwardness that comes with working at an adult toy store. So when the hottest guy she’s ever seen walks into the shop looking completely overwhelmed, she’s more than happy to turn on the charm and help him purchase all of the items on his list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Griffin Mills is using his business trip in Las Vegas as a chance to escape the broken pieces of his life in New York City. The last thing he wants is to be put in charge of buying gag gifts for his friend’s bachelor party. Despite being totally out of his element, and mortified by the whole experience, Griffin is pleasantly surprised when he finds himself attracted to the sales girl that helped him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As skeptical as Cosy may be of Griffin’s motivations, there’s something about him that intrigues her. But sometimes what happens in Vegas doesn’t always stay in Vegas and when real life gets in the way, all bets are off. Filled with hilariously awkward situations and enough sexual chemistry to power Sin City, Making Up is the next standalone in the Shacking Up world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My will to live is weak.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By all accounts, I should be dead, but somehow I made it through. Broken, battered, and barely hanging on, I’m forced to rely on the man who destroyed me. Recovery is a long road, and I’m not sure I can take it by his side, so I punish him, refusing to grant forgiveness.&lt;br /&gt;But it’s still there—the spark. That incessant pull that I can’t escape.&lt;br /&gt;The deepest scars of our hearts spill out. All the secrets we kept locked away are laid bare.&lt;br /&gt;Everything is different. Time is running out.&lt;br /&gt;All the infractions are catching up to us.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; His body was sin, his cock was sin, and I was a sinner. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep myself safe I hide in the world and let life move around me.&lt;br /&gt;My new partner, Nathan, isn’t safe. Far from it.&lt;br /&gt;The darkness coils around him, hidden by a shield created by a blinding smile. But those who live in darkness see past the façade we create.&lt;br /&gt;Even in darkness, there is light. A spark that ignites, then explodes.&lt;br /&gt;Every filthy word from his mouth, every possessive touch—I crave them, need them. Violent and passionate and everything I need to fill the void inside me, but one thing is missing.&lt;br /&gt;He can never love me.&lt;br /&gt;More than my heart is on the line, and I don’t know if I’ll survive our breach.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He’s everything she &lt;i&gt;doesn’t&lt;/i&gt; want. But he might be exactly what she needs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evie Hart has no time for romance. She’s poised to take over her father’s billion-dollar business, and a new development in a small northwest town could be just the ticket to get her dad to hand over the reins. When local protests put a hitch in her plans, Evie heads to Holiday Junction to take down the lawyer standing in her way. . . and the infuriating jerk causes her nothing but trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liam Durant only wants to protect his hometown, and his broken heart. Dumped by his childhood sweetheart, he swears off women altogether, and uses work to fill the void. Hired to fight the builder of a planned luxury development, Liam immediately butts heads with the company’s pushy vice president. She’s a pain the neck, so why can’t he get her out of his mind?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re on opposite sides of the fight, but the more time Liam and Evie spend together, the harder it gets to deny a growing attraction. When they finally put aside their battle of wills, can they drop the walls around their hearts and take a chance on love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Holiday Junction, the town that takes it holidays seriously, and the perfect place to fall in love… any day of the year.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>I never expected to be locked out of my room basically naked in a total blackout. Thinking that would be the biggest shock of my night was my first mistake. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With my friends nowhere in sight, I’m thankful when Jason, the mysterious guy who flirts from across the hall, shows up and comes to my rescue. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After I borrow his clothes, I let this man be my protector when mayhem ensues. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As he takes me under his wing how could I not fall for this handsome Clark Kent lookalike? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But just like the lights suddenly going out, our night ends just as fast, leaving me more lost than when it went dark.</description>

If only she could stand the sight of him.</description>

  <description>Anda Weiss knows that going on a reality show to find love is, well, desperate. But after years of putting her love life second to her career, that’s how low she’s willing to stoop. Miraculously, the hot guy starring in Man Of Her Dreams is nice. Surprisingly normal. Altogether terrific. And Chance DiMarco kisses so well she forgets cameras are taping every second. Until she spends a red hot night with him, only to have all of America watch him kick her off the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven months later, Anda decides that a mind-blowing one-night stand is the only way to move past her humiliation. But the man she hits on at a Vegas resort is far from a stranger. Anda seizes her chance to get payback on Chance. At least, that’s her plan... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But does she have it in her to use Chance for a few more nights of great sex and then turn the tables and dump him? Is that revenge worth undoing all her healing? Will Anda leave with the satisfaction of another steamy hook-up with Chance? Or could her epic humiliation actually end up bringing her to the man of her dreams?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;With a name like Vegas Manilow, it was inevitable I would find my way back to the City of Sin, where I was born to Lola, she was a showgirl with yellow feathers in her hair . . . okay, she was a stripper. Cliché, right? Tell me about it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to do something more, be more . . . I wind up the last place I expected-a one-stop wedding chapel. Cue the Elvis and grab the feathers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of a tacky wedding parlor or Vegas side show, what I find is a family, a place where I belong. So, when a smooth-talking suit shows up and threatens to take it all away, I'm determined to send him back where he came from Vegas style . . . literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn't count on was sharing the honeymoon suite with him. Talk about sleeping with the enemy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens when the lights go out?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just found out . . . and it changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;*A sizzling story about a sassy woman trying to make her way in Sin City, and the sexy businessman that stands in her way. A one-stop wedding chapel and a line-up of secondary characters so zany and unique, you'll want to book a room at the Honeymoon Hideaway and never leave!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>One explosive weekend together nearly ruined them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, a year later, Simone had perfected the art of keeping Micah at arms length. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Micah wants to explain, but the wall Simone has erected is impossible to get around, until a city wide blackout gives him the opportunity he needs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There's no way Simone and Micah can ignore their chemistry when they're alone in the dark, but will she still want him when the lights come on?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Note to self:&lt;/b&gt; Never agree to play an innocent dice game during a blackout in Vegas. I should have known it wouldn't remain innocent. Not in the city of sin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you really blame me, though? Here I am, stuck in my least favorite city in the world, after having to suffer through the bachelorette party from hell, playing Never Have I Ever with one of the most attractive men I've seen in recent history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I've seen my fair share of men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;But Lincoln's different.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is he different enough for me to bend the rules I put into place years ago? Or will our bubble burst the second the lights come back on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's only one way to find out. &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Let the games begin... &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He’d be a fool to fall for his long-legged, barefoot employee. But bad decisions have never stopped him before…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Successful businessman and single father, Nate Crawford, doesn’t need any more complications. That’s why he’s moved his business – and his life – to a small beach town. He’s expecting sun, sea and tranquility, but what he gets is a whirlwind in the form of town sweetheart, Ally Sutton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ally’s used to dealing with heartache. But losing the café she’s owned for years is the final straw. Being offered a new job feels like a lifeline – that is until she meets her much-older, and impossibly handsome new boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the space of a few weeks everything changes. And when an accident forces them closer, Nate and Ally can’t ignore the fascination between them any longer. As the summer heats up, the question is when, not if, they’ll give in to their explosive attraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**She’s Like the Wind is the second book in the Angel Sands series, set in a small beach town on the California coast. If you like a heartwarming read that’s low on angst and big on feels, this stand-alone romance is for you.**</description>

  <description>Everyone has a best friend. Mine just happens to be Dr. Christian Gallagher— the gorgeous, green-eyed heart surgeon who wants to have a baby with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you read that correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my mother approached me on my thirty-third birthday with a brochure for egg freezing, it was a glaring reminder that my biological clock is ticking toward its expiration date. I’ve always dreamed of being a mom and had a plan — one that was destroyed when I caught my professional hockey player husband in bed with another woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my broken heart I still believe in love. I want the happily ever after, but I also want a child desperately and won't settle in order to make it happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s why when I decided to take my mother’s advice, Christian came up with his own plan: Let’s have a baby together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a bad idea. A really, really bad idea. And yet...I can’t stop thinking about how great it could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s just one condition. Before we have sex (oh, yes, we’re doing this the old fashioned way!) Christian is adamant we go on three dates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds easy, but it's not.I thought sex would be the hard part, but the dates are only making me fall for the man I’ve known almost my entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whoever said sex doesn't change things never went to bed with their best friend.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I always enjoy Jeannine Colette’s writing, but I was a bit hesitant if I’d like this story given its subject. I needn’t have worried. While Meadow’s journey toward motherhood is an important part of the story, so is the best-friend-to-lovers arc. And that is a prompt I highly enjoy.<br /><br />Be...]]>

  <description>What happens when the lights go out in the city that never sleeps?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Games of chance, unexpected situations, and hours of sin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen bestselling and award-winning authors are turning up the heat in an anthology featuring brand-new show-stopping stories set in Las Vegas. Roll the dice and get ready to feel the heat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night Games by T.K. Leigh: &lt;br /&gt;Note to self: Never agree to play an innocent dice game during a blackout in Vegas. I should have known it wouldn’t remain innocent, not in the city of sin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night &amp;amp; Day by Bethany Lopez: &lt;br /&gt;One explosive weekend together nearly ruined them. But, there's no way Simone and Micah can ignore their chemistry when they're alone in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Close Encounter by Stephanie St. Klaire:&lt;br /&gt;The day started with a quick screw, a couple of quirky two-bit cons and ended with a diabolical serial killer. What do you do when the lights go out? Run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely Mine by Terri E. Laine: &lt;br /&gt;I made a promise to stay away from my best friend’s little sister. But it’s Vegas and that’s one promise I’m probably going to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honeymoon Hideaway by Cary Hart: &lt;br /&gt;What’s worse than being locked in a room with a vibrating bed and your sworn enemy? Waking up next to him… naked! Did I mention he’s also my boss? Oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Do-Over by Christi Barth: &lt;br /&gt;The best way to move on after being dumped? A hot fling. An even better way? Revenge sex and the chance to turn the tables on the guy who dumped you... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just Us by J.H. Croix:&lt;br /&gt;Ellie asks me to promise her one thing. We can’t tell her brother about us. Small problem though. One night will never be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dirty Thoughts by C.A. Harms: &lt;br /&gt;He was the crush I never thought I’d see again. Yet here we were in Vegas, during a total blackout. I figure why not explore all the possibilities, or more like let him explore me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard Luck by K.A. Ware: &lt;br /&gt;Ellis James is my kryptonite, the only person who could drag me back to Vegas after I promised myself I was done with that life. I'd bleed for her, I'd die for her, but can I save her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Becoming His by K.I. Lynn: &lt;br /&gt;When I slammed into Hollywood heartthrob Reid Gallagher, I never imagined it would turn into a first date I’d never forget. After all, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas...right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going Down by Lisa Shelby: &lt;br /&gt;She’s the only person I’ve ever loved and I’m the last person she wants to see. She’d hoped to avoid me as much as possible in Vegas, but when we get stuck alone in an elevator, not even she can deny that our chemistry still runs hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blind Faith by Lauren Runow:&lt;br /&gt;I never expected to be locked out of my room basically naked in a total blackout. Thinking that would be the biggest shock of my night was my first mistake.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Forget the rules.&lt;br /&gt;Forget right or wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Forget letting go.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Roman Gregory's daughter caught him and Mila Lawson together in Santa Cruz, he swore he would face whatever he had to face to keep Mila by his side and win back his daughter. But now Talia isn't speaking to either of them, and their relationship has gotten a whole lot more complicated thanks to the violent gang gunning for the ATF agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mila knows nothing good comes easy, but she never imagined being the reason Talia stopped speaking to her father. All she wants to do is fix what she broke before the man she loves loses his daughter for good…even if that means she has to break her own heart to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Roman, bringing Mila to Los Angeles with a gang war looming on the horizon is the most terrifying thing he's ever done. But now that he's fallen in love with the gorgeous blonde, he can't let her go. He will do whatever it takes to keep her safe and regain his daughter's trust…even if he has to walk away from his career to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But neither Roman nor Mila could have foreseen the news that will change their lives forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his worst fear becomes a reality and Mila is targeted, more than just their hearts are on the line. To save Mila's life and guarantee a future with her, Roman will do more than break the rules. He'll rewrite the rule book entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing will stand in his way. Not even the law itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Defend Me&lt;/i&gt; is the third part of Mila and Roman's steamy story.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description> 
  &lt;strong&gt;Two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;No strings attached.&lt;br /&gt;No messy emotions.&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Those were the terms Mila Lawson offered Roman Gregory when they found themselves living together in Santa Cruz. Now that the ATF agent has his daughter's twenty-two year old best friend in his bed every night, he's finding it more and more difficult to deny what he's felt for her since the day they met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a drug cartel threatening to go to war and his daughter becoming increasingly suspicious, the last thing Roman should be thinking about is keeping Mila by his side. He's never wanted much, but he wants her…and he's willing to break more than a few of his own rules to convince the feisty little blonde to put her heart in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Mila, falling for Roman might just be the most terrifying thing she's ever done. Trusting him with her body is one thing, but with her past still hanging over her, she knows all too well that the scary-hot man who drives her wild has the power to destroy her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As their time in Santa Cruz draws to a close and the world beyond their little stretch of beach closes in on them, Roman and Mila will be forced to confront the truth about their relationship and make decisions neither could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;But who ever said falling in love would be easy?&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destroy Me&lt;/em&gt; is the second of three steamy novellas featuring Mila and Roman.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;In DEVOUR ME, bestselling author Ayden K. Morgen's new forbidden romance, single father Roman Gregory learns that rules were meant for breaking…&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Don't get caught.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Never fall in love.&lt;/strong&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;And steer clear of his daughter's friends.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rules were easy enough for Roman Gregory...until Mila Lawson set out to break every single one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the twenty-two year old lands on the ATF agent's doorstep after a nasty breakup, he knows all too well that she's off-limits. At thirty-eight, he's almost twice her age, she's hurting, and the blonde bombshell is his daughter's best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mila knows all about wanting what she can't have. For four years, she's lusted after Talia McPherson's scary hot, terminally single father from afar. After walking away from her cheating ex and what she thought was her happily-ever-after, the last thing on her mind is jumping into a new relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Until she find herself living with Roman in Santa Cruz...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now all she can think about is making all those dirty fantasies come to life. With nothing left to lose, she makes him an offer he can't refuse: Two weeks of no-holds-barred sex. No strings. No commitments. No messy emotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roman has no business agreeing to her insane proposition, but he does anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He can't have her. He shouldn't even want her. But he's going to take her… and he has no intentions of stopping until she's his completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;If there's one thing Roman knows for a fact, it's that he doesn't lose. Ever.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;DEVOUR ME is the first of three steamy novellas featuring Mila and Roman.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>Top Tip: Don’t put out an online ad offering your services as a fake date. Someone will take you up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it won’t just be for one night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how I ended up being Mason Jackson’s fake girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He didn’t even want me to be. No—his sister was solely responsible for me being his date for his ten-year high school reunion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, she’s responsible for telling his parents our relationship is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have no choice. We have to act like this isn’t all a mistake, like it’s not all fake, like we’re totally, completely, utterly, head-over-heels in love with each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.</description>

  <description>He doesn’t believe in luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t believe in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can they believe in each other?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lena McKenna has never been lucky in love. After a string of bad relationships, she’s sworn off men, unwilling to give up the control over her life that she fought so hard to regain. When the new Chief of Police blows into town, his teasing smile and easy charm may work on everyone else, but Lena’s not interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gage Turner left the pressures of being a big city cop behind, in search of peace and quiet in Holiday Junction. But Lena challenges him at every turn, flaunting the rules and generally driving him crazy. She’s exactly what he doesn’t need . . . so why can’t he stop thinking about her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teamed up for the St. Patrick’s Day Treasure Hunt, Gage and Lena must put their differences aside to have any hope of winning the pot of gold. But an even bigger prize is waiting, if they’re both willing to take a chance and grab it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With an open heart, and a bit of luck, they could find love at the end of the rainbow.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Wanted: one hot guy with rock-hard abs and a big stick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Broke and desperate, Sugar Ryan has no use for arrogant, bad boy athletes . . . until she’s forced to bargain with the cockiest of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only he knew she was alive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her mission? Get on this hockey player’s radar any way possible.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zack Morgan is the king of the ice and the bedroom—but nothing prepares him for the mystery girl who shows up everywhere he does—frat parties, his favorite bar, and finally his front door with an offer he can’t refuse. The only rule in her boyfriend bargain: &lt;b&gt;no falling in love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after one (um, two) smoking-hot hookups, he’s done with pretending and vows to make their fake relationship real. Too bad she can’t trust a player with a reputation for breaking hearts.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will this hockey star score his forever girl or will their Boyfriend Bargain end in heartbreak? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A standalone hockey romance.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Last Wingman&lt;/i&gt; is a standalone enemies to lovers romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonah Kingston is the last wingman standing.&lt;br /&gt;June Moxee doesn't care if he's the last man on earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't exactly avoided relationships, but love has never been a priority. Solitude doesn't bother me and being alone doesn't mean being lonely. Until she moved to the island and I had to reconsider everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June seems content running her yarn shop, knitting with the local church ladies, and avoiding me. She's a temptress in a hand-knit sweater. And for some reason, she's not a fan of mine. It might be the tattoos. Or the beard. Or the fact that we're polar opposites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman has finally caught my attention. Too bad she thinks she hates me. Good thing I'm stubborn enough to try to change her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Last Wingman&lt;/i&gt; is a standalone, small town rom com in the &lt;i&gt;Wingmen&lt;/i&gt; series. You do not have to read the previous books first to enjoy this book.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book ends at 91%. There are two bonus chapters included from previous&lt;/i&gt; Wingmen &lt;i&gt;books.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A brand new best-friends-to-lovers romcom from Emma Hart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let your homeless best friend stay with you, he said. Being roommates will be fun, he said. It's only temporary, he said.&lt;br /&gt;He never said I'd fall for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know what isn't 'temporary?' The endless stream of dirty socks in my bathroom and empty food packets under the sofa—and don't even get me started on the hot guys who take over my living room every Sunday to watch sports.&lt;br /&gt;I can't take anymore. &lt;br /&gt;So I propose a roommate agreement. One that will bring peace and order back to my life, complete with rules that might just stop my newfound crush on my best friend in its tracks.&lt;br /&gt;After all, there’s only so many times you can see your best friend naked before you start to lose your mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rules. They're meant to be broken... Aren't they?</description>

  <description>The narrative drive of Stowe's classic novel is often overlooked in the heat of the controversies surrounding its anti-slavery sentiments. In fact, it is a compelling adventure story with richly drawn characters and has earned a place in both literary and American history. Stowe's puritanical religious beliefs show up in the novel's final, overarching theme—the exploration of the nature of Christianity and how Christian theology is fundamentally incompatible with slavery.</description>

  <description>Winter Nobleman is complicated. &lt;i&gt;To say the least&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was supposed to be simple. Go to Paris, find a client’s daughter, and close a multi-million-dollar deal. &lt;i&gt;Easy. &lt;/i&gt;Then I meet her. Stormy blue eyes, quick wit, and the secrets she keeps on the tip of her tongue make me forget my mission for a moment, or six, and why I’m in Paris in the first place—&lt;i&gt;to bring her home&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distracted by her beauty, I fail to notice the others lurking with missions of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bennett Everest is the twist I never saw coming. &lt;i&gt;Talk about perfect timing&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He steals my breath the first time I see him and breathes hope back into my heart. He’s a giant in my eyes, a king among men with patience and love to share in spades. Six foot three. Whiskey-colored eyes. Solid gold on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the dirty deeds of my past, he sees the person I am meant to be and not the person I have become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the lies don’t kill us, will the truth set us free?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Courtney Jane Salinger...&lt;br /&gt;and I'm sick of games.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sick of the Friday night bar-scene-cum-meat-market. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sick of the boy-girl, man-woman, mars-venus, flirtation-without-expectation, game-playing nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sick of awful dates and one-night stands, booty calls and guys who don’t call back, mixed messages or NO messages and—and—and...I'm sick of all of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m done.&lt;br /&gt;I just can't do it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It's too hard, and worse: little by little, it's making &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; hard.&lt;br /&gt;It's breaking my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; I want?&lt;br /&gt;That's easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want a house in suburbia with a white picket fence.&lt;br /&gt;I want babies to buckle into a minivan.&lt;br /&gt;But most of all, I want to be married.&lt;br /&gt;I want a husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I've made an important decision: I'm making my escape from the dating world and the single life.&lt;br /&gt;I've filled out my application on ArrangeMe.com and I'm putting my fate into the hands of experts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a little scary?&lt;br /&gt;Sure.&lt;br /&gt;I mean, I have no idea who I'll end up with. &lt;br /&gt;After all, I'm planning to marry a complete stranger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But between you and me?&lt;br /&gt;I can't wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being arranged can't possibly be worse than being single.&lt;br /&gt;Can it?</description>

  <description>“A kiss was all I needed.” &lt;br /&gt;“Looks like you got what you wished for.”&lt;br /&gt;“Yes. About that…”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was supposed to find a finely dressed businessman, have a one-night stand and forget about my failed relationship. Instead, I meet Tanner Sexton—a gorgeous man in street clothes, messy hair and the sexiest smile I’ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When my ex shows up at the bar, Tanner notices my panic and kisses me just so the prick can see. Then he takes off, leaving me breathless.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, I do what any rational person would. I chase after him onto the subway, and embark on a wild night in New York City with a complete stranger. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No matter how much I fight it, this mysterious artist painted his soul onto my skin, and I haven’t been able to forget him. Our romance is one for the ages, but age isn’t the only thing standing in our way.</description>

  <description>In a world plagued by constant earthquakes and volcanic debris, people in the valley struggle to survive while those on top of the hill want for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where I come in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend my nights plundering supplies in the walled city of Hilltop, and I trade them to the valley people below. I’m not a thief. I prefer to be known as the head of Lost and Found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I discover a beautiful but dangerous competitor in my territory, I also learn she knows more about me than she should. Is she a spy sent by my father, or is she a rebel like me? I don’t trust her, but together we’ll discover secrets that may destroy what’s left of our world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have always been those with wealth and those without. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Talen, and I’m here to even the score.</description>

  <description>HE WANTS TO LOSE CONTROL.&lt;br /&gt;Between his parents’ messed up marriage and his narcissistic younger brother, Lincoln Moorehead has spent the majority of his life avoiding his family. After the death of his father, Lincoln finds himself in the middle of the drama. To top it all off, he’s been named CEO of Moorehead Media, much to his brother’s chagrin. But Lincoln’s bad attitude softens when he meets the no-nonsense, gorgeous woman who has been given the task of transforming him from the gruff, wilderness guy to a suave businessman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHE’S TRYING TO HOLD IT TOGETHER.&lt;br /&gt;Wren Sterling has been working double time to keep the indiscretions at Moorehead Media at bay, so when she’s presented with a new contract, with new responsibilities and additional incentives, she agrees. Working with the reclusive oldest son of a ridiculously entitled family is worth the hassle if it means she’s that much closer to pursuing her own dreams. What Wren doesn’t expect is to find herself attracted to him, or for it to be mutual. And she certainly doesn’t expect to fall for Lincoln. But when a shocking new Moorehead scandal comes to light, she’s forced to choose between her own family and the broody, cynical CEO.</description>

  <description>One teen assassin-in-training must unite three warring supernatural dynasties before death comes to them all…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find out why USA Today calls The Sparks “a crackling read” that “builds a vivid world (both) otherworldly and relatable.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neil Vapros just wants to make his father proud. The sixteen-year-old aspires to serve his family as an assassin, but he nearly dies in the process. As if that wasn’t bad enough, Neil’s family, as well as two rival dynasties, have abandoned an ancient promise to protect their city. An unknown evil has begun hunting all three houses from the shadows…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Neil’s relatives fall one-by-one, he attempts to unite the three supernatural families against a common enemy. But earning trust after years of assassination attempts could prove impossible. Neil’s fight may involve more than a bloodthirsty empire, as betrayal rears its ugly head… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sparks is the first book in the award-winning Epic Feud trilogy of young adult fantasy novels. If you like captivating characters, inventive world building, and supernatural battles, then you’ll love Kyle Prue’s action-packed coming-of-age tale. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy The Sparks today to ignite your thirst for adventure!</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;She isn’t looking for love. He’s not planning on staying around. But when they meet, sparks fly…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a big city firefighter, Lucas lives for his job. Forced to take extended leave following an accident, he returns to his small hometown to stay at the beach cottage his grandparents left him. The problem is, he’s not used to having so much time on his hands. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a broken engagement, Ember isn’t ready for love right now. Though her heart might be mended, she prefers to keep herself busy with her family and work; that way she won’t get hurt again. But she didn’t count on meeting a handsome firefighter with that dimpled smile. After Lucas saves her from one awkward situation too many, she can’t stop thinking about him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ember finds Lucas impossible to resist. And he’s determined not to let her. As long summer days melt into sultry, passionate nights what begins as a fling develops into something much deeper. Until the day Ember’s ex-fiancé returns to town and threatens to destroy the fragile connection that’s building between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sign up for more info here ➜ &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.subscribepage.com/LetMeBurn" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.subscribepage.com/LetMeBurn&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Don’t hate the player…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Achieve lifelong dream of becoming a reporter? &lt;em&gt;Check.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Land dream job working with her idol at the &lt;em&gt;Brooklyn Daily Post&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;em&gt;Check.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Navigate working across the street from her college nemesis?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, yes, hate the player.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Jessica Romano doesn’t have time to be bothered by the likes of Alex Drake. She’s struck up a fiery online flirtation with a mystery man and—thanks to Alex’s family’s gossip website, competitor Click News—she also has a newspaper to save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she is bothered by Alex. She’s bothered by the fact that Click News keeps scooping the &lt;em&gt;Daily Post&lt;/em&gt;’s stories. And by how Alex &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; gets what he wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And she’s really bothered by how she can’t seem to stop staring at his stupid, sexy face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or how their competitive banter is starting to sound like familiar foreplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly Jess isn’t just bothered by Alex; she’s hot and bothered. Hot sex and swoony romance are &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; enough to make her forget the vast divide between old media and new…and the Romanos from Brooklyn and the Drakes of Manhattan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is approximately 87,000 words</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;As a consuming darkness threatens the world, The Order prepares for the fight of their lives…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dylan Kennedy shows up on Chloe Blake’s doorstep with no memory of how he got there, he quickly learns the weirdness in his life is just beginning. Dylan opens the old wooden chest in Chloe’s attic and, with a flash of blinding light, he’s gifted with a strange and awesome power, and a duty to protect humanity as part of The Order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chloe knows the darkness is coming. It feeds on pain, thrives on chaos, and it’s getting stronger every day. Her mystical visions show her a battle on the horizon, that the darkness will destroy everything if they can’t defeat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Order is ready to fight. But if Chloe’s visions are right, they might not all emerge from the battle unscathed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or even alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Super Natural&lt;/i&gt; is the third book in The New Super Humans, a contemporary fantasy series with a new kind of superhero. If you like incredible abilities, dark and scary villains, and super-powered fight scenes, then you’ll love T.M. Franklin’s edge-of-your-seat story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy &lt;i&gt;Super Natural&lt;i&gt; today, and see who wins the epic battle between good and evil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;NOTE: Portions of this book were previously published in The Talisman Chronicles. It has been re-written with substantial additional content. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He’s powerful.&lt;br /&gt;She’s invisible.&lt;br /&gt;But that doesn’t make it any easier to save the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beck Leighton’s generally got three things on his mind: Classes, swim team, and finding a way to get his younger sister away from their drunken, abusive mother. Then Wren Galloway stumbles into his life and vanishes—literally—before his very eyes. And his life will never be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ancient journal tells of a secret group called The Order—powerful warriors of legend who’ve protected humanity throughout history. It’s a fantastical story, a tall tale handed down through the generations, but Beck and Wren quickly learn there’s more to the myth than meets the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Order is real. And they’re destined to be a part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Super Powers&lt;/i&gt; is the second book in The New Super Humans, a thrilling contemporary fantasy series. If you like awesome powers, chilling villains, and heroes coming together to save the day, you’ll love T.M. Franklin’s exciting second installment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy &lt;i&gt;Super Powers&lt;/i&gt; to continue the exhilarating adventure today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;NOTE: Portions of this book were previously published in The Talisman Chronicles. It has been re-written with substantial additional content. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>As an award-winning songwriter, Melody Mitchell has no time for distractions--and no time for romance. But when a sudden death in the family calls her back to the hometown she left behind, she’ll find herself questioning the many sacrifices she’s made on the path to success--especially when she learns she’s been named the guardian of a newly orphaned infant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite a fulfilling life, small-town pediatrician Dr. Brody Myers still can’t forget the girl who broke his heart so long ago. She's even harder to forget when a family emergency brings them face-to-face after more than a decade apart. It only takes a moment for him to realize that nothing has changed--especially not the promise he made to love Melody Mitchell for the rest of his days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Melody put her life on hold for another chance at finding her happily ever after? Or is Brody destined to have his heart broken all over again? Fans of second chance romance will savor this sweet tale of unexpected motherhood and everlasting love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About The No Brides Club Series:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six no marriage vows. Six Mr. Rights. Will a group of strong, independent women break their pledge to one another and choose love over a career? Each book stands completely on its own, but you'll have more fun if you read them all together!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Business is king, and I have an empire to topple. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivy is my new assistant and a threat to me. She’s my undoing. If ever I was to believe in a cosmic connection, it was the moment I met her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I’ve had one goal--revenge. As CEO, I have crafted a strategic plan for business, but never a life beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With one touch from her, the veil is lifted. Things are different, and every moment I’m near her, my world begins to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wall of propriety keeps me from her. I need her as my pawn in this war, beside me in battle. Sharing the secrets of my enemies, and her desires in my bed. Her body to claim as mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting what I want has consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collateral damage is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the game of crushing kings of men, I never planned on my heart being a sacrifice</description>

  <description>It took only four months to bring the angels to their knees… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With a virus ravaging the fallen angels on earth, mankind’s symbol of love and hope is at risk of extinction. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Centuries ago, a group of angelic warriors known as The Fallen risked everything to save themselves and carve a future for their kind. Hope slips away as The Fallen and their kin are cut down by an ancient menace, La Morte Nera—and no one saw it coming. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only one immortal can save them, and only one mortal can stand in his way… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Nephilim warrior Killian St. James sets out on a quest to find a cure, he and his blade-brothers discover nineteen-year-old Aubrey Carter—a human with a past as dark as it is mysterious—cowering in an abandoned house in the heart of Memphis, Tennessee. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The corrupted races are chasing her, and Killian is determined to find out why… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But neither he nor Aubrey are prepared for their attraction to one another, or for the frightening truths lurking in the shadows. The painful childhood memories Aubrey has buried hold precious answers. Answers that threaten to tear Killian's world apart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With her life hanging in the balance, Killian must choose between the future of The Fallen, and the human girl he's pledged to protect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Demons are rising, and this time they plan to win the war for dominion once and for all.</description>

Since his return, he’s made it his mission to be the best husband and father he can possibly be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the holiday season approaches, Carter‘s children face a crisis of faith, and it could be that only another miracle can save the day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoyed &lt;i&gt;Second Chances&lt;/i&gt;, you’ll love this peek into Carter and Kenzie’s happily ever after. &lt;i&gt;Visions of Sugar Plums&lt;/i&gt; will take you on a magical journey where anything is possible . . . and Christmas wishes can come true, if you only believe.</description>

  <description>Formerly published in the Romantic Interludes anthology. Now available for the first time as a stand-alone short story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily Valentine is a matchmaker who doesn’t believe in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, at least not the hearts and flowers, see-your-soulmate-across-a-crowded-room-and-the-world-stands-still kind of love. No, Emily is a pragmatist – a scientist – and she’s abandoned her family’s tradition of matchmaking based on instinct and uncanny intuition for a more scientific approach to pairing people up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily believes love is more about compatibility and common interests than anything mystical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a run-of-the-mill job turns her world on end when swoony cake designer Sam Cavanaugh pops up as a potential match for her newest client. The attraction she feels for him throws a wrench in her plans, but she’s not going to succumb without a fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily is nothing if not practical. And reasonable. But she’s about to learn that sometimes the best things in life…are neither.</description>

  <description>“Truth or dare?”&lt;br /&gt;“I’ll take your dare.”&lt;br /&gt;“Kiss me.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don’t believe in Prince Charming, but when I met a handsome stranger on a rooftop his words intrigued me and his dares left nothing but temptation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then I learned the truth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His name is Bryce Sexton. Media mogul, workaholic and a heart of stone. He’s broody AF and yet every woman in San Francisco wants him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So why won’t he leave me alone? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wherever I go, he’s there, trying to force his way into my world. What he doesn’t know is I already have a man in my life. A tiny redhead who loves Legos and Superheroes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With every push, Bryce pulls me in further. Our pasts are laced with betrayal. Our futures are unpredictable. Our chemistry is explosive.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With each dare I uncover a truth, but he's exactly what I don’t need right now.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So why did I have to go and kiss him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The Sexton Brothers novels are stand-alone books that can be read in any order.</description>

  <description>~~~Being Bad Never Felt So Good~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being bad never felt so good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell for Ally the moment I saw her. Who doesn’t like a confident, intelligent woman with curves I could spend days exploring?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who am I kidding? &lt;br /&gt;I have. &lt;br /&gt;Many times. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our story ended abruptly when she packed her bags and left like we weren’t meant to be. We are. So I’m calling her bluff. That’s how I ended up thousands of miles from home, standing next to a man who claims to be her fiancé. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being good has never felt so bad. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to a successful man with an incredible body and biteable jaw aka Hutton . . . let’s just say willpower is not my strong suit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need more? &lt;br /&gt;Try bad-boy American. &lt;br /&gt;You’re welcome. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Embracing my newfound good girl status, I do the right thing to start my reign. My desires no longer matter. The monarchy, the people, and my country do. There is no place for love in this new life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I never expected to see him again, much less standing next to my royally appointed soon-to-be fiancé. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if that didn’t complicate things, he’s wearing a perfectly tailored tuxedo and my favorite smirk. I straighten my crown and adjust my dress, realizing this good girl never stood a chance. I’ll take the bad reputation if I get him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Being Bad Never Felt So Good~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad Reputation will release December 7th.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;What's a girl to do when a man who's countless shades of wrong feels oh-so-right?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ambitious book editor Asha Tate is a hopeless romantic. Despite her mediocre track record with men, she believes in swooning, sighing, and the everlasting love of true soul mates. Sure, sex is okay, but she’s not someone who’s ever been driven by her animal urges. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Asha stumbles upon the scorching hot Instagram feed of someone calling himself Professor Feelgood, she falls in lust for the first time. Not only is she left panting over the professor’s insane body, but his angst-filled poetry about losing his one true love speaks straight to her soul.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperately in need of a bestseller for her struggling publishing company, Asha knows the professor’s potential to sell to his millions of loyal followers could be the lifeline her bosses need. However, the ink is barely dry on a book deal before she realizes she’s made a terrible mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In real life, the man behind the persona is intense and infuriating, and sparks fly between the pair when ghosts from their shared past take them down paths that have previously been ripped up and paved over.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asha tells herself she doesn't want him. She swears up and down that she doesn't need him. And when their connection gets too powerful to ignore, she tries to convince herself she doesn’t love him. But repeating lies, even those you truly want to believe, will never make them true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A compelling tale of love, hate, and reluctant soul mates, from the international bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bad Romeo&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;Broken Juliet.</description>

  <description>“Tell me a secret.”&lt;br /&gt;“I’m falling for you.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Austin Sexton is the man I’ve always tried to stay away from. He’s arrogant, entitled and a total ass. That’s why I didn’t bother giving him my name last night. We’ll never see each other again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my surprise when I start my new job only to come face-to-face with the blue eyes I just declared all wrong for me. No, he’s not my boss, but being my boss’ brother seems almost worse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how hard I try to push him away, his secrets draw me in. When it comes to a Sexton that could be lethal...for my heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have his secrets and I won’t tell a soul. Now I just have to not fall for him completely.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A mysterious chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A terrifying vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are their newfound powers enough to take down an unspeakable evil?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chloe Blake’s campus rental has it all: a retro Victorian vibe, a beautiful picture window, and a perfect view of Ethan Reynolds—the guy who broke her heart and lives across the street. But when she sees disturbing visions of death slide across the panes, she’s convinced she’s glimpsed into Ethan’s future. She’ll stop at nothing to change fate and save him… even if it means everyone will think she’s crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wren Galloway has lost track of all the crummy cities she’s lived in. Plagued by nightmares, Wren wakes in a cold sweat with the vision of a nearby Victorian house still in her mind… and a strong urge to seek out the powerful talisman calling to her from its attic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawn together by an ancient force, Chloe and Wren must work together to discover the house’s secrets and unlock their hidden powers to take down the shadowy specter that haunts their premonitions and leaves death in its wake. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Super Humans&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in &lt;i&gt;The New Super Humans&lt;/i&gt;, an edge-of-your-seat contemporary fantasy series. If you like original magic systems, startling suspense, and fast-paced action, then you’ll love TM Franklin’s riveting thrill ride. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Buy &lt;i&gt;Super Humans&lt;/i&gt; to unlock an imaginative fantasy adventure today!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;NOTE: Portions of this book were previously published in WINDOW and The Talisman Chronicles. It has been re-written with substantial additional content. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>As sisters they share an everlasting bond; As queens they can break each other’s hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“There is only one bond that I trust: between a woman and her sisters. We never take our eyes off each other. In love and in rivalry, we always think of each other.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Katherine of Aragón is brought to the Tudor court as a young bride, the oldest princess, Margaret, takes her measure. With one look, each knows the other for a rival, an ally, a pawn, destined—with Margaret’s younger sister Mary—to a sisterhood unique in all the world. The three sisters will become the queens of England, Scotland, and France.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;United by family loyalties and affections, the three queens find themselves set against each other. Katherine commands an army against Margaret and kills her husband James IV of Scotland. But Margaret’s boy becomes heir to the Tudor throne when Katherine loses her son. Mary steals the widowed Margaret’s proposed husband, but when Mary is widowed it is her secret marriage for love that is the envy of the others. As they experience betrayals, dangers, loss, and passion, the three sisters find that the only constant in their perilous lives is their special bond, more powerful than any man, even a king.</description>

  <description>The One didn’t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I met Meadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band's honorary little sister was off-limits. Too late for that. She says we’re “nothing serious,” but she’s gotten under my skin and I can’t stop thinking about her. And when I touch her, I know we’re meant to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Endings don’t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even with Ridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big plans never included falling for a rock star. Too soon for that. He wants to make us a “thing,” and I can’t deny our chemistry is combustible. His persistence is wearing me down, making his proposition hard to resist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If true love only exists in fairy tales, why am I beginning to believe that Ridge just might be my happily ever after?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#SavetheDate #CominginSeptember #TheCrowBrothers #Rockstarromance #secondchance</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Her love opened his heart. &lt;br /&gt;His love set her free.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack McAllister never thought he'd fall in love with a ballerina. She’s a wondrous dream who dances into his life, gently prying open his wounded heart. But with endless debts mounting and the threat of foreclosure on his family’s ranch, he lives a life the wealthy beauty could never understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giselle Stratford is given every advantage an affluent family can provide, except unconditional love. Bound by the demands of perfection, she trains relentlessly under her mother’s critical eye, desperate for approval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Giselle finally breaks out on her own, she stumbles into a new life and straight into Jack’s arms. He’s strong in a way she desperately needs, and his tight-knit family fills all the cracks left in her heart by her own. But the world she's left behind has the power to tear them apart, and they’ll have to fight to hold on to their love.</description>

  <description>This text is the 16th revised and updated edition of this introduction to art, from the earliest cave paintings to experimental art. Eight new artists from the modern period have been introduced. They are: Corot, Kollwitz, Nolde, de Chirico, Brancussi, Magritte, Nicolson and Morandi. A sequence of new endings have been added, and the captions are now fuller, including the medium and dimension of the works illustrated. Six fold-outs present selected large-scale works. They are: Van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece, Leonardo's Last Supper, Botticelli's Birth of Venus, Jackson Pollock's One (Number 31, 1950), Van der Weyden's Descent from the Cross and Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling.</description>

  <description>For 1000s of art lovers both amateur &amp;amp; professional, esthetic life began with Janson, as his History of Art is often called. In the 1st edition, published in 1962, he spoke to that perennial reader he gently called "the troubled layman." His opening paragraph revealed his sympathy: "Why is this supposed to be art?" he quoted rhetorically. "How often have we heard this question asked--or asked it ourselves, perhaps--in front of one of the strange, disquieting works that we are likely to find nowadays in the museum or art exhibition?" Keeping that curious, questioning perspective in mind, he wrote a history of art from cave painting to Picasso that was singularly welcoming, illuminating &amp;amp; exciting. Sojourning thru this book, a reader is offered every amenity for a comfortable trip. Because he never assumes knowledge on the part of the reader, a recent immigrant from Mars could comprehend Western art from this text. The only assumption the Jansons have made is that with a little guidance everyone can come to understand the artifacts that centuries of architecture, sculpture, design &amp;amp; painting have deposited in our paths. Countless readers have proven the Jansons right &amp;amp; found their lives enriched in the process.</description>

  <description>How did a single village community in the Italian peninsula eventually become one of the most powerful imperial powers the world has ever known? In The Romans: From Village to Empire, Mary T. Boatwright, Daniel Gargola, and Richard J.A. Talbert explore this question as they guide readers through a comprehensive sweep of Roman history, ranging from the prehistoric settlements to the age of Constantine. &lt;br /&gt; Vividly written and accessible, The Romans traces Rome's remarkable evolution from village, to monarchy, to republic, and eventually to one-man rule by an emperor whose power at its peak stretched from Scotland to Iraq and the Nile Valley. Firmly grounded in ancient literary and material sources, the book describes and analyzes major political and military landmarks, from the Punic Wars, to Caesar's conquest of Gaul and his crossing of the Rubicon, to the victory of Octavian over Mark Antony, and to Constantine's adoption of Christianity. It also introduces such captivating individuals as Hannibal, Mithridates, Pompey, Cicero, Cleopatra, Augustus, Livia, Nero, Marcus Aurelius, and Shapur. The authors cover issues that still confront modern states worldwide, including warfare, empire building, consensus forging, and political fragmentation. They also integrate glimpses of many aspects of everyday Roman life and perspective--such as the role of women, literature, entertainment, town-planning, portraiture, and religion--demonstrating how Rome's growth as a state is inseparable from its social and cultural development. &lt;br /&gt; Ideal for courses in Roman history and Roman civilization, The Romans is enhanced by almost 100 illustrations, more than 30 maps (most produced by the Ancient World Mapping Center), and 22 textual extracts that provide fascinating cultural observations made by ancient Romans themselves.</description>

  <description>This was a time of civil war, anarchy, intrigue, and assassination.Between 193 and 284 the Roman Empire knew more than twenty-five emperors, and an equal number of usurpers. All of them had some measure of success, several of them often ruling different parts of the Empire at the same time. Rome's traditional political institutions slid into vacuity and armies became the Empire's most powerful institutions, proclaiming their own imperial champions and deposing those they held to be incompetent.Yet despite widespread contemporary dismay at such weak government this period was also one in which the boundaries of the Empire remained fairly stable; the rights and privileges of Roman citizenship were extended equally to all free citizens of the Empire; in several regions the economy remained robust in the face of rampant inflation; and literary culture, philosophy, and legal theory flourished. Historians have been discussing how and why this could have been for centuries. Olivier Hekster takes you to th&lt;br /&gt;</description>

He knows Scout’s had it rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s determined to be the one thing in her life that’s easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this captivating teen novel, Sydney Logan weaves a touching story that tackles the heartbreak of addiction, the power of forgiveness, and the wonders of first love.</description>

  <description>From New York Times Bestselling Author, S.L. Scott, comes a hot new rock star romance that will sweep you off your feet and leave you with a smile.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The rumors are true. At least where I’m concerned.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Drummers hit it harder and do it better.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Women love me and I love them. But I like to think of myself as a sensitive soul trapped in a lady-killer’s body. Not so surprisingly, I’ve been called cocky a time or two. What can I say? We can’t all be boy scouts.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nikki Faris has thrown off my rhythm. With her red lips, smart aleck mouth, short skirts, long legs, and blue-sky eyes, the beautiful lead singer has become a complete distraction on this tour. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She loves to give me a hard time when all I want to do is give her the pleasure of my hard—time right back.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tulsa Crow can save his pick up lines, great eight-pack abs, and cute dimples to use on someone else. My band earned their spot on The Resistance’s tour just like The Crow Brothers. I’m not going to blow it getting sidetracked by a cocky rock star that wants to sleep his way through the states. I’ve been called a name or two, but easy isn’t one of them.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the best intentions with him turn into a walk of shame for me. Only, I don’t feel shame. Instead, I’m doing the very thing I said I wouldn’t—falling for a playboy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We make sinful music when we’re on the road, but what happens to our melody when the tour ends?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➡️ Standalone Rock Star Romance ⬅️</description>

  <description>As an NHL player, relationships haven’t been my thing. Shrouded in secrecy and speculation, they never last very long. But then that’s what happens when you require an NDA before the first date. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Charlene. She’s like a firefly. She’s elusive, and if you catch her she’ll burn bright, but keeping her trapped dulls her fire and dims her beauty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I caught her. And as much as I might want to keep her, I’ll never put the lid on her jar. Not at the risk of losing her. So I've let her set the rules in our relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as long hidden secrets expose us both, I discover exactly how fragile Charlene is, and how much I need her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’re all broken. We’re all messed up. Some more than others. Me more than most.</description>

      <![CDATA[As the last book of the Pucked series, this is a little bittersweet, but Helena Hunting has done it justice. As with the other books, she provides us with an entertaining mix of humor, hot hockey players, and the feisty women who somewhat tame them. There is also plenty of room for a variety of e...]]>

  <description>In 1558, the ancient stones of Kingsbridge Cathedral look down on a city torn apart by religious conflict. As power in England shifts precariously between Catholics and Protestants, royalty and commoners clash, testing friendship, loyalty, and love.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ned Willard wants nothing more than to marry Margery Fitzgerald. But when the lovers find themselves on opposing sides of the religious conflict dividing the country, Ned goes to work for Princess Elizabeth. When she becomes queen, all Europe turns against England. The shrewd, determined young monarch sets up the country’s first secret service to give her early warning of assassination plots, rebellions, and invasion plans. Over a turbulent half-century, the love between Ned and Margery seems doomed as extremism sparks violence from Edinburgh to Geneva. Elizabeth clings to her throne and her principles, protected by a small, dedicated group of resourceful spies and courageous secret agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real enemies, then as now, are not the rival religions. The true battle pitches those who believe in tolerance and compromise against the tyrants who would impose their ideas on everyone else—no matter what the cost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>One break is all The Crow Brothers need and we’re about to get it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Johnny Outlaw, rock legend and lead singer of The Resistance, is here to watch us play. But he’s not the only familiar face in the crowd—killer little body, heart-shaped face, and drop-dead gorgeous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah Nichols sitting at the bar makes it hard to concentrate, sparks already reigniting. The beauty was never a groupie and tonight she’s not here to catch our show. She came to drop a bomb. “You have a son.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She underestimated me. I’ll prove to my son, and her, that I can be the dad he needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is it about musicians? Why are they so damn sexy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My heart was Jet Crow’s the moment he opened his sexy mouth and sang that first song. One stolen night with that man would never be enough, but I’m not here to fall into his bed. Again. I’m here to fight for custody of a son he’s never known. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s just one problem. Those sparks between us have become flames. If we’re not careful we’re both going to get burned.</description>

  <description>The latest novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Philippa Gregory features one of the most famous girls in history, Lady Jane Grey, and her two sisters, each of whom dared to defy her queen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane Grey was queen of England for nine days. Her father and his allies crowned her instead of the dead king’s half sister Mary Tudor, who quickly mustered an army, claimed her throne, and locked Jane in the Tower of London. When Jane refused to betray her Protestant faith, Mary sent her to the executioner’s block, where Jane transformed her father’s greedy power grab into tragic martyrdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Learn you to die,” was the advice Jane wrote to her younger sister Katherine, who has no intention of dying. She intends to enjoy her beauty and her youth and fall in love. But she is heir to the insecure and infertile Queen Mary and then to her half sister, Queen Elizabeth, who will never allow Katherine to marry and produce a Tudor son. When Katherine’s pregnancy betrays her secret marriage, she faces imprisonment in the Tower, only yards from her sister’s scaffold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Farewell, my sister,” writes Katherine to the youngest Grey sister, Mary. A beautiful dwarf, disregarded by the court, Mary keeps family secrets, especially her own, while avoiding Elizabeth’s suspicious glare. After seeing her sisters defy their queens, Mary is acutely aware of her own danger but determined to command her own life. What will happen when the last Tudor defies her ruthless and unforgiving Queen Elizabeth?</description>

  <description>Meet Cute – When boy meets girl in a way that’s considered adorable, awkward, or amusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter Britt Daniels is the queen of the meet-cute. From mixed-up cappuccinos at coffee shops to awkwardly intercepted text messages, Britt creates the perfect first meeting for rom-com movie characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for Britt, life doesn’t imitate art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or does it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hollywood heartthrob Luke Taylor is fed up with demanding divas and spoiled brats. He’s looking for someone simple. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone like Britt Daniels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he learns that Britt has a strict no-dating policy when it comes to actors, Luke takes it as a personal challenge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for him, Britt’s immune to his big blue eyes and trademark charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke realizes it’s going to take more than Hollywood glitz and glamour to win Britt’s heart. He needs to be sincere. He needs to get creative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He needs the cutest meet-cute of all.</description>

  <description>Six foot three. Dynamic green eyes. Utterly irresistible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan Everest stole my breath the first time I saw him. He romanced me with skill, dazzled me with his charisma, and proceeded to steal my heart right after. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might have fallen for his easy-going smile the first time we met, but I fell for him the second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honey-colored hair. Cherry-kissed lips. Captivatingly gorgeous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Singer Davis was the first, and only, woman to ever intimidate me. She spoke to my heart with her wit, seduced me with her eyes, and became the only thing that made sense in a world that made none. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let her slip through my fingers once. I won’t make that mistake twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secrets broke us apart. Can a second chance bring us back together? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From New York Times Bestselling Author, S.L. Scott, comes a ROMANTIC SUSPENSE STANDALONE that will have you on the edge of your seat and swooning over this new ALPHA BILLIONAIRE.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A second chance romance set in New York and Kuai. If you ever dreamed about a past love, this is the book for you. &lt;i&gt;True Abandon&lt;/i&gt; is filled with angst, humor, romance and a setting that will have you swooning page after page. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can the sins of the past be forgiven with the actions of today?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trish Hogan's life was destroyed when she gave her trust to her high school boyfriend, Jackson, and he threw it away, changing the course of her life forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decade later she’s living in Manhattan -- she has a roommate, a steady boyfriend and a career. When a hurricane puts the city on lock down, Trish gets a message she never thought she’d receive: Jackson is dying and alone. In a city of millions, she is the only person who can sit by his side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackson Davis was once the golden child of a senator who went against his father’s plans and became a musician. Tatted up and broken, he wakes up in a hospital only to see Trish -- the one person he needs to atone his sins to -- standing before him. He will recover from his injuries, but not from the pain he caused in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped by the storm, they embark on a night of reckoning that has one running away to Hawaii and the other following in her steps. As the victim becomes the villain, the two are forced to face the past, live in the present and find a way to navigate into the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True Abandon is the fifth installment in the Abandon Collection -- a series of STANDALONE novels featuring dynamic heroines who have to abandon their reality in order to discover themselves . . . and love along the way. &lt;br /&gt;Each book in the Abandon Collection features a new couple, exciting city and a rose of a different color.

  <description>Sometimes second chances aren’t quite what you expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every Christmas Eve, Carter Reed sits in a bar and regrets the decision he made ten years earlier that tore the love of his life from him. Mackenzie Monroe was his everything, but he left her behind to follow his dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now those dreams all revolve around her. The one who got away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so he thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A not-so-chance encounter with a mysterious stranger sends Carter on a mystical journey to fix the mistakes of the past. But he quickly finds out making things right isn’t as simple as making a different choice. And if he doesn't find the key to Kenzie's heart, he could lose her all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Chances is a story about a man who gets a peek at what his life could be, if only he’d walked a different path. In the tradition of It’s a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Carol, it’s a heartwarming romance sprinkled with a touch of magic that’s sure to become a holiday favorite.</description>

  <description>Formerly published in the Romantic Interludes anthology. Now available for the first time as a stand-alone short story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily Valentine is a matchmaker who doesn’t believe in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, at least not the hearts and flowers, see-your-soulmate-across-a-crowded-room-and-the-world-stands-still kind of love. No, Emily is a pragmatist – a scientist – and she’s abandoned her family’s tradition of matchmaking based on instinct and uncanny intuition for a more scientific approach to pairing people up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily believes love is more about compatibility and common interests than anything mystical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a run-of-the-mill job turns her world on end when swoony cake designer Sam Cavanaugh pops up as a potential match for her newest client. The attraction she feels for him throws a wrench in her plans, but she’s not going to succumb without a fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily is nothing if not practical. And reasonable. But she’s about to learn that sometimes the best things in life…are neither.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the cursed Las Vegas wastelands where fallen angels enslave humans and witches hide in the shadows, a young witch will break the Sanctuary's cardinal rules to protect her home and a forbidden love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some laws were made to be broken.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sanctuary is the only place protected from the covet curse, and life there is all Senna knows. When a mysterious light outside of the boundary compels her to cross and investigate, she meets the stunning Archangel Cade and soon finds herself on the path of breaking the angelic rules governing the Sanctuary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cade warns her that the spell protecting the Sanctuary is breaking and that the key to fixing it is in an ancient book hidden in the Las Vegas wastelands. She sets off with him determined to do whatever it takes to save her home. But along their journey, Senna learns that Cade’s true motive could place her cherished home in danger. The choice is hers. Save the Sanctuary, or give into what she covets the most—him.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the &lt;i&gt;Abandon Collection &lt;/i&gt; comes sexy stand-alone romance about a Matthew McConaughey loving bartender and the badass cop she can’t stand! It’s an enemies-to-lovers romance with a ton of suspense!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take one sexy bartender. Add a badass cop. A splash of sweet, that's me. One sour, that's him... and serve over ice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s how you’ll get to my current situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the girl - the one who commands the scene, bottle of liquor in hand, pouring liquid fire into the willing throats of patrons as they let loose at the local bar?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's me. Leah Marie Paige.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be known as the town party girl, but in reality I'm this close to my dream of opening my own bar - McConaugheys. Yes, it will be named after the acclaimed actor. What can I say? I’m a sucker for that sexy Texan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything was going as planned until the night I had a few drinks and accepted a ride home from a friend. A misunderstanding leads to an arrest, and now I'm at the mercy of the one man I can’t stand, and trust me, the feeling is definitely mutual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Reingold is six-feet-tall and built like a stallion -- the man is the epitome of male. He also happens to be the town narc and hates my guts. There’s a story to our past and it's not a pretty one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now, here I am, chained to him for the summer like a hardened criminal, doing whatever he tells me to do. Problem is, I can’t help but look at him when he’s not watching and wonder what our future could be like if things were different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many reasons why he’s all wrong for me. Even more reasons why I need to stay away from him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a cocktail of trouble. Best served shaken, not stirred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;i&gt;Wrecked&lt;/i&gt; is a prequel to &lt;i&gt;Reckless Abandon&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>A quest for vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;A high-stakes treasure hunt.&lt;br /&gt;An attraction they both try to deny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced One-Eyed Jack Tremayne killed her father and stole his prized cutlass, Sarina Talbot sneaks aboard the pirate’s ship to exact her revenge. To her surprise, she’s met by a declaration of innocence and an offer of help. She doesn’t trust him, and he doesn’t trust anybody. But they need each other to catch the killer and beat their enemies to a hidden cache of Aztec gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re not the only treasure-seekers, however, and there’s a traitor in their midst. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caught between Crown ships and enemy pirates, Sarina and Jack discover a prize greater than gold as their uneasy alliance leads them on the adventure of a lifetime.</description>

  <description>Sinfully sexy rock stars are the cornerstone of New York Times Bestselling Author, S.L. Scott’s Bestselling Hard to Resist Series. The Rebellion is the newest STAND-ALONE that brings soul-searing romance mixed with heartfelt emotions to fans of this legendary rock band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I met my muse at fifteen. I’d just gotten busted for smoking behind the school gymnasium. She inspired me with her laugh and nonjudgmental attitude and, before I knew it, we were inseparable. Then I left to pursue my rock star dreams—dreams she encouraged.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I got over Jaymes Grenier no problem. I never think about that little bow at the top of her pink lips, or the way her green eyes admired mine. Nope, I barely recall the way she fit so perfectly in my arms when I held her at night. The sweet way she would whisper she loved me has long faded from memory.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These are the lies I regularly tell myself in hopes of believing them one day. Yeah, I was told I’d get over my first love.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Derrick Masters marked me the moment we met back in ninth grade. He called me over—all bravado and bad boy mystery wrapped in a James Dean-esque package. Dark hair and blue eyes with a rebel without a cause charisma. He was everything I was warned about, but I couldn’t resist. I was his from that moment on.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His career took off almost as soon as he did. I knew it would. I just thought I would be beside him as his partner in crime, best friend, and lover. That’s what we had always been … before he left me behind to fend for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fend? Fight is more like it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve been fighting ever since. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fighting for survival.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fighting for a better life in a world determined to keep me down.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don’t have the luxury of letting my head live in the lure of La La Land. His dreams may have come true, but mine were extinguished. These days I fight for something bigger than me, bigger than we were ever meant to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his dreams come crashing back into my reality, is this a second chance at that fairy tale ending or another heartbreak in the making?</description>

  <description>‘We love Aussies,’ they said, ‘the readers will eat you up’. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Those seven little words got me on a plane to the USA for the ‘Raunchy with a touch of sexiness – Valentine’s Day Author Event’ in Miami. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m a romance author. A girl with a vivid imagination, and an overactive sex drive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh, and yes I’m Australian &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I agreed the so-called love of my life had just walked out on me, leaving me with two little girls. All I wanted was a little fun and some no strings attached fun while I was there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It would be my very own ‘what happens in Miami, stays in Miami’. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unless I fall in love with an American &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s no such thing as a happily ever after in real life &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is there? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author, S.L. Scott, comes this story that will captivate and consume from beginning to end. This is a must read for anyone who believes in true love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Move on with your life&lt;/i&gt;, they said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Forget her&lt;/i&gt;, they said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how could Ben Edwards forget the woman who was supposed to be his forever? When Grace Stevens disappeared--&lt;i&gt;without a word, without a trace&lt;/i&gt;--she took half his soul with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the heartbreak, Ben tried. He tried to take their advice by pursuing his career. He tried to find fulfillment in his work. He tried to find peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace had been the love of his life. Her fingerprints were on every surface of his existence. He had success and wealth. &lt;i&gt;He had everything, except her&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then fate stepped in one serendipitous night. The hope he'd held on to for three long, agonizing years appeared before him in the form of a picturesque beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was she real, or an apparition returning to haunt him? He wasn't sure, but he wouldn't stop until he found his missing love. Every minute mattered, and he wouldn't waste a second chance.</description>

  <description>The first time Adeline Ivey danced into my life, high on ecstasy instead of life, was at the party before the kickoff of our seventh tour. I spotted her out on the lawn, a gorgeous girl spinning around in circles with her arms wide and a big smile directed at the Los Angeles sky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We shared an insane summer on the road, surrounded by sex, drugs, and rock n' roll—a combination that could only end in disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was ten years ago. The world has forgotten Lincoln Hayes, rock god and guitarist in Path of Destruction. As the date of my parole hearing approaches, I'm nothing but a number in the system of the Michigan Department of Corrections. And as much as I want to forget the events of that summer and move on, the girl I can't get out of my head is trying to make an encore appearance in my life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Max Riley is the man of your dreams. Or at least he will be, for a price.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As his alter-ego Mister Romance, Max is a drop-dead gorgeous escort who makes romantic fantasies come to life. No sex, just swoon-worthy dates to die for, and the cream of New York's socialites can't get enough.  Whether they want a dominating billionaire, bad boy with a heart of gold, hot geek, sexy biker, or best friend who loves them from afar, Max can make it all happen, but he's careful to keep his real identity a secret. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enter investigative journalist Eden Tate. Having caught wind of the urban legend of Mister Romance from a lovestruck client, Eden is determined to publish a scathing expose on Max and his ability to swindle lonely society women out of their fortunes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Desperate to protect his anonymity and his clients, Max challenges Eden to give him three dates. If she doesn't fall in love with him, she can run her story with his blessing. If she succumbs to his charms, the story dies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cynical Eden has no doubt she can resist his fake romance personas, but when the real Max admits he’s falling for her, she has to decide if the professional liar is telling the truth, or if the passionate man with the mysterious past is just one more character designed to con her out of her career-making story. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t miss this sizzling new standalone from the internationally best selling author of Bad Romeo, Broken Juliet, and Wicked Heart.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A mysterious house. An old journal. A dusty chest holding more than secrets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each talisman found in the chest grants the chosen a gift, a unique ability. But with that power comes a burden—the duty of The Order. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something is coming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something evil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it's up to The Order to stop it. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW, Now EPISODE 1 of The Talisman Chronicles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chloe Blake has a unique gift, an odd connection to her house that results in glimpses of the past, present, and future via the picture window in her living room. Unfortunately, it’s a gift that sometimes proves to be more of a curse. Especially when she tries to help out Ethan Reynolds, the gorgeous boy who lives across the street – an endeavor that, for some reason, always seems to backfire. Or leave her covered in mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the house is convinced Ethan’s life is in danger and Chloe’s the only one who can save him. The problem is, he thinks she’s more than a little crazy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lose yourself in this heart-wrenching small town romance about first love, broken promises, and holding on to love when all hope is lost.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hardest thing Cody Wilde ever had to do was keep the promise he made to his dying father—stay away from trouble. Growing up in a rural Texas town and being bullied by the sheriff’s son made it nearly impossible to control the notorious Wilde temper. Only having his good friend, Cassie, and her family for support made the task bearable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cassie Strong never understood why people picked on Cody. He was sweet, sexy, and had a silly side that he showed only to her. When tragedy strikes her family, it’s Cody who is by her side and their friendship blossoms into something more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Cody’s lifelong enemy threatens the one thing that could make him break his promise, will he risk losing Cassie or will he be strong enough to hold on to his father’s last wish?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This is the first of 3 parts of the Strong &amp;amp; Wilde novel and is written as a serial with cliffhangers. The full novel is now available for readers who prefer the complete novel format or you can continue reading the book in serial format.</description>

  <description>Victoria Carson never expected love. An American heiress and graduate of Lady Grantham's finishing school, she's been groomed since birth to marry an English title—the grander the better. So when the man chosen for her, the forbidding Earl of Dunnley, seems to hate her on sight, she understands that it can't matter. Love can have no place in this arrangement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew Hargrave has little use for his title and even less for his cold, disinterested parents. Determined to make his own way, he's devoted to his life in Italy working as an archaeologist. Until the collapse of his family's fortune drags him back to England to a marriage he never wanted and a woman he doesn't care to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild attraction is an unwanted complication for them both, though it forms the most fragile of bonds. Their marriage of convenience isn't so intolerable after all—but it may not be enough when the deception that bound them is finally revealed.</description>

  <description>Reese King: Olympic medalist, underwear model, Greek god.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His body is chiseled from rock, sculpted by the weight room, and refined by water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a daily basis his skin is completely bare for everyone to see, tan and defined, only covered up by a minuscule piece of spandex. There is no denying his sex appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to admit it, but I’m head over heels infatuated with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one HUGE problem though. His achingly gorgeous abs, inked up arm, and cocky swagger belong to my boss, the high-profile, reality star bitch from hell and certified heinous human being, Bellini Chambers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I think is going to be an easy job assisting a glorified wench turns into a cluster f*ck of epic proportions.</description>

  <description>100% of the proceeds of this short story benefits Alex's Lemonade Stand and Wounded Warriors Project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snow blankets the earth in a cascade of white that shimmers in the sunlight. I gaze out the frosty window, watching in fascination as my breath creates a pale fog along the glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You love the snow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You love the holidays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You especially love Christmas morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think about you all the time, but never so much as I have the past few days. December is always hard because everything reminds me of you. The frozen river where we like to skate. The hot chocolate we love to drink. The glittering lights on the tree that you can't wait to decorate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see you everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the sweetest torture.</description>

  <description>Everything you've heard about modeling is true, and you haven't heard the half of it. It's glamorous. It's sexy. And yes, the line between work and reality often blurs. We're not just prototypes of perfection. Models have feelings and desires, too. We may be genetically gifted, but we're still human. I'm only human. Yes, an extraordinary specimen that earns more in a day than most make in a year, but this eight pack didn't create itself. I spend hours working on this body. The good looks just come natural. *Winks* Thanks, Mom and Dad. I'm Danny Weston, Supermodel. But one path was traded for another when I chose this career. Ten years later, I would trade my career to have it back. To have her back. Reese Carmichael is the one woman I would give it all up for, and the only one I can't have. Yet.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From New York Times Bestselling Author, S.L. Scott, comes this downright delicious peek into the male anatomy... er, mind of Hardy Richard. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two rules:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Don’t get too close. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Don’t fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Correction: Don’t ever fall in love. I don’t need the baggage of relationships. Life should be simple, easy, uncomplicated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I’m faced with is, if I really believe life should be that easy, that uncomplicated, and that simple, then why am I still thinking about a woman I met on a random Tuesday at the bar? A girl who was never a Gimlet, and always a Paloma. Yep, I called it all wrong last night and I’m starting to wonder if my heart is the one that will pay the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might have broken rule number one, but rule number two remains firmly intact. For now. Sort of. Okay, maybe rule two hasn’t been broken, but it’s definitely been bent.</description>

  <description>I’ve spent my entire life protecting something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The net&lt;br /&gt;My teammates&lt;br /&gt;My sister&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve played hockey my entire life. Had many girlfriends. Slept with more women than I care to mention. Been in love twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While one woman tried to control me by changing me into someone I no longer recognized, the other loved me not for who I could be, but for who I already was. She was my high school sweetheart but, like a fool, I walked away and let someone else take my place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she’s back and even more beautiful than I remembered. But one glance tells me she’s guarded. At seventeen, I asked for something she wasn’t ready to give away. Today… I’d settle for holding her hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one time she trusted me with her heart and I broke it. Now, I’ll do whatever it takes to convince her to let down her guard and give me a chance to prove I’m worthy of being trusted with it again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was the first boy she ever kissed. And after all these years, I want to be the man she kisses for the rest of her life.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A mysterious house. An old journal. A dusty chest holding more than secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each talisman found in the chest grants the chosen a gift, a unique ability. But with that power comes a burden—the duty of The Order. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something is coming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something evil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it's up to The Order to stop it. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRISON - The Talisman Chronicles, Episode 6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chloe Blake knows a battle is coming. She’s seen it—over and over—in her living room’s mystical picture window. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she’s also seen something worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chloe and her friends now know they’re The Order, gifted with powers to fight the dark chaos that’s descended on Lamsden and is bent on wreaking havoc not only there, but around the world. They’re prepared to fight, but fighting may not be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if Chloe’s visions are right, they might not all emerge from the battle unscathed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or even alive.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A mysterious house. An old journal. A dusty chest holding more than secrets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each talisman found in the chest grants the chosen a gift, a unique ability. But with that power comes a burden—the duty of The Order. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something is coming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something evil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it's up to The Order to stop it. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHIELD - The Talisman Chronicles, Episode 5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dylan Kennedy finds himself standing in the rain on Chloe Blake’s doorstep, with no memory of how he got there, he has no idea that the weirdness in his life is just beginning. He opens the old wooden chest in Chloe’s attic and, with a flash of blinding light, he’s endowed with a unique gift—and made part of The Order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Dylan and the others face a growing threat—a darkness that feeds on pain and thrives on chaos. It’s getting stronger every day, and soon, they’ll have to fight it head-on, whether they’re ready or not.</description>

The journal tells of a secret group called The Order—powerful warriors tasked with protecting humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maia knows it’s a legend, an interesting bit of mythology passed down through generations. But the more she translates the journal, the more she begins to wonder if there’s more to the myth than meets the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe The Order is real. And maybe Maia’s destined to be a part of it.</description>

  <description>"I don't want to be a choice you have to make. I want to be your heart's only option."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wedding planner Skye Douglas makes a career out of bringing fairytales to life—even if she’s given up on her own happily ever after. Instead of dating, she devotes time to her nephew, a guitar prodigy who shares her love for 80s hair bands. When she encounters Caleb Lynch, the new guitar teacher, everything changes. Caleb's passion for music—not to mention his Def Leppard T-shirt—makes Skye wonder if she might get her storybook ending after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caleb would do anything for those he loves—including a fake engagement as a gift to his best friend's dying mother. But after meeting Skye, he regrets the promise he made. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Skye realizes she’s fallen for the groom, will she listen to her head . . . or her heart?</description>

  <description>Life at Fashionista magazine can be a real bitch. Especially when you work for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vig Morgan finally worked her way out of the assistant-for-the-bitch-from-hell trenches only to get stuck in a sea of editors. But Vig isn't like the other associate editors at the aggressively hip and overwhelmingly current Fashionista magazine. For one thing, she couldn't care less which star wore which designer to which party. Sure, she's clever and witty—and just as ambitious as the next overqualified underpaid underling, but she would never get drawn into a plot to depose the evil editor-in-chief. Or would she?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jump with Vig into the choppy waters of scheming, backstabbing, free speech, flirtation and fashion, as the lackeys at the bottom of the masthead band together to take down the queen at the top, with some unexpected—but not necessarily unpleasant—results.</description>

  <description>Husbands: you're really only allowed one at a time ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bella secretly married her childhood sweetheart, Stevie, over a decade ago; they were at university, two big kids playing at being grownups. When it all unravelled and reality hit, Bella simply got up and left. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, Bella meets Philip and, despite her vow never to marry again, she can't resist him. He is a catch. Funny, charming, interesting and kind. Only hitch is, she's still (technically, anyway) married to Stevie. Bella, typically, just ignores the problem. And the moment to tell Philip never quite seems to arrive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Bella plans never to reveal her secret after all, it's just a silly piece of paper, lodged at a registrar's office in Aberdeen, isn't it? She hasn't seen Stevie for years - probably never will again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except when Bella's best friend Laura introduces her new man to the gang it is none other than Stevie. Could things get any more complicated? Only if Bella and Stevie fall in love with each other again ...</description>

  <description>Off the court, tennis star Jason Cartwright's playboy image is taking a public beating. On the court, he's down forty-love. A knee injury is shutting down his game, and the paparazzi are splashing his love life on every magazine. A comeback is in order, but the makeover he needs to save his faltering career is in the hands of the woman he loved and left fifteen years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While single-mom, Izzy Connors, sees people for who they really are through the lens of her camera, even without it, she knows Jason isn't the star he appears to be. Although his charm and good looks haven't dimmed since he broke her heart, all she sees is his wasted talent and playboy lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Izzy put the past behind her and help Jason get his game, and his image, back on track? Or will the click of her camera shatter his world as well as his heart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Librarian's note: Alternate cover edition of ASIN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43786352-game-set-match" rel="nofollow"&gt;B0090QWA1M&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Don’t miss the resulting action and insights in this Pucked series and Clipped Wings crossover novella.</description>

A dusty chest holding more than secrets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each talisman found in the chest grants the chosen a gift, a unique ability. But with that power comes a burden—the duty of The Order. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something is coming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something evil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it's up to The Order to stop it. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW, Now EPISODE 1 of The Talisman Chronicles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chloe Blake has a unique gift, an odd connection to her house that results in glimpses of the past, present, and future via the picture window in her living room. Unfortunately, it’s a gift that sometimes proves to be more of a curse. Especially when she tries to help out Ethan Reynolds, the gorgeous boy who lives across the street – an endeavor that, for some reason, always seems to backfire. Or leave her covered in mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the house is convinced Ethan’s life is in danger and Chloe’s the only one who can save him. The problem is, he thinks she’s more than a little crazy.</description>

  <description>Although Branford is broken and desperate, he finds himself with no choice: He must declare war against Hadebrand, or Edgar’s evil darkness will envelop the commonwealth. Silverhelm’s army is grossly outnumbered, but Branford underestimates the people’s love for their commoner queen. The people rise up in support of their beloved regent, and Branford sees a glimmer of hope for his wife. He becomes more determined than ever to make up for his previous failures and secure the future of his kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With their murderous intentions, the treacherous King Edgar and Princess Whitney must pay for what they have done. They must not be allowed to destroy everything the people hold dear.&lt;br /&gt;With but faint hope in his heart, Branford gathers his people and marches toward the castle in Hadebrand, gathering allies along the way. With the support of other noble families, Branford will have to find the strength to fight for the very survival of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He sees only one path: the annihilation of his enemy.</description>

  <description>***THIS BOOK CAN BE READ AS A STANDALONE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All publicity is good publicity, right? Unless you’re recent college grad Ellie Wagner and an embarrassing video of you and your boyfriend goes viral. Every man in your life abandons you, but who knew a one-minute clip of your latest doomed relationship would brand you a slut, prevent you from getting your perfect job, and force you to keep doing the one thing you swore you’d never do again…live with your mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But staying with mom and her latest boy-toy (is this husband number four or five?) until your life turns around might not be all bad. Especially when you fall – literally – at the feet of a sexy, green-eyed stranger who offers you freedom and a life of luxury on a gold-rimmed platter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s only one little problem – the man of your dreams is none other than Mason Nash, the latest hip-hop star busting up the music charts. Fame and fortune are his calling cards and he’s vying to steal the show on a new reality TV series that will catapult him into mainstream stardom. Hello spotlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The man behind the famous persona is perfect for Ellie in every way, but can she overcome the ugly pitfalls that come with Mason's celebrity status? Or will she be forced to choose between the man she loves and the independent life she longs for? After all, fame and fortune aren’t always what they seem and not all publicity is good publicity…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.***</description>

      <![CDATA[I always enjoy a good romance with a strong female lead. Sure, the hero can swoop in and add to her life, but I prefer my heroines to be self-sufficient to begin with. This is even more important when the hero is much wealthier than the heroine, or a celebrity.<br /><br />This is the case with El...]]>

  <description>Women loathed me without even knowing my name. Men coveted the very idea of me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Escort. Call girl. Prostitute. Hooker. Whore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd heard it all. Done it all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I'd felt a lot of things about my occupation...but not regret--never regret. I had my reasons for doing what I did and nothing and no one had ever made me question them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNTIL MARCO VALENTI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He'd changed me and I'd naively fed into the fairy tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Marco wasn't my Prince Charming. He had secrets of his own. Secrets that would eventually rip away everything I held dear.</description>

  <description>With two traitors removed from their midst, Branford and Alexandra rekindle their faith in one another. Branford insists on remaining at Alexandra’s side at all times to protect her as he rallies his allies against King Edgar and the kingdom of Hadebrand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alexandra’s grace and humility continue to touch the hearts of the people of Silverhelm, and the couple is surrounded by the love of their people. But treachery still lives in the hearts of those who wish to see the destruction of Silverhelm and they would be willing to cause Alexandra harm to achieve their goal. King Edgar still will not relent, but will his role in past events be exposed? Branford is not invincible, and despite his vows to keep his wife safe, Alexandra is still vulnerable. When the unthinkable happens, Branford may not be able to survive the loss. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>On the heels of a brutal attack, Emma Southerly finds herself swept away to Palm Springs, but she can't run from trouble, especially when it has a habit of chasing her down. A mysterious stranger is posting incriminating photos of the less-than-upstanding citizens of Belle Mère, but is it a friendly game or something more sinister? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Jameson West breaks his bail and tracks her down, he delivers more bad news. Emma's landed on the suspect list. No one knows who killed Nathaniel West, but now there are two suspects, two investigations, and two people with every reason to turn on one another. Someone in Belle Mère is a murderer—someone closer to both of them than they could ever imagine—and unless they stick together, they might find themselves falling into a trap instead of falling in love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because when the cards are dealt, everyone might lose.</description>

  <description>In a world with too much money and not enough rules, anything goes. Welcome to Belle Mère, the most exclusive zip code outside the Las Vegas Strip. It's every sinner's fantasy and every good parent's worst nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma Southerly doesn't belong at Belle Mère Prep despite her new stepfather's money. Not after she shunned her invite to the popular table, and especially not after what happened last summer. So when her best friend begs her to crash an invite-only, end of the year party, she should say no with a capitol H-E-L-L. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's just a party. What could go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;Getting kicked out to start. Running into the man who destroyed your family. &lt;br /&gt;Everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she meets Jamie, who's also hiding from the in-crowd. After spending the night with the cute stranger, Emma barely makes it home before news hits Belle Mère's brunch tables. A body's been found on the West estate, and Jamie is the number one suspect. But he couldn't have done it…right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma isn't sure she can trust him or the rest of Belle Mère. After all, no one is safe when everyone is a liar.</description>

  <description>Royalty requires sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As King Camden’s health declines, the need for an heir becomes crucial, impossible to ignore. With no other viable choice, Alexandra must stand stoically by when Hadley comes to the court of Silverhelm as Branford’s concubine. The queen’s edict of duty echoes through Alexandra’s mind as she accepts the loathsome conditions for the sake of the kingdom. The only person more devastated by the circumstances is Branford himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Branford spurs Alexandra’s affections, and King Edgar continues press his post-war advantage, all seems lost to the young couple. Treachery still lies deep within the castle of Silverhelm, and the revelation of the traitor will come from the least likely of sources.</description>

With rugged good looks, his ever present plaid shirt, and a dog named Babe, John is a modern alpha male lumberjack. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After his favorite neighbor rents out her beach cabin for the winter, John finds himself playing fireman and tour guide to Diane Watson, a beautiful brunette with her own messy past and recent battle scars. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will he be ready to fall in love? Or will he go back to his old, flirty ways? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold onto your heart as John Day tells his story in this male POV contemporary adult romance/romantic comedy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ready to Fall is the first novel in the Wingmen series, a spin-off from Modern Love Stories. Each book is a standalone with no cliffhanger.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of Songbird comes a story that will make you laugh, cry, and believe in the power of second chances.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carrie Malone has seen enough heartbreak to last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her family’s demons gave Carrie the courage to move away from home and leave her past behind. Now a college senior, she stays busy with her classes and her job at the diner. It may sound boring to some, but to Carrie, the very best thing about her new life is that every day is calm and blissfully uneventful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all changes the night Josh Bennett walks into her diner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his dirty designer suit and mud-caked shoes, Carrie’s not sure what to think about the broken man sitting at her counter. She’s even more confused when he doesn’t touch his coffee . . . and leaves his Rolex watch as a tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh Bennett has nothing to live for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starved for affection and deep in despair, he’s looking for a tender touch. A kind word. A giving heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shattered and broken Josh finds himself standing on a city bridge, looking down into the freezing river that will undoubtedly bring an end to his pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s prepared to jump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s prepared to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s not prepared for the pretty waitress who finds him there by the water’s edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When two lost souls find each other in the dark of the night, can they give each other a reason to breathe again?</description>

  <description>I’m NHL defenseman Lance Romero, AKA Lance “Romance."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m notorious for parties and excess. I have the most penalty minutes in the league. I get into the most fights. I take the most hits. I’m a player on and off the ice. I’m the one women with no inhibitions want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not because I like the notoriety, but because I don’t know how to be any other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have secrets. Ones I shared with the wrong person, and she used them against me. Sometimes she still does. I should cut ties. But she makes it difficult, because she’s the kind of bad I deserve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least that’s what I believed until someone from my past gets caught up in my present. She’s all the good things in this world. She lights up my dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shouldn’t want her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should leave her alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I won’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;***A Standalone novel in the &lt;i&gt;Pucked&lt;/i&gt; series.***&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>From the New York Times Bestselling Author that brought you The Resistance comes this dirty-talking, sexy standalone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Because first love deserves a second chance&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One month.&lt;br /&gt;One movie.&lt;br /&gt;One shot at a second chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell madly in love at first sight with Jane Lewis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girl with bright blue eyes, a pretty smile, and great ass owned my heart. I thought she was happy with the status quo, but ten years later, I foolishly let her go. Despite dating other women, no one compares to my first love. We are meant to be together, and I’m going to try my damnedest to convince her of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke Anders tricked me. The deal was sealed before I knew he was behind it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We agreed to be just friends. Simple. Easy. But it’s not just the weather that’s hot in Texas. I was a fool to think I could resist him. He knows how to work his charms and those kissable lips, that great jaw, and biceps. We are here to work, but he has become downright distracting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m strong. I can handle one month of his flirtatious sexual torture. But if I happen to fall in bed with that sexy bastard for a night, or three, does that make me weak? Asking for a friend, of course. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I’m about to find out when love gets messy, it’s not just the talk that’s dirty.</description>

  <description>Tucker Winslow and Gracie Madison, two strangers trying to survive a staggering loss. Both hop in their cars and set out on a cross-country adventure, hoping to leave the hurt behind. But, when Tucker's car breaks down, and he is forced to hitchhike the rest of the way, fate intervenes. When these two meet, the bond is instantaneous. Their losses connect them in a way that's impossible to ignore, and they form a friendship that helps soothe wounds that go far too deep to heal. They laugh, they cry, they blast 80's music and sing off-key, and they stop at every tourist trap they can find along the way. Then, as it always does, one night their laughter turns to lust and they both give in, knowing it will change everything they've come to rely on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Losing someone you know and love can be the hardest thing in the world. So why does losing someone you've just met, yet have come to depend on, hurt twice as much? Join Tucker and Gracie as they embark upon the adventure of a lifetime, and end up on a journey toward finding happiness in a world that was once filled with pain.</description>

  <description>Jack Dalton was charismatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Johnny Outlaw was irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two sides of the same man, passionate about two things—music and Holliday Hughes. With her intoxicating mix of strength and vulnerability, confidence and sex appeal, he couldn’t get enough of her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, love was a storm of chaos and calm. When fame became a force to be reckoned with, could their love hold them together or would their notoriety tear them apart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This isn’t how our melody goes. This isn’t how we were supposed to play out.”</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;AVAILABLE SEPTEMBER 22, 2016.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shattered dreams are one thing. Broken souls rarely heal.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No stranger to the grip of pain and fear caused by his existence, Jeremy had become accustomed to the repercussions of being the archangel of death. But when his duty earns him the loathing of the one woman he can never have, he finds an ache that cuts deeper than any sword. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite heaven standing on the brink of war, Jeremy defies the orders given to him to stay and stand beside his brothers. Instead, he returns to Kauai in hopes of finding comfort in the admiration of his human companions. But what he finds is far less than he had hoped. Old wounds heal slowly and Leilani is hard pressed to simply forgive his abandonment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torn between seductive promises and the threat of all-out war, Jeremy is forced to seek answers where he has never dared to before—an enemy of ancient power. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will he be able to resist the siren’s call of the darkness? Or will he be forced to watch as his love turns to ash? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join L.G. Castillo in the final installment of her ground breaking Broken Angel series! If you like dark intrigue, harrowing suspense and the struggle between desire and redemption you don’t want to miss Golden Angel!</description>

It seems as though everything in their lives has become as smooth as silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But war is on the horizon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neighboring kingdom of Hadebrand has amassed an army, and Branford must leave his new wife to right for his people against insurmountable odds. Alexandra must hold her terror inside of herself while her husband is away, and set an example for the people of the kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the war comes to an end, there is only one thing on Branford’s mind. But how will Alexandra overcome her anguish when she can’t give her husband the one thing he must have?</description>

  <description>Celebrating the 500th anniversary of Michelangelo’s David, New American Library releases a special edition of Irving Stone’s classic biographical novel—in which both the artist and the man are brought to life in full. A masterpiece in its own right, this novel offers a compelling portrait of Michelangelo’s dangerous, impassioned loves, and the God-driven fury from which he wrested the greatest art the world has ever known.</description>

One taste is never enough.</description>

  <description>Being immortal isn't all it's cracked up to be. Life's hard for a Greek god in the 21st century: nobody believes in you any more, even your own family doesn't respect you, and you're stuck in a delapidated hovel in north London with too many siblings and not enough hot water. But for Artemis (goddess of hunting, professional dog walker), Aphrodite (goddess of beauty, telephone sex operator) and Apollo (god of the sun, TV psychic) there's no way out... Until a meek cleaner and her would-be boyfriend come into their lives, and turn the world literally upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gods Behaving Badly&lt;/i&gt; is that rare thing, a charming, funny, utterly original first novel that satisfies the head and the heart.</description>

  <description>Will his call of duty break both their hearts?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Losing her father in Desert Storm has left Stephanie James with a bitter soul when it comes to the military. As a college senior juggling a full course load, Steph's only goal is to graduate with honors at the end of the semester. She’s focused, determined, and a firm believer in all work and no play. Then she meets Brandon Walker at a New Year’s Eve costume party. Despite his disguise, Steph finds herself attracted to the camouflaged soldier who curls her toes with a scorching midnight kiss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brandon is an engineering major and ROTC student from the hills of Kentucky. Growing up as the son of a major general has given Brandon firsthand knowledge of the struggles military families sometimes face. Now that his father’s memory is fading, Brandon is even more determined to make his dad proud and graduate as an officer in the United States Army. Then he meets Stephanie, and suddenly, his focus is less on his military service and more on the pretty brunette who has stolen his heart. When he becomes aware of Steph’s resentment toward the military, he worries their relationship is doomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When faced with the realization that she's fallen in love with a soldier, can Steph’s wounds from the past be healed with love in her present . . . and in her future?</description>

  <description>With steady patience, Sir Branford teaches his young wife the pleasures that are to be found in their marital chambers. Though still unsure of herself, Alexandra begins to open herself to the possibilities of her new life. As Branford expresses his desire to have more than a simple political marriage, Alexandra begins to see a brand new side of her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexandra soon discovers there is more to being Sir Branford’s wife than sharing his bed. When the lives of nobles rest in her hands, she finally begins to understand the importance of her position in the court and in her husband’s life.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;You don't choose when.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't choose where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you don't get to choose who you fall in love with.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minute he opened his sexy mouth, Holliday Hughes should have known Jack Dalton was trouble. His smooth pickup lines, broad shoulders, and ridiculously handsome face charmed her right out of her clothes. She gave into her desires, the instant attraction blinding her to the obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;One night. &lt;/i&gt;That was all it took for Holliday's world to be flipped on its axis. Jack Dalton was cocky. Smug. Volatile. Demanding. He ignited something deep inside her like no other, but there was something more to this brooding bad boy. There was a dark side to him she couldn't help but be drawn to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torn between what she knew about him and a mysterious side he tried to hide, could she walk away or was he simply too hard to resist?</description>

  <description>In a bold political move, Sir Branford claims a handmaid as his bride instead of the expected princess in an attempt to spark a war. Poor Alexandra knows little of how to behave as the wife of a future king and knows nothing of the man who is suddenly her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexandra knows she is being used as a pawn and must do her best to avoid scheming noblewomen and the scorned princess, accept her position as her husband ascends to the throne, and overcome her fears of the man with whom she now shares a bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sir Branford is determined to have it all – the kingdom, a wife of his choosing, and the revenge he seeks for the death of his father. He doesn’t expect the naïve handmaid to become more important than he ever could have foreseen.</description>

  <description>No one knows where the Keepers came from. Not even Lizzy Walters, who has the ability to see both the past and the future. In fact, there is only one thing Lizzy can’t see, and that is the dead. Yet her dreams for more than a hundred years have involved impossible futures with impossible consequences.&lt;br /&gt;But all thoughts of the dead are soon swept aside when a mysterious plaque takes hold of the Weres. Their shifts are killing them, turning the flowing of forms into a death sentence of broken bones and torn bodies.&lt;br /&gt;There is only one person alive capable of saving the Weres, and Georgianna Rose, Crone to all witches, hasn’t been seen in centuries.&lt;br /&gt;Lizzy must race against death to find a witch who doesn’t want to be found, and in the process uncovers truths about the world she may wish had stayed buried.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Four tales never before published by USA Today bestselling author Shay Savage.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An executive in need of some temporary release. A Dom looking to cleanse his soul. A twisted college encounter. A PA and a terrorist’s unlikely meeting during an office building takeover. Four alpha males just waiting to fulfill your fantasies in these hot short stories. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you ready to be Savaged?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Same Time Tomorrow: &lt;/b&gt;Executive Julian Reddick is tired of his brand of hand lotion but doesn’t have time to date. What’s the solution? Call in a “nooner” from a high-class company of ill-repute. Valerie Woods is exactly the distraction he needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cleansing Bonds: &lt;/b&gt;A Dom who had hurt the one he loved and an abused sub looking for release. Both are sure they will never be able to find what they need, but they find healing with each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encounter: &lt;/b&gt;On a weekend night near campus, a college girl walks home alone from the local bar. Who is watching her from the shadows, waiting to take advantage of the situation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Want No More:&lt;/b&gt; Olivia’s new job takes an unexpected turn when terrorists take over her office building. Olivia is taken hostage, but Adam, the sexy head henchman, seems to be exactly what Olivia desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS STORY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What I Want (Want No More from Adam’s POV):&lt;/b&gt; Adam Lebourn’s life for the past three years has lead up to this point, but to exact his revenge on the man who ruined his life, he is going to have to rely on a decent amount of luck.

      <![CDATA[Shay Savage is known for writing romance and erotica with an edge, and this novella sure delivers. It consists of four short stories with different themes, but all with sinfully sexy alpha males. The only story in it that irked me was the one set in college, but this is due to personal tastes.

  <description>He is revered among his kind,&lt;br /&gt;an archangel who can do no wrong.&lt;br /&gt;But when temptations and choices arise,&lt;br /&gt;the pedestal will come crumbling down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Archangel of Death, Jeremy prides himself on his loyalty and high-ranking status amongst his peers. From the outside, it appears as though he deserves the utmost respect and admiration, but he knows the truth—a secret that could destroy his family. Opening up and succumbing to his inner desires would be the ultimate betrayal, a betrayal he can never risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jeremy receives an order he knows will shatter everyone he holds dear, he’s forced to choose between family and duty. His decision shocks everyone, even himself, and leads to inescapable anguish for everyone he loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will the once revered archangel suddenly become one of the fallen?</description>

  &lt;i&gt;**Warning: this book contains an addictively filthy alpha male who will dampen your panties and own your days and nights. Proceed at your own risk.**&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meet Colton Drake&lt;/b&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why she auctioned off her virginity for a cool mill. Regardless, I’m now the proud new owner of a perfectly intact hymen. A lot of good that will do me. I have certain tastes, certain sexual proclivities. My cock is a bit more discriminatory than most. And training a virgin takes finesse and patience – both of which I lack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sophie Evans&lt;/b&gt; has been backed into a corner. With her sister’s life hanging in the balance, the only choice is to claw her way out, even if that means selling her virginity to the highest bidder at an exclusive erotic club. When Colton Drake takes her home, she quickly learns nothing is as it seems with this beautifully troubled man. Being with him poses challenges she never expected, and pushes her to want things she never anticipated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A sinfully seductive erotic romance where everything has a price and the cost of love is the highest of all from New York Times &amp;amp; USA Today bestselling author, Kendall Ryan.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>***A Domino Anthology: 13 Authors ONE story***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verity Michaels is new to New York City, but even she knows riding in a stolen cab is not a normal way to meet someone. Damn it if that tattoo-covered would-be felon isn’t everywhere now, and lighting everything on fire under her skirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His name is Hudson Fenn, and he’s frustratingly impossible to pin down. He works as a bike messenger, but has the manners of a prince—along with a strange tendency toward breaking and entering. As much as Verity knows he’s not her type, and likely to land her in jail, she can’t help but find her truest self when they’re together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can she be brave enough to give Hudson a real chance? Will he be bold enough to reveal the man beneath the ink, or will his secrecy doom their connection? Also, WTF is the deal with Verity’s boss? No less than thirteen of your favorite romance writers have teamed up to tell this sexy, wacky, snort-inducing tale. With them you’ll visit the world’s most irritating office, a VIP room of questionable cleanliness, and the fanciest apartment a bike messenger has ever inhabited, but you’ll still never see this ending coming.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Orange Is the New Black&lt;/i&gt; meets Jennifer Probst's &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Marriage to a Billionaire trilogy, featuring a strong-minded prison tutor who discovers that her sexy bad-boy student is far more than he appears to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by nightmares of her father’s street murder fifteen years ago, Kat Lane decides to face her fears and uphold his legacy of helping others by teaching inmates at a New York prison. There she meets arrogant Wesley Carter, who’s as handsome as he is dangerous, as mysterious as he is quick-witted, and with a reputation that ensures people will keep their distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As teacher and student, Kat and Carter are forced to leave their animosities at the door and learn that one should never judge a book by its cover. As Carter’s barriers begin to crumble, Kat realizes there’s much more to her angry student than she thought, leaving them to face a new, perilous obstacle: their undeniable attraction to one another.</description>

  <description>Welkom in Vigs waanzinnige wereld.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nieuwe ideeën? Nergens voor nodig. Informatie? Onbelangrijk. Het gehalte aan beroemdheden en de mate van hipheid - dat is het enige wat telt als je werkt bij modeglossy Fashionista. En opperste nederigheid tegenover superbitch Jane McNeill, de hoofdredactrice, natuurlijk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ja, om een fashionista te worden, moet je heel wat doorstaan...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vig Morgan is het gelukt het vijf jaar uit te houden; ze is opgeklommen van redactieassistent tot bureauredacteur. Maar om eerlijk te zijn: zo langzamerhand begint ze er aardig genoeg van te krijgen haar leven te vullen met onbenulligheden. Ze wil meer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan, precies op het juiste moment, wordt ze door enkele collega's betrokken bij een waanzinnig complot. En je weet wat ze zeggen: alles is geoorloofd in mode en oorlog...</description>

  <description>The bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Devil Wears Prada&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Everyone Worth Knowing&lt;/i&gt; returns with the story of three best friends who vow to change their entire lives...and change them fast. Emmy is newly single, and not by choice. She was this close to the ring and the baby she's wanted her whole life when her boyfriend left her for his twenty-three-year-old personal trainer - whose fees are paid by Emmy. With her plans for the perfect white wedding in the trash, Emmy is now ordering takeout for one. Her friends insist an around-the-world sex-fueled adventure will solve all her problems - could they be right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leigh, a young star in the publishing business, is within striking distance of landing her dream job as senior editor and marrying her dream guy. And to top it all off, she has just purchased her dream apartment. Only when Leigh begins to edit the enfant terrible of the literary world, the brilliant and brooding Jesse Chapman, does she start to notice some cracks in her perfect life...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adriana is the drop-dead-gorgeous daughter of a famous supermodel. She possesses the kind of feminine wiles made only in Brazil, and she never hesitates to use them. But she's about to turn thirty and - as her mother keeps reminding her - she won't have her pick of the men forever. Everyone knows beauty is ephemeral and there's always someone younger and prettier right around the corner. Suddenly she's wondering...does Mother know best?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These three very different girls have been best friends for a decade in the greatest city on earth. As they near thirty, they're looking toward their future...but despite all they've earned - first-class travel, career promotions, invites to all the right parties, and luxuries small and large - they're not quite sure they like what they see...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Saturday night at the Waverly Inn, Adriana and Emmy make a pact: within a single year, each will drastically change her life. Leigh watches from the sidelines, not making any promises, but she'll soon discover she has the most to lose. Their friendship is forever, but everything else is on the table. Three best friends. Two resolutions. One year to pull it off.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's Note: this is an alternate cover edition - ISBN 10: 0140444173&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;St Petersburg, 1805: a city of glittering parties and socialites. Into this scene step three young people seeking fulfilment in their different ways. Pierre is looking for life's meaning, but his cheating wife is driving him insane. Cynical Andrey is unable to find true love. And Natasha's impulsive and affectionate nature could threaten her future happiness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But their lives - and the lives of so many of their fellow countrymen - are about to change forever. Napoleon's army is approaching, and soon battle and terror will engulf them. They must learn to survive when their world is thrown into total war.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Midnight Sun&lt;/i&gt; is the much anticipated retelling of &lt;i&gt;Twilight&lt;/i&gt; from Edward Cullen's perspective. An unedited partial draft was illegally leaked onto the internet in 2008; consequently, author Stephenie Meyer put the project on indefinite hold. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly afterward, she posted a letter to her fans on her website including a link to the entire partial draft of the book so that those who wanted to read it could do so legally and with her consent; see URL for more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Do not add a cover. Do not add translations. Do not add any other editions.</description>

  <description>To be irrevocably in love with a vampire is both fantasy and nightmare woven into a dangerously heightened reality for Bella Swan. Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for Edward Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob Black, she has endured a tumultuous year of temptation, loss, and strife to reach the ultimate turning point. Her imminent choice to either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or to pursue a fully human life has become the thread from which the fates of two tribes hangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that Bella has made her decision, a startling chain of unprecedented events is about to unfold with potentially devastating and unfathomable, consequences. Just when the frayed strands of Bella's life - first discovered in &lt;i&gt;Twilight&lt;/i&gt;, then scattered and torn in &lt;i&gt;New Moon&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Eclipse&lt;/i&gt; - seem ready to heal and knit together, could they be destroyed... forever?</description>

  <description>“We all lose, son. Either I’ll be in there tonight, or I’ll end up there as one of them when I’m dead.”&lt;br /&gt;When the dead first rose, the world thought they could just kill them. But they only return to their graves with bellies full of flesh and more dead littering the ground. Out of desperation the zombie lottery was born. &lt;br /&gt;One night a year, the dead rise, and every adult gets their name entered into the lottery. No matter their ability, health, or status. The winners are herded to cemeteries and only one will come out alive, but all pray for the scientists working around the clock to find the answer before the killing is done.</description>

  <description>The first night after Caroline moves into her fantastic new San Francisco apartment, she realizes she's gaining an intimate knowledge of her new neighbor's nocturnal adventures. Thanks to paper-thin walls and the guy's athletic prowess, she can hear not just his bed banging against the wall but the ecstatic response of what seems (as loud night after loud night goes by) like an endless parade of women. And since Caroline is currently on a self-imposed dating hiatus, and her neighbor is clearly lethally attractive to women, she finds her fantasies keep her awake even longer than the noise. So when the wallbanging threatens to literally bounce her out of bed, Caroline, clad in sexual frustration and a pink baby-doll nightie, confronts Simon Parker, her heard-but-never-seen neighbor. The tension between them is as thick as the walls are thin, and the results just as mixed. Suddenly, Caroline is finding she may have discovered a whole new definition of neighborly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a delicious mix of silly and steamy, Alice Clayton dishes out a hot and hilarious tale of exasperation at first sight...</description>

  <description>New Hot Standalone from New York Times Bestselling Author Helen Cooper &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was only supposed to be one night &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We met at a wedding. He was hot. And I’d been in a year’s drought. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He smiled. We got drunk. We flirted. We hooked up. I left without early the next morning without saying goodbye. It was only meant to be a one night stand. I didn’t want the awkward morning after moment. Not at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I went home for the weekend. And he was there. Sitting on the couch chatting to my dad. Turns out he was more than just a stranger. Turns out that my one night stand was about to cause a whole heap of trouble. Turns out that it never just stops with one night.</description>

  <description>Ava's life is . . . complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not every day a girl discovers she’s not entirely human and unlocks hidden powers strong enough to make even the First Race take notice. Then again, Ava Michaels is no ordinary girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the Race’s Ruling Council wants her under their control, and that’s just the beginning of her problems. Her boyfriend, Caleb Foster, has disappeared—accused of betraying the Race—and Ava herself is implicated in a crime she didn’t commit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearing their names will mean uncovering a web of deceit and intrigue with Ava woven right in the center. To unravel the strands, she joins forces with some unlikely allies; a Protector who once haunted her nightmares, a young girl with secrets as unexpected as Ava’s, and a group of rebel Guardians who have their own fight against the Council.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together they stand in a battle to find the truth, bring Caleb home, and secure Ava’s freedom—not to mention save her life.</description>

  <description>Ava Michaels is gifted, powerful, and — whether she likes it or not — part of a plot to take over the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s only been a few months since Ava Michaels discovered she has ties to an ancient people living in the shadows of the human world, despite their superior gifts and abilities. A select few don’t like hiding, however, and think it’s time to take control. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Ava’s caught up in a conspiracy in the works before she was even born. In fact, her birth was an integral part of the plan. She’s one of the Twelve, the most powerful Race ever created, and they were created for a purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, Ava doesn’t like being told what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All she wants is to start a new life with her boyfriend, Caleb Foster, but before they can even think about that, they must join forces with former enemies, seek out some powerful new friends, and figure out what exactly the Twelve, and their power-hungry leader, are up to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, they have to find a way to stop them.</description>

  <description>I have to be the best. I am the best. I'm quick. I'm strong. I'm smart. I'm the star keeper of my high school soccer team, and I've got major leagues scouting me. As their captain, my teammates will do anything I say - on or off the field. Girls practically beg to be added to my list of conquests. As long as I manage to go pro for the best team in the world, I won't have to worry about my father's wrath. I'm Thomas Malone, and I've seen to it that the world revolves around me. There's a new girl at school, and it's just a matter of time before she gives in to my charm. This one's just a little more stubborn than most - she won't even tell me her name! She's smart, too. Maybe too smart. I can't let her in. I can't let anybody in. I'm not too worried, but even I have to admit she's interfering with my focus on the goal. Dad's not going to be happy about that. Did I mention I love Shakespeare? Yeah, I know. I'm a walking contradiction. According to the Bard - "some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them." Somehow, I got all three. Now how is anyone supposed to live up to that?</description>

  <description>It’s said that women and men are from two different planets when it comes to communication, but how can they overcome the obstacles of prehistoric times when one of them simply doesn’t have the ability to comprehend language?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ehd’s a caveman living on his own in a harsh wilderness. He’s strong and intelligent, but completely alone. When he finds a beautiful young woman in his pit trap, it’s obvious to him that she is meant to be his mate. He doesn’t know where she came from; she’s wearing some pretty odd clothing, and she makes a lot of noises with her mouth that give him a headache. Still, he’s determined to fulfill his purpose in life – provide for her, protect her, and put a baby in her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth doesn’t know where she is or exactly how she got there. She’s confused and distressed by her predicament, and there’s a caveman hauling her back to his cavehome. She’s not at all interested in Ehd’s primitive advances, and she just can’t seem to get him to listen. No matter what she tries, getting her point across to this primitive, but beautiful, man is a constant – and often hilarious – struggle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only each other for company, they must rely on one another to fight the dangers of the wild and prepare for the winter months. As they struggle to coexist, theirs becomes a love story that transcends language and time.</description>
