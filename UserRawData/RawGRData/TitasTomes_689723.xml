  <description>&lt;b&gt;A poetic response to the tumult of a move across country&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;One Thing — Then Another&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of poetry divided into three unique sections: "East" explores the constraints of living under the poverty line in a have-not province. "And" is a long poem about moving in a U-Haul across the prairies during an ice storm. "West" considers what it means to live in the have-est of have provinces and trying to acclimate to that alongside an ever-present drought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The poems are largely about contrast: east to west, flood to aridity, poverty to comfort, small town to city. Throughout this accessible, smart, and funny collection, there are many descriptions of apocalyptic upheaval to reflect the feelings of disruption that often accompany relocation.</description>

  <description>In 1962, at the age of eleven, Carlos Eire was one of 14,000 children airlifted out of Cuba, his parents left behind. His life until then is the subject of &lt;i&gt;Waiting for Snow in Havana,&lt;/i&gt; a wry, heartbreaking, intoxicatingly beautiful memoir of growing up in a privileged Havana household -- and of being exiled from his own childhood by the Cuban revolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That childhood, until his world changes, is as joyous and troubled as any other -- but with exotic differences. Lizards roam the house and grounds. Fights aren't waged with snowballs but with breadfruit. The rich are outlandishly rich, like the eight-year-old son of a sugar baron who has a real miniature race car, or the neighbor with a private animal garden, complete with tiger. All this is bathed in sunlight and shades of turquoise and tangerine: the island of Cuba, says one of the stern monks at Carlos's school, might have been the original Paradise -- and it is tempting to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His father is a municipal judge and an obsessive collector of art and antiques, convinced that in a past life he was Louis XVI and that his wife was Marie Antoinette. His mother looks to the future; conceived on a transatlantic liner bound for Cuba from Spain, she wants her children to be modern, which means embracing all things American. His older brother electrocutes lizards. Surrounded by eccentrics, in a home crammed with portraits of Jesus that speak to him in dreams and nightmares, Carlos searches for secret proofs of the existence of God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, in January 1959, President Batista is suddenly gone, a cigar-smoking guerrilla named Castro has taken his place, and Christmas is canceled. The echo of firingsquads is everywhere. At the Aquarium of the Revolution, sharks multiply in a swimming pool. And one by one, the author's schoolmates begin to disappear -- spirited away to the United States. Carlos will end up there himself, alone, never to see his father again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Narrated with the urgency of a confession, &lt;i&gt;Waiting for Snow in Havana&lt;/i&gt; is both an exorcism and an ode to a paradise lost. More than that, it captures the terrible beauty of those times in our lives when we are certain we have died -- and then are somehow, miraculously, reborn.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A startling, moving, and innovative memoir from the National Book Award Finalist for Fiction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years Carmen Maria Machado has struggled to articulate her experiences in an abusive same-sex relationship. In this extraordinarily candid and radically inventive memoir, Machado tackles a dark and difficult subject with wit, inventiveness and an inquiring spirit, as she uses a series of narrative tropes—including classic horror themes—to create an entirely unique piece of work which is destined to become an instant classic.</description>

  <description>With intimacy and humour award-winning poet Ariel Gordon walks us through the streets of Winnipeg and into the urban forest that is, to her, the city’s heart. Along the way she shares with us the lives of these urban trees, from the grackles and cankerworms of the spring, to the flush of mushrooms on stumps in the summer and through to the red-stemmed dogwood of the winter. After grounding us in native elms and ashes, Gordon travels to BC's northern Rockies, to Banff National Park and a cattle farm in rural Manitoba, and helps us to consider what we expect of nature. Whether it is the effects of climate change on the urban forest or foraging in the city, Dutch elm disease in the trees or squirrels in the living room, Gordon delves into our relationships with the natural world with heart and style. In the end, the essays circle back to the forest, where the weather is always better and where the reader can see how to remake even the trees that are lost.With intimacy and humour, award-winning poet Ariel Gordon walks us through the streets of Winnipeg and into the urban forest that is, to her, the city’s heart. Along the way she shares with us the lives of these urban trees, from the grackles and caterpillars of the spring to the red-stemmed dogwood of the winter and helps us to consider what we expect of nature. Whether it is the fogging of mosquitoes, family farms and their futures, or infestations of teenagers at a lake when she is looking for quiet, Gordon delves into our relationships with the natural world with heart and style. In the end, the essays circle back to the forest, where the weather is always better and where the reader can see how to remake even the trees that are lost.</description>

  <description>In this stunning graphic novel, Lacuna is a girl without a family, a past, or a proper home. She lives alone in a swamp made of ink, but with the help of Polaris, a will-o'-the-wisp, she embarks for the fabled Northern Kingdom, where she might find people like her. The only way to get there, though, is to travel the strange and dangerous Blue Road that stretches to the horizon like a mark upon a page. Along the way, Lacuna must overcome trials such as the twisted briars of the Thicket of Tickets and the intractable guard at the Rainbow Border. At the end of her treacherous journey, she reaches a city where memory and vision can be turned against you, in a world of dazzling beauty, divisive magic, and unlikely deliverance. Finally, Lacuna learns that leaving, arriving, returning -- they're all just different words for the same thing: starting all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Blue Road&lt;/i&gt; -- the first graphic novel by acclaimed poet and prose writer Wayde Compton and illustrator April dela Noche Milne -- explores the world from a migrant's perspective with dreamlike wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ages 12 and up.</description>

  <description>In 1889, Saskatoon was no more than a few wooden houses and false-fronted shops. There were no bridges, no railway, or even a school. There was little reason to believe Saskatoon would be much different than any other Prairie town. Saskatoon not only survived, it thrived. Saskatoon tells the story of the dreams and determination of the people that built this city into the most dynamic city on the Prairies.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Cherie Priest, the author of &lt;i&gt;The Family Plot&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Maplecroft&lt;/i&gt;, comes &lt;i&gt;The Toll&lt;/i&gt;, a tense, dark, and scary treat for modern fans of the traditionally strange and macabre.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;State Road 177 runs along the Suwannee River, between Fargo, Georgia, and the Okefenokee Swamp. Drive that route from east to west, and you’ll cross six bridges. Take it from west to east, and you might find seven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you’d better hope not.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Titus and Davina Bell leave their hotel in Fargo for a second honeymoon canoeing the Okefenokee Swamp. But shortly before they reach their destination, they draw up to a halt at the edge of a rickety bridge with old stone pilings, with room for only one car . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When, much later, a tow-truck arrives, the driver finds Titus lying in the middle of the road, but Davina is nowhere to be found.</description>

  <description>An unconventional social history, Red Lights on the Prairies takes a lively look at the history of prostitution in prairie cities in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. &lt;br /&gt;This lighthearted yet insightful book tells how the West became overrun with brothels when huge tides of immigrants- mostly unattached young men in the prime of life- swept into the region as settlers. Unlike many histories of this era, it focuses on the prairie cities and towns that were home to the bars, brothels and poolrooms, and describes the efforts of the police, clergy and moral reformers, who were periodically outraged by the rowdy behaviour in the bawdy houses. &lt;br /&gt;In this ground-breaking book, James Gray draws upon local newspapers of the time, the accounts of several former madams, and the reminiscences of old-timers who had been youths at the turn of the century to produce a vivid and authentic book at a colourful and offbeat aspect of our past. &lt;br /&gt;Like its companion book, Booze, also by James Gray, Red Lights on the Prairies was a huge success when it was first published, selling more than 100,000 copies throughout North America&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>He has hunted some of the most notorious and sadistic criminals of our time: The Trailside Killer in San Francisco, the Atlanta Child murderer. He has confronted, interviewed and researched dozens of serial killers and assassins, including Charles Manson, Richard Speck, John Wayne Gacy, and James Earl Ray - for a landmark study to understand their motives. To get inside their minds. He is Special Agent John Douglas, the model for law enforcement legend Jack Crawford in Thomas Harris's thrillers &lt;i&gt;Red Dragon&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Silence of the Lambs&lt;/i&gt;, and the man who ushered in a new age in behavorial science and criminal profiling. Recently retired after twenty-five years of service, John Douglas can finally tell his unique and compelling story.</description>

  <description>Long recognized as a master teacher at writing programs like VONA, the Loft, and the Stonecoast MFA, with &lt;i&gt;A Stranger's Journey&lt;/i&gt;, David Mura has written a book on creative writing that addresses our increasingly diverse American literature. Mura argues for a more inclusive and expansive definition of craft, particularly in relationship to race, even as he elucidates timeless rules of narrative construction in fiction and memoir. His essays offer technique-focused readings of writers such as James Baldwin, ZZ Packer, Maxine Hong Kingston, Mary Karr, and Garrett Hongo, while making compelling connections to Mura's own life and work as a Japanese American writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;A Stranger's Journey&lt;/i&gt;, Mura poses two central questions. The first involves identity: How is writing an exploration of who one is and one's place in the world? Mura examines how the myriad identities in our changing contemporary canon have led to new challenges regarding both craft and pedagogy. Here, like Toni Morrison's &lt;i&gt;Playing in the Dark&lt;/i&gt; or Jeff Chang's &lt;i&gt;Who We Be&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;A Stranger's Journey&lt;/i&gt; breaks new ground in our understanding of the relationship between the issues of race, literature, and culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book's second central question involves structure: How does one tell a story? Mura provides clear, insightful narrative tools that any writer may use, taking in techniques from fiction, screenplays, playwriting, and myth. Through this process, Mura candidly explores the newly evolved aesthetic principles of memoir and how questions of identity occupy a central place in contemporary memoir.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Dads can be such a drag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life has been a struggle for Toby Goodman. Her mother died by suicide five years ago, and her father left their small town before Toby was born. Now a teenager living on her grandparents’ dairy farm, Toby has trouble letting people in. She keeps even her closest friend, the brash but endearing Trisha, at arms’ length, and recently ended her first relationship, with Trisha’s burnout brother, Mike. Convinced that she is destined to follow her mother’s path, Toby creates a plan to escape her pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with the news that her father is coming home and finally wants to meet her, Toby must face the truth of her family’s story. Not only is her father gay, but he’s also a world-famous female impersonator—and a self-absorbed, temperamental man-child who is ill-prepared to be a real parent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Toby’s careful plans go awry, she is forced to rebuild the life she thought she knew from the ground up. While she may not follow an expected path, through the support of a quirky but lovable circle of friends and family, Toby may finally put together the many different pieces that make up her past, her present, and her future.</description>

  <description>Set in Calgary in 1982, in the wake of the recession that arrived on the heels of Canada’s 1980 National Energy Program, The Western Alienation Merit Badge tells the story of the Murray family who are struggling with grief and the very real possibility of financial ruin. After the death of her stepmother Frances Murray is called back to Calgary to help her father, Jimmy, and sister, Bernadette, make the mortgage on the family home. When Robyn, a long lost friend, becomes their house guest tensions are ignited and Jimmy, Bernadette and Frances find themselves increasingly estranged from one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Murrays, history has a way of repeating itself and as each of them wrestles with their own secrets they find themselves unable to forget and unwilling to forgive one another. Part family drama, part queer coming-of-age story, The Western Alienation Merit Badge explores the dynamics of a small family falling apart.</description>

  <description>HOW DOES ONE SURVIVE WHEN ALL HOPE IS LOST? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the middle of the night in 1997, Doctors Without Borders administrator Christophe André was kidnapped by armed men and taken away to an unknown destination in the Caucasus region. For three months, André was kept handcuffed in solitary confinement, with little to survive on and almost no contact with the outside world. Close to twenty years later, award-winning cartoonist Guy Delisle (&lt;i&gt;Pyongyang, Jerusalem, Shenzhen, Burma Chronicles&lt;/i&gt;) recounts André’s harrowing experience in &lt;i&gt;Hostage&lt;/i&gt;, a book that attests to the power of one man’s determination in the face of a hopeless situation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marking a departure from the author’s celebrated first-person travelogues, Delisle tells the story through the perspective of the titular captive, who strives to keep his mind alert as desperation starts to set in. Working in a pared down style with muted colour washes, Delisle conveys the psychological effects of solitary confinement, compelling us to ask ourselves some difficult questions regarding the repercussions of negotiating with kidnappers and what it really means to be free. Thoughtful, intense, and moving, &lt;i&gt;Hostage&lt;/i&gt; takes a profound look at what drives our will to survive in the darkest of moments.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“It is my honor to introduce these pages—so gravelly, so straggly, so hopeful, bright, and true.”  —Elizabeth Gilbert &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When she was seven, Rayya Elias and her family fled the political conflict in their native Syria, settling in Detroit. Bullied in school and caught between the world of her traditional family and her tough American classmates, she rebelled early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Elias moved to New York City to become a musician and kept herself afloat with an uncommon talent for cutting hair. At the height of the punk movement, life on the Lower East Side was full of adventure, creative inspiration, and temptation. Eventually, Elias’s passionate affairs with lovers of both sexes went awry, her (more than) occasional drug use turned to addiction, and she found herself living on the streets—between her visits to jail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This debut memoir charts four decades of a life lived in the moment, a path from harrowing loss and darkness to a place of peace and redemption. Elias’s wit and lack of self-pity in the face of her extreme highs and lows make &lt;i&gt;Harley Loco&lt;/i&gt; a powerful read that’s sure to appeal to fans of Patti Smith, Augusten Burroughs, and Eleanor Henderson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lambda Literary Award finalist&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1996, poet Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha ran away from America with two backpacks and ended up in Canada, where she discovered queer anarchopunk love and revolution, yet remained haunted by the reasons she left home in the first place. This passionate and riveting memoir is a mixtape of dreams and nightmares, of immigration court lineups and queer South Asian dance nights; it reveals how a disabled queer woman of color and abuse survivor navigates the dirty river of the past and, as the subtitle suggests, "dreams her way home."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha&lt;/b&gt;'s poetry book &lt;i&gt;Love Cake &lt;/i&gt;won a Lambda Literary Award.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A masterful true crime account of the Golden State Killer—the elusive serial rapist turned murderer who terrorized California for over a decade—from Michelle McNamara, the gifted journalist who died tragically while investigating the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;"You’ll be silent forever, and I’ll be gone in the dark."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more than ten years, a mysterious and violent predator committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before moving south, where he perpetrated ten sadistic murders. Then he disappeared, eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three decades later, Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, was determined to find the violent psychopath she called "the Golden State Killer." Michelle pored over police reports, interviewed victims, and embedded herself in the online communities that were as obsessed with the case as she was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time of the crimes, the Golden State Killer was between the ages of eighteen and thirty, Caucasian, and athletic—capable of vaulting tall fences. He always wore a mask. After choosing a victim—he favored suburban couples—he often entered their home when no one was there, studying family pictures, mastering the layout. He attacked while they slept, using a flashlight to awaken and blind them. Though they could not recognize him, his victims recalled his voice: a guttural whisper through clenched teeth, abrupt and threatening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll Be Gone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;—the masterpiece McNamara was writing at the time of her sudden death—offers an atmospheric snapshot of a moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a portrait of a woman’s obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. Framed by an introduction by Gillian Flynn and an afterword by her husband, Patton Oswalt, the book was completed by Michelle’s lead researcher and a close colleague. Utterly original and compelling, it is destined to become a true crime classic—and may at last unmask the Golden State Killer.</description>

      <![CDATA[Some masterful reporting and editing in here. I think the book suffered because of the author's unexpected death, but there was still some great stuff in here. And it was really creepy too!<br /><br />A worthwhile addition to the true crime genre. And so glad that the perpetuator was caught after...]]>

  <description>It's the summer of 1990 and Crystal Beach has lost its beloved, long-running amusement park, leaving the lakeside village a virtual ghost town. It is back to this fallen community that Starla Mia Martin must return to live with her overbearing mother after dropping out of university and racking up significant debt. But an economic downturn, mother-daughter drama, and Generation X disillusionment soon prove to be to be the least of Starla's troubles. A mysterious and salacious force begins to dog her; inexplicable sounds in the night and indescribable sights spotted in the periphery. Soon enough, Starla must confront the unresolved traumas that haunt Crystal Beach. &lt;i&gt;Sodom Road Exit&lt;/i&gt; might read like a conventional paranormal thriller, except that Starla is far from a conventional protagonist. Where others might feel fear, Starla feels lust and queer desire. When others might run, Starla draws the horror nearer. And in turn, she draws a host of capricious characters toward her--all of them challenged to seek answers beyond their own temporal realities. &lt;i&gt;Sodom Road Exit&lt;/i&gt;, the second novel by Lambda Literary Award winner Amber Dawn, is a book that's alive with both desire and dread.</description>

  <description>A visionary new master class in cooking that distills decades of professional experience into just four simple elements, from the woman declared “America’s next great cooking teacher” by Alice Waters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the tradition of &lt;i&gt;The Joy of Cooking&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;How to Cook Everything&lt;/i&gt; comes &lt;i&gt;Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat&lt;/i&gt;, an ambitious new approach to cooking by a major new culinary voice. Chef and writer Samin Nosrat has taught everyone from professional chefs to middle school kids to author Michael Pollan to cook using her revolutionary, yet simple, philosophy. Master the use of just four elements—Salt, which enhances flavor; Fat, which delivers flavor and generates texture; Acid, which balances flavor; and Heat, which ultimately determines the texture of food—and anything you cook will be delicious. By explaining the hows and whys of good cooking, &lt;i&gt;Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat&lt;/i&gt; will teach and inspire a new generation of cooks how to confidently make better decisions in the kitchen and cook delicious meals with any ingredients, anywhere, at any time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Echoing Samin’s own journey from culinary novice to award-winning chef, &lt;i&gt;Salt, Fat Acid, Heat&lt;/i&gt; immediately bridges the gap between home and professional kitchens. With charming narrative, illustrated walkthroughs, and a lighthearted approach to kitchen science, Samin demystifies the four elements of good cooking for everyone. Refer to the canon of 100 essential recipes—and dozens of variations—to put the lessons into practice and make bright, balanced vinaigrettes, perfectly caramelized roast vegetables, tender braised meats, and light, flaky pastry doughs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring 150 illustrations and infographics that reveal an atlas to the world of flavor by renowned illustrator Wendy MacNaughton, &lt;i&gt;Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat&lt;/i&gt; will be your compass in the kitchen. Destined to be a classic, it just might be the last cookbook you’ll ever need. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a foreword by Michael Pollan.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;An inspirational story of accepting and embracing two trans people in a family--a family who shows what's possible when you "lead with love.&lt;/b&gt;"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Amanda Jett� Knox ever wanted was to enjoy a stable life. She never knew her biological father, and while her mother and stepfather were loving parents, the situation was sometimes chaotic. At school, she was bullied mercilessly, and at the age of fourteen, she entered a counselling program for alcohol addiction and was successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While still a teenager, she met the love of her life. They were wed at 20, and the first of three children followed shortly. Jett� Knox finally had the stability she craved--or so it seemed. Their middle child struggled with depression and avoided school. The author was unprepared when the child she knew as her son came out as transgender at the age of eleven. Shocked, but knowing how important it was to support her daughter, Jett� Knox became an ardent advocate for trans rights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the story wasn't over. For many years, the author had coped with her spouse's moodiness, but that chronic unhappiness was taking a toll on their marriage. A little over a year after their child came out, her partner also came out as transgender. Knowing better than most what would lie ahead, Jett� Knox searched for positive examples of marriages surviving transition. When she found no role models, she determined that her family would become one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shift was challenging, but slowly the family members noticed that they were becoming happier and more united. Told with remarkable candour and humour&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;and full of insight into the challenges faced by trans people&lt;i&gt;, Love Lives Here&lt;/i&gt; is a beautiful story of transition, frustration, support, acceptance, and, of course, love.</description>

      <![CDATA[Really enjoyed this book. I actually read it in one day. It's the story of a woman who had a tough childhood. She gets married and has three children, but things are not right. Then her middle child reveals that she is a transgender girl, and the family adjusts to this shift. A year or so later,...]]>

  <description>In their own words, the incarcerated, the formerly incarcerated, and those who love them in this moving anthology explore the complex realities of marriages and relationships lived in the long shadow of prison. Defying the frightening myths and stereotypes to which the media and society have reduced them, the people in this collection eloquently tell their own stories and speak their own truths.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The extraordinary new novel from the acclaimed writer whose previous book, &lt;i&gt;Martin John&lt;/i&gt;, was shortlisted for the Giller Prize, and whose debut, &lt;i&gt;Malarky&lt;/i&gt;, won the Amazon First Novel Award&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"My name is Bina and I'm a very busy woman. That's Bye-na, not Beena. I don't know who Beena is but I expect she's having a happy life. I don't know who you are, or the state of your life. But if you've come all this way here to listen to me, your life will undoubtedly get worse. I'm here to warn you ..."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins this "novel in warnings"--an unforgettable tour de force in the voice of an ordinary-extraordinary woman who has simply had enough. Through the character of Bina, who is writing out her story on the backs of discarded envelopes, Anakana Schofield filters a complex moral universe filled with humour and sadness, love and rage, and the consolations, obligations and mysteries of lifelong friendship. A work of great power, skill, and transformative empathy from a unique and astonishing writer, whose previous book, &lt;i&gt;Martin John&lt;/i&gt;, was shortlisted for the Giller Prize, and whose debut, &lt;i&gt;Malarky&lt;/i&gt;, won the Amazon First Novel Award.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Anakana Schofield's &lt;i&gt;Bina&lt;/i&gt; is a fiction of the rarest and darkest kind, a work whose pleasures must be taken measure for measure with its pains. Few writers operate the scales of justice with more precision, and Schofield is no less exacting in what she chooses to weigh. The novel's themes--male violence, the nature of moral courage, the contemporary problems of truth and individuality, the status of the female voice--could hardly be more timely or germane. Schofield's sense of injustice is unblinking and without illusion, yet her writing is so vivacious, so full of interest and lust for life: she is the most compassionate of storytellers, wearing the guise of the blackest comedian." --Rachel Cusk, Giller Prize-shortlisted author of &lt;i&gt;Outline&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Transit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Intimate, disarming, and riotous, &lt;i&gt;Bina&lt;/i&gt; is a searing exploration of one woman's soul that unwinds like a reluctant confession. Whether &lt;i&gt;Bina&lt;/i&gt; is rescuing a ne'er-do-well from a ditch, taking a hammer to a plane or considering the dark request of her best friend, Schofield has created a compelling, practical everywoman--someone who has had enough and is ready to make a spectacle." --Eden Robinson, Giller Prize-shortlisted author of &lt;i&gt;Son of a Trickster&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Monkey Beach&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Insightful. Inventive. Hilarious. Genius." --Eimear McBride, author of &lt;i&gt;A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing&lt;/i&gt;, winner of the Bailey's Prize for Women's Fiction, and &lt;i&gt;The Lesser Bohemians&lt;/i&gt;, winner of the James Tait Memorial Prize&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[The voice in this book was great, and the subject matter was intriguing for me. I think this was a fantastic book.<br /><br />That said, I'm really bad at reading experimental fiction. It's very difficult for me to follow. So my enjoyment was only 3 stars. But I still think was a masterful book....]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A vibrant, compelling memoir from a remarkable young woman that bravely reveals the real-life havoc wrought by depression and the urgent search for solutions. Illuminating, completely engaging—it's essential reading for all since we all know someone whose life, family or friends are touched by the disease that directly afflicts a fifth of Canadians.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her early twenties, while outwardly thriving in her dream job and enjoying warm familial support and a strong social network, award-winning journalist Anna Mehler Paperny found herself trapped by feelings of failure and despair. Her first suicide attempt—ingesting a deadly mix of sleeping pills and antifreeze—landed her in the ICU, followed by weeks of enforced detention that ran the gamut of horrifying, boring, hilarious, and absurd. This was Anna's entry into the labyrinthine psychiatric care system responsible for providing care to millions of Canadians.&lt;br /&gt; As she struggled to survive the psych ward and as an outpatient—enduring the "survivor's" shame of facing concerned family, friends, and co-workers; finding (or not) the right therapist, the right meds; staying healthy, insured, and employed—Anna could not help but turn her demanding journalist's eye on her condition and on the system in which she found herself. She set off on a quest to "know her enemy," interviewing leading practitioners in the field across Canada and the US—from psychiatrists to neurological experts, brain-mapping pioneers to heroic family practitioners, and others dabbling in novel hypotheses. She reveals in courageously frank detail her own experiences with the pharmacological pitfalls and side effects of long-term treatment, and offers moving case studies of conversations with others, opening wide a window into how we treat (and fail to treat) the disease that accounts for more years swallowed up by disability than any other in the world.</description>

  <description>Imagine a world where your phone is too big for your hand, where your doctor prescribes a drug that is wrong for your body, where in a car accident you are 47% more likely to be seriously injured, where every week the countless hours of work you do are not recognised or valued. If any of this sounds familiar, chances are that you're a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invisible Women shows us how, in a world largely built for and by men, we are systematically ignoring half the population. It exposes the gender data gap – a gap in our knowledge that is at the root of perpetual, systemic discrimination against women, and that has created a pervasive but invisible bias with a profound effect on women’s lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Award-winning campaigner and writer Caroline Criado Perez brings together for the first time an impressive range of case studies, stories and new research from across the world that illustrate the hidden ways in which women are forgotten, and the impact this has on their health and well-being. From government policy and medical research, to technology, workplaces, urban planning and the media, Invisible Women reveals the biased data that excludes women. In making the case for change, this powerful and provocative book will make you see the world anew.</description>

Criado-Perez points out how many things are designed without women in mind, and it's hard not to get mad while you read this book.

  <description>Growing up in the tiny village of Smith, Alberta, Darrel J. McLeod was surrounded by his Cree family’s history. In shifting and unpredictable stories, his mother, Bertha, shared narratives of their culture, their family and the cruelty that she and her sisters endured in residential school. McLeod was comforted by her presence and that of his many siblings and cousins, the smells of moose stew and wild peppermint tea, and his deep love of the landscape. Bertha taught him to be fiercely proud of his heritage and to listen to the birds that would return to watch over and guide him at key junctures of his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in a spiral of events, Darrel’s mother turned wild and unstable, and their home life became chaotic. Sweet and innocent by nature, Darrel struggled to maintain his grades and pursue an interest in music while changing homes many times, witnessing violence, caring for his younger siblings and suffering abuse at the hands of his surrogate father. Meanwhile, his sibling’s gender transition provoked Darrel to deeply question his own sexual identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fractured narrative of &lt;em&gt;Mamaskatch&lt;/em&gt; mirrors Bertha’s attempts to reckon with the trauma and abuse she faced in her own life, and captures an intensely moving portrait of a family of strong personalities, deep ties and the shared history that both binds and haunts them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully written, honest and thought-provoking, &lt;em&gt;Mamaskatch&lt;/em&gt;—named for the Cree word used as a response to dreams shared—is ultimately an uplifting account of overcoming personal and societal obstacles. In spite of the traumas of Darrel’s childhood, deep and mysterious forces handed down by his mother helped him survive and thrive: her love and strength stayed with him to build the foundation of what would come to be a very fulfilling and adventurous life.</description>

      <![CDATA[A very beautiful and painful memoir about growing up Cree in Alberta and BC. Darrel was very honest and true, and he really shows how trauma can be passed down. Great writing. I look forward to more from him. ]]>

  <description>Laura Dean, the most popular girl in high school, was Frederica Riley's dream girl: charming, confident, and SO cute. There's just one problem: Laura Dean is maybe not the greatest girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reeling from her latest break up, Freddy's best friend, Doodle, introduces her to the Seek-Her, a mysterious medium, who leaves Freddy some cryptic parting words: break up with her. But Laura Dean keeps coming back, and as their relationship spirals further out of her control, Freddy has to wonder if it's really Laura Dean that's the problem. Maybe it's Freddy, who is rapidly losing her friends, including Doodle, who needs her now more than ever. Fortunately for Freddy, there are new friends, and the insight of advice columnists like Anna Vice to help her through being a teenager in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mariko Tamaki and Rosemary Valero-O’Connell bring to life a sweet and spirited tale of young love that asks us to consider what happens when we ditch the toxic relationships we crave to embrace the healthy ones we need.</description>

  <description>There is beauty in the teacup like dresses requiring crinoline or beaded purses too small to carry anything but anger. --from "Inheritance" A window into the complex and disordered lives of middle age, Marita Dachsel's third poetry collection draws from her own history and explores parenthood, love, and the grief of losing those both close and distant. In the tradition of Karen Solie and Suzanne Buffam--and a touch of the Canadian Gothic--Dachsel unfolds her poetic skills in a variety of brief and expansive forms. With a voice that is both authentic and controlled, her poems offer a type of release despite their painful twists and topics. Readers working through their own personal losses and daily stresses will be grateful for and find a kinship in Dachsel's grief-fuelled and vulnerable poetics.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In 1960s Florida, a young Cuban exile will risk her life--and heart--to take back her country in this exhilarating historical novel from the author of &lt;i&gt;Next Year in Havana&lt;/i&gt;, a Reese Witherspoon Book Club pick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beautiful. Daring. Deadly. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cuban Revolution took everything from sugar heiress Beatriz Perez--her family, her people, her country. Recruited by the CIA to infiltrate Fidel Castro's inner circle and pulled into the dangerous world of espionage, Beatriz is consumed by her quest for revenge and her desire to reclaim the life she lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Cold War swells like a hurricane over the shores of the Florida Strait, Beatriz is caught between the clash of Cuban American politics and the perils of a forbidden affair with a powerful man driven by ambitions of his own. When the ever-changing tides of history threaten everything she has fought for, she must make a choice between her past and future--but the wrong move could cost Beatriz everything--not just the island she loves, but also the man who has stolen her heart...</description>

  <description>At school Connell and Marianne pretend not to know each other. He’s popular and well-adjusted, star of the school soccer team while she is lonely, proud, and intensely private. But when Connell comes to pick his mother up from her housekeeping job at Marianne’s house, a strange and indelible connection grows between the two teenagers—one they are determined to conceal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, they’re both studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Marianne has found her feet in a new social world while Connell hangs at the sidelines, shy and uncertain. Throughout their years in college, Marianne and Connell circle one another, straying toward other people and possibilities but always magnetically, irresistibly drawn back together. Then, as she veers into self-destruction and he begins to search for meaning elsewhere, each must confront how far they are willing to go to save the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Rooney brings her brilliant psychological acuity and perfectly spare prose to a story that explores the subtleties of class, the electricity of first love, and the complex entanglements of family and friendship.</description>

  <description>In 1858, gold was discovered in the Fraser River. News of this discovery travelled to the Pearl River Delta, where, in the aftermath of the Opium Wars, many Chinese sought to escape the poverty, overcrowding, political unrest and even slavery. This tumultuous period marked the beginning of Chinese migration to Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, white settlers welcomed the cheap labour provided by these "coolie labourers," but as the gold rushes came to an end, so did this period of relative peace. Soon, white settlers viewed the Chinese settlers' acceptance of lower wages for longer hours of work as a threat to their livelihoods. Anti-Chinese organizations formed and pressed politicians to exclude Chinese from government work and restrict Chinese immigration. After British Columbia entered confederation in 1871, politicians would not receive support from white settlers unless they condemned Chinese migrants as "the grasshoppers" of BC, a plague that would eventually devour the province. For the century that followed, segregation and discrimination against the Chinese would be a hallmark of white citizens of Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT FORTUNE DREAM: THE STRUGGLES AND TRIUMPHS OF CHINESE SETTLERS IN CANADA, 1858-1966 describes Chinese migration and life in Canada according to the four periods of Canada's policies on Chinese immigration, ranging from Free Entry to Exclusion. In 1967, the Canadian government adopted a universal immigration policy, ending these discriminatory laws and advocating multiculturalism. GREAT FORTUNE DREAM is also the story of the changing relationship with China, both for Chinese migrants and for other Canadians. What began as a population of displaced Chinese migrants working to save their great fortune for a better life back in China evolved into a community of Chinese Canadians, one with roots firmly planted in the history and culture of Canada.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Our Familiar Hunger&lt;/em&gt; is a book about the strength, will, struggle and fortitude of generations of women and how those relationships and knowledges interact, inform, transform and burden. These poems are memories of reclaimed history and attempts at starting over in a new place. They are the fractured reality of trickle-down inheritance, studies of the epigenetic grief we carry and the myriad ways that interferes or interprets our best attempts.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;We're All in This Together&lt;/i&gt; comes a novel about family, friendship, fame, and the cost of living in the public eye -- because when everyone suddenly knows your name, it's easy to forget who you really are.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"The first time they met, Mags saved Ava's life. The second time they met, Ava saved Mags's."&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ava Hart is the most reluctant cast member of a reality TV show based on her big city family's (mostly staged) efforts to run a B&amp;amp;B in small-town Nova Scotia. Every family has its problems, but Ava has grown up seeing her family's every up and down broadcast on national television, after the show becomes an unexpected success for reasons that will take a heavy toll on the Harts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mags Kovach is the charismatic lead singer of a struggling Halifax rock band hoping to be the Next Big Thing. For years she's managed to contain her demons and navigate the uglier aspects of being a woman in the music world, but after a devastating loss, she turns her anger on the only person she can: herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their private tragedies continue to set social media and tabloid headlines on fire, their every move subjected to an endless stream of public commentary, it will be their unexpected friendship that will save them. They will push back against the roles they've been forced to play, and take back control of something they thought they'd lost forever -- the right to their own stories.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An Acknowledged Classic returns gorgeously re-designed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his first graphic novel, &lt;i&gt;It's a Good Life, if You Don't Weaken&lt;/i&gt;--one of the best-selling D &amp;amp; Q titles ever--Seth pays homage to the wit and sophistication of the old-fashioned magazine cartoon. While trying to understand his dissatisfaction with the present, Seth discovers the life and work of Kalo, a forgotten &lt;i&gt;New Yorker &lt;/i&gt;cartoonist from the 1940s. But his obsession blinds him to the needs of his lover and the quiet desperation of his family. Wry self-reflection and moody colours characterize Seth's style in this tale about learning lessons from nostalgia. His playful and sophisticated experiment with memoir provoked a furious debate among cartoon historians and archivists about the existence of Kalo, and prompted a &lt;i&gt;Details&lt;/i&gt; feature about Seth's "hoax".</description>

  <description>This is the story of how a young northern girl picked herself up out of the rough and polished herself off like the diamond that she is in the land of the midnight sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Northern Wildflower&lt;/em&gt; is the beautifully written and powerful memoir of Catherine Lafferty. With startling honesty and a distinct, occasionally humorous, voice, Lafferty tells her story of being a Dene woman growing up in a small northern Canadian mining town and her struggles with discrimination, poverty, addiction, love and loss. Focusing on the importance of family ties, education, spiritualism, cultural identity, health and happiness, the relentless pursuit of success and the courage to speak the truth, Lafferty's words bring cultural awareness and relativity to Indigenous and non-Indigenous readers alike, giving insight into the real issues many Indigenous women face.</description>

  <description>In the follow-up to his Griffin Poetry Prize–winning collection, &lt;em&gt;This Wound is a World&lt;/em&gt;, Billy-Ray Belcourt writes using the modes of accusation and interrogation. He aims an anthropological eye at the realities of everyday life to show how they house the violence that continues to reverberate from the long twentieth century. In a genre-bending constellation of poetry, photography, redaction, and poetics, Belcourt ultimately argues that if signifiers of Indigenous suffering are everywhere, so too is evidence of Indigenous peoples’ rogue possibility, their utopian drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;NDN Coping Mechanisms: Notes from the Field&lt;/em&gt;, the poet takes on the political demands of queerness, mainstream portrayals of Indigenous life, love and its discontents, and the limits and uses of poetry as a vehicle for Indigenous liberation. In the process, Belcourt once again demonstrates his extraordinary craft, guile, and audacity, and the sheer dexterity of his imagination.</description>

      <![CDATA[Some really beautiful, gorgeous, astute work in here. I was a little lost by some of the poems that referenced other poems, but the poems that dealt with Indigenous identity and issues were right up my alley. Billy-Ray is so immensely talented. ]]>

  <description>Kidnapped by his father on the eve of Somalia's societal implosion, Mohamed Ali was taken first to the Netherlands by his stepmother, and then later on to Canada. Unmoored from his birth family and caught between twin alienating forces of Somali tradition and Western culture, Mohamed must forge his own queer coming of age. What follows in this fierce and unrelenting account is a story of one young man's nascent sexuality fused with the violence wrought by displacement.</description>

  <description>After her mother’s sudden death, Karen finds herself back in her childhood home in Nova Scotia for the first time in a decade, acting as full-time caregiver to Kelli, her older sister. Overwhelmed with grief and the daily needs of Kelli, who was born with a developmental disability, Karen begins to feel consumed by the isolation of her new role. On top of that, she’s weighed down with guilt over her years spent keeping Kelli and their independent-to-a-fault mother, Irene, at arm’s length. And so when Trevor — one of Kelli’s support workers — oversteps his role and offers friendly advice and a shoulder to cry on, Karen gratefully accepts his somewhat overbearing friendship. When she discovers how close Trevor was to Irene, she comes to trust him all the more. But as Trevor slowly insinuates himself into Karen and Kelli’s lives, Karen starts to grasp the true aspect of his relationship with her mother — and to experience for herself the suffocating nature of Trevor’s “care.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scotiabank Giller Prize–winning author Lynn Coady delivers a creepy and wholly compelling novel about the complex relationship between mothers and daughters and sisters, women and men, and who to trust and how to trust in a world where the supposedly selfless act of caregiving can camouflage a sinister self-interest.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Me, Myself, They: Life Beyond the Binary&lt;/em&gt; chronicles Joshua M. Ferguson’s extraordinary story of transformation to become the celebrated non-binary filmmaker, writer, and advocate for trans rights they are today. Beginning with their birth and early childhood years of gender creativity, Ferguson recounts the complex and often challenging evolution of their identity, including traumatizing experiences with gender conversion therapy, bullying, depression, sexual assault, and violent physical assault. But Ferguson’s story is above all about survival, empathy, and self-acceptance. By combining their personal reflections on what it feels like to never truly fit into the prescribed roles of girl or boy, woman or man, with an informed analysis of the ongoing shifts in contemporary attitudes towards sex and gender, Ferguson calls for recognition and respect for all trans, non-binary, and gender non-conforming people, and an inclusive understanding of the rich diversity of human identity. Through their honest and impassioned storytelling, we learn what it means to reclaim one’s identity and to live beyond the binary.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Female Monster is alive and well in the pop-cultural imagination. What does she tell us about ourselves and how we live today?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, smart and encyclopedic, nimbly addressing everyone from the biblical Lilith, to the movie Carrie, to Hae Min Lee (whose death was the focus of the first season of "Serial"), this book is dedicated to exploring the female dark side, as represented in female monsters throughout pop culture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These monsters—who tend to follow a few very common forms—express taboo truths about female life, and femininity. They speak to urges women are encouraged to hide, or deny. They also speak to the viciousness with which a sexist society inflicts traditionally feminine roles upon us. This is a sympathetic—or, at least, curious—look at the women we fear and what they show us about how women navigate a dangerous and frightening world.</description>

  <description>During the second half of the 19th century, thousands of Chinese men arrived on the west coast of North America, seeking to escape poverty and make their fortunes in the goldfields or working on the railroads. Among them was 36-year-old Yip Sang, a native of Guangdong province in southeast China, who arrived in Vancouver in 1881 after failing to strike it rich in California. His luck was about to change. Through perseverance, hard work and an eye for opportunity, the enterprising Yip Sang amassed considerable wealth to pass on to his wives and 23 children when he died in 1927. As the unofficial mayor of Chinatown, Yip Sang was instrumental in helping new Chinese immigrants as they fought to overcome social, economic and political barriers. This fascinating history details the struggles and successes of Yip Sang and the first Chinese Canadians as they built new lives and left a lasting legacy for their families and community.</description>

  <description>According to Didier Eribon, melancholy is where it all starts and where it also ends: the lifelong process of mourning that each homosexual experiences, and through which they construct their own identity. In this beguiling book, an introverted, anxious, ambitious, artistically gifted queer Filipino-Canadian boy finds solace, inspiration, and a "syllabus for living" in art--works of literature and music, from the children's literary classic &lt;i&gt;Anne of Green Gables&lt;/i&gt; to the music of Maria Callas. But their contribution to his intellectual, emotional, and spiritual edification belies the fact that they were largely heteronormative and white, which had the effect of invisibilizing him as a queer person of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part memoir, part cultural commentary, and a hybrid of besotted aesthetic appreciation and unsparing critique, &lt;i&gt;Double Melancholy&lt;/i&gt; is by turns a passionate love letter to art and an embattled examination of its oppressive complicity with the society that produces it, and the depths to which art both enriches and colonizes us.</description>

  <description>"A castle, a killer, and prey all bound and blurred by lust and blood."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many before her that have never come back, she's made it to the Countess' castle determined to snuff out the horror, but she could never be prepared for what hides within its turrets; what unfurls under its fluttering flags. Emily Carroll has fashioned a rich gothic horror charged with eroticism that doesn't just make your skin crawl, it crawls into it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bestselling and award-winning author Todd Babiak returns with an immersive and affecting story about a teenager's fascination with an enigmatic new woman in town whose past is catching up with her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer 1989. Fourteen-year-old Adam Lisinski has a lot going for him in Monument, Colorado. He's hoping to be a starter on his high school football team, even though he's only a sophomore. He has a part-time job at Eugene's Gas Stop where he works with his best friend, Simon Kinoro. He'd like to see his girlfriend, Phoebe Brandt, more if he could, but he makes do with time alone at Monument Lake after her ballet lessons. He and his mother, Helen, have a close relationship, but Adam knows she worries. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Beatrice Cyr comes to town. From the second she steps out of his neighbour Marv Walker's truck, Adam is mesmerized. He neglects everything that matters to him and he's desperate to be around her, even if he's confused about what she wants or where she comes from. He begins to find himself alone with Beatrice--in the change room at Modern You, the clothing store on Second Street, at the Chapel Hill Cinema, in Marv's truck--and Adam is soon lying to everyone he cares about. And when Beatrice convinces Helen to quit her job to partner in an ambitious real estate venture, the stakes get higher until Adam is forced to make an impossible choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riveting, emotionally complex, and sparkling with moments of compassion and humour, The Empress of Idaho is a story about loyalty, friendship, and the vulnerability and confusion of adolescence. It's a poignant, unforgettable portrait of a boy's difficult coming-of-age.</description>

  <description>This positive, straightforward book offers kids with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) their own comprehensive resource for both understanding their condition and finding tools to cope with the challenges they face every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some children with ASD are gifted; others struggle academically. Some are more introverted, while others try to be social. Some get “stuck” on things, have limited interests, or experience repeated motor movements like flapping or pacing (“stims”). &lt;i&gt;The Survival Guide for Kids with Autism Spectrum Disorders&lt;/i&gt; covers all of these areas, with an emphasis on helping children gain new self-understanding and self-acceptance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meant to be read with a parent, the book addresses questions (“What is ASD?” “Why me?”) and provides strategies for communicating, making and keeping friends, and succeeding in school. Body and brain basics highlight symptom management, exercise, diet, hygiene, relaxation, sleep, and toileting. Emphasis is placed on helping kids handle intense emotions and behaviors and get support from family and their team of helpers when needed. The book includes stories from real kids, fact boxes, helpful checklists, and resources. Sections for parents offer additional information.</description>

  <description>Hello, My Forever Ago, don't worry,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you won't be reading this much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have already returned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in a snowcloud, which is suggestively,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fashionably, only ever one second old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yes, Darling, it's me&lt;/i&gt;, it says&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as proof that in space,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;though there are many silences,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;fleeting&lt;/i&gt; isn't the opposite&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of &lt;i&gt;infinite&lt;/i&gt;, but its perfect match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four years ago, Ali Blythe arrived with &lt;i&gt;Twoism&lt;/i&gt;, a remarkable debut collection, every line shimmering with life and shivering with erotically charged glimpses of completeness. Now in &lt;i&gt;Hymnswitch&lt;/i&gt;, Blythe takes up the themes of identity and the body once again, this time casting an eye backwards and forwards, visiting places of recovery and wrestling with the transition into one's own skin. Readers will find themselves holding their breath at the risk and beauty and difficulty of the balance Blythe strikes in the midst of ineffable complexity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combining a stark, tensile precision with musicality that lulls and surprises, Blythe, a?surreal engineer of language, has once again created an unusually memorable collection. Imbued with emotional awareness, these stunning poems will imprint readers with startling images and silences as potent as words.</description>

  <description>Shari Cooper hadn't planned on dying, but four floors is a long way to fall. Her friends say she fell but Shari knew she had been murdered. Making a vow to herself to find her killer, Shari spies on her friends, and even enters their dreams. She also comes face-to-face with a nightmare from beyond the grave. The Shadow - a thing more horrible than death itself - is the key to Shari's death, and the only thing that can stop her murderer from murdering again.</description>

  <description>For fans of Helen Macdonald’s H Is for Hawk, this is the extraordinary debut memoir of a young woman who traveled to Mongolia to compete in the world’s longest, toughest horse race, and emerged as its youngest and first-ever female winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the age of nineteen, Lara Prior-Palmer discovered a website devoted to “the world’s longest, toughest horse race”—an annual competition of endurance and skill that involves dozens of riders racing a series of twenty-five wild ponies across 1,000 kilometers of Mongolian grassland. On a whim, she decided to enter the race. As she boarded a plane to East Asia, she was utterly unprepared for what awaited her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riders often spend years preparing to compete in the Mongol Derby, a course that recreates the horse messenger system developed by Genghis Khan, and many fail to finish. Prior-Palmer had no formal training. She was driven by her own restlessness, stubbornness, and a lifelong love of horses. She raced for ten days through extreme heat and terrifying storms, catching a few hours of sleep where she could at the homes of nomadic families.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Battling bouts of illness and dehydration, exhaustion and bruising falls, she decided she had nothing to lose. Each dawn she rode out again on a fresh horse, scrambling up mountains, swimming through rivers, crossing woodlands and wetlands, arid dunes and open steppe, as American television crews chased her in their Jeeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told with terrific suspense and style, in a voice full of poetry and soul, Rough Magic captures the extraordinary story of one young woman who forged ahead, against all odds, to become the first female winner of this breathtaking race.</description>

      <![CDATA[Was really disappointed by this movie, since I saw the film "All the wild horses" and loved it. This book just felt really boring and flat, even though she was talking about a culture and a way of life that I love. I lived in Mongolia for four months. Mixed feelings, but mostly boredom.<br /><br...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the cofounder of VerySmartBrothas.com, and one of the most read writers on race and culture at work today, a provocative and humorous memoir-in-essays that explores the ever-shifting definitions of what it means to be Black (and male) in America.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Damon Young, existing while Black is an extreme sport. The act of possessing black skin while searching for space to breathe in America&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is enough to induce a ceaseless state of angst where questions such as “How should I react here, as a professional black person?” and “Will this white person’s potato salad kill me?” are forever relevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Blacker &lt;/em&gt;chronicles Young’s efforts to survive while battling and making sense of the various neuroses his country has given him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a condition that’s sometimes stretched to absurd limits, provoking the angst that made him question if he was any good at the “being straight” thing, as if his sexual orientation was something he could practice and get better at, like a crossover dribble move or knitting; creating the farce where, as a teen, he wished for a white person to call him a racial slur just so he could fight him and have a great story about it; and generating the surreality of watching gentrification transform his Pittsburgh neighborhood from predominantly Black to “Portlandia . . . but with Pierogies.”  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, at its most devastating, it provides him reason to believe that his mother would be alive today if she were white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From one of our most respected cultural observers, &lt;em&gt;What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Blacker &lt;/em&gt;is a hilarious and honest debut that is both a celebration of the idiosyncrasies and distinctions of Blackness and a critique of white supremacy and how we define masculinity.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Virgin Suicides&lt;/i&gt; in this dystopic feminist revenge fantasy about three sisters on an isolated island, raised to fear men&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King has tenderly staked out a territory for his wife and three daughters, Grace, Lia, and Sky. He has laid the barbed wire; he has anchored the buoys in the water; he has marked out a clear message: Do not enter. Or viewed from another angle: Not safe to leave. Here women are protected from the chaos and violence of men on the mainland. The cult-like rituals and therapies they endure fortify them from the spreading toxicity of a degrading world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when their father, the only man they’ve ever seen, disappears, they retreat further inward until the day three strange men wash ashore. Over the span of one blistering hot week, a psychological cat-and-mouse game plays out. Sexual tensions and sibling rivalries flare as the sisters confront the amorphous threat the strangers represent. Can they survive the men?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A haunting, riveting debut about the capacity for violence and the potency of female desire, &lt;i&gt;The Water Cure&lt;/i&gt; both devastates and astonishes as it reflects our own world back at us.</description>

  <description>If you work hard enough, if you want it enough, if you’re smart and talented and “good enough,” you can do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except get pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her whole life, Lucy Knisley wanted to be a mother. But when it was finally the perfect time, conceiving turned out to be harder than anything she’d ever attempted. Fertility problems were followed by miscarriages, and her eventual successful pregnancy plagued by health issues, up to a dramatic, near-death experience during labor and delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moving, hilarious, and surprisingly informative memoir not only follows Lucy’s personal transition into motherhood but also illustrates the history and science of reproductive health from all angles, including curious facts and inspiring (and notorious) figures in medicine and midwifery. Whether you’ve got kids, want them, or want nothing to do with them, there’s something in this graphic memoir to open your mind and heart.</description>

  <description>A stunning memoir about a childhood spent growing up in a family of extreme hoarders and hiding squalor behind the veneer of a perfect family. Kim Miller is an immaculately put-together woman with a great career, a loving boyfriend, and a beautifully tidy apartment in Brooklyn. You would never guess that she spent her childhood hiding behind the closed doors of her family’s idyllic Long Island house, navigating between teetering stacks of aging newspaper, broken computers, and boxes upon boxes of unused junk festering in every room—the product of her father’s painful and unending struggle with hoarding. In this coming-of-age story, Kim brings to life her experience of growing up in a rat-infested home, concealing her father’s shameful secret from friends for years, and of the emotional burden that ultimately led to an attempt to take her own life. And in beautiful prose, Miller sheds light on her complicated yet loving relationship with her parents that has thrived in spite of the odds. &lt;i&gt; Coming Clean&lt;/i&gt; is a story about recognizing where we come from and the relationships that define us—and about finding peace in the homes we make for ourselves.</description>

  <description>In this collection of essays, Lambda Literary Award-winning writer and longtime activist and performance artist Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha explores the politics and realities of disability justice, a movement that centers the lives and leadership of sick and disabled queer, trans, Black, and brown people, with knowledge and gifts for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Care Work&lt;/i&gt; is a mapping of access as radical love, a celebration of the work that sick and disabled queer/people of color are doing to find each other and to build power and community, and a tool kit for everyone who wants to build radically resilient, sustainable communities of liberation where no one is left behind. Powerful and passionate, &lt;i&gt;Care Work&lt;/i&gt; is a crucial and necessary call to arms.</description>

  <description>Samantha Heather Mackey couldn't be more of an outsider in her small, highly selective MFA program at New England's Warren University. A scholarship student who prefers the company of her dark imagination to that of most people, she is utterly repelled by the rest of her fiction writing cohort--a clique of unbearably twee rich girls who call each other "Bunny," and seem to move and speak as one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everything changes when Samantha receives an invitation to the Bunnies' fabled "Smut Salon," and finds herself inexplicably drawn to their front door--ditching her only friend, Ava, in the process. As Samantha plunges deeper and deeper into the Bunnies' sinister yet saccharine world, beginning to take part in the ritualistic off-campus "Workshop" where they conjure their monstrous creations, the edges of reality begin to blur. Soon, her friendships with Ava and the Bunnies will be brought into deadly collision. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spellbinding new novel from one of our most fearless chroniclers of the female experience, Bunny is a down-the-rabbit-hole tale of loneliness and belonging, friendship and desire, and the fantastic and terrible power of the imagination.</description>

  <description>THE RIVETING SEQUEL TO THE HIT BOOK &lt;i&gt;YOU&lt;/i&gt;, NOW A NETFLIX SERIES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the compulsively readable sequel to her widely acclaimed debut novel, You, Caroline Kepnes weaves a tale that &lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt; calls “the love child of Holden Caulfield and Patrick Bateman.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Goldberg is no stranger to hiding bodies. In the past ten years, this thirty-something has buried four of them, collateral damage in his quest for love. Now he’s heading west to Los Angeles, the city of second chances, determined to put his past behind him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Hollywood, Joe blends in effortlessly with the other young upstarts. He eats guac, works in a bookstore, and flirts with a journalist neighbor. But while others seem fixated on their own reflections, Joe can’t stop looking over his shoulder. The problem with hidden bodies is that they don’t always stay that way. They re-emerge, like dark thoughts, multiplying and threatening to destroy what Joe wants most: true love. And when he finds it in a darkened room in Soho House, he’s more desperate than ever to keep his secrets buried. He doesn’t want to hurt his new girlfriend—he wants to be with her forever. But if she ever finds out what he’s done, he may not have a choice…</description>

  <description>In the fall of 2017, the acclaimed writer and musician Vivek Shraya began receiving vivid and disturbing transphobic hate mail from a stranger. Celebrated artist Ness Lee brings these letters and Shraya's responses to them to startling life in &lt;i&gt;Death Threat&lt;/i&gt;, a comic book that, by its existence, becomes a compelling act of resistance. Using satire and surrealism, &lt;i&gt;Death Threat&lt;/i&gt; is an unflinching portrayal of violent harassment from the perspective of both the perpetrator and the target, illustrating the dangers of online accessibility, and the ease with which vitriolic hatred can be spread digitally.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six: The band's album &lt;i&gt;Aurora&lt;/i&gt; came to define the rock 'n' roll era of the late seventies, and an entire generation of girls wanted to grow up to be Daisy. But no one knows the reason behind the group's split on the night of their final concert at Chicago Stadium on July 12, 1979 . . . until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it’s the rock 'n' roll she loves most. By the time she’s twenty, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also getting noticed is The Six, a band led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she’s pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes that the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The making of that legend is chronicled in this riveting and unforgettable novel, written as an oral history of one of the biggest bands of the seventies. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a talented writer who takes her work to a new level with &lt;i&gt;Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six&lt;/i&gt;, brilliantly capturing a place and time in an utterly distinctive voice.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A daring post-apocalyptic thriller from a powerful rising literary voice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With winter looming, a small northern Anishinaabe community goes dark. Cut off, people become passive and confused. Panic builds as the food supply dwindles. While the band council and a pocket of community members struggle to maintain order, an unexpected visitor arrives, escaping the crumbling society to the south. Soon after, others follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The community leadership loses its grip on power as the visitors manipulate the tired and hungry to take control of the reserve. Tensions rise and, as the months pass, so does the death toll due to sickness and despair. Frustrated by the building chaos, a group of young friends and their families turn to the land and Anishinaabe tradition in hopes of helping their community thrive again. Guided through the chaos by an unlikely leader named Evan Whitesky, they endeavor to restore order while grappling with a grave decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blending action and allegory, &lt;i&gt;Moon of the Crusted Snow&lt;/i&gt; upends our expectations. Out of catastrophe comes resilience. And as one society collapses, another is reborn.</description>

  <description>What started as a small sequence of poems about the Starbucks logo grew to monstrous proportions after the poet fell under a siren spell herself. &lt;i&gt;All Day I Dream About Sirens&lt;/i&gt; is both an ancient reverie and a screen-induced stupor as these poems reckon with the enduring cultural fascination with siren and mermaid narratives as they span geographies, economies, and generations, chronicling and reconfiguring the male-centered epic and women's bodies and subjectivities.</description>

  <description>Inspiring and honest, this unique memoir of gender transition and coming-of-age proves it’s never too late to find your true identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since he was a small child, Lorimer Shenher knew something for certain: he was a boy. The problem was, he was growing up in a girl’s body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this candid and thoughtful memoir, Shenher shares the story of his gender journey, from childhood gender dysphoria to teenage sexual experimentation to early-adult denial of his identity—and finally the acceptance that he is trans, culminating in gender reassignment surgery in his fifties. Along the way, he details his childhood in booming Calgary, his struggles with alcohol, and his eventual move to Vancouver, where he became the first detective assigned to the case of serial killer Robert Pickton (the subject of his critically acclaimed book That Lonely Section of Hell). With warmth and openness, This One Looks Like A Boy takes us through one of the most important decisions Shenher will ever make, as he comes into his own and finally discovers acceptance and relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LORIMER SHENHER is an acclaimed author, public speaker, and advocate for marginalized people and police reform. His first book, That Lonely Section of Hell, detailed his assignment as the first detective on Vancouver’s missing women investigation. It was nominated for several literary prizes and selected as one of the Globe &amp;amp; Mail’s 100 Best Books of 2015.</description>

  <description>My Heart Is a Rose Manhattan is a darkly humorous book about grief and isolation. Cutting yet tender, sorrowful yet angry, these poems touch on death and loss, architecture, alcohol, horse statues, and catalogues of life. Addicted to social media and simultaneously well-versed in feminist theory, My Heart Is a Rose Manhattan “subvert[s] the literary industrial complex,” but it also crashes in like the Kool-Aid meme with all-caps non sequiturs and “overdrawn affluenza.” Pull up a chair, get a drink – a rose manhattan, a quartz gimlet, or a gourmet ginger ale, if you prefer. A rose is a rose is a Rose Manhattan.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A devastatingly frank memoir that tears open the past to examine how circumstances--and the choices we make--dictate the people we become.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mistakes to Run With &lt;/i&gt;chronicles the turbulent life of Yasuko Thanh, from early childhood in the closest thing Victoria, BC, has to a slum to teen years as a sex worker and, finally, to her emergence as an award-winning author. As a child, Thanh embraced evangelical religion, only to rebel against it and her equally rigid parents, cutting herself, smoking, and shoplifting. At fifteen, the honour-roll runaway develops a taste for drugs and alcohol. After a stint in jail at sixteen, feeling utterly abandoned by her family, school, and society, Thanh meets the man who would become her pimp and falls in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next chapter of her life takes Thanh to the streets of Vancouver, where she endures beatings, arrests, crack cocaine, and an unwanted pregnancy. The act of writing ultimately becomes a solace from her suffering. Leaving the sex trade, but refusing to settle on any one thing, Thanh forges a new life for herself, from dealing drugs in four languages to motherhood and a complicated marriage, and emerges as a successful writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even as publication and awards bolster her, she remains haunted by her past.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Voice&lt;/i&gt;, Adam Pottle explores the crucial role deafness has played in the growth of his imagination, and in doing so presents a unique perspective on a writer's development. Born deaf in both ears, Pottle recounts what it was like growing up in a world of muted sound, and how his deafness has influenced virtually everything about his writing, from his use of language to character and plot choices. Salty, bold, and relentlessly honest, &lt;i&gt;Voice &lt;/i&gt;makes us think about writing in entirely new ways and expands our understanding of deafness and the gifts that it can offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Pottle's book is an important contribution to the growing roster of writing supplied by deaf academics, artists, writers, actors and theatre directors and professionals. I felt a 'coming home' experience in reading this book. As a deaf writer, I enthusiastically say 'yes' to his linkages between deafness and writing." --Joanne Weber, author of &lt;i&gt;The Deaf House&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In pop culture as much as in policy advocacy, the feminist movement has historically left infertile women out in the cold. This book traverses the chilly landscape of miscarriage, and the particular grief that accompanies the longing to make a family. Framed by her own desire for a child, journalist Alexandra Kimball brilliantly reveals the pain and loneliness of infertility, especially as a lifelong feminist. Her experience of online infertility support groups -- where women gather in forums to discuss IVF, surrogacy, and isolation -- leaves her longing for a real life community of women working to break down the stigma of infertility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the tradition of Eula Biss's &lt;i&gt;On Immunity&lt;/i&gt; and Barbara Ehrenreich's &lt;i&gt;Bright-sided&lt;/i&gt;, Kimball marries perceptive analysis with deep reportage -- her findings show the lie behind the prevailing, and at times paradoxical, cultural attitudes regarding women's right to actively choose to have children. Braiding together feminist history, memoir, and reporting from the front lines of the battle for reproductive rights and technology, &lt;i&gt;The Seed&lt;/i&gt; plants in readers the desire for a world where no woman is made to feel that her biology is her destiny.</description>

  <description>This spooky addition to Alvin Schwartz's popular books on American folklore is filled with tales of eerie horror and dark revenge that will make you jump with fright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a story here for everyone—skeletons with torn and tangled flesh who roam the earth; a ghost who takes revenge on her murderer; and a haunted house where every night a bloody head falls down the chimney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen Gammell's splendidly creepy drawings perfectly capture the mood of more than two dozen scary stories—and even scary songs—all just right for reading alone or for telling aloud in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If You Dare!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;’s fiercely original, Pulitzer Prize–winning culture critic, a provocative collection of new and previously published essays arguing that we are what we watch.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From her creation of the first “Approval Matrix” in New York magazine in 2004 to her Pulitzer Prize–winning columns for &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;, Emily Nussbaum has known all along that what we watch is who we are. In this collection, including two never-before-published essays, Nussbaum writes about her passion for television that began with stumbling upon "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"—a show that was so much more than it appeared—while she was a graduate student studying Victorian literature. What followed was a love affair with television, an education, and a fierce debate about whose work gets to be called “great” that led Nussbaum to a trailblazing career as a critic whose reviews said so much more about our culture than just what’s good on television. Through these pieces, she traces the evolution of female protagonists over the last decade, the complex role of sexual violence on TV, and what to do about art when the artist is revealed to be a monster. And she explores the links between the television antihero and the rise of Donald Trump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book is more than a collection of essays. With each piece, Nussbaum recounts her fervent search, over fifteen years, for a new kind of criticism that resists the false hierarchy that elevates one form of culture over another. It traces her own struggle to punch through stifling notions of “prestige television,” searching for a wilder and freer and more varied idea of artistic ambition—one that acknowledges many types of beauty and complexity, and that opens to more varied voices. It’s a book that celebrates television as television, even as each year warps the definition of just what that might mean.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sharply intelligent novel about two college students and the strange, unexpected connection they forge with a married couple.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances is twenty-one years old, cool-headed, and darkly observant. A college student and aspiring writer, she devotes herself to a life of the mind--and to the beautiful and endlessly self-possessed Bobbi, her best friend and comrade-in-arms. Lovers at school, the two young women now perform spoken-word poetry together in Dublin, where a journalist named Melissa spots their potential. Drawn into Melissa's orbit, Frances is reluctantly impressed by the older woman's sophisticated home and tall, handsome husband. Private property, Frances believes, is a cultural evil--and Nick, a bored actor who never quite lived up to his potential, looks like patriarchy made flesh. But however amusing their flirtation seems at first, it gives way to a strange intimacy neither of them expect. As Frances tries to keep her life in check, her relationships increasingly resist her control: with Nick, with her difficult and unhappy father, and finally even with Bobbi. Desperate to reconcile herself to the desires and vulnerabilities of her body, Frances's intellectual certainties begin to yield to something new: a painful and disorienting way of living from moment to moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with gem-like precision and probing intelligence, &lt;i&gt;Conversations With Friends&lt;/i&gt; is wonderfully alive to the pleasures and dangers of youth."</description>

  <description>An intimate, moving book written with the immediacy and directness of one who still struggles with the effects of mental and chronic illness, &lt;i&gt;The Collected Schizophrenias &lt;/i&gt;cuts right to the core. Schizophrenia is not a single unifying diagnosis, and Esmé Weijun Wang writes not just to her fellow members of the "collected schizophrenias" but to those who wish to understand it as well. Opening with the journey toward her diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, Wang discusses the medical community's own disagreement about labels and procedures for diagnosing those with mental illness, and then follows an arc that examines the manifestations of schizophrenia in her life. In essays that range from using fashion to present as high-functioning to the depths of a rare form of psychosis, and from the failures of the higher education system and the dangers of institutionalization to the complexity of compounding factors such as PTSD and Lyme disease, Wang's analytical eye, honed as a former lab researcher at Stanford, allows her to balance research with personal narrative. An essay collection of undeniable power, &lt;i&gt; The Collected Schizophrenias&lt;/i&gt; dispels misconceptions and provides insight into a condition long misunderstood.</description>

      <![CDATA[A great collection of essays about schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and mental illness in general. I liked the frank nature of these essays. I felt that that the last two essays weren't as good as the rest of the collection. That said, this is an important book and I've glad that Esme wrote it. ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling book exploring the counterproductive reactions white people have when their assumptions about race are challenged, and how these reactions maintain racial inequality.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Referring to the defensive moves that white people make when challenged racially, white fragility is characterized by emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt and by behaviors including argumentation and silence. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium and prevent any meaningful cross-racial dialogue. In this in-depth exploration, anti-racist educator Robin DiAngelo examines how white fragility develops, how it protects racial inequality, and what can be done to engage more constructively.</description>

  <description>Written in dead letters... and covered in blood!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demonic possession! Haunted condominiums! Murderous babies! Man-eating moths! No plot was too ludicrous, no cover art too appalling, no evil too despicable for the &lt;i&gt;Paperbacks From Hell&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where did they come from? Where did they go? Horror author Grady Hendrix risks his soul and sanity (not to mention yours) to relate the true, untold story of the &lt;i&gt;Paperbacks From Hell&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shocking story summaries! Incredible cover art! And true tales of writers, artists, and publishers who violated every literary law but one: never be boring. All this awaits, if you dare experience the &lt;i&gt;Paperbacks From Hell&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>In this intimate and moving graphic memoir, Teresa Wong writes and illustrates the story of her struggle with postpartum depression in the form of a letter to her daughter Scarlet. Equal parts heartbreaking and funny, Dear Scarlet perfectly captures the quiet desperation of those suffering from PPD and the profound feelings of inadequacy and loss. As Teresa grapples with her fears and anxieties and grasps at potential remedies, coping mechanisms, and her mother’s Chinese elixirs, we come to understand one woman's battle against the cruel dynamics of postpartum depression. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Scarlet is a poignant and deeply personal journey through the complexities of new motherhood, offering hope to those affected by PPD, as well as reassurance that they are not alone.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A bold and profound meditation on trauma, legacy, oppression and racism in North America from award-winning Haudenosaunee writer Alicia Elliott.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an urgent and visceral work that asks essential questions about the treatment of Native people in North America while drawing on intimate details of her own life and experience with intergenerational trauma, Alicia Elliott offers indispensable insight into the ongoing legacy of colonialism. She engages with such wide-ranging topics as race, parenthood, love, mental illness, poverty, sexual assault, gentrifcation, writing and representation, and in the process makes connections both large and small between the past and present, the personal and political--from overcoming a years-long battle with head lice to the way Native writers are treated within the Canadian literary industry; her unplanned teenage pregnancy to the history of dark matter and how it relates to racism in the court system; her childhood diet of Kraft Dinner to how systemic oppression is directly linked to health problems in Native communities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With deep consideration and searing prose, Elliott provides a candid look at our past, an illuminating portrait of our present and a powerful tool for a better future.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A good friend will bury your body, a best friend will dig you back up.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dino doesn’t mind spending time with the dead. His parents own a funeral home, and death is literally the family business. He’s just not used to them talking back. Until Dino’s ex-best friend July dies suddenly—and then comes back to life. Except not exactly. Somehow July is not quite alive, and not quite dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Dino and July attempt to figure out what’s happening, they must also confront why and how their friendship ended so badly, and what they have left to understand about themselves, each other, and all those grand mysteries of life.</description>

  <description>Kelsey Miller had done it all: crash diets, healthy diets, and nutritionist-prescribed "eating plans," which are diets that you pay more money for. She'd been fighting her un-thin body since early childhood, and at 29, she finally hit bottom. No diet could transform her body or her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of an intuitive eating coach and fitness professionals, she learned how to eat based on her body's instincts and exercise sustainably, without obsessing over calories burned. But, with each thrilling step toward a healthy future, she had to contend with the painful truths of her past. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIG GIRL chronicles Kelsey's journey into self-loathing and disordered eating--and out of it. This is a memoir for anyone who's grappled with a distorted body image, food issues, or a dysfunctional family. It's for late bloomers and the not-yet-bloomed. It's for everyone who's tried and failed and felt like a big, fat, loser. So, basically, everyone.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A hilarious and nostalgic trip through the history of paperback pre-teen series of the '80s and '90s.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every twenty- or thirty-something woman knows these books. The pink covers, the flimsy paper, the zillion volumes in the series that kept you reading for your entire adolescence. Spurred by the commercial success of Sweet Valley High and The Babysitters Club, these were not the serious-issue YA novels of the 1970s, nor were they the blockbuster books of the Harry Potter and Twilight ilk. They were cheap, short, and utterly beloved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PAPERBACK CRUSH dives in deep to this golden age with affection, history, and a little bit of snark. Readers will discover (and fondly remember) girl-centric series on everything from correspondence (Pen Pals and Dear Diary) to sports (The Pink Parrots, Cheerleaders, and The Gymnasts) to a newspaper at an all-girls Orthodox Jewish middle school (The B.Y. Times) to a literal teen angel (Teen Angels: Heaven Can Wait, where an enterprising guardian angel named Cisco has to earn her wings “by helping the world’s sexist rock star.”) Some were blatant ripoffs of the successful series (looking at you, Sleepover Friends and The Girls of Canby Hall), some were sick-lit tearjerkers à la Love Story (Abby, My Love) and some were just plain perplexing (Uncle Vampire??) But all of them represent that time gone by of girl-power and endless sessions of sustained silent reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In six hilarious chapters (Friendship, Love, School, Family, Jobs, Terror, and Tragedy), Bustle Features Editor Gabrielle Moss takes the reader on a nostalgic tour of teen book covers of yore, digging deep into the history of the genre as well as the stories behind the best-known series.</description>

  <description>Busy Philipps’s autobiographical book offers the same unfiltered and candid storytelling that her Instagram followers have come to know and love, from growing up in Scottsdale, Arizona and her painful and painfully funny teen years, to her life as a working actress, mother, and famous best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Busy is the rare entertainer whose impressive arsenal of talents as an actress is equally matched by her storytelling ability, sense of humor, and sharp observations about life, love, and motherhood. Her conversational writing reminds us what we love about her on screens large and small. From film to television to Instagram, Busy delightfully showcases her wry humor and her willingness to bare it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’ve been waiting my whole life to write this book. I’m just so grateful someone asked. Otherwise, what was the point of any of it?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>After the death of her beloved grandmother, a Cuban-American woman travels to Havana, where she discovers the roots of her identity--and unearths a family secret hidden since the revolution...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Havana, 1958. The daughter of a sugar baron, nineteen-year-old Elisa Perez is part of Cuba's high society, where she is largely sheltered from the country's growing political unrest--until she embarks on a clandestine affair with a passionate revolutionary...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miami, 2017. Freelance writer Marisol Ferrera grew up hearing romantic stories of Cuba from her late grandmother Elisa, who was forced to flee with her family during the revolution. Elisa's last wish was for Marisol to scatter her ashes in the country of her birth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving in Havana, Marisol comes face-to-face with the contrast of Cuba's tropical, timeless beauty and its perilous political climate. When more family history comes to light and Marisol finds herself attracted to a man with secrets of his own, she'll need the lessons of her grandmother's past to help her understand the true meaning of courage.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A follow-up to Matt Haig's internationally bestselling memoir, &lt;i&gt;Reasons to Stay Alive&lt;/i&gt;, a broader look at how modern life feeds our anxiety, and how to live a better life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The societies we live in are increasingly making our minds ill, making it feel as though the way we live is engineered to make us unhappy. When Matt Haig developed panic disorder, anxiety, and depression as an adult, it took him a long time to work out the ways the external world could impact his mental health in both positive and negative ways. &lt;i&gt;Notes on a Nervous Planet &lt;/i&gt;collects his observations, taking a look at how the various social, commercial and technological "advancements" that have created the world we now live in can actually hinder our happiness. Haig examines everything from broader phenomena like inequality, social media, and the news; to things closer to our daily lives, like how we sleep, how we exercise, and even the distinction we draw between our minds and our bodies.</description>

  <description>It's been eighteen months since the Raxter School for Girls was put under quarantine. Since the Tox hit and pulled Hetty's life out from under her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started slow. First the teachers died one by one. Then it began to infect the students, turning their bodies strange and foreign. Now, cut off from the rest of the world and left to fend for themselves on their island home, the girls don't dare wander outside the school's fence, where the Tox has made the woods wild and dangerous. They wait for the cure they were promised as the Tox seeps into everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Byatt goes missing, Hetty will do anything to find her, even if it means breaking quarantine and braving the horrors that lie beyond the fence. And when she does, Hetty learns that there's more to their story, to their life at Raxter, than she could have ever thought true.</description>

  <description>Every year since 1904, when the ice breaks up on the North Saskatchewan River, Edmonton has crowned a Melting Queen--a woman who presides over the Melting Day spring carnival and who must keep the city's spirits up over the following winter. But this year, something has changed: a genderfluid ex-frat brother called River Runson is named as Melting Queen. As River's reign upends the city's century-old traditions, Edmonton tears itself in two, with progressive and reactionary factions fighting a war for Edmonton's soul. Ultimately, River must uncover the hidden history of Melting Day, forcing Edmonton to confront the dark underbelly of its traditions and leading the city into a new chapter in its history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Balancing satire with compassion, Bruce Cinnamon's debut novel combines history and magic to weave a splendid future-looking tale. Recalling the work of Minister Faust and Vivek Shraya, &lt;i&gt;The Melting Queen&lt;/i&gt; lays down a foundational mythology for Edmonton in the vein of Guy Maddin's &lt;i&gt;My Winnipeg&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An unforgettable memoir about a young woman who tries to outrun loss, but eventually finds a way home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ayelet Tsabari was 21 years old the first time she left Tel Aviv with no plans to return. Restless after two turbulent mandatory years in the Israel Defense Forces, Tsabari longed to get away. It was not the never-ending conflict that drove her, but the grief that had shaken the foundations of her home. The loss of Tsabari’s beloved father in years past had left her alienated and exiled within her own large Yemeni family and at odds with her Mizrahi identity. By leaving, she would be free to reinvent herself and to rewrite her own story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nearly a decade, Tsabari travelled, through India, Europe, the US and Canada, as though her life might go stagnant without perpetual motion. She moved fast and often because—as in the Intifada—it was safer to keep going than to stand still. Soon the act of leaving—jobs, friends and relationships—came to feel most like home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a series of dramatic events forced Tsabari to examine her choices and her feelings of longing and displacement. By periodically returning to Israel, Tsabari began to examine her Jewish-Yemeni background and the Mizrahi identity she had once rejected, as well as unearthing a family history that had been untold for years. What she found resonated deeply with her own immigrant experience and struggles with new motherhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully written, frank and poignant, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Leaving&lt;/em&gt; is a courageous coming-of-age story that reflects on identity and belonging and that explores themes of family and home—both inherited and chosen.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Abby Maslin shares an inspiring story of resilience and commitment in a deeply affecting new memoir. After her husband suffered a traumatic brain injury, the couple worked together as he recovered--and they learned to love again. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Abby Maslin's husband, TC, didn't make it home on August 18, 2012, she knew something was terribly wrong. Her fears were confirmed when she learned that her husband had been beaten by three men and left for dead mere blocks from home, all for his cell phone and debit card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The days and months that followed were a grueling test of faith. As TC recovered from a severe traumatic brain injury that left him unable to speak and walk, Abby faced the challenge of caring for&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;and loving&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;a husband who now resembled a stranger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love You Hard&lt;/i&gt; is the raw, unflinchingly honest story of a young love left broken, and the resilience required to mend a life and remake a marriage. Told from the caregiver's perspective, this book is a daring exploration of true love: what it means to love beyond language, beyond abilities, and into the place that reveals who we really are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the heart of Abby and TC's unique and captivating story are the universal truths that bind us all. This is a tale of living and loving wholeheartedly, learning to heal after profound grief, and choosing joy in the wake of tragedy.</description>

  <description>Delving behind Canada's veneer of multiculturalism and tolerance, Policing Black Lives traces the violent realities of anti-blackness from the slave ships to prisons, classrooms and beyond. Robyn Maynard provides readers with the first comprehensive account of nearly four hundred years of state-sanctioned surveillance, criminalization and punishment of Black lives in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While highlighting the ubiquity of Black resistance, Policing Black Lives traces the still-living legacy of slavery across multiple institutions, shedding light on the state's role in perpetuating contemporary Black poverty and unemployment, racial profiling, law enforcement violence, incarceration, immigration detention, deportation, exploitative migrant labour practices, disproportionate child removal and low graduation rates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emerging from a critical race feminist framework that insists that all Black lives matter, Maynard's intersectional approach to anti-Black racism addresses the unique and understudied impacts of state violence as it is experienced by Black women, Black people with disabilities, as well as queer, trans, and undocumented Black communities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A call-to-action, Policing Black Lives urges readers to work toward dismantling structures of racial domination and re-imagining a more just society.</description>

  <description>The Bram Stoker Award-winning author of A Head Full of Ghosts adds an inventive twist to the home invasion horror story in a heart-palpitating novel of psychological suspense that recalls Stephen King’s Misery, Ruth Ware’s In a Dark, Dark Wood, and Jack Ketchum’s cult hit The Girl Next Door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven-year-old Wen and her parents, Eric and Andrew, are vacationing at a remote cabin on a quiet New Hampshire lake. Their closest neighbors are more than two miles in either direction along a rutted dirt road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One afternoon, as Wen catches grasshoppers in the front yard, a stranger unexpectedly appears in the driveway. Leonard is the largest man Wen has ever seen but he is young, friendly, and he wins her over almost instantly. Leonard and Wen talk and play until Leonard abruptly apologizes and tells Wen, "None of what’s going to happen is your fault". Three more strangers then arrive at the cabin carrying unidentifiable, menacing objects. As Wen sprints inside to warn her parents, Leonard calls out: "Your dads won’t want to let us in, Wen. But they have to. We need your help to save the world."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus begins an unbearably tense, gripping tale of paranoia, sacrifice, apocalypse, and survival that escalates to a shattering conclusion, one in which the fate of a loving family and quite possibly all of humanity are entwined. The Cabin at the End of the World is a masterpiece of terror and suspense from the fantastically fertile imagination of Paul Tremblay.</description>

  <description>From debut author Caroline Kepnes comes &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt;, one of Suspense Magazine’s Best Books of 2014, and a brilliant and terrifying novel for the social media age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a beautiful aspiring writer strides into the East Village bookstore where Joe Goldberg works, he does what anyone would do: he Googles the name on her credit card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one Guinevere Beck in New York City. She has a public Facebook account and Tweets incessantly, telling Joe everything he needs to know: she is simply Beck to her friends, she went to Brown University, she lives on Bank Street, and she’ll be at a bar in Brooklyn tonight—the perfect place for a “chance” meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Joe invisibly and obsessively takes control of Beck’s life, he orchestrates a series of events to ensure Beck finds herself in his waiting arms. Moving from stalker to boyfriend, Joe transforms himself into Beck’s perfect man, all while quietly removing the obstacles that stand in their way—even if it means murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A terrifying exploration of how vulnerable we all are to stalking and manipulation, debut author Caroline Kepnes delivers a razor-sharp novel for our hyper-connected digital age. You is a compulsively readable page-turner that’s being compared to &lt;i&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;American Psycho&lt;/i&gt;, and Stephen King’s &lt;i&gt;Misery&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>In 2010, the al Rabeeah family left their home in Iraq in hope of a safer life. They moved to Homs, in Syria — just before the Syrian civil war broke out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abu Bakr, one of eight children, was ten years old when the violence began on the streets around him: car bombings, attacks on his mosque and school, firebombs late at night. &lt;i&gt;Homes&lt;/i&gt; tells of the strange juxtapositions of growing up in a war zone: horrific, unimaginable events punctuated by normalcy — soccer, cousins, video games, friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Homes&lt;/i&gt; is the remarkable true story of how a young boy emerged from a war zone — and found safety in Canada — with a passion for sharing his story and telling the world what is truly happening in Syria. As told to her by Abu Bakr al Rabeeah, writer Winnie Yeung has crafted a heartbreaking, hopeful, and urgently necessary book that provides a window into understanding Syria.</description>

  <description>An anthology of African-Canadian writing, Black Writing Matters offers a cross-section of established writers and newcomers to the literary world who tackle contemporary and pressing issues with beautiful, sometimes raw, prose. As Whitney French says in her introduction, Black Writing Matters “injects new meaning into the word diversity [and] harbours a sacredness and an everydayness that offers Black people dignity.” An “invitation to read, share, and tell stories of Black narratives that are close to the bone,” this collection feels particular to the Black Canadian experience.</description>

      <![CDATA[An excellent collection by Canadian black writers. My favourite pieces were the pieces that were more personal. The middle section was a little too academic for my taste. There was some wonderful writing in this anthology, and some really gutsy pieces. I definitely learned a lot. Brava!]]>

  <description>In her third collection of poetry, &lt;i&gt;Holy Wild&lt;/i&gt;, Gwen Benaway explores the complexities of being an Indigenous trans women in expansive lyric poems. She holds up the Indigenous trans body as a site of struggle, liberation, and beauty. A confessional poet, Benaway narrates her sexual and romantic intimacies with partners as well as her work to navigate the daily burden of transphobia and violence. She examines the intersections of Indigenous and trans experience through autobiographical poems and continues to speak to the legacy of abuse, violence, and colonial erasure that defines Canada. Her sparse lines, interwoven with English and Anishinaabemowin (Ojibwe), illustrate the wonder and power of Indigenous trans womanhood in motion. &lt;i&gt;Holy Wild&lt;/i&gt; is not an easy book, as Benaway refuses to give any simple answers, but it is a profoundly vibrant and beautiful work filled with a transcendent grace.</description>

  <description>A collection of four novellas, &lt;i&gt;Different Seasons &lt;/i&gt;includes some of Stephen King's most enduring and well-known works, including "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption," which was made into the film &lt;i&gt;The Shawshank Redemption&lt;/i&gt;, and "The Body," which was made into the movie &lt;i&gt;Stand by Me&lt;/i&gt;. For this entry in the Bookmarked series, Aaron Burch, editor of the literary journal &lt;i&gt;Hobart&lt;/i&gt;, will focus on the influence of "The Body" on his life and work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aaron Burch&lt;/b&gt;'s fiction has appeared in numerous literary magazines and anthologies, including &lt;i&gt;The &amp;amp;NOW Awards&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Best Innovative Writing&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Another Chicago &lt;/i&gt;magazine, &lt;i&gt;New York Tyrant&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Review&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Barrelhouse&lt;/i&gt;. His chapbook, &lt;i&gt;How to Take Yourself Apart, How to Make Yourself Anew&lt;/i&gt;, was published by PANK as the winner of their inaugural chapbook contest. He is the founding and current editor of the literary journal &lt;i&gt;Hobart&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>What is Cuban cuisine? A delectable intermingling of Spanish, Portuguese, Arabian, Chinese, and African culinary traditions—a true melting pot of all the influences that combine in Cuban culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Raquel Rabade Roque gives us the definitive book of Cuban cuisine: encyclopedic in its range, but intimate and accessible in tone with more than five hundred recipes for classic, home-style dishes—from black bean soup to pork empanadas, from &lt;i&gt;ropa vieja&lt;/i&gt; to black beans and &lt;i&gt;croquetas,&lt;/i&gt; from &lt;i&gt;tostones &lt;/i&gt;to &lt;i&gt;arroz con pollo, &lt;/i&gt;from &lt;i&gt;churros &lt;/i&gt;to &lt;i&gt;café con leche—&lt;/i&gt;as well as the vividly told stories behind the recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the author’s family recipes, this is real Cuban cooking presented with today’s busy cooks in mind. Whether you are an experienced cook or a novice, a lover of Cuban cuisine or just discovering it, &lt;i&gt;The Cuban Kitchen&lt;/i&gt; will become an essential part of your kitchen library.</description>

  <description>When Friends debuted in 1994, no one anticipated the sensation it would become. Through its decade-long run, the show maintained an uncanny connection to its audience, who saw it both as a reflection of their own lives and an aspirational escape from reality. I’ll Be There for You is a deep dive into Friends history and lore, exploring all aspects of the show, from its unlikely origins to the societal conditions that amplified its success. Journalist and pop culture expert Kelsey Miller relives the show’s most powerful moments, sheds light on its sometimes dated and problematic elements and examines the worldwide trends that Friends catalyzed, from contemporary coffee culture to the wildly popular ’90s haircut The Rachel. I’ll Be There for You is not only for fans of the series, but for anyone who’s ever wondered what it is about this show—and television comedy—that resonates so powerfully.</description>

  <description>February in Newfoundland is the longest month of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another blizzard is threatening to tear a strip off downtown St. John’s, while inside The Hazel restaurant a storm system of sex, betrayal, addiction, and hurt is breaking overhead. Iris, a young hostess from around the bay, is forced to pull a double despite resolving to avoid the charming chef and his wealthy restaurateur wife. Just tables over, Damian, a hungover and self-loathing server, is trying to navigate a potential punch-up with a pair of lit customers who remain oblivious to the rising temperature in the dining room. Meanwhile Olive, a young woman far from her northern home, watches it all unfurl from the fast and frozen street. Through rolling blackouts, we glimpse the truth behind the shroud of scathing lies and unrelenting abuse, and discover that resilience proves most enduring in the dead of this winter’s tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By turns biting, funny, poetic, and heartbreaking, Megan Gail Coles’ debut novel rips into the inner lives of a wicked cast of characters, building towards a climax that will shred perceptions and force a reckoning. This is blistering Newfoundland Gothic for the twenty-first century, a wholly original, bracing, and timely portrait of a place in the throes of enormous change, where two women confront the traumas of their past in an attempt to overcome the present and to pick up a future.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Combining Neil Gaiman's extraordinary words with Chris Riddell's deft and striking illustrations, &lt;i&gt;Art Matters&lt;/i&gt; will inspire its readers to seize the day in the name of art. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neil Gaiman once said that 'the world always seems brighter when you've just made something that wasn't there before'. This little book is the embodiment of that vision. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawn together from speeches, poems and creative manifestos, &lt;i&gt;Art Matters&lt;/i&gt; will explore how reading, imagining and creating can change the world. A creative call to arms, the book will champion freedom of ideas, making art in the face of adversity and choosing to be bold. It will be inspirational to young and old, and will encourage glorious, creative rebellion.</description>

  <description>From the author of &lt;i&gt;How Should a Person Be?&lt;/i&gt; (“one of the most talked-about books of the year”—&lt;i&gt;Time Magazine&lt;/i&gt;) and the New York Times Bestseller &lt;i&gt;Women in Clothes&lt;/i&gt; comes a daring novel about whether to have children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Motherhood&lt;/i&gt;, Sheila Heti asks what is gained and what is lost when a woman becomes a mother, treating the most consequential decision of early adulthood with the candor, originality, and humor that have won Heti international acclaim and made &lt;i&gt;How Should A Person Be?&lt;/i&gt; required reading for a generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her late thirties, when her friends are asking when they will become mothers, the narrator of Heti’s intimate and urgent novel considers whether she will do so at all. In a narrative spanning several years, casting among the influence of her peers, partner, and her duties to her forbearers, she struggles to make a wise and moral choice. After seeking guidance from philosophy, her body, mysticism, and chance, she discovers her answer much closer to home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Motherhood&lt;/i&gt; is a courageous, keenly felt, and starkly original novel that will surely spark lively conversations about womanhood, parenthood, and about how—and for whom—to live.</description>

  <description>~Nominated for a &lt;b&gt;James Beard Award&lt;/b&gt; in the international cookbook category!~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cuban Table&lt;/i&gt; is a comprehensive, contemporary overview of Cuban food, recipes and culture as recounted by serious home cooks and professional chefs, restaurateurs and food writers. Cuban-American food writer Ana Sofia Pelaez and award-winning photographer Ellen Silverman traveled through Cuba, Miami and New York to document and learn about traditional Cuban cooking from a wide range of authentic sources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuban home cooks are fiercely protective of their secrets. Content with a private kind of renown, they demonstrate an elusive turn of hand that transforms simple recipes into bright and memorable meals that draw family and friends to their tables time and again. More than just a list of ingredients or series of steps, Cuban cooks' tricks and touches hide in plain sight, staying within families or being passed down in well-worn copies of old cookbooks largely unread outside of the Cuban community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here you'll find documented recipes for everything from iconic Cuban sandwiches to rich stews with Spanish accents and African ingredients, accompanied by details about historical context and insight into cultural nuances. More than a cookbook, &lt;i&gt;The Cuban Table&lt;/i&gt; is a celebration of Cuban cooking, culture and cuisine. With stunning photographs throughout and over 110 deliciously authentic recipes this cookbook invites you into one of the Caribbean's most interesting and vibrant cuisines.</description>

  <description>"FORWARD MARCH made me snort with laughter even as my heart was aching. Meghan's journey from newbie to seasoned band nerd is worthy of a standing ovation." —Lisa Jenn Bigelow (author of DRUM ROLL, PLEASE) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Love, loss, and the surprising aphrodisiacs of the band locker room. That’s what the Dulaney High marching band has in store for Meghan Riggins. Like her Gram, who’s been her biggest fan since that first trombone lesson, Meghan’s always loved making music. So marching band should be easy, right? Wrong. It’s hard enough staying upright during the halftime show, avoiding the worst of the upperclassmen, or remembering the difference between a cummerbund and a dickie. But then she falls for Jonah, an adorkable fellow trombone nerd who just happens to be her best friend’s brother. Meghan may need to rethink everything she knows about herself, in and out of band, with and without her family and friends, and in and out of love. Both witty and poignant, Forward March will have you laughing, swooning, and cheering from the stands. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her "head-for-the-hills bag". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Educated&lt;/em&gt; is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.</description>

  <description>CanLit--the commonly used short form for English Canadian Literature as a cultural formation and industry--has been at the heart of several recent public controversies. Why? Because CanLit is breaking open to reveal the accepted injustices at its heart. It is imperative that these public controversies and the issues that sparked them be subject to careful and thorough discussion and critique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;provides a critical and historical context to help readers understand conversations happening about CanLit presently. One of its goals is to foreground the perspectives of those who have been changing the conversation about what CanLit is and what it could be. Topics such as literary celebrity, white power, appropriation, class, rape culture, and the ongoing impact of settler colonialism are addressed by a diverse gathering of writers from across Canada. This volume works to avoid a single metanarrative response to these issues, but rather brings together a cacophonous and ruinous multitude of voices.</description>

  <description>In September 1985, nineteen-year-old John Lindqvist moved into a dilapidated old building in Stockholm, planning to make his living as a magician. Something strange was going on in the locked shower room in the building’s basement—and the price of entry was just a little blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Always Find You is a horror story—as bizarre and macabre as any of Lindqvist’s earlier novels—but it’s also a melancholy meditation on being young and lonely, on making friends and growing up. It’s about magic, and the intensity of human connection—and the evil we carry inside.</description>

  <description>Drawing on the same standards of accuracy as the acclaimed &lt;i&gt;DK Eyewitness Travel Guides&lt;/i&gt;, The &lt;i&gt;DK Top 10 Guides&lt;/i&gt; use exciting colorful photography and excellent cartography to provide a reliable and useful pocket-sized travel. Dozens of Top 10 lists provide vital information on each destination, as well as insider tips, from avoiding the crowds to finding out the freebies, The &lt;i&gt;DK Top 10 Guides&lt;/i&gt; take the work out of planning any trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long known for its isolation from the Western world and its precarious relationship with the USA in particular, the last decade has seen Cuba emerge as one of the top tourist destinations in the Caribbean. Even though the country remains staunchly Communist, Cuba is a nation that understands the commercial power of rebranding and has reinvented itself as the home of sun, salsa and rum with a unique blend of chutzpah and a casual manner that capitalizes on the Cuban character.</description>

  <description>In 2016, &lt;em&gt;Globe and Mail&lt;/em&gt; reporter Ann Hui drove across Canada to answer two questions: Why is there a Chinese restaurant in every small town? And who are the families who run them? It was only after the story was published that she discovered her own family could have been included — her parents had run their own Chinese restaurant, The Legion Cafe, before she was born. This discovery set her on a time-sensitive mission: to understand how her own family had somehow wound up in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chop Suey Nation&lt;/em&gt; weaves together Hui’s own family history with those dozens of Chinese restaurant owners from coast to coast. Along her trip, she meets a Chinese-restaurant owner/small-town mayor, the owner of a Chinese restaurant in a Thunder Bay curling rink, and the woman who runs a restaurant alone on the very remote Fogo Island. Hui also explores the fascinating history behind “chop suey” cuisine, detailing the invention of classics like “ginger beef” and “Newfoundland chow mein,” and other uniquely Canadian fare like the “Chinese pierogi” of Alberta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hui, who grew up in authenticity-obsessed Vancouver, starts out her journey with a dim view of “fake" small-town Chinese food. But along the way she comes to understand the values that drive these restaurants — perseverance, entrepreneurialism and deep love for family. Using her own family’s story as a touchstone, she reveals the importance of these restaurants to this country’s history and makes the case for why chop suey cuisine is quintessentially Canadian.</description>

  <description>In Téa Mutonji's disarming debut story collection, a woman contemplates her Congolese traditions during a family wedding, a teenage girl looks for happiness inside a pack of cigarettes, a mother reconnects with her daughter through their shared interest in fish, and a young woman decides to shave her head in the waiting room of an abortion clinic. These punchy, sharply observed stories blur the lines between longing and choosing, exploring the narrator's experience as an involuntary one. Tinged with pathos and humour, they interrogate the moments in which femininity, womanness, and identity are not only questioned but also imposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shut Up You're Pretty&lt;/i&gt; is the first book to be published under the imprint VS. Books, a series of books curated and edited by writer-musician Vivek Shraya featuring work by new and emerging Indigenous or Black writers, or writers of colour.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Cats, dogs, people -- funny and heartbreaking stories from a pet veterinarian&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With insight and humor, Dr. Philipp Schott shares tales from the unlikely path he took into his career of veterinary science and anecdotes from his successful small-animal clinic. Dr. Schott brings to his writing the benefit of many years of expertise. Wisdom he imparts on readers includes the best way to give your cat a pill, how to prevent your very handy dog from opening a fridge, and how to handle your fish when it has half-swallowed another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through these and other experiences, Dr. Schott also learned that veterinary medicine is as much, if not more, about the people as it is the animals. And he will have you laughing and crying as you embark on this journey of discovery with him.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From bestselling author Patrick deWitt, a brilliant and darkly comic novel about a wealthy widow and her adult son who flee New York for Paris in the wake of scandal and financial disintegration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances Price – tart widow, possessive mother, and Upper East Side force of nature – is in dire straits, beset by scandal and impending bankruptcy. Her adult son Malcolm is no help, mired in a permanent state of arrested development. And then there’s the Prices' aging cat, Small Frank, who Frances believes houses the spirit of her late husband, an infamously immoral litigator and world-class cad whose gruesome tabloid death rendered Frances and Malcolm social outcasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting penury and pariahdom behind them, the family decides to cut their losses and head for the exit. One ocean voyage later, the curious trio land in their beloved Paris, the City of Light serving as a backdrop not for love or romance, but self destruction and economical ruin – to riotous effect. A number of singular characters serve to round out the cast: a bashful private investigator, an aimless psychic proposing a seance, a doctor who makes house calls with his wine merchant in tow, and the inimitable Mme. Reynard, aggressive houseguest and dementedly friendly American expat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brimming with pathos and wit, French Exit is a one-of-a-kind ‘tragedy of manners,’ a riotous send-up of high society, as well as a moving mother/son caper which only Patrick deWitt could conceive and execute</description>

  <description>How do you honour blood and chosen kin with equal care? A groundbreaking memoir spanning nations, prairie punk scenes, and queer love stories, Lindsay Nixon’s nîtisânak is woven around grief over the loss of their mother. It also explores despair and healing through community and family, and being torn apart by the same. Using cyclical narrative techniques and drawing on Nixon’s Cree, Saulteaux, and Métis ancestral teachings, this work offers a compelling perspective on the connections that must be broken and the ones that heal.</description>

  <description>The poems in Kelly Shepherd's &lt;i&gt;Insomniac Bird&lt;/i&gt; are a cartography and a geography of Edmonton. The poems which shift between short, individual lyric pieces and found text emulate a black-billed magpie's nest with the subject-matter and also physically, with the words and lines. The poems generate the theme of home (the bird's nest, the city), and not feeling at home; sleeping, and the inability to sleep. The magpie (the insomnia bird) is the protagonist and the muse, the thread that connects everything to everything else in this work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As such, Shepherd's poems move across the surface at speed, like Edmonton's NAIT train, and dive like magpies after the occasional tasty image or crumb of detail. The city as it spreads out across the Prairies, can do nothing to prevent urban sprawl, and grows taller with each new highrise building and office tower and sinks deeper into the ground, which is memory!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The city with purple fingers and black feathers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;is bending branches outside the window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the photosensitivity of morning, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;The city is an open window that can't hear itself think.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Shepherd's poems are at times critical of Edmonton's automobile culture and urban sprawl, his tone remains ironic rather than moralizing and he is consistent in his use of dark humour to avoid being didactic. With such guidance the poems effectively disclose what is not seen, what is repressed, what lies behind the scenes in the city he shares with magpies.</description>

  <description>In this jaw-dropping, darkly comedic memoir, a young woman comes of age in a dysfunctional Asian family whose members blamed their woes on ghosts and demons when in fact they should have been on anti-psychotic meds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lindsay Wong grew up with a paranoid schizophrenic grandmother and a mother who was deeply afraid of the "woo-woo"--Chinese ghosts who come to visit in times of personal turmoil. From a young age, she witnessed the woo-woo's sinister effects; at the age of six, she found herself living in the food court of her suburban mall, which her mother saw as a safe haven because they could hide there from dead people, and on a camping trip, her mother tried to light Lindsay's foot on fire to rid her of the woo-woo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eccentricities take a dark turn, however, when her aunt, suffering from a psychotic breakdown, holds the city of Vancouver hostage for eight hours when she threatens to jump off a bridge. And when Lindsay herself starts to experience symptoms of the woo-woo herself, she wonders whether she will suffer the same fate as her family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one hand a witty and touching memoir about the Asian immigrant experience, and on the other a harrowing and honest depiction of the vagaries of mental illness, The Woo-Woo is a gut-wrenching and beguiling manual for surviving family, and oneself.</description>

  <description>It begins with a boy. Theo Decker, a thirteen-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by his unbearable longing for his mother, he clings to one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into the underworld of art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love-and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Goldfinch&lt;/i&gt; combines vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and suspense, while plumbing with a philosopher's calm the deepest mysteries of love, identity, and art. It is an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention, and the ruthless machinations of fate.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this powerful and provocative memoir, genre-bending essayist and novelist Kiese Laymon explores what the weight of a lifetime of secrets, lies, and deception does to a black body, a black family, and a nation teetering on the brink of moral collapse.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiese Laymon is a fearless writer. In his essays, personal stories combine with piercing intellect to reflect both on the state of American society and on his experiences with abuse, which conjure conflicted feelings of shame, joy, confusion and humiliation. Laymon invites us to consider the consequences of growing up in a nation wholly obsessed with progress yet wholly disinterested in the messy work of reckoning with where we’ve been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Heavy&lt;/i&gt;, Laymon writes eloquently and honestly about growing up a hard-headed black son to a complicated and brilliant black mother in Jackson, Mississippi. From his early experiences of sexual violence, to his suspension from college, to his trek to New York as a young college professor, Laymon charts his complex relationship with his mother, grandmother, anorexia, obesity, sex, writing, and ultimately gambling. By attempting to name secrets and lies he and his mother spent a lifetime avoiding, Laymon asks himself, his mother, his nation, and us to confront the terrifying possibility that few in this nation actually know how to responsibly love, and even fewer want to live under the weight of actually becoming free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A personal narrative that illuminates national failures, &lt;i&gt;Heavy&lt;/i&gt; is defiant yet vulnerable, an insightful, often comical exploration of weight, identity, art, friendship, and family that begins with a confusing childhood—and continues through twenty-five years of haunting implosions and long reverberations.</description>

  <description>National Film Board of Canada Collection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Emmy-nominated, PBS-aired animated short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Flawed&lt;/i&gt; is a true story of self-acceptance, adapted from the Emmy-nominated film of the same name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Flawed&lt;/i&gt;, author Andrea Dorfman tells the true story of how she falls head over heels for Dave, "the nicest guy in the world." But she is conflicted about her feelings for her new love. He's a plastic surgeon; she hates plastic surgery and its power to make people feel flawed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dorfman joins Dave in the operating room to watch him fix a man's badly injured hand. She sees for herself the difference between plastic reconstructive surgery and cosmetic surgery. Dave truly is an artist. She knows she's falling in love. But when Dave performs a cosmetic surgery on a healthy boy so he won't be teased at school, Dorfman questions everything she thinks she loves about him. Her discomfort with Dave's decision to operate on the boy sends her on a journey of self-reflection that forces her to confront her own fears about the way she looks. She feels flawed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dorfman's playful and colorful illustrations along with her deeply personal writing takes readers through the genesis of her self-image -- from the carefree days of her childhood to the gut-wrenching awkwardness of her adolescence, and beyond. When she realizes that her negative self-perception is stopping her from being happy, Dorfman makes the bold move to accept herself as she is -- imperfections and all. As Dorfman concludes, it's our flaws that make us extraordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the tradition of the NFB's creative and innovative storytelling on film comes the National Film Board of Canada Collection: a series of celebrated animated films, documentary films and media projects adapted for the printed page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether discovering a much-loved classic for the first time or interacting with a favorite film in a new and exciting way, readers will be delighted with the thought-provoking stories and inventive presentations of the National Film Board of Canada Collection.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One man’s thrilling journey through an enchanted world to find his wife, who has disappeared after seemingly committing an unforgiveable act of violence, from the award-winning author of the &lt;i&gt;The Devil in Silver&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Big Machine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apollo Kagwa has had strange dreams that have haunted him since childhood. An antiquarian book dealer with a business called Improbabilia, he is just beginning to settle into his new life as a committed and involved father, unlike his own father who abandoned him, when his wife Emma begins acting strange. Disconnected and uninterested in their new baby boy, Emma at first seems to be exhibiting all the signs of post-partum depression, but it quickly becomes clear that her troubles go far beyond that. Before Apollo can do anything to help, Emma commits a horrific act—beyond any parent’s comprehension—and vanishes, seemingly into thin air. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus begins Apollo’s odyssey through a world he only thought he understood to find a wife and child who are nothing like he’d imagined. His quest begins when he meets a mysterious stranger who claims to have information about Emma’s whereabouts. Apollo then begins a journey that takes him to a forgotten island in the East River of New York City, a graveyard full of secrets, a forest in Queens where immigrant legends still live, and finally back to a place he thought he had lost forever. This dizzying tale is ultimately a story about family and the unfathomable secrets of the people we love.</description>

  <description>The close of the 20th century promised a new era of gender equality. However, the iconic women of the 1990s—such as Hillary Clinton, Courtney Love, Roseanne Barr, Marcia Clark, and Anita Hill—earned their places in history not as trailblazers, but as whipping girls of the media. During this decade, American society grew increasingly hostile to women who dared to speak up, challenge power, or defy rigid expectations for female behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deeply researched yet thoroughly engaging, &lt;em&gt;90s Bitch&lt;/em&gt; untangles the complex history of women in the 1990s, exploring how they were maligned by the media, vilified by popular culture, and objectified in the marketplace. In an age where even a presidential nominee can be derided as a “nasty woman,” it’s clear that the epidemic of casting women as bitches persists. To understand why we must take a long, hard look back at the 1990s—a decade in which female empowerment was twisted into bitchification and exploitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yarrow’s thoughtful, clear-eyed, and timely examination is a must-read for anyone seeking to understand gender politics and how we might end the “bitch epidemic” for the next generation.</description>

  <description>What does it mean to lose your roots—within your culture, within your family—and what happens when you find them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicole Chung was born severely premature, placed for adoption by her Korean parents, and raised by a white family in a sheltered Oregon town. From early childhood, she heard the story of her adoption as a comforting, prepackaged myth. She believed that her biological parents had made the ultimate sacrifice in the hopes of giving her a better life; that forever feeling slightly out of place was simply her fate as a transracial adoptee. But as she grew up—facing prejudice her adoptive family couldn’t see, finding her identity as an Asian American and a writer, becoming ever more curious about where she came from—she wondered if the story she’d been told was the whole truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With warmth, candor, and startling insight, Chung tells of her search for the people who gave her up, which coincided with the birth of her own child. &lt;i&gt;All You Can Ever Know&lt;/i&gt; is a profound, moving chronicle of surprising connections and the repercussions of unearthing painful family secrets—vital reading for anyone who has ever struggled to figure out where they belong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Finalist, National Book Critics Circle Award for Autobiography / Longlisted for the PEN Open Book Award / Named a Best Book of the Year by The Washington Post, NPR, The Boston Globe, TIME, Newsday, Library Journal, BuzzFeed, Real Simple, Paste Magazine, Chicago Public Library, Seattle Public Library, Goodreads, Shelf Awareness, Electric Literature, and more&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Ray Brower, a boy from a nearby town, has disappeared, and twelve-year-old Gordie Lachance and his three friends set out on a quest to find his body along the railroad tracks. During the course of their journey, Gordie, Chris Chambers, Teddy Duchamp, and Vern Tessio come to terms with death and the harsh truths of growing up in a small factory town that doesn’t offer much in the way of a future.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A timeless exploration of the loneliness and isolation of young adulthood, Stephen King’s &lt;i&gt;The Body&lt;/i&gt; is an iconic, unforgettable, coming-of-age story.</description>

They really pulled a lot from this script, but I think that in some ways, the movie was stronger than the book. King creates great characters and a good...]]>

  <description>Following the Scotiabank Giller Prize-shortlisted &lt;i&gt;Son of a Trickster&lt;/i&gt; comes &lt;i&gt;Trickster Drift&lt;/i&gt;, the second book in Eden Robinson's captivating Trickster trilogy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an effort to keep all forms of magic at bay, Jared, 17, has quit drugs and drinking. But his troubles are not over: now he's being stalked by David, his mom's ex--a preppy, khaki-wearing psycho with a proclivity for rib-breaking. And his mother, Maggie, a living, breathing badass as well as a witch, can't protect him like she used to because he's moved away from Kitimat to Vancouver for school.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even though he's got a year of sobriety under his belt (no thanks to his enabling, ever-partying mom), Jared also struggles with the temptation of drinking. And he's got to get his grades up, find a job that doesn't involve weed cookies, and somehow live peacefully with his Aunt Mave, who has been estranged from the family ever since she tried to "rescue" him as a baby from his mother. An indigenous activist and writer, Mave smothers him with pet names and hugs, but she is blind to the real dangers that lurk around them--the spirits and supernatural activity that fill her apartment.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the son of a Trickster, Jared is a magnet for magic, whether he hates it or not--he sees ghosts, he sees the monster moving underneath his Aunt Georgina's skin, he sees the creature that comes out of his bedroom wall and creepily wants to suck his toes. He also still hears the Trickster in his head, and other voices too. When the David situation becomes a crisis, Jared can't ignore his true nature any longer.</description>

      <![CDATA[I love the character of Jared and I loved this world and the Vancouver details. That said, I felt that this book was a bit of a slow burn. It was definitely the least violent of Eden's books. She's created a character and a world that I feel very invested in. I also love her humour. ]]>

  <description>Poetry. Winner of the 2017 Robert Kroetsch Award for Innovative Poetry. Voyeurism and fact go head to head in PORT OF BEING, a debut poetry collection that mines speech from the city streets and the Internet. These are poems set firmly on the threshold of the private and public, the future-haunted and the real, forging the human adrift in a terrain of space junk, drones, and addiction. PORT OF BEING speaks just in time, navigating the worlds of surveillance, migration, and money, only to carve a way into intimacy and connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Shazia Hafiz Ramji writes with an intimacy that echoes the unspoken familiar across the ocean to map us--to 'root and hold' us--right now, right here where we live. PORT OF BEING is a collection of keen listening, where words are found, spliced, and always woven with sunshine, pain, and memory that shimmers."--Juliane Okot Bitek&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"PORT OF BEING by Shazia Hafiz Ramji, is a revelation: one that reveals the surface beneath the surface, and the uncertain in the overdetermined. If the city is a machine of social sublimation, then these poems are the glint of its gears. Ramji demonstrates with devastating energy how form is infrastructure. You could drown in the static of our times, or you could traverse it like an ocean. PORT OF BEING is an ingenious manual, in verse, for how to do the latter."--Wayde Compton&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Like a section of ocean caught, cubed, and shot through with the light of our closest star, Shazia Hafiz Ramji's PORT OF BEING moves with and against time and borders. Her poems surveil what's witnessed and what we admit to witnessing, the secrets we tell and those we keep, and the questions: why and for whose benefit? In equal measures, this book is bioluminescent, galactic, humane. Daring and intimate, it holds worlds."--Dani Couture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Like Teju Cole, Shazia Hafiz Ramji presents a city in full intricacy: the expansive possibilities of human connection and the digital silos that separate. Like Solmaz Sharif, she teaches us to look at violence: the quotidian bedrooms, buses, and spaces in which it is experienced, the ideologies that allow for its transmission. PORT OF BEING is urgent and uncomfortable, comforting and necessary."--Benjamin Hertwig&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"PORT OF BEING confronts us with the global algorithms and state apparatuses docked in our consciousness, and the cyborgs of time and space that mark the shock of bodies rammed through ideologies. Here we find out how to navigate fake news, flags of convenience, and engineered personhood. A brilliant debut collection. Its politics bite back."--Meredith Quartermain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"In PORT OF BEING, a desiring, witnessing body moves through Vancouver, speaking our individual human vulnerability to surveillance, technologies of war, and neo-capitalism's brutal structuring of spaces and dreams. In a world where 'Google knows more than our lovers, ' Shazia Hafiz Ramji sees us acutely as ports: as soft animal receptacles for what travels at light speed through fibre optic cables, and as jagged, welcoming horizons, where we might exchange our cargos of experience and offer fellow voyagers tender language. Plug this book directly into your cardiac rhythms."--Sonnet L'Abb�</description>

  <description>Wil Wheaton has never been one to take the conventional path to success. Despite early stardom through his childhood role in the motion picture "Stand By Me," and growing up on television as Wesley Crusher on "Star Trek: The Next Generation," Wil left Hollywood in pursuit of happiness, purpose, and a viable means of paying the bills. In the oddest of places, Topeka, Kansas, Wil discovered that despite his claims to fame, he was at heart "Just a Geek." In this bestselling book, Wil shares his deeply personal and difficult journey to find himself. You'll understand the rigors, and joys, of Wil's rediscovering of himself, as he comes to terms with what it means to be famous, or, ironically, famous for once having been famous. Writing with honesty and disarming humanity, Wil touches on the frustrations associated with his acting career, his inability to distance himself from Ensign Crusher in the public's eyes, the launch of his incredibly successful web site, wilwheaton.net, and the joy he's found in writing. Through all of this, Wil shares the ups and downs he encountered along the journey, along with the support and love he discovered from his friends and family. The stories in "Just a Geek" include: Wil's plunge from teen star to struggling actor, discovering the joys of HTML, blogging, Linux, and web design, the struggle between Wesley Crusher, Starfleet ensign, and Wil Wheaton, author and blogger, gut-wrenching reactions to the 9-11 disaster, moving tales of Wil's relationships with his wife, step-children, and extended family, and the transition from a B-list actor to an A-list author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wil Wheaton—celebrity, blogger, and geek—writes for the geek in all of us. Engaging, witty, and pleasantly self-deprecating, "Just a Geek" will surprise you and make you laugh.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the # 1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Signature of All Things&lt;/i&gt;, a delicious novel of glamour, sex, and adventure, about a young woman discovering that you don't have to be a &lt;i&gt;good girl&lt;/i&gt; to be a good person.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Life is both fleeting and dangerous, and there is no point in denying yourself pleasure, or being anything other than what you are.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beloved author Elizabeth Gilbert returns to fiction with a unique love story set in the New York City theater world during the 1940s. Told from the perspective of an older woman as she looks back on her youth with both pleasure and regret (but mostly pleasure), &lt;i&gt;City of Girls&lt;/i&gt; explores themes of female sexuality and promiscuity, as well as the idiosyncrasies of true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1940, nineteen-year-old Vivian Morris has just been kicked out of Vassar College, owing to her lackluster freshman-year performance. Her affluent parents send her to Manhattan to live with her Aunt Peg, who owns a flamboyant, crumbling midtown theater called the Lily Playhouse. There Vivian is introduced to an entire cosmos of unconventional and charismatic characters, from the fun-chasing showgirls to a sexy male actor, a grand-dame actress, a lady-killer writer, and no-nonsense stage manager. But when Vivian makes a personal mistake that results in professional scandal, it turns her new world upside down in ways that it will take her years to fully understand. Ultimately, though, it leads her to a new understanding of the kind of life she craves-and the kind of freedom it takes to pursue it. It will also lead to the love of her life, a love that stands out from all the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now ninety-five years old and telling her story at last, Vivian recalls how the events of those years altered the course of her life - and the gusto and autonomy with which she approached it. &lt;i&gt;At some point in a woman's life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time,&lt;/i&gt; she muses. &lt;i&gt;After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is.&lt;/i&gt; Written with a powerful wisdom about human desire and connection, &lt;i&gt;City of Girls&lt;/i&gt; is a love story like no other.</description>

I also liked the sexuality and the voice of the main character. Lots of historical details. I felt the book faltered...]]>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Bri wants to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. Or at least make it out of her neighborhood one day. As the daughter of an underground rap legend who died before he hit big, Bri’s got big shoes to fill. But now that her mom has unexpectedly lost her job, food banks and shutoff notices are as much a part of Bri’s life as beats and rhymes. With bills piling up and homelessness staring her family down, Bri no longer just wants to make it—she has to make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Come Up&lt;/i&gt; is Angie Thomas’s homage to hip-hop, the art that sparked her passion for storytelling and continues to inspire her to this day. It is the story of fighting for your dreams, even as the odds are stacked against you; of the struggle to become who you are and not who everyone expects you to be; and of the desperate realities of poor and working-class black families.</description>

  <description>The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Columbine&lt;/em&gt; offers a deeply moving account of the extraordinary teenage survivors of the Parkland shooting who pushed back against the NRA and Congressional leaders and launched the singular grassroots March for Our Lives movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma Gonzalez called BS. David Hogg called out Adult America. The uprising had begun. Cameron Kasky immediately recruited a colorful band of theatre kids and rising activists and brought them together in his living room to map out a movement. Four days after escaping Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, two dozen extraordinary kids announced the audacious March for Our Lives. A month later, it was the fourth largest protest in American history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave Cullen, who has been reporting on the epidemic of school shootings for two decades, takes us along on the students’ nine-month odyssey to the midterms and beyond. With unrivaled access to their friends and families, meetings and homes, he pulls back the curtain to reveal intimate portraits of the quirky, playful organizers that have taken the nation by storm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cullen brings us onto the bus for the Road to Change tour showing us how these kids seized an opportunity. They hit the highway to organize the young activist groups mushrooming across America in their image. Rattled but undeterred, they pressed on in gun country even as adversaries armed with assault weapons tailed them across Texas and Utah trying to scare them off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Parkland students are genuinely candid about their experiences. We see them cope with shattered friendships and PTSD, along with the normal day-to-day struggles of school, including AP exams and college acceptances. Yet, with the idealism of youth they are mostly bubbling with fresh ideas. As victims refusing victimhood, they continue to devise clever new tactics to stir their generation to action while building a powerhouse network to match the NRA’s. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spell-binding book is a testament to change and a perceptive examination of a pivotal moment in American culture. After two decades of adult hand-wringing, the MFOL kids are mapping a way out. They see a long road ahead, a generational struggle to save every kid of every color from the ravages of gun violence in America. Parkland is a story of staggering empowerment and hope, told through the wildly creative and wickedly funny voices of a group of remarkable kids.</description>

  <description>Poet and scholar Tanis MacDonald has taught creative writing for twenty years all across Canada: in small community workshops, large university classes and everything in between. The question she's heard the most is "How can I be a writer?" and she realized early on that this question had nothing to do with putting words on a page. &lt;i&gt;Out of Line&lt;/i&gt; is her answer to this question. This book is about creativity and community, about what it is like to try and pick up a pen, or a paintbrush, and create art for the first time when you don't come from a background with access to the arts. In this wide-ranging work, MacDonald looks at our societal preconceptions about the artist lifestyle and examines how real artists fit into the everyday world. Along the way she walks the reader through the steps that must be taken for an idea to make it from a concept to a finished piece and what happens once the work is out in the world. But &lt;i&gt;Out of Line&lt;/i&gt; also tackles how issues such as class and the rural-urban divide can structure our interactions with the arts. MacDonald examines the experiences artists have, whether beginners or established, in finding a community to support them and celebrate their work outside of the major urban centres where the industry has traditionally been clustered. In the end, &lt;i&gt;Out of Line&lt;/i&gt; works to open up the arts to everyone who might dream of creating.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Could psychedelic drugs change our worldview? One of America's most admired writers takes us on a mind-altering journey to the frontiers of human consciousness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;When LSD was first discovered in the 1940s, it seemed to researchers, scientists and doctors as if the world might be on the cusp of psychological revolution. It promised to shed light on the deep mysteries of consciousness, as well as offer relief to addicts and the mentally ill. But in the 1960s, with the vicious backlash against the counter-culture, all further research was banned. In recent years, however, work has quietly begun again on the amazing potential of LSD, psilocybin and DMT. Could these drugs in fact improve the lives of many people? Diving deep into this extraordinary world and putting himself forward as a guinea-pig, Michael Pollan has written a remarkable history of psychedelics and a compelling portrait of the new generation of scientists fascinated by the implications of these drugs. &lt;i&gt;How to Change Your Mind&lt;/i&gt; is a report from what could very well be the future of human consciousness.</description>

  <description>From Rebecca Traister, the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;All the Single Ladies &lt;/i&gt;comes a vital, incisive exploration into the transformative power of female anger and its ability to transcend into a political movement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the year 2018, it seems as if women’s anger has suddenly erupted into the public conversation. But long before Pantsuit Nation, before the Women’s March, and before the #MeToo movement, women’s anger was not only politically catalytic—but politically problematic. The story of female fury and its cultural significance demonstrates the long history of bitter resentment that has enshrouded women’s slow rise to political power in America, as well as the ways that anger is received when it comes from women as opposed to when it comes from men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With eloquence and fervor, Rebecca tracks the history of female anger as political fuel—from suffragettes marching on the White House to office workers vacating their buildings after Clarence Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court. Here Traister explores women’s anger at both men and other women; anger between ideological allies and foes; the varied ways anger is perceived based on its owner; as well as the history of caricaturing and delegitimizing female anger; and the way women’s collective fury has become transformative political fuel—as is most certainly occurring today. She deconstructs society’s (and the media’s) condemnation of female emotion (notably, rage) and the impact of their resulting repercussions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Highlighting a double standard perpetuated against women by all sexes, and its disastrous, stultifying effect, Traister’s latest is timely and crucial. It offers a glimpse into the galvanizing force of women’s collective anger, which, when harnessed, can change history.</description>

  <description>Why couldn't I occupy the world as those model-looking women did, with their flowing hair, pulling their tiny bright suitcases as if to say, I just arrived from elsewhere, and I already belong here, and this sidewalk belongs to me? When her marriage suddenly ends, and a diary documenting her beloved grandfather's escape from Nazi-occupied Netherlands in the summer of 1942 is discovered, Naomi K. Lewis decides to retrace his journey to learn about her family history. Despite suffering from extreme disorientation and a lifetime of anxiety, she travels alone for the first time. Moving from Amsterdam to Lyon--relying on the marvels of GPS--she discovers family secrets and her own narrative as a second-generation Jewish Canadian. With vulnerability, humour, and wisdom, Lewis's memoir asks tough questions about her identity as a secular Jew, the accuracy of family stories, and the impact of the Holocaust on subsequent generations. How do immigrants weave their sense of identity into their chosen countries? Must we be able to locate ourselves within family and cultural geography to belong?</description>

  <description>Elizabeth Hay, one of Canada's most beloved novelists has written a poignant, complex, and hugely resonant memoir about the shift she experienced between being her parents' daughter to their guardian and caregiver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the daughter takes charge, and the writer takes notes, her mother and father are like two legendary icebergs floating south. They melt into the ocean of partial, painful, inconsistent, and funny stories that a family makes over time. Hay's eloquent memoir distills these stories into basic truths about parents and children and their efforts of understanding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her uncommon sharpness and wit, Elizabeth Hay offers her insights into the peculiarities of her family's dynamics--her parents' marriage, sibling rivalries, miscommunications that spur decades of resentment all matched by true and genuine love and devotion. Her parents are each startling characters in their own right--her mother is a true skinflint who would rather serve up wormy soup (twice) than throw away an ancient packet of "perfectly good" mix; her father is a proud and well-mannered man with a temper that can be explosive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All Things Consoled &lt;/i&gt;is a startlingly beautiful memoir that addresses the exquisite agony of family, the unstoppable force of dementia, and the inevitability of aging.</description>

  <description>From the internationally acclaimed Inuit throat singer who has dazzled and enthralled the world with music it had never heard before, a fierce, tender, heartbreaking story unlike anything you've ever read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fact can be as strange as fiction. It can also be as dark, as violent, as rapturous. In the end, there may be no difference between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A girl grows up in Nunavut in the 1970s. She knows joy, and friendship, and parents' love. She knows boredom, and listlessness, and bullying. She knows the tedium of the everyday world, and the raw, amoral power of the ice and sky, the seductive energy of the animal world. She knows the ravages of alcohol, and violence at the hands of those she should be able to trust. She sees the spirits that surround her, and the immense power that dwarfs all of us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she becomes pregnant, she must navigate all this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veering back and forth between the grittiest features of a small arctic town, the electrifying proximity of the world of animals, and ravishing world of myth, Tanya Tagaq explores a world where the distinctions between good and evil, animal and human, victim and transgressor, real and imagined lose their meaning, but the guiding power of love remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunting, brooding, exhilarating, and tender all at once, Tagaq moves effortlessly between fiction and memoir, myth and reality, poetry and prose, and conjures a world and a heroine readers will never forget.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"People always ask me about life after childhood stardom. What would I say to parents of children in the industry? My only advice, honestly, is to get these kids out of Hollywood and let them lead normal lives." —Corey Feldman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A deeply personal and revealing Hollywood-survival story.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lovable child star by age ten, international teen idol by fifteen, and to this day a perennial pop-culture staple, Corey Feldman has not only spent the entirety of his life in the spotlight, he's become just as famous for his off-screen exploits as for his roles in such classic films as &lt;i&gt;Gremlins, The Goonies, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Stand by Me&lt;/i&gt;. He's been linked to a slew of Hollywood starlets (including Drew Barrymore, Vanessa Marcil, and adult entertainer Ginger Lynn), shared a highly publicized friendship with Michael Jackson, and with his frequent costar Corey Haim enjoyed immeasurable success as one half of the wildly popular duo "The Two Coreys," spawning seven films, a 1-900 number, and "Coreymania" in the process. What child of the eighties didn't have a Corey Feldman poster hanging in her bedroom, or a pile of &lt;i&gt;Tiger Beats&lt;/i&gt; stashed in his closet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in this brave and moving memoir, Corey is revealing the truth about what his life was like behind the scenes: His is a past that included physical, drug, and sexual abuse, a dysfunctional family from which he was emancipated at age fifteen, three high-profile arrests for drug possession, a nine-month stint in rehab, and a long, slow crawl back to the top of the box office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Corey has managed to overcome the traps that ensnared so many other entertainers of his generation—he's still acting, is a touring musician, and is a proud father to his son, Zen—many of those closest to him haven't been so lucky. In the span of one year, he mourned the passing of seven friends and family members, including Corey Haim and Michael Jackson. In the wake of those tragedies, he's spoken publicly about the dark side of fame, lobbied for legislation affording greater protections for children in the entertainment industry, and lifted the lid off of what he calls Hollywood's biggest secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Coreyography&lt;/i&gt; is his surprising account of survival and redemption.</description>

  <description>Neuroscientist Lipska was diagnosed early in 2015 with metastatic melanoma in her brain's frontal lobe. As the cancer progressed and was treated, the author experienced behavioral and cognitive symptoms connected to a range of mental disorders, including her professional specialty, schizophrenia. Lipska's family and associates were alarmed by the changes in her behavior, which she failed to acknowledge herself. Gradually, after a course of immunotherapy, Lipska returned to normal functioning, recalled her experience and, through her knowledge of neuroscience, identified the ways in which her brain changed during treatment. Lipska admits her condition was unusual; after recovery she was able to return to her research and resume her athletic training and compete in a triathalon. Most patients with similar brain cancers rarely survive to describe their ordeal. Lipska's memoir, coauthored with journalist McArdle, shows that strength and courage but also a encouraging support network are vital to recovery</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Gus Van Sant’s film and the ’90s cult of the alternative&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gus Van Sant’s 1991 indie darling &lt;i&gt;My Own Private Idaho&lt;/i&gt; perplexed and provoked, inspiring a new ethos for a new decade: being different was better than being good. &lt;i&gt;Gentlemen of the Shade&lt;/i&gt; examines how the film was a coming-of-age for a generation of young people who would embrace the alternative and bring their outsider perspectives to sustainability, technology, gender constructs, and social responsibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Own Private Idaho&lt;/i&gt; — fragmented and saturated with colour and dirt and a painfully beautiful masculinity — also crept into popular media, and its influence can still be traced. R.E.M. Portlandia. Hipsterism. James Franco. Referencing the often-funny and sometimes-tragic cultural touchstones of the past 26 years, &lt;i&gt;Gentlemen of the Shade&lt;/i&gt; sets the film as social bellwether for the many outsiders who were looking to join the right, or any, revolution.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A startling, moving magic realist debut&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost immediately upon Julie Bird’s return to the small port town where she was raised, everyday life is turned upside down. Julie’s Gulf War vet father, Marty, has been on the losing side of a battle with PTSD for too long. A day of boating takes a dramatic turn when a majestic blue whale beaches itself and dies. A blond stranger sets up camp oceanside: she’s an agitator, musician-impersonator, and armchair philosopher named Jennie Lee Lewis — and Julie discovers she’s connected to her father’s mysterious trip to New Mexico 25 years earlier. As the blue whale decays on the beach, more wildlife turns up dead — apparently by suicide — echoing Marty’s deepest desire. But Julie isn’t ready for a world without her father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A stunning exploration of love and grief, &lt;i&gt;Land Mammals and Sea Creatures&lt;/i&gt; is magic realism on the seaside, a novel about living life to the fullest and coming to your own terms with its end.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An original, imaginative, and hilarious debut novel about love, anxiety, and sea creatures, from the author of &lt;i&gt;So Sad Today.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy has been writing her dissertation about Sappho for thirteen years when she and Jamie break up. After she hits rock bottom in Phoenix, her Los Angeles-based sister insists Lucy housesit for the summer—her only tasks caring for a beloved diabetic dog and trying to learn to care for herself. Annika’s home is a gorgeous glass cube atop Venice Beach, but Lucy can find no peace from her misery and anxiety—not in her love addiction group therapy meetings, not in frequent Tinder meetups, not in Dominic the foxhound’s easy affection, not in ruminating on the ancient Greeks. Yet everything changes when Lucy becomes entranced by an eerily attractive swimmer one night while sitting alone on the beach rocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whip-smart, neurotically funny, sexy, and above all, fearless, &lt;i&gt;The Pisces&lt;/i&gt; is built on a premise both sirenic and incredibly real—what happens when you think love will save you but are afraid it might also kill you.</description>

  <description>The land is contoured in a way that breeds sound: it sloughs from the bird cliffs, heaves over the water in a rich, fetid roll. From the endangered Canadian boreal forest to the environmentally threatened Svalbard archipelago off the coast of Norway, Jenna Butler takes us on a sea voyage that connects continents and traces the impacts of climate change on northern lands. With a feminist gaze, she questions explorer narratives and the mythic draw of the polar North. As a woman who cannot have children, she writes out the internal friction of travelling in Svalbard during the fertile height of the Arctic summer. Blending travelogue and poetic meditation on place, Magnetic North will draw readers' minds to the beauty and power of landscapes under threat, and ask them why some stories in recorded history are privileged at the expense of those left to speak from beneath the surface.</description>

  <description>"Ma'am, you sound like a very reasonable person. Can I advise you to just move?" A young family moves into a neighbourhood with a reputation for crime. As they make their home in one of the oldest parts of the city, Carissa Halton reflects on the changing view from her little yellow house. While others nervously examine the less than-stellar reputation of her surroundings, she heads out to meet her neighbours, and through them discovers the innate beauty in her community. Halton invites us to meet a cast of diverse characters including cat rescuers, tragic teens, art evangelists, and crime fighters, whose walks of life, though very different from her own, has led to them being the people in her neighbourhood. Threaded through this collection of essays are questions about the social and economic forces that shape and reshape our cities.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heartwarming and refreshing debut novel that proves one thing: there's not enough data in the world to predict what will make your heart tick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Lane thinks math is the only thing that unites the universe. She comes up with algorithms to predict customer purchases — a job that has given her more money than she knows what to do with, and way less experience in the dating department than the average thirty-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't help that Stella has Asperger's and French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth cleaned by pilot fish. Her conclusion: she needs lots of practice — with a professional. Which is why she hires escort Michael Phan. The Vietnamese and Swedish stunner can't afford to turn down Stella's offer, and agrees to help her check off all the boxes on her lesson plan — from foreplay to more-than-missionary position...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Stella not only learns to appreciate his kisses, but to crave all the other things he's making her feel. Soon, their no-nonsense partnership starts making a strange kind of sense. And the pattern that emerges will convince Stella that love is the best kind of logic...</description>

  <description>On a day that begins like any other, Hal receives a mysterious letter bequeathing her a substantial inheritance. She realizes very quickly that the letter was sent to the wrong person—but also that the cold-reading skills she’s honed as a tarot card reader might help her claim the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, Hal finds herself at the funeral of the deceased…where it dawns on her that there is something very, very wrong about this strange situation and the inheritance at the centre of it.</description>

  <description>M_____ is dying of cancer. Only thirty-two, an extra with a meagre list of credits to their name and afraid of being forgotten, M_____ starts recounting the strange, fantastic, and ultimately tragic path of their love affair with the world’s greatest living “redshirt”—a man who has died or appeared dead in nearly eight hundred film and television roles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In a compelling narrative of blog entries interspersed with film script excerpts, &lt;i&gt;The Death Scene Artist&lt;/i&gt; immerses readers in a three-act surrealist exploration of the obsessive fault-finding of body dysmorphia and the dangerous desires of a man who has lived several hundred half-minute lives without having ever experienced his own.</description>

  <description>The Inheritance of Shame details the six years author Peter Gajdics spent in a bizarre form of conversion therapy that attempted to “cure” him of his homosexuality. Kept with other patients in a cult-like home in British Columbia, Canada, Gajdics was under the authority of a dominating, rogue psychiatrist who controlled his patients, in part, by creating and exploiting a false sense of family. Juxtaposed against his parents’ tormented past — his mother’s incarceration and escape from a communist concentration camp in post-World War II Yugoslavia, and his father’s upbringing as an orphan in war-torn Hungary — Gajdics’ story explores the universal themes of childhood trauma, oppression, and intergenerational pain. Told over a period of decades, the book shows us the damaging repercussions of conversion therapy and reminds us that resilience, compassion, and the courage to speak the truth exist within us all.</description>

  <description>In these unconventional, interconnected stories of first-person narratives in an age of text messages and Instagram posts, gay men look for love, steal office supplies, hook up on Grindr, bake pies, see therapists, have threesomes with ghosts, and fear happiness. With wry abandon and a beguiling heart, &lt;i&gt;Everything Is Awful and You're a Terrible Person&lt;/i&gt; is a deadpan, tragicomic exploration of love, desire, and dysfunction in the twenty-first century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Daniel Zomparelli&lt;/b&gt; is editor and founder of &lt;i&gt;Poetry Is Dead&lt;/i&gt; magazine, and the author of the poetry collections &lt;i&gt;Davie Street Translations&lt;/i&gt; and (with Dina Del Bucchia) &lt;i&gt;Rom Com&lt;/i&gt;. This is his first work of fiction.</description>

  <description>Isabella Caro, born in Florence at the de-occupation of Italy in WW2 is a woman shaped by the resilience of her country and a thirst for knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this fictional Novel-in-Verse we take a journey through one woman's life, told from the perspective of three characters: Isabella, her daughter Alina and her granddaughter Georgia. Three voices weave through a lifetime in and out of harmony as they tell us a story of innocence, feminism, intellect, motherhood, immigration, understanding and loss. Ancient mythology is weaved through the poems and the character's voices ring with the echoes of the maiden, the mother and the crone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of a feminist and scholar and the story of mothers and daughters that takes us from 1944 Italy to the the Prairies in 2014. We meet Isabella as a child and follow her story as she marries, suffers from postpartum depression, immigrates to Canada, struggles to connect with her teen daughter, takes on the care of her grandchild and finds peace in old love. In poems both blunt and confessional a woman's story is revealed, page by page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This debut collection by Rayanne Haines is a creative threading of perspectives and memories about the fictional life of Isabella Caro, by three women who are fictional and yet remarkably real.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Voodoo Hypothesis&lt;/i&gt; is a subversion of the imperial construct of "blackness" and a rejection of the contemporary and historical systems that paint black people as inferior, through constant parallel representations of "evil" and "savagery." Pulling from pop culture, science, pseudo-science and contemporary news stories about race, Lubrin asks: What happens if the systems of belief that give science, religion and culture their importance were actually applied to the contemporary "black experience"? With its irreverence toward colonialism, and the related obsession with post-colonialism and anti-colonialism, and her wide-ranging lines, deftly touched with an intermingling of Caribbean Creole, English patois and baroque language, Lubrin has created a book that holds up a torch to the narratives of the ruling class, and shows us the restorative possibilities that exist in language itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A powerful, darkly glittering novel of violence, love, faith, and loss, as a young woman at an elite American university is drawn into acts of domestic terrorism by a cult tied to North Korea.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Phoebe Lin and Will Kendall meet their first month at prestigious Edwards University. Phoebe is a glamorous girl who doesn't tell anyone she blames herself for her mother's recent death. Will is a misfit scholarship boy who transfers to Edwards from Bible college, waiting tables to get by. What he knows for sure is that he loves Phoebe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Grieving and guilt-ridden, Phoebe is increasingly drawn into a religious group—a secretive extremist cult—founded by a charismatic former student, John Leal. He has an enigmatic past that involves North Korea and Phoebe's Korean American family. Meanwhile, Will struggles to confront the fundamentalism he's tried to escape, and the obsession consuming the one he loves. When the group bombs several buildings in the name of faith, killing five people, Phoebe disappears. Will devotes himself to finding her, tilting into obsession himself, seeking answers to what happened to Phoebe and if she could have been responsible for this violent act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Incendiaries&lt;/i&gt; is a fractured love story and a brilliant examination of the minds of extremist terrorists, and of what can happen to people who lose what they love most.</description>

  <description>Beth Macy takes us into the epicenter of America's twenty-plus year struggle with opioid addiction. From distressed small communities in Central Appalachia to wealthy suburbs; from disparate cities to once-idyllic farm towns; it's a heartbreaking trajectory that illustrates how this national crisis has persisted for so long and become so firmly entrenched. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning with a single dealer who lands in a small Virginia town and sets about turning high school football stars into heroin overdose statistics, Macy endeavors to answer a grieving mother's question-why her only son died-and comes away with a harrowing story of greed and need. From the introduction of OxyContin in 1996, Macy parses how America embraced a medical culture where overtreatment with painkillers became the norm. In some of the same distressed communities featured in her bestselling book &lt;i&gt;Factory Man&lt;/i&gt;, the unemployed use painkillers both to numb the pain of joblessness and pay their bills, while privileged teens trade pills in cul-de-sacs, and even high school standouts fall prey to prostitution, jail, and death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through unsparing, yet deeply human portraits of the families and first responders struggling to ameliorate this epidemic, each facet of the crisis comes into focus. In these politically fragmented times, Beth Macy shows, astonishingly, that the only thing that unites Americans across geographic and class lines is opioid drug abuse. But in a country unable to provide basic healthcare for all, Macy still finds reason to hope-and signs of the spirit and tenacity necessary in those facing addiction to build a better future for themselves and their families.</description>

  <description>When longtime Zen practitioner and world-renowned writing teacher Natalie Goldberg learns that she has a life-threatening illness, she is plunged into the challenging realm of hospitals, physicians, unfamiliar medical treatments, and the intense reality of her own impermanence. In navigating this foreign landscape, Natalie illuminates a pathway through illness that is grounded in the fierce commitment to embrace the suffering directly. In the middle of this, her partner discovers that she too has cancer. The cancer twins, as Natalie calls them, must together and apart grapple with survival, love, and the rawness of human connection. This book is a moving meditation on living a genuine life in full bloom.</description>

  <description>From Mallory Ortberg comes a collection of darkly mischievous stories based on classic fairy tales. Adapted from their beloved "Children's Stories Made Horrific" series, &lt;i&gt;The Merry Spinster&lt;/i&gt; takes up the trademark wit that endeared Ortberg to readers of both &lt;i&gt;The Toast&lt;/i&gt; and their best-selling debut &lt;i&gt;Texts from Jane Eyre&lt;/i&gt;. The feature become among the most popular on the site, with each entry bringing in tens of thousands of views, as the stories proved a perfect vehicle for Ortberg’s eye for deconstruction and destabilization. Sinister and inviting, familiar and alien all at the same time, &lt;i&gt;The Merry Spinster&lt;/i&gt; updates traditional children's stories and fairy tales with elements of psychological horror, emotional clarity, and a keen sense of feminist mischief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers of &lt;i&gt;The Toast&lt;/i&gt; will instantly recognize Ortberg's boisterous good humor and uber-nerd swagger: those new to Ortberg's oeuvre will delight in their unique spin on fiction, where something a bit mischievous and unsettling is always at work just beneath the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfalteringly faithful to its beloved source material, &lt;i&gt;The Merry Spinster&lt;/i&gt; also illuminates the unsuspected, and frequently, alarming emotional complexities at play in the stories we tell ourselves, and each other, as we tuck ourselves in for the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bedtime will never be the same.</description>

  <description>By the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Seinfeldia&lt;/i&gt;, a fascinating retrospective of the iconic and award-winning television series, &lt;i&gt;Sex and the City,&lt;/i&gt; to coincide with the show’s twentieth anniversary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Candace Bushnell started writing her “Sex and the City” column for the &lt;i&gt;New York Observer&lt;/i&gt;, she didn’t think anyone beyond the Upper East Side would care about her adventures among the Hamptons-hopping media elite. But her struggles with singlehood struck a chord, making her a citywide—and soon nationwide—sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beverly Hills, 90210&lt;/i&gt; creator Darren Star brought Bushnell’s vision to an even wider audience when he adapted the column for an HBO series. His four main characters: Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha, forever branded the actresses that took on the roles, redefined women’s relationship to sex, and elevated the perception of singlehood. With their fashion-forward lifestyle, they launched a barrage of trends, from fabric flower accessories to Manolo Blahnik shoes to Cosmopolitan cocktails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sex and the City and Us&lt;/i&gt; is the story of how a columnist, two gay men—Darren Star and fellow executive producer Michael Patrick King—and a writers’ room full of women used their own poignant, hilarious, and humiliating stories to launch a cultural phenomenon, pushing the boundaries of television and ignited a national conversation about single women and sex in the process. While the show’s feminist merits continue to fuel debate, it taught viewers—male and female, gay and straight—about sex, and demonstrated that single women could support each other through life’s tribulations, even as men came and went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring exclusive new interviews with the cast and writers, including star Sarah Jessica Parker, creator Darren Star, executive producer Michael Patrick King, and author Candace Bushnell, &lt;i&gt;Sex and the City and U&lt;/i&gt;s brings us behind-the-scenes for a nostalgic look at a TV series that changed the way women everywhere see themselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lara Jean is having &lt;i&gt;the best&lt;/i&gt; senior year.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there’s still so much to look forward to: a class trip to New York City, prom with her boyfriend Peter, Beach Week after graduation, and her dad’s wedding to Ms. Rothschild. Then she’ll be off to college with Peter, at a school close enough for her to come home and bake chocolate chip cookies on the weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life couldn’t be more perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, that’s what Lara Jean thinks . . . until she gets some unexpected news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the girl who dreads change must rethink all her plans—but when your heart and your head are saying two different things, which one should you listen to?</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a good light read. I love the relationship between Lara Jean and Peter. There's a lot of tension that develops because they don't get accepted into the same college. Other plots involve friendships and their father's marriage. This was a really fun book, and a nice, truthful conclusion t...]]>

  <description>Folk hero. Rock icon. Living legend. Buffy Sainte-Marie is all of these things, and Greystone is proud to celebrate the incredible Cree singer-songwriter, activist, and educator with her authorized biography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more than 50 years, Sainte-Marie has made her voice heard through her music, art, and activism, establishing herself among the ranks of folk greats such as Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan. She’s released more than twenty albums and ten singles, survived being blacklisted by two U.S. presidents, and has received countless accolades, including the only Academy Award ever to be won by a First Nations artist. Her most recent album, Power in the Blood (2015), won the Polaris Music Prize and two Juno Awards. But Sainte-Marie is so much more than a musician; she is also an entrepreneur, a pioneer in digital art, and an important cultural activist who has worked tirelessly advocating for and protecting Indigenous rights and freedoms. Her incredible contributions to society will be recognized when she receives the Allan Waters Humanitarian Award at the 2017 Juno Awards, and will also come to light in her forthcoming biography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penned by leading music, culture, and feminist writer Andrea Warner, Buffy Sainte-Marie: An Authorized Biography will weave a powerful, intimate look at the life of a beloved artist and everything that she has accomplished in her 76 years (and counting).</description>

  <description>In a futuristic world ravaged by global warming, people have lost the ability to dream, and the dreamlessness has led to widespread madness. The only people still able to dream are North America's Indigenous people, and it is their marrow that holds the cure for the rest of the world. But getting the marrow, and dreams, means death for the unwilling donors. Driven to flight, a fifteen-year-old and his companions struggle for survival, attempt to reunite with loved ones and take refuge from the "recruiters" who seek them out to bring them to the marrow-stealing "factories."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Shinrin = Forest Yoku = Bathing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shinrin-Yoku or forest bathing is the practice of spending time in the forest for better health, happiness and a sense of calm. A pillar of Japanese culture for decades, Shinrin-Yoku is a way to reconnect with nature, from walking mindfully in the woods, to a break in your local park, to walking barefoot on your lawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forest Medicine expert, Dr Qing Li's research has proven that spending time around trees (even filling your home with house plants and vaporising essential tree oils) can reduce blood pressure, lower stress, boost energy, boost immune system and even help you to lose weight. Along with his years of ground-breaking research, anecdotes on the life-changing power of trees, Dr Li provides here the practical ways for you to try Shinrin-Yoku for yourself.</description>

  <description>A taut, philosophical mind-bender from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;I’m Thinking of Ending Things.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;We don’t get visitors. Not out here. We never have.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Iain Reid’s second haunting, philosophical puzzle of a novel, set in the near-future, Junior and Henrietta live a comfortable, solitary life on their farm, far from the city lights, but in close quarters with each other. One day, a stranger from the city arrives with alarming news: Junior has been randomly selected to travel far away from the farm...very far away. The most unusual part? Arrangements have already been made so that when he leaves, Henrietta won't have a chance to miss him, because she won't be left alone—not even for a moment. Henrietta will have company. Familiar company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in Reid’s sharp and evocative style, &lt;i&gt;Foe&lt;/i&gt; examines the nature of domestic relationships, self-determination, and what it means to be (or not to be) a person. An eerily entrancing page-turner, it churns with unease and suspense from the first words to its shocking finale.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A short, irresistible, and bittersweet coming-of-age story in the vein of "Stranger Things" and "Stand by Me" about a group of misfit kids who spend an unforgettable summer investigating local ghost stories and urban legends.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in 1980s Niagara Falls--a seedy but magical, slightly haunted place--Jake Baker spends most of his time with his uncle Calvin, a kind but eccentric enthusiast of occult artifacts and conspiracy theories. The summer Jake turns twelve, he befriends a pair of siblings new to town, and so Calvin decides to initiate them all into the "Saturday Night Ghost Club." But as the summer goes on, what begins as a seemingly lighthearted project may ultimately uncover more than any of its members had imagined. With the alternating warmth and sadness of the best coming-of-age stories, &lt;i&gt;The Saturday Night Ghost Club&lt;/i&gt; examines the haunting mutability of memory and storytelling, as well as the experiences that form the people we become.</description>

There were some nice creepy legends included and the whole story came together neatly. Since I've read his horror, I expected it to get sc...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Emotional and painful but also layered with humour, &lt;i&gt;I'm Afraid of Men&lt;/i&gt; will widen your lens on gender and challenge you to do better. This challenge is a necessary one—one we must all take up. It is a gift to dive into Vivek's heart and mind."&lt;br /&gt; —Rupi Kaur, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Sun and Her Flowers &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Milk and Honey&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A trans artist explores how masculinity was imposed on her as a boy and continues to haunt her as a girl--and how we might reimagine gender for the twenty-first century&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivek Shraya has reason to be afraid. Throughout her life she's endured acts of cruelty and aggression for being too feminine as a boy and not feminine enough as a girl. In order to survive childhood, she had to learn to convincingly perform masculinity. As an adult, she makes daily compromises to steel herself against everything from verbal attacks to heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with raw honesty, Shraya delivers an important record of the cumulative damage caused by misogyny, homophobia, and transphobia, releasing trauma from a body that has always refused to assimilate. &lt;i&gt;I'm Afraid of Men&lt;/i&gt; is a journey from camouflage to a riot of colour and a blueprint for how we might cherish all that makes us different and conquer all that makes us afraid.</description>

  <description>When Henry Robinson's first daughter, Starr, is born with Williams Syndrome, he swears to devote his life to making her happy. More than twenty years later, we find Henry working at Frankie's Funhouse, where he repairs the animatronic band that Starr loves, wrestling with her attempts at living outside the family home. His wife, Kathy, wishes he would allow Starr more independence, hoping that Henry will turn his attention a little more to their own relationship and to their other daughter, who is pregnant. As tensions mount Henry's young co-worker, Darren, reveals he needs to get to Chicago Comic Con to win back his ex-girlfriend, so Henry packs Starr (and her pet turtles) and Darren (still dressed as Frankie the mascot) into the van for a road trip no one was prepared for.</description>

  <description>One evening, eight Mennonite women climb into a hay loft to conduct a secret meeting. For the past two years, each of these women, and more than a hundred other girls in their colony, has been repeatedly violated in the night by demons coming to punish them for their sins. Now that the women have learned they were in fact drugged and attacked by a group of men from their own community, they are determined to protect themselves and their daughters from future harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the men of the colony are off in the city, attempting to raise enough money to bail out the rapists and bring them home, these women—all illiterate, without any knowledge of the world outside their community and unable even to speak the language of the country they live in—have very little time to make a choice: Should they stay in the only world they’ve ever known or should they dare to escape?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on real events and told through the “minutes” of the women’s all-female symposium, Toews’s masterful novel uses wry, politically engaged humor to relate this tale of women claiming their own power to decide.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Heart Berries&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful, poetic memoir of a woman's coming of age on the Seabird Island Indian Reservation in the Pacific Northwest. Having survived a profoundly dysfunctional upbringing only to find herself hospitalized and facing a dual diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder and bipolar II disorder; Terese Marie Mailhot is given a notebook and begins to write her way out of trauma. The triumphant result is &lt;i&gt;Heart Berries&lt;/i&gt;, a memorial for Mailhot's mother, a social worker and activist who had a thing for prisoners; a story of reconciliation with her father―an abusive drunk and a brilliant artist―who was murdered under mysterious circumstances; and an elegy on how difficult it is to love someone while dragging the long shadows of shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mailhot trusts the reader to understand that memory isn't exact, but melded to imagination, pain, and what we can bring ourselves to accept. Her unique and at times unsettling voice graphically illustrates her mental state. As she writes, she discovers her own true voice, seizes control of her story, and, in so doing, reestablishes her connection to her family, to her people, and to her place in the world.</description>

  <description>In&lt;i&gt; Her Body and Other Parties&lt;/i&gt;, Carmen Maria Machado blithely demolishes the arbitrary borders between psychological realism and science fiction, comedy and horror, fantasy and fabulism. While her work has earned her comparisons to Karen Russell and Kelly Link, she has a voice that is all her own. In this electric and provocative debut, Machado bends genre to shape startling narratives that map the realities of women's lives and the violence visited upon their bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wife refuses her husband's entreaties to remove the green ribbon from around her neck. A woman recounts her sexual encounters as a plague slowly consumes humanity. A salesclerk in a mall makes a horrifying discovery within the seams of the store's prom dresses. One woman's surgery-induced weight loss results in an unwanted houseguest. And in the bravura novella Especially Heinous, Machado reimagines every episode of &lt;i&gt;Law &amp;amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&lt;/i&gt;, a show we naively assumed had shown it all, generating a phantasmagoric police procedural full of doppelgangers, ghosts, and girls with bells for eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earthy and otherworldly, antic and sexy, queer and caustic, comic and deadly serious, &lt;i&gt;Her Body and Other Parties&lt;/i&gt; swings from horrific violence to the most exquisite sentiment. In their explosive originality, these stories enlarge the possibilities of contemporary fiction.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For devotees of Bird by Bird and The Artist's Way, a memoir-driven guide to healing through the craft of writing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Francesca Lia Block is the bestselling author of more than twenty-five books, including the award-winning Weetzie Bat series. Her writing has been called "transcendent" by &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, and her books have been included in "best of" lists compiled by &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; magazine and NPR. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In this long-anticipated guide to the craft of writing, Block offers an intimate glimpse of an artist at work and a detailed guide to help readers channel their own experiences and creative energy. Sharing visceral insights and powerful exercises, she gently guides us down the write-to-heal path, revealing at each turn the intrinsic value of channeling our experiences onto the page. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Named for the painting by Frida Kahlo, who famously transformed her own personal suffering into art, &lt;i&gt;The Thorn Necklace&lt;/i&gt; offers lessons on life, love, and the creative process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In the tradition of &lt;em&gt;Brain on Fire &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Darkness Visible, &lt;/em&gt;an honest, beautifully rendered memoir of chronic illness, misdiagnosis, addiction, and the myth of full recovery that details author Porochista Khakpour's struggles with late-stage Lyme disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as writer Porochista Khakpour can remember, she has been sick. For most of that time, she didn't know why. All of her trips to the ER and her daily anguish, pain, and lethargy only ever resulted in one question: How could any one person be this sick? Several drug addictions, three major hospitalizations, and over $100,000 later, she finally had a diagnosis: late-stage Lyme disease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sick&lt;/em&gt; is Khakpour's arduous, emotional journey—as a woman, a writer, and a lifelong sufferer of undiagnosed health problems—through the chronic illness that perpetually left her a victim of anxiety, living a life stymied by an unknown condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divided by settings, Khakpour guides the reader through her illness by way of the locations that changed her course—New York, LA, New Mexico, and Germany—as she meditates on both the physical and psychological impacts of uncertainty, and the eventual challenge of accepting the diagnosis she had searched for over the course of her adult life. With candor and grace, she examines her subsequent struggles with mental illness, her addiction to the benzodiazepines prescribed by her psychiatrists, and her ever-deteriorating physical health. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A story about survival, pain, and transformation, &lt;em&gt;Sick&lt;/em&gt; is a candid, illuminating narrative of hope and uncertainty, boldly examining the deep impact of illness on one woman's life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;By the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Empathy Exams&lt;/i&gt;, an exploration of addiction, and the stories we tell about it, that reinvents the traditional recovery memoir.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its deeply personal and seamless blend of memoir, cultural history, literary criticism, and journalistic reportage, &lt;i&gt;The Recovering&lt;/i&gt; turns our understanding of the traditional addiction narrative on its head, demonstrating that the story of recovery can be every bit as electrifying as the train wreck itself. Leslie Jamison deftly excavates the stories we tell about addiction--both her own and others'--and examines what we want these stories to do, and what happens when they fail us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the while, she offers a fascinating look at the larger history of the recovery movement, and at the literary and artistic geniuses whose lives and works were shaped by alcoholism and substance dependence, including John Berryman, Jean Rhys, Raymond Carver, Billie Holiday, David Foster Wallace, and Denis Johnson, as well as brilliant figures lost to obscurity but newly illuminated here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the power of her striking language and the sharpness of her piercing observations, Jamison has been compared to such iconic writers as Joan Didion and Susan Sontag. Yet her utterly singular voice also offers something new. With enormous empathy and wisdom, Jamison has given us nothing less than the story of addiction and recovery in America writ large, a definitive and revelatory account that will resonate for years to come.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;The Queen of the Night&lt;/i&gt;, an essay collection exploring his education as a man, writer, and activist—and how we form our identities in life and in art.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a novelist, Alexander Chee has been described as “masterful” by Roxane Gay, “incendiary” by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, and "brilliant" by the &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;. With &lt;i&gt;How to Write an Autobiographical Novel,&lt;/i&gt; his first collection of nonfiction, he’s sure to secure his place as one of the finest essayists of his generation as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Write an Autobiographical Novel&lt;/i&gt; is the author’s manifesto on the entangling of life, literature, and politics, and how the lessons learned from a life spent reading and writing fiction have changed him. In these essays, he grows from student to teacher, reader to writer, and reckons with his identities as a son, a gay man, a Korean American, an artist, an activist, a lover, and a friend. He examines some of the most formative experiences of his life and the nation’s history, including his father’s death, the AIDS crisis, 9/11, the jobs that supported his writing—Tarot-reading, bookselling, cater-waiting for William F. Buckley—the writing of his first novel, &lt;i&gt;Edinburgh,&lt;/i&gt; and the election of Donald Trump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By turns commanding, heartbreaking, and wry, &lt;i&gt;How to Write an Autobiographical Novel&lt;/i&gt; asks questions about how we create ourselves in life and in art, and how to fight when our dearest truths are under attack.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A profoundly moving exploration of our capacity to heal one another.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellie and Eric Nyland have moved their two sons back to Eric's childhood farmhouse, hoping for a fresh start. But there’s no denying it, their family is falling apart, each one of them isolated by private sorrows, stresses, and missed signals. With every passing day, Ellie’s hopes are buried deeper in the harsh winter snows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Eric finds Hannah Finch, the girl across the road, wandering alone in the bitter cold, his rusty police instincts kick in and he soon discovers there are bad things happening in the girl’s house. With nowhere else to send her, the Nylands reluctantly agree to let Hannah stay with them until she can find a new home after the Christmas holidays. But Hannah proves to be more balm than burden, and the Nylands discover that the only thing harder than taking Hannah in may be letting her go.</description>

  <description>Covering Indigenous adventures from Wahpole Island to Northern Saskatchewan to the coast of Vancouver, &lt;i&gt;#IndianLovePoems&lt;/i&gt; is a poetry collection that delves into the humour and truths of love and lust within Indigenous communities. Sharing stories in search of The One, or even better, that One-Night-Stand, or the opening of boundaries -- can we say &lt;i&gt;medicine wheel&lt;/i&gt; -- this collection fearlessly sheds light on the sharing and honesty that comes with discussions of men, women, sex, and relationships, using humour to chat about the complexities of race, culture and intent within relationships. From discovering your own John Smith to sharing sushi in bed, &lt;i&gt;#IndianLovePoems&lt;/i&gt; will make you smile, shake your head, and remember your own stories about that special someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From a leading journalist and activist comes a brave, beautifully wrought survival story of navigating childhood during the height of the AIDS and crack epidemics, searching for intimacy and love as a young gay man, and ultimately finding a calling fighting for justice and liberation in the Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ movements.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Darnell L. Moore was fourteen years old, three boys from his neighborhood tried to set him on fire as he was walking home from school. Darnell was tall and awkward and constantly bullied for being gay. That afternoon, one of the boys doused him with gasoline and tried lighting a match. It was too windy, and luckily Darnell's aunt arrived in time to grab Darnell and pull him to safety. It was not the last time he would face death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	What happens to the black boys who come of age in neglected, poor, heavily policed, and economically desperate cities that the War on Drugs and mass incarceration have created? How do they learn to live, love, and grow up? Darnell was raised in Camden, NJ, the son of two teenagers on welfare struggling to make ends meet. He explored his sexuality during the height of the AIDS epidemic, when being gay was a death sentence. He was beaten down and ignored by white and black America, by his school, and even his church, the supposed place of sanctuary. He made it out, but as he quickly learned, escaping Camden, escaping poverty, and coming out do not guarantee you freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	It wasn't until Darnell was pushed into the spotlight at a Newark rally after the murder of a young queer woman that he found his voice and his calling. He became a leading organizer with Black Lives Matter, a movement that recognized him and insisted that his life mattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	In recovering the beauty, joy, and love in his own life, &lt;i&gt;No Ashes in the Fire&lt;/i&gt; gives voice to the rich, varied experiences of all those who survive on the edges of the margins. In the process, he offers a path toward liberation.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a heartbreaking and raw book. Writer and journalist Darnell Moore grew up in a place with crack epidemics and abuse. In one scene, he is drenched with gasoline and practically set on fire. Yet he perservers to become a leading black, queer writer. This is a honest, no holds-barred and gu...]]>

  <description>Carleigh Baker likes to make light in the dark. Whether plumbing family ties, the end of a marriage, or death itself, she never lets go of the witty, the ironic, and perhaps most notably, the awkward. Despite the title, the resolution in these stories isn't always tragic, but it's often uncomfortable, unexpected, or just plain strange. Character digressions, bad decisions, and misconceptions abound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While steadfastly local in her choice of setting, Baker's deep appreciation for nature takes a lot of these stories out of Vancouver and into the wild. Salmon and bees play reoccurring roles in these tales, as do rivers. Occasionally, characters blend with their animal counterparts, adding a touch of magic realism. Nature is a place of escape and attempted convalescence for characters suffering from urban burnout. Even if things get weird along the way, as Hunter S. Thompson said, "When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Bad Endings, Baker takes troubled characters to a moment of realization or self-revelation, but the results aren't always pretty.</description>

  <description>No mother is prepared for the moment when a child comes out to her as a person whose physical gender is out-of-keeping with his emotional and psychological gender-identity. In Michelle Alfano’s intimate memoir, she recounts her experience as the mother of a transgender child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The central metaphor of The Unfinished Dollhouse tells the story: on Frankie’s fourth birthday, her parents Michelle and Rob purchased a kit to create a beautiful dollhouse. Michelle imagined building the home, buying the tiny pieces of furniture and accessories to fill it and, more importantly, the times she and her daughter would spend constructing the perfect dollhouse – a fantasy of domestic and familial happiness. Frankie expressed no interest in such typically girlish pursuits because Frankie harboured a secret – a secret about gender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the years to follow, Frankie’s parents experienced an education in parenting a child transitioning from female to male – which pronouns to use, how to disclose the information to friends, family, school and how to deal with the reactions of all – some heartening, some surprising, some disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no memoir like The Unfinished Dollhouse in the Canadian cultural landscape, a memoir by the mother of a transgender child.</description>

  <description>“The internet’s best friend.” — Flare&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the author of the popular newsletter &lt;i&gt;That’s What She Said&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nobody Cares&lt;/i&gt; is a frank, funny personal essay collection about work, failure, feminism, and the messy business of being alive in your twenties and thirties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she shares her hard-won insights from screwing up, growing up, and trying to find her own path, Anne T. Donahue’s debut book offers all the honesty, laughs, and reassurance of a late-night phone call with your best friend. Whether she’s giving a signature pep talk, railing against summer, or describing her own mental health struggles, Anne reminds us that failure is normal, saying to no to things is liberating, and that we’re all a bunch of beautiful disasters — and she wouldn’t have it any other way.</description>

  <description>In this riveting memoir, Judy Rebick, one of Canada’s best-known feminists, lays bare the public and private battles that have shaped her life. She documents two major decades in her life: the 1980s, when she became a high-profile spokesperson for the pro-choice movement during the fight to legalize abortion; and the 1990s, when she took on her biggest challenge as a public figure by becoming president of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, for the first time, she also reveals the very private battles she waged during these important decades. The result is a fascinating, heartbreaking, but ultimately empowering story.</description>

Rebick developed multiple personalities as a result of sexual abuse from her father. This was a quick and easy read. ]]>

  <description>From Vancouver-based writer Chelene Knight, &lt;i&gt;Dear Current Occupant&lt;/i&gt; is a creative non-fiction memoir about home and belonging set in the 80s and 90s of Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a variety of forms, Knight reflects on her childhood through a series of letters addressed to all of the current occupants now living in the twenty different houses she moved in and out of with her mother and brother. From blurry non-chronological memories of trying to fit in with her own family as the only mixed East Indian/Black child, to crystal clear recollections of parental drug use, Knight draws a vivid portrait of memory that still longs for a place and a home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peering through windows and doors into intimate, remembered spaces now occupied by strangers, Knight writes to them in order to deconstruct her own past. From the rubble of memory she then builds a real place in order to bring herself back home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling author of The Interestings, comes an electric novel not just about who we want to be with, but who we want to be.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To be admired by someone we admire—we all yearn for this: the private, electrifying pleasure of being singled out by someone of esteem. But sometimes it can also mean entry to a new kind of life, a bigger world.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Greer Kadetsky is a shy college freshman when she meets the woman she hopes will change her life. Faith Frank, dazzlingly persuasive and elegant at sixty-three, has been a central pillar of the women’s movement for decades, a figure who inspires others to influence the world. Upon hearing Faith speak for the first time, Greer—madly in love with her boyfriend, Cory, but still full of longing for an ambition that she can’t quite place—feels her inner world light up. And then, astonishingly, Faith invites Greer to make something out of that sense of purpose, leading Greer down the most exciting path of her life as it winds toward and away from her meant-to-be love story with Cory and the future she’d always imagined.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charming and wise, knowing and witty, Meg Wolitzer delivers a novel about power and influence, ego and loyalty, womanhood and ambition. At its heart,&lt;i&gt; The Female Persuasion&lt;/i&gt; is about the flame we all believe is flickering inside of us, waiting to be seen and fanned by the right person at the right time. It’s a story about the people who guide and the people who follow (and how those roles evolve over time), and the desire within all of us to be pulled into the light.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the tradition of Ta-Nehisi Coates's &lt;i&gt;Between the World&lt;/i&gt; and Me and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's &lt;i&gt;Dear Ijeawele, or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions&lt;/i&gt;, acclaimed novelist David Chariandy's latest is an intimate and profoundly beautiful meditation on the politics of race today.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a moment of quietly ignored bigotry prompted his three-year-old daughter to ask "what happened?" David Chariandy began wondering how to discuss with his children the politics of race. A decade later, in a newly heated era of both struggle and divisions, he writes a letter to his now thirteen-year-old daughter. David is the son of Black and South Asian migrants from Trinidad, and he draws upon his personal and ancestral past, including the legacies of slavery, indenture, and immigration, as well as the experiences of growing up a visible minority within the land of one's birth. In sharing with his daughter his own story, he hopes to help cultivate within her a sense of identity and responsibility that balances the painful truths of the past and present with hopeful possibilities for the future.</description>

  <description>"You're gonna need a rock and a whole lotta medicine" is a mantra that Jonny Appleseed, a young Two-Spirit/Indigiqueer, repeats to himself in this vivid and utterly compelling novel. Off the reserve and trying to find ways to live and love in the big city, Jonny becomes a cybersex worker who fetishizes himself in order to make a living. Self-ordained as an NDN glitter princess, Jonny has one week before he must return to the "rez," and his former life, to attend the funeral of his stepfather. The next seven days are like a fevered dream: stories of love, trauma, sex, kinship, ambition, and the heartbreaking recollection of his beloved kokum (grandmother). Jonny's world is a series of breakages, appendages, and linkages--and as he goes through the motions of preparing to return home, he learns how to put together the pieces of his life. &lt;i&gt;Jonny Appleseed&lt;/i&gt; is a unique, shattering vision of Indigenous life, full of grit, glitter, and dreams.</description>

  <description>Scarborough is a low-income, culturally diverse neighborhood east of Toronto, the fourth largest city in North America; like many inner city communities, it suffers under the weight of poverty, drugs, crime, and urban blight. &lt;i&gt;Scarborough&lt;/i&gt; the novel employs a multitude of voices to tell the story of a tight-knit neighborhood under fire: among them, Victor, a black artist harassed by the police; Winsum, a West Indian restaurant owner struggling to keep it together; and Hina, a Muslim school worker who witnesses first-hand the impact of poverty on education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there are the three kids who work to rise above a system that consistently fails them: Bing, a gay Filipino boy who lives under the shadow of his father's mental illness; Sylvie, Bing's best friend, a Native girl whose family struggles to find a permanent home to live in; and Laura, whose history of neglect by her mother is destined to repeat itself with her father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scarborough&lt;/i&gt; offers a raw yet empathetic glimpse into a troubled community that locates its dignity in unexpected places: a neighborhood that refuses to be undone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Catherine Hernandez&lt;/b&gt; is a queer theatre practitioner and writer who has lived in Scarborough off and on for most of her life. Her plays &lt;i&gt;Singkil&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kilt Pins&lt;/i&gt; were published by Playwrights Canada Press, and her children's book &lt;i&gt;M is for Mustache: A Pride ABC Book&lt;/i&gt; was published by Flamingo Rampant. She is the Artistic Director of Sulong Theatre for women of color.</description>

  <description>For Penny Lee high school was a total nonevent. Her friends were okay, her grades were fine, and while she somehow managed to land a boyfriend, he doesn’t actually know anything about her. When Penny heads to college in Austin, Texas, to learn how to become a writer, it’s seventy-nine miles and a zillion light years away from everything she can’t wait to leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam’s stuck. Literally, figuratively, emotionally, financially. He works at a café and sleeps there too, on a mattress on the floor of an empty storage room upstairs. He knows that this is the god-awful chapter of his life that will serve as inspiration for when he’s a famous movie director but right this second the seventeen bucks in his checking account and his dying laptop are really testing him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sam and Penny cross paths it’s less meet-cute and more a collision of unbearable awkwardness. Still, they swap numbers and stay in touch—via text—and soon become digitally inseparable, sharing their deepest anxieties and secret dreams without the humiliating weirdness of having to &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; each other.</description>

      <![CDATA[Emergency contact is a nice YA romance that includes anxiety, weirdness, romantic feelings and one main character who is Korean. The author had a way with language and some of it was quite funny. I enjoyed this as a light summer read. ]]>

  <description>In these provocative, powerful essays acclaimed writer/journalist Jeff Chang (&lt;i&gt;Can’t Stop Won’t Stop&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Who We Be&lt;/i&gt;) takes an incisive and wide-ranging look at the recent tragedies and widespread protests that have shaken the country. Through deep reporting with key activists and thinkers, passionately personal writing, and distinguished cultural criticism, &lt;i&gt;We Gon’ Be Alright&lt;/i&gt; links #BlackLivesMatter to #OscarsSoWhite, Ferguson to Washington D.C., the Great Migration to resurgent nativism. Chang explores the rise and fall of the idea of “diversity,” the roots of student protest, changing ideas about Asian Americanness, and the impact of a century of racial separation in housing. He argues that resegregation is the unexamined condition of our time, the undoing of which is key to moving the nation forward to racial justice and cultural equity.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;WINNER, Lambda Literary Award; Firecracker Award for Fiction; $60,000 Amazon Canada First Novel Award&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this extraordinary debut novel by the author of the Lambda Literary Award-winning story collection &lt;i&gt;A Safe Girl to Love&lt;/i&gt;, Wendy Reimer is a thirty-year-old trans woman who comes across evidence that her late grandfather--a devout Mennonite farmer--might have been transgender himself. At first she dismisses this revelation, having other problems at hand, but as she and her friends struggle to cope with the challenges of their increasingly volatile lives--from alcoholism, to sex work, to suicide--Wendy is drawn to the lost pieces of her grandfather's life, becoming determined to unravel the mystery of his truth. Alternately warm-hearted and dark-spirited, desperate and mirthful, &lt;i&gt;Little Fish&lt;/i&gt; explores the winter of discontent in the life of one transgender woman as her past and future become irrevocably entwined.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A fascinating investigation of a beloved comic strip&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The internet is home to impassioned debates on just about everything, but there’s one thing that’s universally beloved: Bill Watterson’s comic strip Calvin and Hobbes. Until its retirement in 1995 after a ten-year run, the strip won numerous awards and drew tens of millions of readers from all around the world. The story of a boy and his best friend — a stuffed tiger — was a pitch-perfect distillation of the joys and horrors of childhood, and a celebration of imagination in its purest form. In &lt;i&gt;Let’s Go Exploring&lt;/i&gt;, Michael Hingston mines the strip and traces the story of Calvin’s reclusive creator to demonstrate how imagination — its possibilities, its opportunities, and ultimately its limitations — helped make Calvin and Hobbes North America’s last great comic strip.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Life is never as perfect as it seems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tensions that have lurked beneath the surface of a shiny new subdivision rise up, in new fiction from the author of the Toronto Book Award—shortlisted &lt;em&gt;The Wondrous Woo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suburbs of the 1970s promised to be heaven on earth—new houses, new status, happiness guaranteed. But in a Scarborough subdivision populated by newcomers from all over the world, a series of sudden catastrophic events reveals that not everyone’s dreams come true. Moving from house to house, Carrianne Leung explores the inner lives behind the tidy front gardens and picture-perfect windows, always returning to June, an irrepressible adolescent Chinese-Canadian coming of age in this shifting world. Through June and her neighbours, Leung depicts the fine line where childhood meets the realities of adult life, and examines, with insight and sharp prose, how difficult it is to be true to ourselves at any age.</description>

  <description>From leading psychologist Dr. Kristin Neff comes a step-by-step guide explaining how to be more self-compassionate and achieve your dreams in life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The relentless pursuit of high self-esteem has become a virtual religion—and a tyrannical one at that. Our ultracompetitive culture tells us we need to be constantly &lt;em&gt;above average&lt;/em&gt; to feel good about ourselves, but there is always someone more attractive, successful, or intelligent than we are. And even when we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; manage to grab hold of high self-esteem for a brief moment, we can't seem to keep it. Our sense of self-worth goes up and down like a ping-pong ball, rising and falling in lockstep with our latest success or failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, there is an alternative to self-esteem that many experts believe is a better and more effective path to happiness: self-compassion. The research of Dr. Kristin Neff and other leading psychologists indicates that people who are compassionate toward their failings and imperfections experience greater well-being than those who repeatedly judge themselves. The feelings of security and self-worth provided by self-compassion are also highly stable, kicking in precisely when self-esteem falls down. This book powerfully demonstrates why it's so important to be self-compassionate and give yourself the same caring support you'd give to a good friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This groundbreaking work will show you how to let go of debilitating self-criticism and finally learn to be kind to yourself. Using solid empirical research, personal stories, practical exercises, and humor, Dr. Neff—the world's foremost expert on self-compassion—explains how to heal destructive emotional patterns so that you can be healthier, happier, and more effective. Engaging, highly readable, and eminently accessible, this book has the power to change your life.</description>

  <description>In her second collection of poetry, Passage, Gwen Benaway examines what it means to experience violence and speaks to the burden of survival. Traveling to Northern Ontario and across the Great Lakes, Passage is a poetic voyage through divorce, family violence, legacy of colonization, and the affirmation of a new sexuality and gender. Previously published as a man, Passage is the poet's first collection written as a transwoman. Striking and raw in sparse lines, the collection showcases a vital Two Spirited identity that transects borders of race, gender, and experience. In Passage, the poet seeks to reconcile herself to the land, the history of her ancestors, and her separation from her partner and family by invoking the beauty and power of her ancestral waterways. Building on the legacy of other ground-breaking Indigenous poets like Gregory Scofield and Queer poets like Tim Dlugos, Benaway's work is deeply personal and devastating in sharp, clear lines. Passage is a book burning with a beautiful intensity and reveals Benaway as one of the most powerful emerging poets writing in Indigenous poetics today.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The closer she gets to the truth, the faster it slips away.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heike Lerner’s life looks perfect from the outside: she’s settled into an easy routine of caring for her young son, Daniel, and spends her days wandering the woods near their summer house, while her nights are filled with clinking glasses and charming conversation. It all helps to keep her mind at ease—or at least that’s what her husband, Eric, tells her. But lately, Heike’s noticed there are some things out of place: a mysterious cabin set back in the trees and a strange little girl who surfaces alone at the pond one day, then disappears—while at home Eric is becoming increasingly more controlling. Something sinister that Heike cannot quite put her finger on is lingering just beneath the surface of this idyllic life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s possible Heike’s worries are all in her head, but when the unthinkable happens—Daniel vanishes while she and Eric are at a party one night—she can no longer deny that something is very wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to find her son, Heike will try anything, but Eric insists on a calm that feels so cold she wonders if she can trust him at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could Eric be involved in Daniel’s disappearance? Or has some darker thing taken him? The closer Heike gets to the truth, the faster it slips away. But she will not rest until she finds her son. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A sharply funny and wise debut novel about female friendship, the face we show the world online and letting your own light shine, from the Scotiabank Giller Prize–shortlisted author of&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This Cake Is for the Party&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lilian Quick has looked up to her cousin Florence her whole life. Florence is everything Lilian is not—brave, confident, quick to find adventure and American. The women have been out of touch for years due to a family rift, but Lilian, childless, single and self-employed as a pet portraitist, has been watching Florence for years. Florence is now Internet-famous as Eleven Novak, the face of a compelling new feminine lifestyle empowerment brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Eleven comes to town as part of her sales tour, she offers Lilian a place at the Temple, her Manhattan office. Despite twenty years of silence, Eleven welcomes her long-lost cousin with open arms, and the two women begin a new relationship. Lilian quickly enrols in the Ascendency, Eleven’s signature program: an expensive three-month training seminar on empowered leadership, spiritual awakening, and sales and marketing. Eleven is going to help her cousin rise up to be her highest self: confident, affluent and self-actualized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lilian’s sensitive, artistic nature is stretched by the work she does in the Ascendency, and pushed even further by her cousin’s careful life coaching. In just three months, Lilian’s life changes drastically and becomes everything she’s dreamed of. But is it everything she wants? And can she trust everything Eleven says? </description>

  <description>Weaving together the narratives of female farmers from across three continents, &lt;i&gt;Women Who Dig&lt;/i&gt; offers a critical look at how women are responding to and, increasingly, rising up against, the injustices of the global food system. Beautifully written with spectacular photos, it examines gender roles, access to land, domestic violence, maternal health, political and economic marginalization, and a rapidly changing climate. It also shows the power of collective action. With women from Guatemala, Nicaragua, the United States, Canada, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, India, and Cuba included, it explores the ways women are responding to, as both individuals and in groups, the barriers they face in providing the world a healthy diet.</description>

  <description>Meet the Figgs. June, the family's matriarch, looks forward to a quiet retirement — if only she can get her three adult children to finally, finally, move out of the house. But her dreams are shattered when her son Derek unexpectedly becomes a single father. Now there's a newborn baby at home, and Derek's older siblings are showing no sign of going anywhere either. In the midst of the chaos, June's husband, Randy, has a shocking revelation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With family life flying fast and furious around her, June finds herself thinking about her parents — adoptive and biological. Where did she come from? Will her new grandson be traumatized without his mother? And why in the world are all the kids still at home, anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Figgs combines the quirkiness of Miriam Toews, the startling humour and fierce energy of Heather O'Neill, the heart of Little Miss Sunshine and the unruly family dynamics of Jonathan Tropper's This Is Where I Leave You into one hilarious, immensely fun novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this breakout book, Ijeoma Oluo explores the complex reality of today's racial landscape--from white privilege and police brutality to systemic discrimination and the Black Lives Matter movement--offering straightforward clarity that readers need to contribute to the dismantling of the racial divide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;So You Want to Talk About Race,&lt;/i&gt; Editor at Large of The Establishment Ijeoma Oluo offers a contemporary, accessible take on the racial landscape in America, addressing head-on such issues as privilege, police brutality, intersectionality, micro-aggressions, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the "N" word. Perfectly positioned to bridge the gap between people of color and white Americans struggling with race complexities, Oluo answers the questions readers don't dare ask, and explains the concepts that continue to elude everyday Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Oluo is an exceptional writer with a rare ability to be straightforward, funny, and effective in her coverage of sensitive, hyper-charged issues in America. Her messages are passionate but finely tuned, and crystalize ideas that would otherwise be vague by empowering them with aha-moment clarity. Her writing brings to mind voices like Ta-Nehisi Coates and Roxane Gay, and Jessica Valenti in &lt;i&gt;Full Frontal Feminism,&lt;/i&gt; and a young Gloria Naylor, particularly in Naylor's seminal essay "The Meaning of a Word."</description>

  <description>Jean Vale Horemarsh is an ordinary, small-town woman with the usual challenges of middle age. She's content, mostly, with the life she's built: a semi-successful career as a ceramics artist, a close collection of women friends (if you ignore the terrible falling out she had with Cheryl all those years ago), a comfortable marriage with a kind if otherwise unextraordinary man. And then Jean sees her mother go through the final devastating months of cancer, and realizes that her fondest wish is to protect her dearest friends from the indignities of aging and illness. That's when she decides to kill them... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eagerly awaited new novel from Trevor Cole combines the humour and sharp observations of contemporary life that he is known for with an irresistibly twisted premise, for fans of the quirkily macabre &lt;i&gt;Six Feet Under&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dexter&lt;/i&gt;, and readers of Paul Quarrington, Miriam Toews, Jonathan Franzen, and, of course, Trevor Cole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his first two, GG-shortlisted novels, Trevor Cole proved himself a master of drawing us into the shadowy side of human nature with sharp observation and warm wit.</description>

  <description>Why are there so few women in politics? Why is public space, whether it’s the street or social media, still so inhospitable to women? What does Carrie Fisher have to do with Mary Wollstonecraft? And why is a wedding ceremony Satan’s playground?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are some of the questions that bestselling author and acclaimed journalist Elizabeth Renzetti examines in her new collection of essays. Drawing upon Renzetti’s decades of reporting on feminist issues, &lt;em&gt;Shrewed&lt;/em&gt; is a book about feminism’s crossroads. From Hillary Clinton’s failed campaign to the quest for equal pay, from the lessons we can learn from old ladies to the future of feminism in a turbulent world, Renzetti takes a pointed, witty look at how far we’ve come — and how far we have to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Nellie McClung and Erma Bombeck had an IVF baby, this book would be the result. If they’d lived at the same time. And in the same country. And if IVF had been invented. Well, you get the point.</description>
