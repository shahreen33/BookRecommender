  <description>&lt;b&gt;Should some secrets stay buried?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as Cassie Hunt can remember her Aunt Aggie has spoken about the forgotten world that exists just below their feet, in the tunnels and catacombs of the Sand House. The story is what inspired Cassie to become an archaeologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Aggie has a secret that she’s buried as deep as the tunnels and when excavation work begins on the site, Cassie is the only one who can help her keep it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the assistance of her old university friend, Noah Flanagan, she puts into action a plan to honour Aggie’s wishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems the deeper Noah and Cassie dig, the more shocking the secrets uncovered – and danger is never far away, both above and below the ground …</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  The feel-good read of 2019, perfect for fans of Lucy Diamond and Karen Swan.  &lt;p&gt;Bestselling Brianna Middleton has won the hearts of millions of readers with her sweeping - and steamy - love stories. But the girl behind the typewriter is struggling... Not only does she have writer's block, but she's a world-famous romance author with zero romance in her own life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the opportunity to spend the summer teaching at a writer's retreat in an idyllic villa on the shores of Lake Garda - owned by superstar author Arran Jamieson - could this be just the thing to fire up Brie's writing - and romantic - mojo? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brie's sun-drenched Italian summer could be the beginning of this writer's very own happy-ever-after... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Escape the January blues with this sun-drenched, heart-warming story from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Snowflakes Over Holly Cove&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What readers are saying about Lucy Coleman...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I adored this book. A wonderful escapist read ... For me, it's a 5 star read!' Katherine, Katherine's Book Universe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I adored this beautifully written tale. The score is a well deserved and easy 5* out of 5*' Ginger Book Geek. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'This book gives you all the feels. It'll make you want to move to France and start a new life ... Lucy Coleman has a way of writing where it feels like you're actually there standing beside Anna and you mentally really feel involved in the story' Stacey, The Cosiest Corner. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She’s taking her life back, one step at a time…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grace&lt;/b&gt; thought she had it all. Living in the beautiful village of Little Ollington, along with head teacher husband &lt;b&gt;Mark&lt;/b&gt; and gorgeous son, &lt;b&gt;Archie&lt;/b&gt;, she devoted herself to being the perfect mum and the perfect wife, her little family giving her everything she ever wanted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until that fateful day when she walked in on Mark kissing his secretary - and her perfect life fell apart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now she's a single mum to Archie, trying to find her way in life and keep things together for his sake. Saturday nights consist of a Chinese takeaway eaten in front of the TV clad in greying pyjamas, and she can’t remember the last time she had a kiss from anyone aside from her dog, &lt;b&gt;Becks&lt;/b&gt;… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grace’s life needs a shake up – fast. So when gorgeous gardener &lt;b&gt;Vinnie&lt;/b&gt; turns up on her doorstep, his twinkling eyes suggesting that he might be interested in more than just her conifers, she might just have found the answer to her prayers. But as Grace falls deeper for Vinnie, ten-year-old Archie fears that his mum finding love means she’ll never reconcile with the dad he loves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So when ex-husband Mark begs her for another chance, telling her he’s changed from the man that broke her heart, Grace finds herself with an impossible dilemma. Should she take back Mark and reunite the family that Archie loves? Or risk it all for a new chance of happiness? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A funny, feel good romance about finding your own path and changing your life for the better – readers of Cathy Bramley, Jill Mansell and Josie Silver will love this uplifting read. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>An utterly charming novel with a sprinkle of magic When Maisie Meadows finds herself single and jobless on New Year’s Day, she resolves that this will be the year she focuses on bringing her scattered family back together. Romance is all very well, but it’s the people you grew up with that matter the most. But a new job working at an auction house puts her in the path of Theo, a gorgeous but unattainable man who she can’t help but be distracted by. As their bond begins to grow, Maisie finds herself struggling to fulfil the promise she made to herself – but the universe has other ideas, and it’s not long before the Meadows family are thrown back together in the most unlikely of circumstances… Can dealing with other people’s treasures help Maisie to let go of the past, and teach her who she ought to treasure the most?</description>

  <description>Over a thousand sentence starts, three per day, with writing tips at the end of each week to motivate and inspire, providing kick-starts to avoid the dreaded ‘writer’s block’. Useful for any writer at any level, whether they have 10 minutes or 10 hours, to start a new project. Also an ideal tool for writing groups.&lt;br /&gt;With a combination of six first-person, six second-person, six third-person and three non-specific point of view starts per week, there are plenty to choose from. Beginning at ‘Day 1’ this book has been designed to be started at any time of the year, and regardless of whether the sentences are used in order or not. With a choice of three per day a writer can select one, two or all and see where it leads them.</description>

They’ve never found my body…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s six in the morning during the hottest summer on record when Elizabeth O’Loughlin, out walking her dog, comes across Clare, a victim of a horrific knife attack, clinging onto life at the side of the road.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Clare dies minutes later, but not before whispering her haunting last words to Elizabeth.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;When it becomes clear that Clare’s killer has more than one murder on his mind, Elizabeth has to take drastic action or face losing everything.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But what if she can’t stop a killer determined never to be forgotten?</description>

  <description>When successful jewellery designer Isla Ashton unexpectedly inherits her eccentric Aunt Kate’s Caribbean island, she is obligated to return to the place she associates with heartache and regret. To where she grew up and fell in love with her childhood friend, Leo Fernandez. Fully intent on selling the island and finally putting the past behind her, Isla is soon compelled to put together the pieces of what really happened on a fateful night ten-years before. She begins to believe that in going to prison, Leo hadn’t only been shielding her from the same fate. She also starts to suspect that her late Aunt hadn’t been entirely honest in sending her away under the guise of recriminations. Who had they both been protecting and why?</description>

  <description>A lie told for the best of reasons; the truth told for the worst...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can you uphold a lie when you know it might destroy your family?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 1356, seven years since the Black Death ravaged Meonbridge, turning society upside down. Margaret, Lady de Bohun, is horrified when her husband lies about their grandson Dickon’s entitlement to inherit Meonbridge. She knows that Richard lied for the very best of reasons – to safeguard his family and its future – but lying is a sin. Yet she has no option but to maintain her husband’s falsehood... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margaret’s companion, Matilda Fletcher, decides that the truth about young Dickon’s birth really must be told, if only to Thorkell Boune, the man she’s set her heart on winning. But Matilda’s “honesty” serves only her own interests, and she’s oblivious to the potential for disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Thorkell won’t scruple to pursue exactly what he wants, by whatever means are necessary, no matter who or what gets in his way…</description>

Initially not a huge fan of historical fiction, this series is one that has pleasantly changed my mind and now the genre is right up there as one of my favourites. I've loved how the characters have...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Your darkest moment is your most vulnerable…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen Berry is about to jump off a bridge until a suicide prevention counsellor stops him. A week later, Stephen is dead. Found at the bottom of a cliff, DI Luc Callanach and DCI Ava Turner are drafted in to investigate whether he jumped or whether he was pushed…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they dig deeper, more would-be suicides roll in: a woman found dead in a bath; a man violently electrocuted. But these are carefully curated deaths – nothing like the impulsive suicide attempts they’ve been made out to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little do Callanach and Turner know how close their perpetrator is as, across Edinburgh, a violent and psychopathic killer gains more confidence with every life he takes…</description>

  <description>Fashion designer Thérèse D’Alesandro has recently moved into Westhead Manor with daughter Felicia and stepson Marco. Joining forces with neighbour Ella Benedict, she is about to open a bridal boutique at Ella’s exclusive wedding venue Lawns at Little Court. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Managing his father’s European restaurant chain, Marco has both the looks and charm to guarantee him any woman. Any woman, that is, except the one he wants: Ella’s niece Charlotte. Marco knows he should walk away as not only is she the most exasperating female he has ever encountered she’s currently in a relationship with rock star Christian Rosetti. But the chemistry between them is undeniable and sensing trouble brewing between Charlotte and the egotistical singer he is prepared to wait. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charlotte’s cousin Lucy has discovered Christian’s guilty secrets – ones he has been keeping safely hidden from everyone. Determined to cause mischief and at the same time settle her own score with the arrogant star, she sets in motion a chain of events which eventually brings Marco and Charlotte together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thérèse’s husband Gianlucca has invited the granddaughter of an old friend to stay as a house guest while he undergoes heart surgery. Rossana Caravello is due to inherit the one of Italy’s premier vineyards on her twenty first birthday in September. Aware this would make an excellent addition to her husband’s international business portfolio, Thérèse plots to push the young heiress and her stepson together. Rossana is already besotted with Marco, but if the plan is to have any chance of success first she needs to get rid of Charlotte… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wicked Game was previously published under the title The Other Side of Morning. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description> Linn B. Halton also writes as Lucy Coleman, the top ten bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Snowflakes Over Holly Cove&lt;/em&gt;! &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;More than just a holiday romance?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her daughter, her job and divorcing her untrustworthy ex are Leah’s main priorities. She isn’t really bothered that her life might be missing a few things. But after winning a prestigious travel blogger award, she’s inundated with offers to review glamorous holiday destinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lying around drinking exotic cocktails and being paid for it … what could be better? Perhaps a romantic trip to idyllic Greece to find the one man who might make Leah risk her heart again…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Meet Lucy, aged 25, and Brenda, aged 79. Neighbours, and unlikely friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Baker is not your usual 25-year-old. She is more at home reading and knitting in her cluttered little flat than going out partying and socialising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;79-year-old Brenda is full of wise and wonderful advice, but when she’s diagnosed with dementia her life begins to change. Before her memories slip away for ever, Brenda is desperate to fulfil one last wish – to see Lucy happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gifting Lucy the locket that helped Brenda find her own true love, she hopes to push her reticent neighbour in the right direction. But is Lucy Baker ready for the opportunities and heartbreaks of the real world? It’s about time she put her knitting needles aside and found out…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hopes and Dreams of Lucy Baker will be the most charming, heart-warming and feel-good novel you will read this year, perfect for fans of Ruth Hogan and Gail Honeyman.</description>

  <description>Living back at home and spending most of her time behind a checkout till, it's fair to say things aren't going quite as Zoe had planned. But she's determined to live every day to the full, and she's spreading her mission of happiness, one inspirational quote at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since his dad died, Tristan has been struggling with a sadness that threatens to overtake everything. He can't face seeing his friends, can't stop fighting with his brother, and as much as he pretends to be better, the truth is he can't even remember what 'normal' feels like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One person can change everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When these two meet, Zoe becomes determined to bring the missing colour back into Tristan's life. But the harder she tries to change the way Tristan sees the world, the more she realises it's something she can't fix - and in trying to put him back together, a part of her is beginning to break . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A novel to break your heart and put it back together again - Every Colour of You is the debut novel from Amelia Mandeville, with heart-wrenchingly relatable characters, big emotions and an unforgettable story.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the romantic tradition of &lt;i&gt;The Notebook&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nights in Rodanthe&lt;/i&gt;, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Nicholas Sparks returns with a story about a chance encounter that becomes a touchstone for two vastly different individuals -- transcending decades, continents, and the bittersweet workings of fate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope Anderson is at a crossroads. At thirty-six, she's been dating her boyfriend, an orthopedic surgeon, for six years. With no wedding plans in sight, and her father recently diagnosed with ALS, she decides to use a week at her family's cottage in Sunset Beach, North Carolina, to ready the house for sale and mull over some difficult decisions about her future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tru Walls has never visited North Carolina but is summoned to Sunset Beach by a letter from a man claiming to be his father. A safari guide, born and raised in Zimbabwe, Tru hopes to unravel some of the mysteries surrounding his mother's early life and recapture memories lost with her death. When the two strangers cross paths, their connection is as electric as it is unfathomable . . . but in the immersive days that follow, their feelings for each other will give way to choices that pit family duty against personal happiness in devastating ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Illuminating life's heartbreaking regrets and enduring hope, &lt;i&gt;Every Breath&lt;/i&gt; explores the many facets of love that lay claim to our deepest loyalties -- and asks the question, &lt;i&gt;How long can a dream survive?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; The perfect Christmas romance for fans of Karen Swan.  &lt;p&gt;As the snowflakes start to fall, the village of Holly Cove welcomes a new tenant to the beautiful old cottage on the beach... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For lifestyle magazine journaist Tia Armstrong, relationships, as well as Christmas, have lost all their magic. Yet Tia is up against a Christmas deadline for her latest article 'Love is, actually, all around'... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Tia heads to Holly Cove where the restorative sea air, and rugged stranger Nic, slowly but surely start mending her broken heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tia didn't expect a white Christmas, and she certainly never dared dream that all her Chiristmas wishes might just come true... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set in Caswell Bay on the stunningly rugged Gower Coast, the cottage nestles amid the limestone cliffs and the woodlands; the emotions run as turbulently as the wind-swept sea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As cosy as a marshmallow-topped cup of cocoa, fall in love with a heart-warming festive story from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The French Adventure&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;What readers are saying about Lucy Coleman... &lt;/b&gt;

The score is a well deserved and easy 5* out of 5*' Ginger Book Geek. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'This book gives you all the feels. It'll make you want to move to France and start a new life ... Lucy Coleman has a way of writing where it feels like you're actually there standing beside Anna and you mentally really feel involved in the story' Stacey, The Cosiest Corner. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Toronto business consultant, Serenity Layne, knew she could only depend on herself. Married to her career, she has no time for other pursuits and life's intangibles. Widowed for three years, Roger Scott is a single parent to his ten-year-old son, Adam. On a day out with their dog, Roger's cell phone rings incessantly. Adam has played matchmaker and put his father's profile on a number of online dating sites. The week before Christmas, Serenity is heading up a series of meetings after a six-month study of the Canadian retail chain, jonathans. After an unpleasant encounter with one of the store managers, she escapes from the boardroom, only to get knocked down by their pet. Guilty over the accident, Roger invites Serenity out for a drink to apologize. Over the course of the week, and spending time together, feelings long dormant for Roger are re-awakened. At the same time, emotions foreign to Serenity fill her with contentment and happiness. Will the couple get their happily ever after?</description>

Just when I think I've found a new favourite book of hers in one genre, I then find myself completely hooked on another book in a different genre! Her writing is that good!<br />...]]>

  <description>1665 and The Great Plague has London in its grip. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the summer heat rises, red crosses mark the doors, and wealthy citizens flee. Only the poor remain to face the march of death ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ambitious and attractive Bess Bagwell is determined her carpenter husband, Will, should make a name for himself. So she schemes to meet Samuel Pepys, diarist, friend of the King, and an important manin the Navy shipyards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Pepys has his own motive for cultivating Bess, and it is certainly not to benefit her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With pestilence rife in the city, all trade ceases. Will is forced to invest in his unscrupulous cousin Jack's dubious 'cure' for the pestilence. But this only horrifies Bess and leaves them deeper in debt. Now they are desperate for money, and the dread disease is moving ever closer. Pepys's help seems to be the only answer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as with all bargains, there's a price to pay. A price that will cost more than Bess has to give.</description>

  <description>What price justice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London 1678.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Titus Oates, an unknown preacher, creates panic with wild stories of a Catholic uprising against Charles II. The murder of a prominent Protestant magistrate appears to confirm that the Popish Plot is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Nathaniel Thompson, writer and Licenser of the Presses, instinctively doubts Oates’s revelations. Even his young wife, Anne, is not so sure. And neither know that their friend William Smith has personal history with Titus Oates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Nathaniel takes a public stand, questioning the plot and Oates’s integrity, the consequences threaten them all.</description>

  <description>Miriam has one year to uncover Heachley Hall's unimaginable past and a secret that only women can discover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The life of a freelance illustrator will never rake in the millions so when twenty-eight year old Miriam discovers she’s the sole surviving heir to her great-aunt’s fortune, she can’t believe her luck. She dreams of selling her poky city flat and buying a studio.&lt;br /&gt;But great fortune comes with an unbreakable contract. To earn her inheritance, Miriam must live a year and a day in the decaying Heachley Hall.&lt;br /&gt;The fond memories of visiting the once grand Victorian mansion are all she has left of her parents and the million pound inheritance is enough of a temptation to encourage her to live there alone.&lt;br /&gt;After all, a year’s not that long. So with the help of a local handyman, she begins to transform the house.&lt;br /&gt;But the mystery remains. Why would loving Aunt Felicity do this to her?&lt;br /&gt;Alone in the hall with her old life miles away, Miriam is desperate to discover the truth behind Felicity’s terms. Miriam believes the answer is hiding in her aunt’s last possession: a lost box. But delving into Felicity and Heachley’s long past is going to turn Miriam’s view of the world upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does she dare keep searching, and if she does, what if she finds something she wasn’t seeking?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has something tragic happened at Heachley Hall?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How can mere women resist the misogyny of men?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The devastation wrought two years ago in Meonbridge by the Black Death changed the balance of society: women saw their chance to build a business, to learn a trade, to play a greater part. But many men hold fast to the teachings of the Church and fear the havoc the so-called “daughters of Eve” might wreak if they’re allowed to usurp men’s roles and gain control over their own lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Meonbridge, a resentful peasant rages against Eleanor Titherige’s efforts to build up her flock of sheep… Susanna Miller’s husband, grown melancholy and ill-tempered, succumbs to idle gossip that his wife’s a scold… Agnes Sawyer’s yearning to be a craftsman is met with scorn. And the village priest, fearful of what he considers women’s “unnatural” ambitions, is determined to keep them firmly in their place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all the men in Meonbridge resist the women’s desire for change – indeed, they want change for themselves. Yet it takes only one or two misogynists to unleash the hounds of hostility and hatred…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;i&gt;I didn’t so much feel as if I were reading about mediaeval England as actually experiencing it first hand.&lt;/i&gt;” @Lindahill50Hill&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you enjoy immersive historical fiction with a strong authentic feel, you’ll love A Woman’s Lot, the second Meonbridge Chronicle, set in the mid-14th century, a time of change and challenge, especially for women.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Outwardly a grieving young Victorian widow, Charlotte Richmond is concealing some scandalous secrets when she arrives at Finchbourne Manor to start a new life with her husband's family. The wealthy Richmonds must never discover that her husband's recent death in the Indian Mutiny came as a great relief. Nor must they hear about the rumors circulating in the army regarding his scandalous behavior. His death has also been the subject of speculation and Charlotte must take care not to spill any secrets. Above all she must make certain that nobody in her new life hears of her own adventurous upbringing in Australia. When the past catches up with Charlotte, she begins to fear for her own life.</description>

  <description>Have you ever tried to conjure up the perfect man? It’s not as easy as it might seem, even if you are a powerful and intelligent witch.&lt;br /&gt;Petulia and Miss Level find out that there is more to finding&lt;br /&gt;Mr Right than just a flick of the wand, and poof…there he is! Their latest attempt is gorgeous – as long as you don’t mind the horns and the singing, which of course they do. But when they try to fix him they run into some serious problems. To make things even more complicated, a mysterious and handsome stranger appears. But there is something not quite right about him either…&lt;br /&gt;Will Petulia and Miss Level be able to fix everything and can they use their witchcraft to overcome misery?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;The Fifth Letter&lt;/i&gt; comes a controversial and darkly comic story about the frustrations of being a childless woman in the modern baby-obsessed world... .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy's world has been tipped sideways: the husband who never wanted children has betrayed her with her broody best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least Annalise is on her side. Her new friend is determined to celebrate their freedom from kids, so together they create a Facebook group to meet up with like-minded women, and perhaps vent just an &lt;i&gt;little&lt;/i&gt; about smug mummies' privileges at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, their colleague Frankie would love a night out, away from her darlings - she's not had one this decade and she's heartily sick of being judged by women at the office as well as stay-at-home mums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Poppy and Annalise's group takes on a life of its own and frustrated members start confronting mums like Frankie in the real world. Cafés become battlegrounds, playgrounds become war zones and offices have never been so divided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A rivalry that was once harmless fun is spiraling out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because one of their members is a wolf in sheep's clothing. And she has an agenda of her own . . .</description>

  <description>Esmie Elstone is thrown into panic when she hears of Captain Rockford's return. But she is determined that the days of him interfering with her life are over. Destroying her chances of a happy future on his last visit, had resulted in her being foisted on her Aunt for a third pointless season in London. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To alleviate the boredom of society life, Esmie helps run a discreet betting enterprise under the guise of a sewing club. But there are some things you just shouldn't wager on, and Esmie's integrity is soon put to a dangerous test. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Richard Rockford had known Esmie almost all her life. As neighbours, her father, Admiral Elstone, had depended on Richard to keep an eye on his daughter when he was away at sea – a responsibility he had always taken on willingly. But her cruel and thoughtless actions, from the day he had left four years earlier, had shaken him. Now, he was back, and he wanted answers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when Esmie tumbles into a treacherous conspiracy, can he really turn his back on her?</description>

  <description>A beautiful, emotive and spell-binding story of two women who find friendship and second chances when they least expect it. Perfect for the fans of Patricia Scanlan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda King and Tess Cuffe are strangers who share the same Georgian house, but their lives couldn't be more different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda seems to have it all, absolute perfection. She projects all the accouterments of a lady who lunches. Sadly, the reality is a soulless home, an unfaithful husband and a very lonely heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By comparison, in the basement flat, unwanted tenant Tess Cuffe has spent a lifetime hiding and shutting her heart to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a bossy doctor, a handsome gardener, a pushy teenager and an abandoned cat to show these two women that sometimes letting go is the first step to moving forward and new friendships can come from the most unlikely situations.</description>

  <description>A contemporary romance set in Wiltshire, London and Paris. Its Love Thirty theme refers not only to rising tennis star Nick but also journalist Georgia's career and personal ambitions. There's an unexpected twist when she finds herself unexpectedly famous and not only because she's a tennis WAG. Friends and family all have their own input and there's plenty of fun but also poignant moments.</description>

  <description>Obsessive-compulsive school mum, Skye, is a lonely elite spy, who is running from her past whilst trying to protect the future of her child. She tries hard to fit in with the other parents at her son’s new school, but the only person who accepts her unconventional way of life is new mother, Thea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thea is feeling harassed by her sister and bored with her life, but she suspects that there is something strange about the new school mum, Skye. Thea has secrets of her own and, although the two become unlikely friends, she hesitates to tell Skye about the father of her own child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zack’s new business is growing faster than he could have dreamed but, suddenly, he finds himself the owner of a crumbling estate on the edge of a pretty village, and a single parent to a very demanding child. Could he make a go of things and give his daughter the life she deserved?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When three lives collide, it appears that only one of them is who they seem to be, and you never know who the person next to you in the school playground really is.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;A task a day to cure a broken heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esmé Peel is approaching thirty with some trepidation, but hope in her heart. If she can just get her long-term boyfriend Andrew to propose, she will have ticked everything off her 'things to do by the time you're 30' list. She didn't reckon on finding another woman's earring in her bed however, and soon she finds herself single, homeless and in need of a new plan. Her best friend Carys gives her the perfect present – The Single Girl’s Calendar – which has a different cure for heartbreak every day: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Day 1: Look and feel fabulous with a new hair style. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Day 2: Step out of your comfort zone and try something new. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Day 3: Reconnect with friends and enjoy! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite thinking it's a bit of a gimmick, Esmé hasn't got any better ideas, so she puts the plan into action. By the end of week one she has four new male housemates, and despite a broken heart she is determined to show Andrew she can do more than survive, she can thrive. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Can he learn to navigate time before it’s too late to save the one person who can help him unravel the secrets of the disc?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether he likes it or not, there’s no more hiding away. And no looking back. Especially when Alpha is watching. A wolf who sees all there is to see … &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For readers aged 10 plus, &lt;i&gt;The Mirror of Pharos&lt;/i&gt; is a contemporary fantasy with a hint of sci-fi.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;They know who did it. Perhaps not consciously. Perhaps not yet. But they know. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When eight-year-old Daisy Mason vanishes from her family’s Oxford home during a costume party, Detective Inspector Adam Fawley knows that nine times out of ten, the offender is someone close to home. And Daisy’s family is certainly strange—her mother is obsessed with keeping up appearances, while her father is cold and defensive under questioning. And then there’s Daisy’s little brother, so withdrawn and uncommunicative . . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DI Fawley works against the clock to find any trace of the little girl, but it’s as if she disappeared into thin air—no one saw anything; no one knows anything. But everyone has an opinion, and everyone, it seems, has a secret to conceal.</description>

  <description>Mac Orman is on a mission. When he discovers his recently deceased father had been searching for his birth mother, Mac aims to finish the job by finding the grandmother he never knew. His quest leads him to Templeton Cove—and a firecracker of a woman who instantly jump-starts his tortured heart. &lt;br /&gt;For Mac, Kate Harrington is the most tempting kind of distraction. But their sizzling connection comes with a side of suspicion for Kate, who doesn’t trust this brooding stranger in her town. Mac arrived with no plans to stay, but as he falls for Kate, he wonders how he could ever possibly leave.</description>

  <description>A sea captain passes through the forgotten port of Wych Ferry, and whiles away an hour relating his traveller’s tales to young Rosamund Euden. He tells her that the stars are different, if you sail far enough, that the horizon isn’t quite real, not when you get there; he speaks of sea serpents and whales, and mysterious islands. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To an impressionable girl who has never left her home, the whales and strange stars of his stories come to symbolise the great outside world she longs to see. The sea captain moves on, unaware of the dramatic events he has set in action as Rosamund’s search for adventure leads her into a world of dangerous secrets in the marshlands of eighteenth century Kent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torn between loyalty to her uncles, and her desire to discover what lies beyond the marshes, Rosamund seeks help from an unexpected source. But who can she really trust</description>

  <description>When Henrietta finds herself excluded from seeing her grandchildren, she decides to write to them to explain their Afro-Caribbean origins in slavery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She tells the story of her childhood in Bermuda, of marrying a British soldier, bringing up six children in Gibraltar and moving to England on her husband’s retirement from the army. Writing the letters reveals unexpected and challenging truths about herself and her family, which give her food for reflection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do her grandchildren ever receive the letters? And if so, how true a picture of their grandmother and family do they paint?</description>

  <description>Is there life after the circus has left town?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Circus performer Justine Belmont works with big cats, but when the circus is disbanded and the old lion is sold to a private menagerie at a stately home in Norfolk, she is asked to spend a few weeks settling him into his new environment. When she arrives at the estate, however, she receives a mixed welcome.&lt;br /&gt;The groundsman Tom Yates resents her presence as he doesn’t feel he needs her help with the lion. He revises his opinion when he sees the bond between her and the big cat, and she and Tom grow closer, although Justine remains torn about her feelings for him. The lady of the house, Priscilla - who is married to the reclusive owner, Lord Brooks’s, grandson - is not so easily convinced. She perceives Justine as a threat for the male attention and her plans for the manor. And her two young daughters are a little too curious about the lion for their own good.&lt;br /&gt;When unsettling events occur, Justine begins to wonder if there is more to Priscilla’s animosity than meets the eye. Can Justine keep herself and everyone else safe until it’s time for her to leave again and start a new life elsewhere?</description>

  <description>When Freya Gibson inherits an old, run-down property she has no idea she is the last in a long line of redoubtable women, including the Tudor nun who built the house. Unknown to Freya, these women, over centuries, fought with whatever weapons came to hand – deception, endurance, even murder – to preserve their home and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freya falls in love with the house, but her inheritance includes an enigmatic letter telling her to ‘restore the balance’ of the Lady’s Well. Besides this, the house seems to be haunted by the scent of flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, the Lady’s Well was a place of healing, and Freya soon feels safe and at home, but she has demons of her own to conquer before she can accept the happiness that beckons.</description>

  <description>When archaeologists Beth Tarrant and Josh Good excavate a ruined chapel at Barbury Abbey they don’t expect to uncover a modern mystery too…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding the tomb of a medieval abbot would mean a lot to Beth – fifty years ago, her grandfather was forced to abandon his own search for the tomb, but nobody knows why. Can Beth finish what he started?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one incident after another threatens to sabotage the dig, Detective Inspector Jeff Lincoln is called in, and when a bungled burglary at the museum turns into murder he finds a shocking link to a case he’s already investigating.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Thornwaite, a quaint village tucked up in England’s beautiful but rainy Lake District… where homecomings happen and surprises are in store for the four Holley sisters…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Holley, the third of four sisters, has always felt a little bit forgotten. A family tragedy when she was a child had her retreating deep into shyness, and social anxiety kept her on the fringes of the cozy chaos of the busy vicarage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several years away from home, Anna returns for Christmas... and an important announcement from her father. As much as she once loved the village, coming back is hard and puts Anna's social capabilities to the test. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoiding her sisters’ bossy questions, she heads out to the local pub one night, and meets a handsome stranger nursing a pint. Somehow, unburdened by expectations, Simon seems like the perfect person to spill all her secrets to—including a hopeless, long-held crush on her sister’s boyfriend. Confident she’ll never see him again, Anna returns home… only to discover the next day that Simon is actually her father’s new curate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna is beyond mortified, but Simon won’t let her retreat into her usual shyness—and for once Anna is forced to confront the past, and all the fears and feelings she’d tried so long to hide. But with his own heartache that needs to heal, can Simon help Anna to make this the most magical Christmas either of them have known?</description>

  <description>Two distant relatives, drawn together in companionship are forced to confront their pasts and learn that some people are good at keeping secrets and some secrets are never meant to be kept. The beautiful old Bath House in Ballytokeep has lain empty and abandoned for decades. For devoted pensioners Archie and Iris, it holds too many conflicting memories of their adolescent dalliances and tragic consequences – sometimes it's better to leave the past where it belongs. For highflying, top London divorce lawyer Kate Hunt, it's a fresh start – maybe even her future. On a winter visit to see her estranged Aunt Iris she falls in love with the Bath House. Inspired, she moves to Ballytokeep leaving her past heartache 600 miles away – but can you ever escape your past or your destiny?</description>

  <description>A compelling blend of mystery and family drama with a gothic twist, by the Top Ten bestselling author of A Time for Silence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Lawrence can sense the shadow of violent death, past and present. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her struggle to cope with her unwelcome gift, she has frozen people out of her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her marriage is on the rocks, her career is in chaos and she urgently needs to get a grip. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So she decides to start again, by joining her effervescent cousin Sylvia and partner Michael in their mission to restore and revitalise Llys y Garn, an old mansion in the wilds of North Pembrokeshire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is certainly a new start, as she takes on Sylvia’s grandiose schemes, but it brings Kate to a place that is thick with the shadows of past deaths. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The house and grounds are full of mysteries that only she can sense, but she is determined to face them down – so determined that she fails to notice that ancient energies are not the only shadows threatening the seemingly idyllic world of Llys y Garn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The happy equilibrium is disrupted by the arrival of Sylvia’s sadistic and manipulative son, Christian - but just how dangerous is he? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, once more, Kate senses that a violent death has occurred… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in the majestic and magical Welsh countryside, Shadows is a haunting exploration of the dark side of people and landscape.</description>

  <description>Wipe off your flip flops, it’s going to be a bumpy ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sacha Collins, cafe owner and sundae-maker extraordinaire, meets Italian archaeologist, Alessandro Salvatore in Rome, she's grateful to him for being her tour guide. Now he’s turned up in the seaside village where she lives, known locally as The Boardwalk by the Sea and is setting up a gelateria in direct competition to her retro Summer Sundaes Café.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's only been running her café for two years since taking over from her father and until now the only other shops on the boardwalk, a wool shop, an antique shop and a second-hand book shop have helped rather than hindered her custom. How will her creative sundaes made from fresh Jersey ice cream compete with his delicious Italian gelatos?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sacha is worried. Is there enough custom for both businesses to thrive? Who is behind the strange changes being made at night on the boardwalk? And when the oldest resident on the boardwalk is threatened with eviction can Sacha and Alessandro come together and find a way of helping her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a peaceful little boardwalk overlooking one of the quieter beaches on the island, there's an awful lot going on and some of it is going to lead to big changes.</description>

      <![CDATA[ It takes a very special author to be able to create a place that makes the reader feel they are truly there or to dream of living somewhere like the setting in a book. Georgina Troy is one such author. What an amazing place the Boardwalk is. And, as if that wasn't enough, the book begins in Rome...]]>

  <description>Do nice guys stand a chance? &lt;br /&gt;Lizzie Donavue went from being the sister of his best friend to the girl Nick Templeton most wants to kiss. On her birthday, he finally summons up the courage to make his move. But it looks like Nick’s missed his chance when he discovers that Lizzie has been offered a modelling contract, which will take her away to the glamorous fashion scenes of New York and Los Angeles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick is forced to watch from the sidelines as the gawky teenager he knew is transformed into Elizabeth Donavue: top model and ultimate English rose pin-up, forever caught in a whirlwind of celebrity parties with the next up-and-coming Hollywood bad boy by her side. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Lizzie’s star-studded life comes crashing down around her, and a guy like Nick could be just what she needs. Will she take a chance on him? Or is he just too damn nice?</description>

  <description>The ghosts of a century's worth of secrets and betrayals are coming home to Pengarrow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evie has lost her eldest son, Jesse, to gang violence. Leaving the house he grew up in is pulling apart the few strings left holding her heart together. Only the desire to be there for her younger boy, Finn, impels Evie to West Wales and the ancient house her husband is sure will heal their wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days later, Andrew is gone - rushing back to his 'important' job in government, abandoning his grieving wife and son. Finn finds solace in the horse his father buys by way of apology. As does his evasive and fearful new friend, Nye, the one who reminds him and Evie of Jesse... Evie loses herself in a dusty 19th century journal and glasses of homemade wine left by the mysterious housekeeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Evie's grasp on reality slides, Andrew's parents ride to the rescue. It is clear that this is a house they know. They seem to think they own it, and begin making changes nobody wants, least of all Alys and her son, Nye, the terrified youth who looks so like Jesse.</description>

  <description>Some places stay with you forever…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ellie Maddison is sent on a business trip to Southern Italy, she's reminded why she loves her job – set amongst rolling vineyards and rich olive groves, the beautiful Villa Rosso is the perfect escape from her life back home. But what Ellie isn't prepared for is the instant connection she feels to the estate's director Max Johnson, or the secrets they share that are as intertwined as the rambling vines that cover Villa Rosso. It's not long before Ellie finds herself entangled in the history of the place, trying to understand the undeniable effect Max is having on her. As their relationship grows, what will Ellie discover about this idyllic villa and those who have walked through its doors? What started as a simple work trip will change Ellie's life forever.</description>

The Secrets of Villa Rosso particularly excited me because I'm also writing a book that's partially set in Italy too. And, I hope that I have described the beautiful count...]]>

  <description>Thomas McNulty, aged barely seventeen and having fled the Great Famine in Ireland, signs up for the U.S. Army in the 1850s. With his brother in arms, John Cole, Thomas goes on to fight in the Indian Wars—against the Sioux and the Yurok—and, ultimately, the Civil War. Orphans of terrible hardships themselves, the men find these days to be vivid and alive, despite the horrors they see and are complicit in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Moving from the plains of Wyoming to Tennessee, Sebastian Barry’s latest work is a masterpiece of atmosphere and language. An intensely poignant story of two men and the makeshift family they create with a young Sioux girl, Winona, &lt;i&gt;Days Without End&lt;/i&gt; is a fresh and haunting portrait of the most fateful years in American history and is a novel never to be forgotten.</description>

  <description>The lady’s here. The lady with the big bag. She’s knocking on the front door. She’s knocking and knocking. I’m not opening the door. I’m not letting her in. I’m behind the black chair. I’m waiting for her to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomos lives with his mother. He longs to return to another place, the place he thinks of as home, and the people who lived there, but he’s not allowed to see them again. He is five years old and at school, which he loves. Miss teaches him about all sorts of things, and she listens to him. Sometimes he’s hungry and Miss gives him her extra sandwiches. She gives him a warm coat from Lost Property, too. There are things Tomos cannot talk about – except to Cwtchy – and then, just before Easter, the things come to a head. There are bad men outside who want to come in, and Mammy has said not to answer the door. From behind the big chair, Tomos waits, trying to make himself small and quiet. He doesn’t think it’s Santa Claus this time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When the men break in, Tomos’s world is turned on its head and nothing will be the same again.</description>

But when they all go ashore in beautiful Central America, a series of minor mishaps lead the families further from the ship's safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minute the children are there, and the next they're gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is a heart-racing story told from the perspectives of the adults and the children, as the distraught parents - now turning on one another and blaming themselves - try to recover their children and their shattered lives.</description>

  <description>1950s England. Five-year-old Gracie Scott lives with her Mam and next door to her best friend Billy. An only child, she has never known her Da. When her Uncle Joe moves in, his physical abuse of Gracie’s mother starts almost immediately. But when his attentions wander to Gracie, an even more sinister pattern of behaviour begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Gracie grows older, she finds solace and liberation in books, poetry and her enduring friendship with Billy. Together they escape into the poetic fairy-tale worlds of their imaginations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But will fairy tales be enough to save Gracie from Uncle Joe’s psychopathic behaviour – and how far will it go?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seas of Snow is a haunting, psychological domestic drama that probes the nature and the origins of evil.</description>

  <description>Twenty-one year old Beth is in prison. The thing she did is so bad she doesn't deserve to ever feel good again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her counsellor, Erika, won't give up on her. She asks Beth to make a list of all the good things in her life. So Beth starts to write down her story, from sharing silences with Foster Dad No. 1, to flirting in the Odeon on Orange Wednesdays, to the very first time she sniffed her baby's head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at the end of her story, Beth must confront the bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the truth hiding behind her crime? And does anyone-even a 100% bad person-deserve a chance to be good?</description>

  <description>Stepping off the boat in Mombasa, eighteen-year-old Rachel Fullsmith stands on Kenyan soil for the first time in six years. She has come home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Rachel reaches the family farm at the end of the dusty Rift Valley Road, she finds so much has changed. Her beloved father has moved his new partner and her son into the family home. She hears menacing rumours of Mau Mau violence, and witnesses cruel reprisals by British soldiers. Even Michael, the handsome Kikuyu boy from her childhood, has started to look at her differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isolated and conflicted, Rachel fears for her future. But when home is no longer a place of safety and belonging, where do you go, and who do you turn to?</description>

  <description>The Man in the Needlecord Jacket follows the story of two women who are each struggling to let go of a long-term destructive partnership. Felicity is reluctant to detach from her estranged archaeologist husband and, after being banished from the family home, she sets out to test the stability of his relationship with his new love, Marianne. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Felicity meets Coll, a charismatic artist, she has high hopes of being distracted from her failed marriage. What she doesn't know is that he has a partner, Sarah, with whom he has planned a future. Sarah is deeply in love with Coll, but his controlling behaviour and associations with other women have always made her life difficult. When he becomes obsessed with Felicity, Sarah's world collapses and a series of events is set in motion that will challenge the integrity of all the characters involved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Man in the Needlecord Jacket is a thought-provoking book, written from the perspectives of Sarah and Felicity. The reader is in the privileged position of knowing what's going on for both of the women, while each of them is being kept in the dark about a very important issue. It stands very much alone, but also follows on from the Lydia series.</description>

  <description>Lauren is in a cell. She knows she shouldn’t be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lauren and Rick are left an allotment they embark on an exciting lifestyle change that they hope will bring their step-family closer together. They embrace the chance for a slice of the good life, fresh air and family times together. Lauren and Rick are a loving, sexy couple, but this is their second time around, and they have never completely left their pasts behind them. For Lauren it’s the gut wrenching affair that her first husband had before he left her. For Rick it’s the loss of his beloved children he was alienated from and forced to leave behind seven years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day a new family move into a cottage behind the allotment. That day changes everything. That day they start falling apart. And as they start to crumble, one of them is pushed to the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Other Side is a cross genre contemporary novel, guaranteed to have readers turning pages as the characters deal with their inner torment, hiding their true feelings to preserve themselves and their relationships. A thrilling family drama about life issues of love, divorce, step parenting and alienation built around a sunny allotment outside a small town just down the road from you! The story is told from the viewpoints of Lauren, and Rick who live in the English market town of Marbury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Other Side shows the love between a couple, and the deep psychology of their relationship as it is tested and falters. This is a bitter-sweet story of deep love, and loss told with warmth and psychological insight. If you love to read books with a twist at the end then this book delivers a twist at the end that you won't see coming.</description>

  <description>Gripping standalone thriller from the Sunday Times No. 1 bestselling author of the Logan McRae series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the Misfit Mob…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s where Police Scotland dumps the officers it can’t get rid of, but wants to: the outcasts, the troublemakers, the compromised. Officers like DC Callum MacGregor, lumbered with all the boring go-nowhere cases. So when an ancient mummy turns up at the Oldcastle tip, it’s his job to find out which museum it’s been stolen from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Callum uncovers links between his ancient corpse and three missing young men, and life starts to get a lot more interesting. O Division’s Major Investigation Teams already have more cases than they can cope with, so, against everyone’s better judgement, the Misfit Mob are just going to have to manage this one on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one expects them to succeed, but right now they’re the only thing standing between the killer’s victims and a slow, lingering death. The question is, can they prove everyone wrong before he strikes again?</description>

  <description>John Sagan is a forgettable man. You could pass him in the street and not realise he’s there. But then, that’s why he’s so dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A torturer for hire, Sagan has terrorised – and mutilated – countless victims. And now he’s on the move.

Bradburn is being terrorised by a lone killer who burns his victims to death. And with the victims chosen at random, no-one knows who will be next. Least of all Heck…</description>

  <description>What if you’d been accused of one of the worst crimes imaginable?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Inspector Matthew Adams is slowly picking up the pieces from a case that nearly cost him the lives of his entire family and his own sanity too. On the surface, he seems to be moving on, but he drinks to forget – and when he closes his eyes, the nightmares still come. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the past is the past – or is it? Because the evil Patrick Sullivan might be out of the picture, but there’s somebody who is just as intent on making Matthew’s life hell, and they’re doing it in the cruelest way possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Matthew finds himself accused of a horrific and violent crime, will his family stand by him? And will he even be around to help when his new enemy goes after them as well?</description>

  <description>The truth can hurt, and sometimes it leads to murder …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After becoming embroiled in a murder investigation, Nate Bastable and Ruby Fawcett have decided to opt for the quiet life. But crime has a habit of following them around.&lt;br /&gt;When her work dries up, Ruby finds herself accepting a job researching and writing about Diana Patrick-John, a colourful and enigmatic Cambridge academic. Simple enough. But then there’s the small fact that Diana was found dead in suspicious circumstances in her home – the very place where Ruby has now been invited to stay.&lt;br /&gt;As she begins to uncover Diana’s secret life, Ruby’s sleuthing instinct kicks in, leaving her open to danger and retribution. But can she rely on Nate to support her? Especially when his behaviour has become increasingly distant and strange, almost as though he had something to hide …</description>

  <description>Hettie and Alexander are back, and this was never going to be a conventional love story. No bed of roses. Proud, passionate and wilful, they are alike in so many ways. That has to be a good thing doesn’t it? Or it could be a disaster…both carry scars, and old wounds have a habit of causing new hurt.&lt;br /&gt;Physical attraction draws them together. Hearts and minds can be thorny, less easy to satisfy. One thing is certain, together or apart their lives will move on. Alexander and Hettie’s clashes of spirit will only be part of the story.&lt;br /&gt;Second chances. New beginnings. The opportunity to make things right. Or to make the same mistakes all over again. Unless fate takes the future out of your hands…</description>

  &lt;i&gt;The number of women my brother Matthew killed, so far as I can reckon it, is one hundred and six...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1645. When Alice Hopkins' husband dies in a tragic accident, she returns to the small Essex town of Manningtree, where her brother Matthew still lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But home is no longer a place of safety. Matthew has changed, and there are rumours spreading through the town: whispers of witchcraft, and of a great book, in which he is gathering women's names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;To what lengths will Matthew's obsession drive him?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And what choice will Alice make, when she finds herself at the very heart of his plan?&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How do you recover when half your neighbours are dead from history’s cruellest plague?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 1349. In Meonbridge, a Hampshire manor, the worst plague in England’s history has wiped out half its population, among them Alice atte Wode’s husband and Eleanor Titherige’s entire family. Even the household of the manor’s lord and his wife, Margaret de Bohun, have not escaped the horror.&lt;br /&gt;Now the plague has finally left Meonbridge, the community is trying to return to normal life. But it’s a struggle, with so much to do and so few left to do it. Tensions mount between the de Bohuns and their tenants, as the workers realise their scarceness means they can demand higher wages, go wherever they wish, dictate their own lives. It’s what they’ve so long waited for!&lt;br /&gt;Though his lordship takes a very different view…&lt;br /&gt;When the tensions deepen into violence and disorder, and the men – lord and villagers alike – seem unable to achieve any resolution, the women – Alice, Eleanor and Margaret – must step forward to find the way out of the conflict that is tearing Meonbridge apart.&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;i&gt;Completely intriguing, fascinating and surprisingly emotional…more please!&lt;/i&gt;” @thebookmagnet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you enjoy well-researched, immersive historical fiction, set in a turbulent and challenging time, with strong but credible female characters and a real sense of authenticity, you’ll love Fortune’s Wheel, the first of the Meonbridge Chronicles. Discover for yourself the compelling story of Meonbridge’s survival.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He’s killed your child and kidnapped your wife. What would YOU do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s evil and then there’s Patrick Sullivan. A drug dealer, pimp and murderer, there are no depths to which Patrick would not sink, and Detective Inspector Matthew Adams has found this out in the most devastating way imaginable.&lt;br /&gt;When Patrick’s brother is shot dead in a drug bust gone wrong, the bitter battle between the two men intensifies, and Matthew finds it increasingly difficult to hold the moral high ground. All he wants is to make the pimping scum suffer the way he did … the way Lily did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But being at war with such a depraved individual means that it’s not just Matthew who’s in danger. Patrick has taken a lot from Matthew, but he hasn’t taken everything – and now he wants everything.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;A gripping, heart-wrenching tale of love against the odds from the Number One &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Dinah Jefferies&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1930, Rajputana, India. Since her husband's death, 28-year-old photojournalist Eliza's only companion has been her camera. When the British Government send her to an Indian princely state to photograph the royal family, she's determined to make a name for herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Eliza arrives at the palace she meets Jay, the Prince's handsome, brooding younger brother. Brought together by their desire to improve conditions for local people, Jay and Eliza find they have more in common than they think. But their families - and society - think otherwise. Eventually they will have to make a choice between doing what's expected, and following their heart. . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>This is an updated cover edition of &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33273455-through-the-barricades" rel="nofollow"&gt;1540695662&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WINNER OF THE SCBWI SPARK AWARD 2017&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Make a difference in the world, ' are the last words Maggie Gilligan's father ever says to her. They form a legacy that she carries in her heart, years later when, at the age of fifteen, she tries to better the lives of Dublin's largely forgotten poor. 'Don't go getting distracted, now, ' is what Daniel Healy's father says to him after seeing him talking to the same Maggie Gilligan. Daniel is more than distracted. He is intrigued. Never has he met anyone as dismissive, argumentative . . . as downright infuriating. A dare from Maggie is all it takes. Daniel volunteers at a food kitchen. There, his eyes are opened to the plight of the poor. It is 1913 and Dublin's striking workers have been locked out of their jobs. Their families are going hungry. Daniel and Maggie do what they can. Soon, however, Maggie realises that the only way to make a difference is to take up arms. The story of Maggie and Daniel is one of friendship, love, war and revolution, of two people prepared to sacrifice their lives: Maggie for her country, Daniel for Maggie. Their mutual sacrifices put them on opposite sides of a revolution. Can their love survive?</description>

  <description>The next 336 hours will be tough. No, the next 336 hours will be really tough...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like an Olympian, waiting to see whether the years of hard work, sacrifice and dedication are finally going to pay off, or whether my body is about to fail me at the last hurdle and make me wonder why I ever hoped I could win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best friend is pregnant, my single friends are planning their pregnancies and, after five long years of tests and investigations, I'm coming to the end of my third - and supposedly final - IVF treatment. There are 336 hours to survive before I'll know if I get to join the motherhood club. That's 224 waking hours of pure psychological torture. 112 sleeping hours to stare at the ceiling and wonder, what the hell am I going to do with my life if it turns out I can't have kids?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the author's true life experiences, &lt;em&gt; 336 Hours&lt;/em&gt; is a humorous and poignant diary about one woman's quest to be a mother.</description>

  <description>Could you ever trust again the man who broke your heart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Fenton thought she'd got the answer to that question all neatly sewn up. Ever since she went to Saul Preston's London art gallery, a month before their wedding, and found him with his assistant - who looked as if she was in the middle of a game of strip poker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years later, she's no longer so sure. Saul's back in her life with a new proposition - to accompany him on a trip to Majorca as his interpreter. It's an offer Kate can't refuse, even though she knows she should. Successful and rich, he's just the sort of client her translation company is trying to attract - even if he is her two-timing ex!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saul's never gone in for second chances. He's never had the time, but he knows exactly what he's doing when he suggests the trip to Kate. As gorgeous and infuriatingly easy to fall for as ever, he's determined to rekindle their past. And he's only got three days to do it...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"I loved this novel! It was charming but also thought provoking. It wasn’t one of these novels with lots of action or lots of laughs but it was beautifully written and I was really engaged with the story."&lt;/i&gt; Joanne B. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"I loved this book. I did not want it to end." &lt;/i&gt; Kim H. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"What an absolutely lovely romantic read this was with such likeable characters too. I love Linn’s writing, it has a different edge to any other books I have read and I always look forward to reading her work."&lt;/i&gt; Tracey F. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When destiny calls, you need to pick up …&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the surface, Kristi Danielson has it all. She’s lifestyle coach to the rich and famous, has a bestselling book to her name and is described by her fans as “the veritable Queen of how to lead a fulfilling life”. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the harsh truth is that Kristi has never practiced what she preaches. Her home life is a mess, her relationship with artist boyfriend, Tom, not much better – and now she has to redeem herself before all is lost. &lt;br /&gt;At her wit’s end, Kristi is driven to seek out the help of Patrick Blakeslee, a tarot card reader and psychic medium, in an attempt to make sense of the mounting panic she’s feeling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Patrick’s visits have an unexpected effect on Kristi, leaving her with more questions than answers – and a life-changing decision to make.</description>

  <description>During a huge row, Gillian stands up to her abusive boyfriend. The consequences are horrendous and far-reaching.&lt;br /&gt;Terrified, she flees her home, seeking anonymity abroad while coming to terms with the outcome of her actions.&lt;br /&gt;In Portugal, Gillian meets Harry, a yachtsman, needing crew for his Atlantic Ocean-crossing. She applies for the job. Half-way into the journey, after confessing to her crime, Harry offers her refuge on an uninhabited island in the Caribbean which he says he owns.&lt;br /&gt;Confused and depressed, Gillian imagines this is the answer to her problems. She needs time to lie low and consider her options; confront the authorities or live in obscurity? Harry is offering the perfect hiding place…or is he?&lt;br /&gt;When things start going horribly wrong, she asks herself if she is alone on the island. But maybe the biggest question of all is why she gets the gut feeling Harry wants to keep her there at all costs?&lt;br /&gt;What happens when she says … no?</description>

  <description>The world we knew is gone. What world will rise in its place? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Twelve have been destroyed and the terrifying hundred-year reign of darkness that descended upon the world has ended. The survivors are stepping outside their walls, determined to build society anew—and daring to dream of a hopeful future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But far from them, in a dead metropolis, he waits: Zero. The First. Father of the Twelve. The anguish that shattered his human life haunts him, and the hatred spawned by his transformation burns bright. His fury will be quenched only when he destroys Amy—humanity’s only hope, the Girl from Nowhere who grew up to rise against him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last time light and dark will clash, and at last Amy and her friends will know their fate.</description>

  <description>He’s not a killer. He’s ordinary. It’s just that he has an addiction. &lt;br /&gt;The papers call him the Choker. Crane and Anderson call him a sadomasochist. But whatever his name is, the Major Crimes team have to find him. And fast. Because time is running out. It won’t be long before he kills again.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Daniel is my son. He has always been mine. And he always will be.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On some level deep inside, Laura Bateman knows something is wrong. That her relationship with her son is not what it should be. That it is based on lies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But bad things have happened to Laura. Things that change a person. Forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For twenty-six-year-old Daniel, the discovery that his mother is not who he thought comes close to destroying him. As his world turns upside down, he searches for sanity in the madness that has become his life. Daniel is left with nothing but questions. Why did Laura do something so terrible? Can he move past the demons of his childhood?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the biggest question of all: can he ever forgive Laura?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Revised edition: This edition of &lt;i&gt;His Kidnapper's Shoes&lt;/i&gt; includes editorial revisions.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How can she forgive him for what he didn't do? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photographer Izzy Cooper feels as frozen as her pictures. Trent Palmer might be the hottest firefighter in Templeton Cove, but she can never face him again. Not after he failed to save her brother. But when they're forced together by a calendar shoot, the sparks between them are undeniable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Izzy knows it's not fair to blame Trent for the tragedy, but opening herself up to loss again isn't something she's prepared to do, no matter how determined Trent is to show her that pain is part of life and that love--their love--can make any suffering bearable.</description>

  <description>“Parsons and tyrants friends take note. We have born your oppreshuns long enough. We will have our parish rights or else Bloodie Bones will drink your blood.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lord Oldfield encloses Barcombe Wood, depriving the people of their ancient rights to gather food and fuel, the villagers retaliate with vandalism, arson and riot. Then Lord Oldfield’s gamekeeper, Josh Castle, is murdered during a poaching raid. Dan Foster, Bow Street Runner and amateur pugilist, is sent to investigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan’s job is to infiltrate the poaching gang and bring the killers to justice. But there’s more to Castle’s death than at first sight appears. What is the secret of the gamekeeper’s past and does it have any connection with his murder? What is Lord Oldfield concealing? And did someone beside the poachers have a reason to want Josh Castle dead? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As tensions in Barcombe build to a thrilling climax, Dan will need all his wits and his fighting skills to stay alive and get to the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bloodie Bones was joint winner of the Historical Novel Society Indie Award 2016 and was a semi finalist in the M M Bennetts Award for Historical Fiction 2016.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A stark but uplifting story of bullying and redemption, for anyone who's ever been a weirdo.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost too terrified to grip the phone, Biddy Weir calls a daytime television show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subject is bullying, and Biddy has a story to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abandoned by her mother as a baby, Biddy lives in her own little world, happy to pass her time watching the birds - until Alison Fleming joins her school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Popular and beautiful, but with a dangerous, malevolent streak, Alison quickly secures the admiration of her fellow students. All except one. And Alison doesn't take kindly to people who don't fit her mould . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A story of abuse and survival, of falling down and of starting again, and of one woman's battle to learn to love herself for who she is, The Lonely Life of Biddy Weir is Lesley Allen’s startlingly honest debut novel, perfect for fans of Rowan Coleman and Julie Cohen.</description>

  <description>18+ Adult Content, Crime Noir, New Adult&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Runaway teenager Lilly Lessard has some secrets. For a start, that’s not her real name and she wants to keep her real age on the down-low too. Bumping into ex-hitman Bobby at a small town film festival is no coincidence either. She’s tracked him here. He owes her money and she’s desperate enough to come looking for it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And she’s not the only one who’s followed him here. Detective Davis is after him too. She’s been after him in Miami for years, but never quite managed to get him. Maybe this weekend she’ll get lucky. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the closer Lilly gets to Bobby and his money, the closer Davis gets to them both. One by one, their secrets are coming out. And Lilly’s about to find out, the worst secrets are the ones you keep from yourself.</description>

  <description>Aspiring actress Elizabeth Smart lands her centre stage role: her mutilated body is found dumped in North London’s red light district. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clasped in her hand is a piece of human hair belonging to an unidentified body of a woman murdered two weeks ago. PC Donal lands himself a place on the murder squad just as his unconventional brother, journalist Finton, unearths the secret double life of Elizabeth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bodies mount, each clinging to the strands of hair belonging to the previous victim. The police are convinced it’s the act of a serial killer. But how does Donal convince them it’s not? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only people he can trust are the victims he dances with in his dreams...</description>

  <description>Beauty and fame… a blessing or a curse?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loveless fashion model Nola Nichols thinks being beautiful is a curse; that is until she is cursed and her looks begin to fade just a week before the most important photo shoot of her career. In her attempts to get un-cursed, she finds herself taking part in a rather unconventional funeral, reveals one or two unrests in her own past, and falls madly in love with a doctor. Erm… that would be a witch doctor, right...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Just the right sprinkling of romance and humour.” Brook Cottage Books&lt;br /&gt;“A very clever plot. Different, fresh and enjoyable.” Jenny in Neverland&lt;br /&gt;“I couldn't help but like Nola even though at times she is a proper diva.” Comet Babe’s Books&lt;br /&gt;“I love all the quirky characters in the story and just the pure madness and fun of it all!” Books4U&lt;br /&gt;“A nice balance of humour, sweet romance, morals and a spooky side!” The Little Reader Library&lt;br /&gt;“A Five Star Read - I really enjoyed the light-hearted tone.” Love Reading Love Books</description>

  <description>Gareth Maddox has his own successful Cardiff Bay law firm, a clever and talented wife and four perfectly imperfect children. Then along comes Cassandra Taylor, managing director of a Canadian shirt company wanting to set up a major manufacturing plant in the Welsh valley Gareth hails from. It seems like the kind of work he will excel at and an ideal way to see the valley pull&lt;br /&gt;back from joblessness and despair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back at the end of the Great War, in the wake of a community splitting strike, Gareth’s Great-Great-Uncle Idris sailed off to Canada in search of his fortune and a new way of life. Behind him Idris left his twin Tommy and Maggie, Tommy’s wife, who shared her childhood and much else besides with both brothers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decades later, Maggie’s secret life is revealed – and for Gareth nothing may ever be quite as it was before Perfect Ltd came to Wales.</description>

  <description>When life in the fast lane threatens to implode …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melanie Hunt’s job working for the Delta racing team means she is constantly rubbing shoulders with Formula One superstars in glamorous locations like Monte Carlo. But she has already learned that keeping a professional distance is crucial if she doesn’t want to get hurt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Delta team driver Aiden Foster lives his life like he drives his cars – fast and hard. But, no matter how successful he is, it seems he always falls short of his championship-winning father’s legacy. If he could just stay focused, he could finally make that win. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resolve begins to slip as Melanie and Aiden find themselves drawn to each other –with nowhere to hide as racing season begins. But when a troubled young boy goes missing, everything is thrown into turmoil, including Aiden’s championship dream.</description>

  <description>Four women. One affair. Four lives entwined. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Pippa's ever wanted is marriage and kids, but at thirty-four and about to embark on IVF, her dream of having a family is far from certain. Her younger sister Georgie has the opposite problem, juggling her career, her lover, a young daughter and a husband who wants baby number two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pippa's best friend Sienna has a successful career in the film world, and despite her boyfriend pressurising her to settle down, a baby is the last thing she wants. Happily married Connie shares the trauma of fertility treatment with Pippa, but underestimates the impact being unable to conceive will have on her and her marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their lives collide in a way they could never have predicted, will any of them get to see their hopes realised?</description>

  <description>From the Top Ten Bestselling Author of A Time for Silence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they were ten everybody wanted to be Serena’s friend, to find themselves one of the inner circle. But doing so meant proving your worth, and doing that often had consequences it’s not nice to think about – not even thirty-five years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen Rothwell is randomly reminded of an incident in her childhood which just as suddenly becomes an obsession. It takes her on a journey into a land of secrets and lies; it means finding that gang of girls from Marsh Green Junior School and most importantly of all finding Serena Whinn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for Thorne Moore’s novels&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘A true page turner’– &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.gwales.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.gwales.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘The most chilling part of Thorne Moore's skill is the way that she represents evil' – Helen Tozer, sideline jelly</description>

  <description>When opposites attract, can dreams come true? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Staying in New England for a few months is just what Sienna Randall needs after all the family problems she's been dealing with at home in London. The last thing she's expecting is romance, so it's a total surprise when she ends up kissing a guy she meets on the flight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kyle Everett is Sienna's complete opposite – he’s clean-cut and over-polished, she has piercings and pink dreads. But he can’t resist making out with her. He is, after all, Northbrooke High’s number one player. Except Sienna's different from other girls. He’s definitely expecting to see her again – until they're separated by irate airline officials before he can get her number. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then fate throws them together once more, but when Sienna turns up in Kyle's home room, neither admits to having met before. The chemistry between them is still there though – should they let it have free rein or should the attraction stay in their dreams?</description>

  <description>Gabriel has returned to the island of Jersey after ten years abroad to help his aging showbiz parents revive their failing Art Deco hotel. This proves to be something of a challenge, especially as his singer father and actress mother are more concerned with staying in the limelight than keeping track of the cash-flow. Gabriel isn t going anywhere fast...Meanwhile, he s stunned to find that the hotel s new receptionist is the girl he fell in love with years earlier in Vietnam, and someone who is tied to Jersey is the last thing she needs..."</description>

  <description>The last people who expect to be meeting with a drug-addicted prostitute are a respected judge and his reclusive wife. And they certainly don't plan to kill her and bury her in their exquisite suburban garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet Andrew and Lydia Fitzsimons find themselves in this unfortunate situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Lydia does all she can to protect their innocent son Laurence and their social standing, her husband begins to falls apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Laurence is not as naïve as Lydia thinks. And his obsession with the dead girl's family may be the undoing of his own.</description>

  <description>VAULT: A large room or chamber used for storage of valuables, especially an underground one…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the unrelenting heat of the Toronto summer, a fire at a land-fill site uncovers the remains of a local prostitute. But the post-mortem reveals disturbing details – the body has been preserved and is not who or what it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DI Eleanor Raven is back on duty six months after barely surviving being kidnapped and tortured by a depraved serial killer. Work is her sanctuary but she’s carrying deep scars – mental as well as physical. Where do you go when the place you feel safest is also the place where you are most at risk?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Eleanor battles her own demons, it looks as though a killer in the city is making a gruesome human collection. And Eleanor’s fight to save the last victim of the Collector becomes a battle to save herself.</description>

  <description>Someone is dumping bodies on DI Ted Darling's patch and he's not happy. Ted's a good solid copper, in an old-fashioned way, with an excellent clear-up rate. He also happens to be gay and has his own unique way of dealing with any prejudice that brings him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this killer seems to be running effortless rings round him and every promising lead just takes him up another blind alley. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it starts to get personal ...</description>

  <description>In a Victorian era where the industrial revolution has been replaced by superstition and magic, Britain is a place where wolves roam freely and children with magic are snatched from the streets. This is home for thirteen-year-old witch, Annie and her baby sister, Georgina. When their mother dies, Annie and Georgina find themselves saved from the workhouse by the mysterious Ernesto Black. But Black’s motives are far from pure and soon Annie faces new, even more dangerous threats. What does Ernesto want from Georgina? And can Annie trust the other teenagers living with Ernesto: Polly, who has her eye fixed firmly on inheriting Ernesto’s fortune and will do anything to make sure she gets it, and the charming Isaac, who would do anything to win Polly’s affections – legal or not. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fearing for Georgina’s safety, Annie is faced with a terrible choice: she can try to guard her sister from the ever-present threat of Ernesto, or she can leave the child out in the wilds of the New Forest in the hope she’ll be found and taken in by a new family, ignorant of her powers. Annie chooses to leave Georgina’s future to chance and steals her away from Ernesto’s house in the dead of night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Annie’s troubles are far from over as her actions set in motion a chain of events that will take her and Georgina into danger she could never imagine. This danger drags country girl, Charlotte Harding into the fray and threatens every one of the teenagers, and it leads them right into the heart of the powerful organisation responsible for the assassination of Queen Victoria, an organisation that wants only one thing: Hell on Earth – quite literally…</description>

  <description>Sometimes there’s more to a house than bricks and mortar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hillcrest House is one such place. Perched on a cliff in the picturesque town of Angel Falls, there is more to this Victorian mansion than meets the eye. When referring to the house, the locals use the word haunted on a regular basis. Strange visions appear in the windows, especially the second-floor ones over the side porch. Even stranger events take place within its four walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumour has it, the original owners, Asher and Maggie Hargrave, never left their beloved home. They claim the couple and their family are responsible for driving people away. Over the years, Hillcrest House has changed hands numerous times. No one stays long. Renovations begin then stop and the house is once more abandoned. The latest in this long line of owners is Jessica Maitland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Jessica be the next one to succumb or will she unravel the mystery of the haunting of Hillcrest House?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melanie Robertson-King's latest novel serves up a delightful blend of the supernatural and spicy romance, Lynn L. Clark, author of The Home Child, and Fire Whisperer &amp;amp; Circle of Souls: Two Novellas of the Supernatural, &amp;amp; The Accusers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intrigue, dark buried secrets, hot romance and a neat twist in the tale make this riveting reading, Sheryl Browne, MA Creative Writing, Choc Lit Author&lt;br /&gt;A fun read that keeps you guessing right up to the surprise ending, Dayna Leigh Cheser, Author of Janelle's Time, Moria's Time, Adelle's Time, &amp;amp; Logan's Time</description>

  <description>Jennie Bateman has fallen in love again with Thomas, her former husband, but Tasha, his daughter, is determined to destroy their relationship. &lt;br /&gt;Jennie destroyed their first marriage two decades earlier when, in the midst of a manic episode, she abandoned Thomas, choosing, instead, a life of shameless debauchery. Now, they have rekindled their love, but Tasha, Thomas’s daughter, is determined to block any plans for a second wedding. &lt;br /&gt;After all, Tasha declares, Jennie’s medicine won’t work forever, and another manic episode surely lies in her future. When it erupts, it will ruin Thomas’s life a second time. &lt;br /&gt;Shamed by Tasha and hoping to prove she is cured, Jennie ponders tossing her medication, but. she fears Tasha is correct − she will fail the test, and the demons of her disorder will rush back in.&lt;br /&gt;In Once and Future Wife, we follow Jennie as she goes a second round with her demons as they conspire to thwart her chance for a second marriage and to steal the love and happiness that seem to be within her grasp.</description>

  <description>Have love and loyalty gone out of fashion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessie Martin believes that when it comes to love there are three types of people: the skimmers, the bottom dwellers and the ones who dive for pearls. Jessie is a pearl diver. She had thought her husband William was a pearl diver too. But when William leaves her for a much younger woman, it’s not just Jessie’s heart that is broken, her ability to trust is shattered too. All Jessie wanted was a love she could believe in. Was that so much to ask? Loyalty it seems has gone out of fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refusing to retire from the battlefield of life, Jessie resolves to put her heartache behind her. She doesn’t want to be that woman who was too scared to love again. There has to be another pearl diver out there; all she has to do is find him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When fate brings handsome flower seller Owen Phillips into her life, Jessie believes he may be the one but is her fragile trust about to be shattered all over again?</description>

  <description>Following the recent death of her father, and in need of both a job and somewhere to live, Kiya takes a housekeeping job on the spur of the moment. She soon finds herself living in a beautiful but neglected mansion, working for a strange and reclusive man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;St. John is a man scarred by the past, both physically and emotionally, and is determined to live out his life alone. They are two very different people, drawn to each other almost against their will, but can Kiya convince St. John that he is not the monster he believes himself to be?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There are rules that every player of every game must abide by, no matter how dangerous the sport.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toronto has become the backdrop to a macabre set of artistic installations: women kidnapped, tortured and horrifically displayed by a killer with a vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only someone capable of understanding the killer's creative desire will be able to stop the murders and D I Eleanor Raven is uniquely qualified. Driven by a complex personality she pursues only the facts, only the things she can see, but never casts a judgement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she also has a dark and dangerous secret - one that will threaten her very survival.</description>

  <description>Book Three in the Dancing for the Devil trilogy Cape Wrath, Scotland, November 1847.Bruce McGunn, laird of Wrath in the far North of Scotland, is as brutal and unforgiving as his land. Discharged from the army, haunted by the spectres of his fallen comrades and convinced he is going mad, he is running out of time to save his estate from the machinations of Cameron McRae, heir to the McGunn's ancestral enemies.When the clipper carrying McRae's new bride docks at Wrath harbour, McGunn decides to hold the woman to ransom and use her to get more time to repay his debts. However, far from the spoilt heiress he expected, Rose is genuine and funny - a ray of sunshine in the long winter that has become his life. She is also determined to escape.As Rose runs away to be reunited with her husband, she discovers there is a sinister side to the dazzlingly handsome aristocrat she married after a whirlwind romance. Why was Cameron so desperate to get her father's military journal? Why did he insist on keeping their wedding a secret? She is even more confused when Bruce catches up with her and she starts to feel irresistibly attracted to him. Soon she risks her marriage to help Bruce find the truth about his past and solve the mystery of the brutal murders committed on his land. Will her love be enough to heal his haunted heart?</description>

  <description>Sometimes you find home, sometimes it comes looking for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Callie knows a lot more about pain than she does about family. She’s never belonged, at least, not until she falls through a portal into her true home. The beautiful faerie city of Eirensae doesn’t come free. Callie must find her amulet and bind herself to the city, and most importantly, avoid the Fallen fae who seek her life. Seems like a small price to pay for the family she’s always wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she meets cynical and gorgeous Rowan, who reads the darkness of her past in her eyes. He becomes Callie’s part-time protector and full-time pain in the ass. He has secrets of his own for Callie to unravel. What they don’t know is that the future of Eirensae lies with them, and the once peaceful city is about to become a battleground for power.</description>

  <description>Book One in the Dancing for the Devil trilogy &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can her love heal his haunted heart? - Cape Wrath, Scotland, November 1847. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bruce McGunn is a man as brutal and unforgiving as his land. Discharged from the army, he is haunted by the spectres of his fallen comrades and convinced he is going mad. And he is running out of time to save his estate from the machinations of Cameron McRae, heir to the McGunn's ancestral enemies. When the clipper carrying McRae’s new bride is caught in a violent storm and docks at Wrath harbour, Bruce decides to revert to the old ways and hold the clipper and the woman to ransom. However, far from the spoilt heiress he expected, Rose is genuine, funny and vulnerable – a ray of sunshine in the long, harsh winter that has become his life. &lt;br /&gt;Rose is determined to escape Wrath and its proud master – the man she calls McGlum. &lt;br /&gt;Will she be reunited with Cameron McRae, the dazzlingly handsome aristocrat she married after a whirlwind romance in Algiers, or will she risk her heart and her honour to help Bruce discover the truth about his past and solve the brutal murders committed on his land? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dancing for the Devil trilogy also includes Blue Bonnets and Sword Dance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Take a chance on a new life and maybe you’ll find your happy ever after. Because true love is &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; worth the risk…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Handsome prince, beautiful house, fabulous job? Polly has none of these. All she has to her name is a string of failed relationships and she’s up to her ears in debt. She sees herself as a hopeless case and would do anything to change her luck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Simon is approaching the big 50. He’s off his game at work, his kids don’t seem to notice he exists and his wife seems to think he’s made of money. As for sex …what’s that? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So when the opportunity comes for both of them to swap their lives for a life of luxury, they jump at the chance. For Simon a life of helicopters, fast cars and hot babes beckons. For Polly, it’s all diamonds, spa days and celebrity parties. What more could they want? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trouble is, the grass isn’t always greener on the other side. Is life in the fast lane more than either of them can cope with? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A witty, heart warming read, perfect for fans of Fiona Gibson and Carole Matthews.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Praise for Carol Wyer: </description>

  <description>What if you were powerless to protect the person you cared about most?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ruby finds out that her partner has done the unforgivable, she has no option but to move out of their home. With nowhere else to go, a job house-sitting in Cambridge seems like the perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it’s soon clear the absent owner hurts everyone he gets close to, and Ruby’s faced with the fallout. As violent repercussions unfold, her instinct is to investigate: it’s a matter of self-preservation. And besides, she’s curious…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ruby’s new boss, Nate Bastable, has his eye on her and seems determined to put a stop to her sleuthing. Is he simply worried for the welfare of a member of staff, or is there something altogether more complicated – and potentially dangerous – at play?</description>

  <description>You love your family. They make you feel safe. You trust them. Or do you…?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When fifteen-year-old Billy Wilkinson goes missing in the middle of the night, his mother, Claire Wilkinson, blames herself. She's not the only one. There isn't a single member of Billy's family that doesn't feel guilty. But the Wilkinson’s are so used to keeping secrets from one another that it isn't until six months later, after an appeal for information goes horribly wrong, that the truth begins to surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claire is sure of two things – that Billy is still alive and that her friends and family had nothing to do with his disappearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mother's instinct is never wrong. Or is it?</description>

How will they fend for themselves?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the last adult died, sensible Elizabeth has been the group leader, testing for a radio signal, playing teacher and keeping an eye on Alex, the littlest, whose insulin can only last so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is ‘shopping’ to do in the houses they haven’t yet searched and wrong smells to avoid. For eight-year-old Rona each day brings fresh hope that someone will come back for them, tempered by the reality of their dwindling supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no adults to rebel against, squabbles threaten the fragile family they have formed.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;‘A terrific story, originally told. All hail the new Queen of Crime!’ HEAT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘A web of a plot that twists and turns and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat. This formidable debut is a page-turner, but don’t read it before bed if you’re easily spooked!’ SUN&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You think you know who to trust? You think you know the difference between good and evil? &lt;b&gt;You’re wrong...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body of the head teacher of an exclusive Devon school is found hanging from the rafters in the assembly hall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hours earlier he’d received a package, and only he could understand the silent message it conveyed. It meant the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Exeter suffers a rising count of gruesome deaths, troubled DS Imogen Grey and DS Adrian Miles must solve the case and make their city safe again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as they’re drawn into a network of corruption, lies and exploitation, every step brings them closer to grim secrets hidden at the heart of their community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And once they learn what’s motivating this killer, will they truly want to stop him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SMART. GRIPPING. GRUESOME.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a psychological crime thriller in a class of its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: Most definitely &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; for the faint-hearted!</description>

  <description>Sinead Moriarty's delicious tenth novel, The Secrets Sisters Keep, is the story of three sisters, three life-altering problems and one eternal truth: nobody knows you quite like a sister!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sinead's writing mixes the worldly wit of Jane Green with the down-to-earth warmth and insight of Marian Keyes and will remind people just how important their sisters - and their friends-who-are-like-sisters - are to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Devlin sisters rely on each other - but some things are just too painful to share, even when your sisters are your best friends ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mum-of-four Julie thought that if her family had more money, life would be easier. But now that they've inherited a fortune, her problems are only starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lawyer Louise is used to having life go exactly as she wants it to. So accepting that she cannot control everything in her world is beyond her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And former model Sophie can just about cope with getting older - that's until her ex-husband finds a younger model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three women think that some battles are best fought alone. Maybe they need to think again ...</description>

  <description>Kepler had never meant to die this way — viciously beaten to death by a stinking vagrant in a dark back alley. But when reaching out to the murderer for salvation in those last dying moments, a sudden switch takes place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Kepler is looking out through the eyes of the killer himself, staring down at a broken and ruined body lying in the dirt of the alley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of dying, Kepler has gained the ability to roam from one body to another, to jump into another person’s skin and see through their eyes, live their life — be it for a few minutes, a few months or a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kepler means these host bodies no harm — and even comes to cherish them intimately like lovers. But when one host, Josephine Cebula, is brutally assassinated, Kepler embarks on a mission to seek the truth — and avenge Josephine’s death.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Cumbria to the Caribbean...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Flying solo again in their middle years, can life really begin again for Jo and Hattie? Is there hope for the newly single baby boomers and can romance happen? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Continuing the Coffee Tea... series, join Jo and Hattie as they romp into their future and prove that anything is possible! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Coffee Tea The Caribbean &amp;amp; Me is a stand-alone read but also the sequel to Coffee Tea The Gypsy &amp;amp; Me which shot to #3 on Amazon and was E-Book of the week in The Sun Newspaper. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"A story about friendship and loss...is there hope for those of a certain age?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘The time to be happy is now...’ Jo remembers her late husband’s words but is struggling to face the lonely future that lies ahead. A heartbroken widow, Jo finds herself alone with ghostly memories at Kirkton House - a Cumbrian Manor that until recently, she ran as a thriving hotel. Her two sons have moved away, Jimmy to run a bar in Barbados, and Zach to London to pursue a career as a celebrity chef. Middle-age and widowhood loom frighteningly and Jo determines to sell up and start again, despite protestations from colourful friend, Hattie and erstwhile admirer Pete Parks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hattie convinces Jo to postpone any life-changing decisions by enjoying a Caribbean holiday but their holiday sets off a course of events that brings mayhem and madness to Jo and her family. Confused and anxious for her future, can life really begin again for Jo? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Coffee Tea The Caribbean &amp;amp; Me was a finalist at The Write Stuff - London Book Fair 2015. The judge’s comments included, “Caroline is a natural story-teller with a gift for humour in her writing.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Caroline's books are stand-alone stories but characters do make appearances throughout. The best order to read them is: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Coffee Tea The Gypsy &amp;amp; Me &lt;br /&gt;So, You Think You're A Celebrity...Chef? &lt;br /&gt;Coffee Tea The Caribbean &amp;amp; Me &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>They thought he belonged safely in the past. His return threatens everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marta, Carrie and Jane have been friends since they were at school. Now one is bringing up her family, another is desperately trying for children of her own, while the third is focused on her career – and each takes the support of the others as a given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when generous Marta bumps into old friend Tom at the height of the Edinburgh festival, she finds he's an actor out-of-luck. Her kind offer of temporary shelter sets in motion a tsunami of destruction. Marta’s marriage comes under threat. Timid Jane is haunted by the secret she has been hiding since she last saw Tom. And ambitious Carrie finds herself at the mercy of a man who can ruin her career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only by pulling together can the friends rid themselves of this menace. But is Tom too clever at sowing mistrust?</description>

  <description>They all said that Bangladesh would be an experience... &lt;br /&gt; For Anne Hamilton, a three-month winter programme of travel and "cultural exchange" in a country where the English language, fair hair, and a rice allergy are all extremely rare was always going to be interesting, challenging, and frustrating. What they didn't tell Anne was that it would also be sunny, funny, and the start of a love affair with this unexplored area of Southeast Asia. &lt;br /&gt; A Blonde Bengali Wife shows the lives beyond the poverty, monsoons, and diarrhoea of Bangladesh and charts a vibrant and fascinating place where one minute Anne is levelling a school playing field "fit for the national cricket team," and then cobbling together a sparkly outfit for a formal wedding the next. Along with Anne are the essential ingredients for survival: a travel-savvy Australian sidekick, a heaven-sent adopted family, and a short, dark, and handsome boy-next-door. &lt;br /&gt; During her adventures zipping among the dusty clamour of the capital Dhaka, the longest sea beach in the world at Cox's Bazaar, the verdant Sylhet tea gardens, and the voluntary health projects of distant villages, Anne amasses a lot of friends, stories...and even a husband. &lt;br /&gt; A Blonde Bengali Wife is the "unexpected travelogue" that reads like a comedy of manners to tell the other side of the story of Bangladesh. &lt;br /&gt; All money earned from A Blonde Bengali Wife goes direct to the charity, Bhola's Children, of which the author and agent are active participants. A Blonde Bengali Wife isn't about Bhola but it is a tribute to Anne's journeys into Bangladesh and all the friends she has made there. Most of all, it is the story of the country that inspired Bhola's Children.</description>

Sometimes it takes two Christmases, three birthdays and a whole lot of cake to get there …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously released as Sweet Occasions by the author.

  <description>How would you feel if, one day, you discovered everything you thought you knew about your family was a fabrication? Your mother wasn't your mother, your father was a liar and your whole upbringing was a sham. Confronted with this exact situation, Dave Fazackerley doesn't feel great. It doesn't help that he has just buried the woman he thought of as his mother. Or that his wife, his one true soulmate, recently jumped into bed with a librarian. Even his band, his only escape from reality, is going through a rough patch. How will Dave respond? Will he discover the truth about his family? Will his band ever play a gig again? More importantly, can Dave entice his wife back from the arms of the book-dork or will he take a chance on a new love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Six Lies reads in humour and brilliance akin to Nick Hornby's High Fidelity. A wonderful book. I loved every moment of reading it." Becky Walsh - BBC Radio Presenter and author.</description>

  <description>Wild Billionaires After Dark are a series of stand-alone romances that may also be enjoyed as part of the larger Love in Bloom series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indulge your inner vixen with these sexy billionaires!&lt;br /&gt;Meet the Wild Boys... Four fiercely loyal, sinfully sexy, uber alpha brothers, about to fall head over heels for their leading ladies.Meet the Bad Boys... Four fiercely loyal, sinfully sexy, uber alpha brothers, about to fall head over heels for their leading ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything's naughtier after dark...&lt;br /&gt;Four years ago at a film festival, Cici Fine met Cooper Wild, a man who turned her world upside down in the span of one deliciously perfect week. He was everything she'd ever dreamed of: sinfully sexy, intelligent, and incredibly loving. When the festival ended, they returned to their own hometowns with promises of forever. But Cooper disappeared, and Cici was left to raise the daughter he never knew about alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooper is finally thinking straight after years of being lost in grief from the tragedy that killed his father and left his mother blind. Now he's on a mission to find the woman he left behind--the only woman he's ever loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Cici Fine is no longer a naive young girl. She's a savvy businesswoman with big responsibilities, on the cusp of a life-changing move. When fate brings the two together, they'll put the old adage to the test and find out if love really can conquer all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;The Wild Boys After Dark books are long enough to burn up the sheets and short enough to leave you craving more.&lt;br /&gt;Read the whole Billionaires After Dark series:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WILD BOYS AFTER DARK (Available Now!)&lt;br /&gt;Logan&lt;br /&gt;Heath&lt;br /&gt;Jackson&lt;br /&gt;Cooper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More Billionaires After Dark books:&lt;br /&gt;BAD BOYS AFTER DARK&lt;br /&gt;Mick&lt;br /&gt;Dylan&lt;br /&gt;Carson (coming soon)&lt;br /&gt;Brett (coming soon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BILLIONAIRES AFTER DARK series are part of the LOVE IN BLOOM big family romance collection.

  <description>"If you're interested in books with super-hot alpha males, ridiculously sexy heroines and need-to-take-a-cold-shower love scenes, this is the series for you!" M. Engel, Book Mama Blog&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You asked for naughtier lovers, with the same fierce loyalty as The Bradens - Meet the Wild Boys... Written in the same loving voice, with a hint of sinful pleasure. After Dark books are loosely tied to the Love in Bloom series. This is NOT a BDSM series. *NO CLIFFHANGERS* *NO SERIALS*&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;**AFTER DARK NOVELLA**&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Everything's naughtier after dark...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Receiving a marriage proposal is supposed to make a women happy, but when Erica "Laney" Lane receives a beautiful marriage proposal from her perfect boyfriend on the eve of her annual camping trip with her best friend, Jackson Wild, the first thing she does is jump into bed with Jackson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackson's all too happy to screw the annoyance out of Laney. After all, they've always screwed the hell out of each other when they were bored or angry, lonely, or too damn drunk to see straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the marriage proposal changes everything, and their annual camping trip takes unexpected turns. Will a few nights in the wilderness set these friends with benefits free, or lead them on a path of destruction?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;Read the whole After Dark series:&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;WILD BOYS:&lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Logan&lt;br /&gt;Book 2: Heath&lt;br /&gt;Book 3: Jackson&lt;br /&gt;Book 4: Cooper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMING SOON:&lt;br /&gt;BAD BOYS:&lt;br /&gt;Dylan&lt;br /&gt;Mick&lt;br /&gt;Carson&lt;br /&gt;Brett&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NICE GIRLS:&lt;br /&gt;Phoebe&lt;br /&gt;Francine&lt;br /&gt;Nicole&lt;br /&gt;Genevieve&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy this series, you'll enjoy the Love in Bloom series, featuring the Snow Sisters, The Bradens, The Remingtons, Seaside Summers, and The Ryders&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;"You can always rely on Melissa Foster to deliver a story that's fresh, emotional and entertaining.

  <description>Christmas is just around the corner when Star begins working at Butterburn library, but not everyone is embracing the spirit of the season. &lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Arianna’s mock exams are looming and she’s feeling under pressure. With her father living abroad and her mother working three jobs, she doesn’t have much support at home. &lt;br /&gt;The bank is threatening to repossess Evan’s house, and he has no idea how he’s going to get through Christmas with two children who are used to getting everything they want. &lt;br /&gt;Patricia’s cliché of a husband, after 23 years of marriage, has announced he’s moving out of the family home, and moving in with his secretary. &lt;br /&gt;Daniel is doing the work of three people in his sales job, as well as looking after his kids and his wife. Pulled in too many different directions, he’s feeling stressed out. &lt;br /&gt;Can Star, the library’s Good Samaritan, help set them on the path to happiness this Christmas?</description>

  <description>It began with a trivial moment of carelessness, but the shockwaves that reverberate from this seemingly insignificant incident, spread far and wide. Ed and his heavily pregnant wife Mary are on an errand for Ed’s ailing father before the pair depart for warmer climes. But the winter of 1962 comes early and one innocuous event and a hastily taken decision will have devastating consequences for the family of young Rose Gorton. Mary’s already fragile mental state is put under further stress while Ed tries to make sense of events that are spiralling massively, Out of Control.</description>

  <description>Sometimes the truth hurts … &lt;br /&gt;When journalist Tess Johnson takes a job at Helix pharmaceuticals, she has a very specific motive. Tess has reason to believe the company are knowingly producing a potentially harmful drug and, if her suspicions are confirmed, she will stop at nothing to make sure the truth comes out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Knight is the president of research and development at Helix and is a force to be reckoned with. After a disastrous office affair he’s determined that nothing else will distract him from his vision for the company. Failure is simply not an option. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Tess and Jim start working together, both have their reasons for wanting to ignore the sexual chemistry that fires between them. But chemistry, like most things in the world of science, isn’t always easy to control.</description>

  <description>What if you were trapped between two cultures? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is tough in 1870s Wyoming. But it’s tougher still when you’re a girl who looks Chinese but speaks like an American. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orphaned as a baby and taken in by an American family, Charity Walker knows this only too well. The mounting tensions between the new Chinese immigrants and the locals in the mining town of Carter see her shunned by both communities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Charity’s one friend, Joe, leaves town, she finds herself isolated. However, in his absence, a new friendship with the only other Chinese girl in Carter makes her feel like she finally belongs somewhere. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, for a lost girl like Charity, finding a place to call home was never going to be that easy …</description>

  <description>Forty-two year old Helen returns one summer to Zakynthos, the Greek island where her life took a dramatic turn two years earlier. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She brings with her Chloe, her sixteen year old daughter, who is fighting demons of her own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relations between mother and daughter are strained, as they struggle to understand the different ways they are coping with their family’s tragedy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The death of Helen’s husband Philip has left them shattered and seeking comfort at the hotel where they spent their final family holiday all together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But has Helen come to Zakynthos to confront the ghosts of her past, or to revive the affair which nearly tore her family apart once already? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the married hotel owner, Nikos, is the man she nearly left her family for two years before, lost in her all-consuming passion for him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing the love of her life again makes Helen question not only her future, but her past as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should she resist her feelings for Nikos, or is he her last chance at happiness? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what if her affair is not the only betrayal lurking in her family’s past? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Echoes in the Sand’ is a heart-breaking story of love and loss, and the war between the head and the heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'A wonderfully-told romantic story.' - Holly Kinsella, best-selling author of 'Uptown Girl'. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gwyneth Williams works fulltime as a Scientific Officer in the University of Leicester’s medical school and writes in her lunch breaks, and any other time she can find. One day she dreams of owning a villa on a Greek island and writing all day by the pool. In the meantime she lives in Leicester with her husband and daughter when she’s home from university, and a stray cat who adopted them one cold Saturday in October. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Endeavour Press is the UK’s leading independent digital publisher.</description>

  <description>A shaky upbringing has left Rosie Stevens craving safety and security. She thinks she knows exactly what she needs to make her life complete – the stable job and perfect house-sit she’s just found in Magnolia Creek. The only thing she wants now is for her long-term boyfriend, Adam, to leave his overseas job and come home for good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owen Harrison is notoriously nomadic, and he roars into town on his Ducati for one reason and one reason only – to search his parents’ house while they’re away to find out what they’ve been hiding from him his entire life. When he meets Rosie, who refuses to quit the house-sit in his parents’ home, sparks fly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secrets are unearthed, promises are broken, friendships are put to the test and the real risk of bushfires under the hot Australian sun threatens to undo Rosie once and for all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Rosie and Owen be able to find what they want or what they really need?</description>

  <description>It's 1969 and Mary Schormann is living quietly in Wales with her ex-POW husband, Peter, and her teenage twins, Richard and Victoria. Her niece, Linda Booth, is a nurse - following in Mary's footsteps - and works in the maternity ward of her local hospital in Lancashire. At the end of a long night shift, a bullying new father visits the maternity ward and brings back Linda's darkest nightmares, her terror of being locked in. Who is this man, and why does he scare her so? There are secrets dating back to the war that still haunt the family, and finding out what lies at their root might be the only way Linda can escape their murderous consequences.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One celebration destined for failure.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wayne and Clarissa are a young London couple whose immediate families are about to meet for the first time. Trying to create harmony between the parents is hard enough, but in this case there are eight parents, step-parents, and partners to cope with. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wayne comes from a working class background and Clarissa, an upper-middle class one. They are deeply in love but tensions arising from the forthcoming gathering have created a rift, and it’s touch and go whether their relationship is strong enough to survive the event. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With more than just an engagement on the line, can these two families come together – &lt;i&gt;or will their differences rip them all apart?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian Note: There is an updated cover for this edition with ASIN B00XFPKA02&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty-four year old, Mimi Finnegan is the third of four daughters and in her eyes, by far, the most unremarkable. She has no singular accomplishment that can stand up to any of her sisters. And if that isn’t enough, she is the only single sibling in her family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mimi’s sisters decide that it’s time she gets serious about husband hunting, so they begin a campaign to find Mr. Right for her. Considering her most recent dating encounters include a night club owner who stuffs bratwurst in his pants and a WASPy trust fund baby, living happily under his mother’s thumb, Mimi is more than ready to meet THE ONE. Enter celebrated British novelist Elliot Fielding. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sexual tension and anger heat up between the duo and it isn’t until Mimi discovers that Elliot is almost engaged to another that she realizes she is head-over-heels in love with him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The journey will make you laugh, cry and want to pull your hair out from frustration! Mimi eventually learns that she is quite remarkable in her own right and never needed to worry that she lived in her sister’s shadows. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Reinvention of Mimi Finnegan is the perfect laugh-out-loud, feel good book for any woman who has ever felt that she wasn’t good enough. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Fall in love on Rockwell Island...Sink your toes into the sandy beaches at the heart of Cape Cod Bay, where family comes first, good friends are around every corner, and true love is waiting beneath the stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trent Rockwell has it all—a thriving legal practice, coownership of the Rockwell Resort, and a big, loving family. And yet his failed marriage to Reese Nicholson has haunted him for ten long years. Now that he has moved back to Cape Cod Bay to help run his family’s resort, he is surrounded by memories of Reese…and he can’t stop longing for the woman he’d always believed was his one true love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At nineteen, artist Reese Nicholson was swept off her feet by the handsome, charming, and incredibly sensual Trent Rockwell. After a whirlwind courtship, they married and moved to New York City, where they hoped all of their personal and professional dreams would come true. But six months later, Reese returned to Rockwell Island brokenhearted and disillusioned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a decade, Trent and Reese carefully kept their distance. But all it takes is one accidental late-night encounter to immediately stir the desires they have both tried to bury deep. Powerless to resist the heat between them, every passionate kiss, loving caress, and heartfelt apology draws them closer together. So close that they can’t help but wonder if the promises they once made to love each other forever are still true…</description>

  <description>YOU FELL IN love with Blue Ryder and Lizzie Barber in Seaside Summers, now follow their journey to find true love in SEIZED BY LOVE, the first book in the Ryder series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEIZED BY LOVE is a USA TODAY BESTSELLER &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lizzie Barber runs a successful flower shop by day and secretly hosts the Naked Baker webcast at night to help pay for her younger sister's education. To keep friends and family from finding out about her sexy secret, she's put her social life on hold until her sister's education is paid off and she can stop filming the webcast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Ryder fell hard for Lizzie Barber when he met her a year ago, and he hasn't been able to get her off his mind since. Everything about the feisty little brunette, from her tight bod to her seductive smile, cuts straight to his heart. Though Lizzie has turned down every invitation he's extended--Blue is not about to give up trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renovating Lizzie's kitchen brings Blue further into Lizzie's life, and the oven is not the only thing heating up. One night and one powerful kiss changes everything. But when Lizzie's secret is revealed and the safe bubble she's hidden in shatters, true love may not be enough to put the pieces back together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE RYDERS are the newest addition to the LOVE IN BLOOM series by New York Times &amp;amp; USA Today bestselling and award-winning author Melissa Foster. This 5-book hot contemporary romance series features alpha male heroes and sexy, empowered women. They're flawed, funny, passionate, and relatable to readers who enjoy new adult romance, contemporary romance, and women's fiction. While each book may be read as a standalone, you might enjoy reading the entire Love in Bloom series (The Snow Sisters, The Bradens, The Remingtons, &amp;amp; Seaside Summers)</description>

  <description>She's back to right her wrongs When Tanya Todd returns to Templeton Cove, she knows better than to expect a warm welcome. She burned a few bridges on her way out of town, and making amends won't be easy. First on her list is the man whose heart she carelessly shattered, Liam Browne. Seeing the successful criminal lawyer after all these years, Tanya is interested in more than just Liam's forgiveness. As they work together to bring the man who hurt her sister to justice, the attraction between them sizzles. Suddenly Tanya's second chance could include a future with Liam... if she can prove she's changed.</description>

  <description>Jennie Bateman screamed at her daughters, cursed at her husband, packed a bag, and walked away. Twelve years later, she petitions the family court for visitation with her daughters, Alexis and Christa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her attorney tells Jennie that, ordinarily, she could not imagine that some type of visitation would not be granted. But, she warns, the situation is hardly ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;True, Jennie suffered from a bipolar disorder when she began to drink heavily, abandoned her family, and moved in with another man. True, she has turned her life around: leaving her boyfriend, returning to school, entering therapy, taking medication, finding a job, and joining a church. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she pressed no claim for her children when her husband divorced her, and she has made no attempt to contact them in any way since then. Her daughters, now sixteen and fourteen, live four hundred miles away. They have busy lives that do not include her, lives that will be totally disrupted by the visitation that she requests. Their father is engaged to be married to a woman who has taken the role of their mother for a decade. Alexis remembers nothing good about Jennie. Christa recalls nothing at all. &lt;br /&gt;Conflict ensues as soon as Jennie’s petition is served: her former husband does not want to share his children with the woman who deserted him; her children have no interest in knowing the mother who abandoned them, and her father insists that she is being timid and ought to demand full custody, not simply visitation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As court convenes, Jennie’s past is dredged up− the desertion, the men, her drinking, her mental health − and paraded before the judge. Her claim to be a different person, now, is attacked. The judge hesitates to grant Jennie’s request, but reluctantly agrees to order three trial visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If persuading the judge to let her see her children was difficult, convincing them to allow her to be a part of their lives seems to be almost impossible. She struggles through two visits and is almost. What happens next tests her confidence in herself, her love for her children, and, ultimately, threatens her life, itself.</description>

  <description>‘IMPECCABLE DESCRIPTIONS MADE THE STORY COME ALIVE … EXHILARATING STUFF’ THE SUN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The first in an electrifying new British detective series starring PC Donal Lynch.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet PC Donal Lynch.&lt;br /&gt;Irish runaway. Insomniac. Functioning alcoholic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donal is new to working the beat in London, trying his&lt;br /&gt;best to forget that night. After all, there aren’t many police&lt;br /&gt;officers who can say they have a convicted murderer&lt;br /&gt;for an ex-girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when a woman is murdered on his patch, Donal throws&lt;br /&gt;himself into the case. As the first person on the scene,&lt;br /&gt;Donal can’t forget the horrific sight that faced him – and&lt;br /&gt;he knows this case can’t go unsolved. But how do you&lt;br /&gt;solve a case with no lead suspect and no evidence?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As his past catches up with him, Donal is forced to confront&lt;br /&gt;his demons and the girl he left behind. But what will crack&lt;br /&gt;first, the case or Donal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chilling, brutal, addictive – if you like Tim Weaver and James Oswald, you will LOVE James Nally.</description>

  <description>Set in the days of civilization's collapse, &lt;i&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of a Hollywood star, his would-be savior, and a nomadic group of actors roaming the scattered outposts of the Great Lakes region, risking everything for art and humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One snowy night a famous Hollywood actor slumps over and dies onstage during a production of &lt;i&gt;King Lear&lt;/i&gt;. Hours later, the world as we know it begins to dissolve. Moving back and forth in time—from the actor's early days as a film star to fifteen years in the future, when a theater troupe known as the Traveling Symphony roams the wasteland of what remains—this suspenseful, elegiac, spellbinding novel charts the strange twists of fate that connect five people: the actor, the man who tried to save him, the actor's first wife, his oldest friend, and a young actress with the Traveling Symphony, caught in the crosshairs of a dangerous self-proclaimed prophet.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mishaps in Millrise&lt;/i&gt; – a four-(novella)-part romantic spin-off from &lt;i&gt;Mishaps and Mistletoe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part 3 - The Parent Trap&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A shock development turns Phoebe’s world upside-down. But it’s one that Jack has difficulty coming to terms with too, and they seem to be growing further and further apart. Archie continues to stir up trouble between them, until one night his reckless actions almost end in tragedy. And he’s not the only one causing problems in Phoebe’s life, as Midnight adds her own peculiar spanner in the works. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Phoebe buries herself in her job, and it looks as though Hendry’s might actually be on the road to financial recovery. But if she loses Jack and Midnight, what will it all be for? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;'Tilly Tennant has obvious talent for turning the every day into a fairy tale... a sweet touch and light humour'&lt;/i&gt; BestChickLit.com&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>James Kingman’s world just got complicated. The love of his life, Katherine Dale, has just given birth to their first child. His troublesome business manager, Phillipa, is sexually harassing him at work. His boss proposes a partnership which would double his workload. With so much on his plate, how will James cope?&lt;br /&gt;Plagued by the unexpected exhaustion of having a baby who suffers from colic, he tries his best to hold his family together. Despite growing up without a mother and a neglectful father, James is a natural-born father. Katherine, however, is struggling. Dejected and rejected, Katherine battles with her hormones as her writing career begins to slip away from her. She not only doubts her capabilities as a writer but as a mother too. Katherine confides in James’ boss, the enigmatic and world-famous astrologer, Mark Ainsley-Thomas, and he puts her in touch with his agent.&lt;br /&gt;Things start to look up for the writer, as her latest work attracts attention from several publishers, but her trips to Mark’s hotel attract attention too… Suspicion is aroused and photographs are snapped.&lt;br /&gt;Is there any truth to last year’s rumours of an affair between the pair?&lt;br /&gt;If not, then why is Katherine visiting Mark in secret?&lt;br /&gt;Will James be able to resist the advances of his seductive colleague?&lt;br /&gt;Will the tangled trio be able to avoid scandal in the stars?&lt;br /&gt;This sequel to ‘Under The Stars’ can be read as a standalone romcom.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Simon. I'm 10 years old. I'm a serial killer.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Stern, a successful defence lawyer, doesn't know what lies in store for him when he agrees to meet a new client in a derelict estate on the outskirts of Berlin. To his astonishment, the defendant is a ten-year-old boy - Simon - a fragile child with a chronic illness who insists that he was a murderer in a former life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stern's surprise quickly turns to horror as he searches the cellar Simon has directed him to and discovers the skeletal remains of a man, the skull split with an axe - just as Simon told him he would. But this is only the beginning, as Simon tells Stern where to find even more victims whose bodies have lain undisturbed for years. Suddenly, the present feels murderously dangerous as well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Child&lt;/i&gt; is a darkly twisting, page-turning thriller that will make your heart pound with adrenaline.</description>

  <description>OUT OF SALE! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Race your heart around the bend with Racing Heart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At age twenty-five Desire Hart has experienced almost too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking drastic measures and changing everything in her life; her identity, her hometown and the country of residence, she hopes her new life will help her find her kidnapped son. Desire is determined that nothing will prevent her achieving her goal. Not even love which has led her to skate on thin ice in the past once too many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One spring evening she meets the golden boy of F1 racing, Lorcan Shore, and finds herself falling for him. Struggling to suppress that feeling, she realizes he might help her get closer to the child she starts to undoubtedly believe is her long lost son. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But nothing goes according to, what she believes, so well planned actions. Everything goes wrong. Her identity is revealed by the press, Lorcan experiences the unexpected racing accident and she finds out that the trail she was given leads her to another dead end. In despair she does, what she does best; she runs away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set against the glamorous backdrops of Monaco, Paris and Nice, 'Racing Heart' mixes romance and mystery as Desire struggles to come to terms with her past and learns how to accept love into her life once again.</description>
