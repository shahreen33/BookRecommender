  <description>Something strange is happening at the Orsk furniture superstore in Cleveland, Ohio. Every morning, employees arrive to find broken Kjerring bookshelves, shattered Glans water goblets, and smashed Liripip wardrobes. Sales are down, security cameras reveal nothing, and store managers are panicking.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To unravel the mystery, three employees volunteer to work a nine-hour dusk-till-dawn shift. In the dead of the night, they’ll patrol the empty showroom floor, investigate strange sights and sounds, and encounter horrors that defy the imagination.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A traditional haunted house story in a thoroughly contemporary setting, Horrorstör comes packaged in the form of a glossy mail order catalog, complete with product illustrations, a home delivery order form, and a map of Orsk’s labyrinthine showroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Designed by Andie Reid, cover photography by Christine Ferrara</description>

  <description>If everything in Amanda's life is so perfect, then why the mood swings, the obscene thoughts, the urge to harm the people she loves? What are those tapping sounds in the walls? And who's that woman following her? The mystery behind what's happening to Amanda in &lt;i&gt;Come Closer&lt;/i&gt; is so frightening that it "ought to carry a warning to...readers."</description>

  <description>What do you do when you discover that the person you've built your life around never existed? When "it could never happen to me" &lt;i&gt;does &lt;/i&gt;happen to you? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the questions facing Jen Waite when she begins to realize that her loving husband--the father of her infant daughter, her best friend, the love of her life--fits the textbook definition of psychopath. In a raw, first-person account, Waite recounts each heartbreaking discovery, every life-destroying lie, and reveals what happens once the dust finally settles on her demolished marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a disturbing email sparks Waite's suspicion that her husband is having an affair, she tries to uncover the truth and rebuild trust in her marriage. Instead, she finds more lies, infidelity, and betrayal than she could have imagined. Waite obsessively analyzes her relationship, trying to find a single moment from the last five years that isn't part of the long-con of lies and manipulation. With a dual-timeline narrative structure, we see Waite's romance bud, bloom, and wither simultaneously, making the heartbreak and disbelief even more affecting.</description>

  <description>“I feel like I’ve joined an enormous club, something like the Veterans of Foreign Wars. We are weary with battle fatigue and sometimes even gripped by nostalgia for the good old, bad old days, but our numbers are large,” writes Theo Pauline Nestor in this wry, fiercely honest chronicle of life after divorce. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less than an hour after confronting her husband over his massive gambling losses, Theo banishes him from their home forever. With two young daughters to support and her life as a stay-at-home mother at an abrupt end, Nestor finds herself slipping from “middle-class grace” as she attends a court-ordered custody class, stumbles through job interviews, and–much to her surprise–falls in love once again. As Theo rebuilds her life and recovers her sense of self, she’s forced to confront her own family’s legacy of divorce. “I’m from a long line of stock market speculators, artists of unmarketable talents, and alcoholics,” writes Nestor. “The higher, harder road is not our road. We move, we divorce, we drink, or we disappear.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nestor’s journey takes her deep into her family’s past, to a tiny village in Mexico, where she discovers the truth about how her sister ended up living in a convent there after their parents divorced in the early sixties. What she learns ultimately brings her closer to understanding her own divorce and its impact on her two daughters. “I knew from experience that for children divorce means half the world is constantly eclipsed. When you’re with one parent, the other must always slip out of view,” Nestor writes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, openhearted, and brave, &lt;i&gt;How to Sleep Alone in a King-Size Bed&lt;/i&gt; will speak to anyone who has passed through the halls of divorce court or risked tenderness after loss. It marks the debut of an enchanting, deeply truthful voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The 50th-anniversary edition of the bestselling novel that launched John le Carré’s career worldwide &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the shadow of the newly erected Berlin Wall, Alec Leamas watches as his last agent is shot dead by East German sentries. For Leamas, the head of Berlin Station, the Cold War is over. As he faces the prospect of retirement or worse—a desk job—Control offers him a unique opportunity for revenge. Assuming the guise of an embittered and dissolute ex-agent, Leamas is set up to trap Mundt, the deputy director of the East German Intelligence Service—with himself as the bait. In the background is George Smiley, ready to make the game play out just as Control wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Setting a standard that has never been surpassed, &lt;i&gt;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&lt;/i&gt; is a devastating tale of duplicity and espionage.</description>

  <description>In the middle of the night, in a house on a quiet street in suburban Minneapolis, intruders silently murder Luke Ellis’s parents and load him into a black SUV. The operation takes less than two minutes. Luke will wake up at The Institute, in a room that looks just like his own, except there’s no window. And outside his door are other doors, behind which are other kids with special talents—telekinesis and telepathy—who got to this place the same way Luke did: Kalisha, Nick, George, Iris, and ten-year-old Avery Dixon. They are all in Front Half. Others, Luke learns, graduated to Back Half, “like the roach motel,” Kalisha says. “You check in, but you don’t check out.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this most sinister of institutions, the director, Mrs. Sigsby, and her staff are ruthlessly dedicated to extracting from these children the force of their extranormal gifts. There are no scruples here. If you go along, you get tokens for the vending machines. If you don’t, punishment is brutal. As each new victim disappears to Back Half, Luke becomes more and more desperate to get out and get help. But no one has ever escaped from the Institute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As psychically terrifying as Firestarter, and with the spectacular kid power of It, The Institute is Stephen King’s gut-wrenchingly dramatic story of good vs. evil in a world where the good guys don’t always win.</description>

  <description>In a vast, mysterious house on the cliffs near Dover, the Silver family is reeling from the hole punched into its heart. Lily is gone and her twins, Miranda and Eliot, and her husband, the gentle Luc, mourn her absence with unspoken intensity. All is not well with the house, either, which creaks and grumbles and malignly confuses visitors in its mazy rooms, forcing winter apples in the garden when the branches should be bare. Generations of women inhabit its walls. And Miranda, with her new appetite for chalk and her keen sense for spirits, is more attuned to them than she is to her brother and father. She is leaving them slowly -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slipping away from them -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when one dark night she vanishes entirely, the survivors are left to tell her story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Miri I conjure you "&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a spine-tingling tale that has Gothic roots but an utterly modern sensibility. Told by a quartet of crystalline voices, it is electrifying in its expression of myth and memory, loss and magic, fear and love.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Stay away from the woods…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Silla and Nori arrive at their aunt’s home, it’s immediately clear that the manor is cursed. The endless creaking of the house at night and the eerie stillness of the woods surrounding them would be enough of a sign, but there are secrets too—questions that Silla can’t ignore: Why does it seem that, ever since they arrived, the trees have been creeping closer? Who is the beautiful boy who’s appeared from the woods? And who is the tall man with no eyes who Nori plays with in the basement at night… a man no one else can see?</description>

  <description>Whoever is born here, is doomed to stay 'til death. Whoever settles, never leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Black Spring, the seemingly picturesque Hudson Valley town haunted by the Black Rock Witch, a 17th century woman whose eyes and mouth are sewn shut. Muzzled, she walks the streets and enters your homes at will. She stands next to your bed for nights on end. Everybody knows that her eyes may never be opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The elders of Black Spring have virtually quarantined the town by using high-tech surveillance to prevent their curse from spreading. Frustrated with being kept in lockdown, the town's teenagers decide to break their strict regulations and go viral with the haunting, but in so doing send the town spiraling into the dark, medieval practices of the past.</description>

  <description>What real reader does not yearn, somewhere in the recesses of his or her heart, for a really literate, first-class thriller--one that chills the body, but warms the soul with plot, perception, and language at once astute and vivid? In other words, a ghost story written by Jane Austen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, we cannot give you Austen, but Susan Hill's remarkable &lt;i&gt;Woman In Black&lt;/i&gt; comes as close as our era can provide. Set on the obligatory English moor, on an isolated causeway, the story has as its hero Arthur Kipps, an up-and-coming young solicitor who has come north from London to attend the funeral and settle the affairs of Mrs. Alice Drablow of Eel Marsh House. The routine formalities he anticipates give way to a tumble of events and secrets more sinister and terrifying than any nightmare: the rocking chair in the deserted nursery, the eerie sound of a pony and trap, a child's scream in the fog, and most dreadfully--and for Kipps most tragically--&lt;i&gt;The Woman In Black&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Woman In Black&lt;/i&gt; is both a brilliant exercise in atmosphere and controlled horror and a delicious spine-tingler--proof positive that this neglected genre, the ghost story, isn't dead after all.</description>

  <description>Thirty-something Colquitt and Walter Kennedy live in a charming, peaceful suburb of the newly bustling Atlanta. Life is made up of enjoyable work, long, lazy weekends, and the company of good neighbors. Then, to their shock, construction starts on the vacant lot next door, a wooded hillside they'd believed would always remain undeveloped. Soon, though, they come to realize that more is wrong than their diminished privacy. Surely the house can't be "haunted," yet something about it seems to destroy the goodness of every person who comes to live in it, until the entire heart of this friendly neighborhood threatens to be torn apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The bestselling novel, "a brilliant, massive combination of history and supernatural horror" (Stephen King), now a major TV series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The men on board the HMS Terror have every expectation of finding the Northwest Passage. But what they don't expect is a monstrous predator lurking behind the Arctic ice. When the expedition's leader, Sir John Franklin, meets a horrifying end, Captain Francis Crozier takes command, leading his surviving crewmen on a last desperate attempt to flee south across the ice.&lt;br /&gt;But another winter is rapidly approaching, and with it, scurvy and starvation. Crozier and his men may find that there is no escaping the terror stalking them southward. And with the crushing cold and the fear of almost certain death at their backs, the most horrifying monster among them may be each other.</description>

  <description>For thirty-one years, a monster terrorized the residents of Wichita, Kansas. A bloodthirsty serial killer, self-named "BTK"—for "bind them, torture them, kill them"—he slaughtered men, women, and children alike, eluding the police for decades while bragging of his grisly exploits to the media. The nation was shocked when the fiend who was finally apprehended turned out to be Dennis Rader—a friendly neighbor . . . a devoted husband . . . a helpful Boy Scout dad . . . the respected president of his church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written by four award-winning crime reporters who covered the story for more than twenty years, &lt;em&gt;Bind, Torture, Kill&lt;/em&gt; is the most intimate and complete account of the BTK nightmare told by the people who were there from the beginning. With newly released documents, evidence, and information—and with the full cooperation, for the very first time, of the Wichita Police Department’s BTK Task Force—the authors have put all the pieces of the grisly puzzle into place, thanks to their unparalleled access to the families of the killer and his victims.</description>

  <description>Arlington Park, a modern-day English suburb very much like its American counterparts, is a place devoted to the profitable ordinariness of life. Amidst its leafy avenues and comfortable houses, its residents live out the dubious accomplishments of civilization: material prosperity, personal freedom, and moral indifference. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Arlington Park, men work, women look after children, and people generally do wha's expected of them. It's a world awash in contentment but empty of belief, and riven with strange anxieties. How are they to know right from wrong? How should they use their knowledge of other people's sufferings? What is the relationship of politics to their own domestic arrangements? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set over the course of a single rainy day, the novel moves from one household to another, and through the passing hours conducts a deep examination of its characters' lives: of Juliet, enraged at the victory of men over women in family life; of Amanda, warding off thoughts of death with obsessive housework; of Solly, who confronts her own buried femininity in the person of her Italian lodger; of Maisie, despairing at the inevitability with which beauty is destroyed; and of Christine, whose troubled, hilarious spirit presides over Arlington Park and the way of life it represents. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darkly comic, deeply affecting, and wise, &lt;i&gt;Arlington Park&lt;/i&gt;is a page-turning imagining of the extraordinary inner nature of ordinary life, by one of Britain's most exciting young novelists.</description>

  <description>A lot has changed since Kitchen Confidential. For the subculture of chefs and cooks, for the restaurant business as a whole—and for Anthony Bourdain. Medium Raw explores those changes, taking the reader back and forth—from the author’s bad old days—to the present. Tracking his own strange and unexpected voyage from journeyman cook to globe travelling professional eater and drinker, Bourdain compares and contrasts what he’s seen and what he’s seeing, pausing along the way for a series of confessions, rants, investigations, and interrogations of some of the more controversial figures in food. Always returning to the question: “Why cook? “ Or the harder to answer: “Why cook well?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning with a secret and highly illegal after-hours gathering of powerful chefs he compares to a Mafia summit, the story follows the twists and eddies through subjects ranging from:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• “The Friends of David Chang” an incredibly undiplomatic discussion with (and peek into the mind of) the hottest, most influential chef in America.&lt;br /&gt;• “Don’t Ask Alice”: Alice Waters. Good . . . or Evil?&lt;br /&gt;• The Big Shake Out: The restaurant business in post economic meltdown America. How it’s changing. How it might change even more.&lt;br /&gt;• And, Heroes and Villains. (With a few returning favorites.)</description>

  <description>Joe O’Brien is a forty-four-year-old police officer from the Irish Catholic neighborhood of Charlestown, Massachusetts. A devoted husband, proud father of four children in their twenties, and respected officer, Joe begins experiencing bouts of disorganized thinking, uncharacteristic temper outbursts, and strange, involuntary movements. He initially attributes these episodes to the stress of his job, but as these symptoms worsen, he agrees to see a neurologist and is handed a diagnosis that will change his and his family’s lives forever: Huntington’s Disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huntington’s is a lethal neurodegenerative disease with no treatment and no cure. Each of Joe’s four children has a 50 percent chance of inheriting their father’s disease, and a simple blood test can reveal their genetic fate. While watching her potential future in her father’s escalating symptoms, twenty-one-year-old daughter Katie struggles with the questions this test imposes on her young adult life. Does she want to know? What if she’s gene positive? Can she live with the constant anxiety of not knowing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Joe’s symptoms worsen and he’s eventually stripped of his badge and more, Joe struggles to maintain hope and a sense of purpose, while Katie and her siblings must find the courage to either live a life “at risk” or learn their fate.</description>

  <description>In the fields and forests of western New York State in the late 1960s, several dozen idealists set out to live off the land, founding what becomes a famous commune centered on the grounds of a decaying mansion called Arcadia House. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Arcadia&lt;/i&gt; follows this lyrical, rollicking, tragic, and exquisite utopian dream from its hopeful start through its heyday and after. The story is told from the point of view of Bit, a fascinating character and the first child born in &lt;i&gt;Arcadia&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>A southern fried novel about love, Lead Belly, and liberation that's been called a "ravishing debut" in a starred Kirkus Review and "writing at its finest" by the NY Journal of Books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1923 in Midland, Texas, and Miss Dara falls in love with her best friend―who also happens to be a girl. Terrified, Miss Dara takes a job at Imperial State Prison Farm for men. Once there, she befriends inmate and soon-to-be legendary blues singer Lead Belly, who sings his way out (true story)―but only after he makes her promise to free herself from her own prison. SUGAR LAND is a triumphant novel that manages to be funny and endearing even as it tangles with race, class, and the fate of misfits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A powerful paperback that doesn't pull any emotional punches, Sugar Land is a debut you don't want to miss." - Bustle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"With a lively sense of humor and a great sense of place, tammy lynne stoner’s debut is a Southern novel from a voice that rings true ... with keen insight into race, class, gender identity and social norms, Sugar Land is the story of a woman learning to come home to herself." - BookPage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Stoner creates a captivating story for the ages—a young, southern girl in the 1920s who becomes a ballsy broad in a double-wide...This heartbreaking and hysterical book inspires us with a brave and unusual life.”&lt;br /&gt;—Jillian Lauren, New York Times bestselling author of Some Girls: My Life in a Harem and Everything You Ever Wanted</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The former Sex &amp;amp; Relationships Editor for &lt;i&gt;Cosmopolitan &lt;/i&gt;and host of the wildly popular comedy show &lt;i&gt;Tinder Live with Lane Moore&lt;/i&gt; presents her poignant, funny, and deeply moving first book.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lane Moore is a rare performer who is as impressive onstage—whether hosting her iconic show &lt;i&gt;Tinder Live &lt;/i&gt;or being the enigmatic front woman of It Was Romance—as she is on the page, as both a former writer for &lt;i&gt;The Onion&lt;/i&gt; and an award-winning sex and relationships editor for &lt;i&gt;Cosmopolitan&lt;/i&gt;. But her story has had its obstacles, including being her own parent, living in her car as a teenager, and moving to New York City to pursue her dreams. Through it all, she looked to movies, TV, and music as the family and support systems she never had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From spending the holidays alone to having better “stranger luck” than with those closest to her to feeling like the last hopeless romantic on earth, Lane reveals her powerful and entertaining journey in all its candor, anxiety, and ultimate acceptance—with humor always her bolstering force and greatest gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Be Alone&lt;/i&gt; is a must-read for anyone whose childhood still feels unresolved, who spends more time pretending to have friends online than feeling close to anyone in real life, who tries to have genuine, deep conversations in a roomful of people who would &lt;i&gt;rather you not&lt;/i&gt;. Above all, it’s a book for anyone who desperately wants to feel less alone and a little more connected through reading her words.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the # 1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Signature of All Things&lt;/i&gt;, a delicious novel of glamour, sex, and adventure, about a young woman discovering that you don't have to be a &lt;i&gt;good girl&lt;/i&gt; to be a good person.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Life is both fleeting and dangerous, and there is no point in denying yourself pleasure, or being anything other than what you are.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beloved author Elizabeth Gilbert returns to fiction with a unique love story set in the New York City theater world during the 1940s. Told from the perspective of an older woman as she looks back on her youth with both pleasure and regret (but mostly pleasure), &lt;i&gt;City of Girls&lt;/i&gt; explores themes of female sexuality and promiscuity, as well as the idiosyncrasies of true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1940, nineteen-year-old Vivian Morris has just been kicked out of Vassar College, owing to her lackluster freshman-year performance. Her affluent parents send her to Manhattan to live with her Aunt Peg, who owns a flamboyant, crumbling midtown theater called the Lily Playhouse. There Vivian is introduced to an entire cosmos of unconventional and charismatic characters, from the fun-chasing showgirls to a sexy male actor, a grand-dame actress, a lady-killer writer, and no-nonsense stage manager. But when Vivian makes a personal mistake that results in professional scandal, it turns her new world upside down in ways that it will take her years to fully understand. Ultimately, though, it leads her to a new understanding of the kind of life she craves-and the kind of freedom it takes to pursue it. It will also lead to the love of her life, a love that stands out from all the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now ninety-five years old and telling her story at last, Vivian recalls how the events of those years altered the course of her life - and the gusto and autonomy with which she approached it. &lt;i&gt;At some point in a woman's life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time,&lt;/i&gt; she muses. &lt;i&gt;After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is.&lt;/i&gt; Written with a powerful wisdom about human desire and connection, &lt;i&gt;City of Girls&lt;/i&gt; is a love story like no other.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the New York Times bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs&lt;/i&gt;, a startling challenge to our thinking about depression and anxiety.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Award-winning journalist Johann Hari suffered from depression since he was a child and started taking antidepressants when he was a teenager. He was told—like his entire generation—that his problem was caused by a chemical imbalance in his brain. As an adult, trained in the social sciences, he began to investigate this question—and he learned that almost everything we have been told about depression and anxiety is wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across the world, Hari discovered social scientists who were uncovering the real causes—and they are mostly not in our brains, but in the way we live today. Hari’s journey took him from the people living in the tunnels beneath Las Vegas, to an Amish community in Indiana, to an uprising in Berlin—all showing in vivid and dramatic detail these new insights. They lead to solutions radically different from the ones we have been offered up until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as &lt;i&gt;Chasing the Scream&lt;/i&gt; transformed the global debate about addiction, with over twenty million views for his TED talk and the animation based on it, &lt;i&gt;Lost Connections&lt;/i&gt; will lead us to a very different debate about depression and anxiety—one that shows how, together, we can end this epidemic.</description>

  <description>A comet the color of blood and flame cuts across the sky. Two great leaders—Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon—who hold sway over an age of enforced peace are dead, victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns. Six factions struggle for control of a divided land and the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, preparing to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a tale in which brother plots against brother and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, victory may go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel...and the coldest hearts. For when kings clash, the whole land trembles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the second volume in George R.R. Martin magnificent cycle of novels that includes &lt;i&gt;A Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A Storm of Swords&lt;/i&gt;.

  <description>Here is the first volume in George R. R. Martin’s magnificent cycle of novels that includes A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords. As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R. R. Martin’s stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A GAME OF THRONES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;source: georgerrmartin.com</description>

  <description>From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Cartel&lt;/i&gt; comes an explosive novel of the drug trade that takes you deep inside a world riddled with corruption, betrayal, and bloody revenge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prequel to &lt;i&gt;The Cartel&lt;/i&gt;, and set about 10 years earlier, &lt;i&gt;The Power of the Dog&lt;/i&gt; introduces a brilliant cast of characters. Art Keller is an obsessive DEA agent. The Barrera brothers are heirs to a drug empire. Nora Hayden is a jaded teenager who becomes a high-class hooker. Father Parada is a powerful and incorruptible Catholic priest. Callan is an Irish kid from Hell’s kitchen who grows up to be a merciless hit man. And they are all trapped in the world of the Mexican drug Federación. From the streets of New York City to Mexico City and Tijuana to the jungles of Central America, this is the war on drugs like you’ve never seen it.</description>

  <description>Baratunde Thurston shares his 30-plus years of expertise in being black, with helpful essays like “How to Be the Black Friend,” “How to Speak for All Black People,” “How To Celebrate Black History Month,” and more, in this satirical guide to race issues—written for black people and those who love them. Audacious, cunning, and razor-sharp, &lt;em&gt;How to Be Black &lt;/em&gt;exposes the mass-media’s insidiously racist, monochromatic portrayal of black culture’s richness and variety. Fans of &lt;em&gt;Stuff White People Like&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;This Week in Blackness&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ending Racism in About an Hour &lt;/em&gt;will be captivated, uplifted, incensed, and inspired by this hilarious and powerful attack on America’s blacklisting of black culture: Baratunde Thurston’s &lt;em&gt;How to Be Black&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>What does “feminism” mean today? That is the question at the heart of &lt;i&gt;We Should All Be Feminists&lt;/i&gt;, a personal, eloquently-argued essay—adapted from her much-viewed TEDx talk of the same name—by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Americanah&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Half of a Yellow Sun&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With humor and levity, here Adichie offers readers a unique definition of feminism for the twenty-first century—one rooted in inclusion and awareness. She shines a light not only on blatant discrimination, but also the more insidious, institutional behaviors that marginalize women around the world, in order to help readers of all walks of life better understand the often masked realities of sexual politics. Throughout, she draws extensively on her own experiences—in the U.S., in her native Nigeria, and abroad—offering an artfully nuanced explanation of why the gender divide is harmful for women and men, alike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argued in the same observant, witty and clever prose that has made Adichie a bestselling novelist, here is one remarkable author’s exploration of what it means to be a woman today—and an of-the-moment rallying cry for why we should all be feminists.</description>

  <description>Author, activist, feminist, teacher, and artist bell hooks is celebrated as one of the nation's leading intellectuals. Born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, hooks drew her unique pseudonym from the name of her grandmother, an intelligent and strong-willed African American woman who inspired her to stand up against a dominating and repressive society. Her poetry, novels, memoirs, and children's books reflect her Appalachian upbringing and feature her struggles with racially integrated schools and unwelcome authority figures. One of &lt;i&gt;Utne Reader&lt;/i&gt;'s "100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life," hooks has won wide acclaim from critics and readers alike. In &lt;i&gt;Appalachian Elegy&lt;/i&gt;, bell hooks continues her work as an imagist of life's harsh realities in a collection of poems inspired by her childhood in the isolated hills and hidden hollows of Kentucky. At once meditative, confessional, and political, this poignant volume draws the reader deep into the experience of living in Appalachia. Touching on such topics as the marginalization of its people and the environmental degradation it has suffered over the years, hooks's poetry quietly elegizes the slow loss of an identity while also celebrating that which is constant, firmly rooted in a place that is no longer whole.</description>

  <description>With fearlessness and grace, &lt;i&gt;Bough Down&lt;/i&gt; reports from deep inside the maelstrom of grief. In this profoundly beautiful and intensely moving lament, artist and writer Karen Green conjures the inscrutable space of love and loss, clarity and contradiction, sense and madness. She summons memory and the machination of the interior mind with the emotional acuity of music as she charts her passage through the devastation of her husband's suicide. In crystalline fragments of text, Green's voice is paradoxically confessional and non-confessional: moments in her journey are devastating but also luminous, exacting in sensation but also ambiguous and layered in meaning. Her world is haunted by the unnameable, and yet she renders that world with poetic precision in her struggle to make sense of not only of death but of living. In counterpoint, tiny visual collages punctuate the text, each made of salvaged language and scraps of the material world-pages torn from books, bits of paper refuse, drawings and photographs, old postage stamps and the albums which classify them. Each collage — and the creative act of making it — evinces the reassembling of life. A breathtaking lyric elegy, &lt;i&gt;Bough Down&lt;/i&gt; uses music and silence, color and its absence, authority of experience and the doubt that trembles at its center to fulfill a humane artistic vision. This is a lapidary, keenly observed work, awash with the honesty of an open heart.</description>

  <description>Welcome to The Shore: a collection of small islands sticking out from the coast of Virginia into the Atlantic Ocean. Where clumps of evergreens meet wild ponies, oyster-shell roads, tumble-down houses, unwanted pregnancies, murder, storm-making and dark magic in the marshes. . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Situated off the coast of Virginia's Chesapeake Bay, the group of islands known as the Shore has been home to generations of fierce and resilient women. Sanctuary to some but nightmare to others, it's a place they've inhabited, fled, and returned to for hundreds of years. From a half-Shawnee Indian's bold choice to flee an abusive home only to find herself with a man who will one day try to kill her to a brave young girl's determination to protect her younger sister as methamphetamine ravages their family, to a lesson in summoning storm clouds to help end a drought, these women struggle against domestic violence, savage wilderness, and the corrosive effects of poverty and addiction to secure a sense of well-being for themselves and for those they love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together their stories form a deeply affecting legacy of two barrier island families, illuminating 150 years of their many freedoms and constraints, heartbreaks, and pleasures. Conjuring a wisdom and beauty all its own, &lt;i&gt;The Shore&lt;/i&gt; is a richly unique, stunning novel that will resonate with readers long after turning its final pages, establishing Sara Taylor as a promising new voice in fiction.</description>

  <description>In Lauren Groff’s &lt;i&gt;Florida&lt;/i&gt;, the hot sun shines, but a wild darkness lurks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her thrilling new book, Lauren Groff brings the reader into a physical world that is at once domestic and wild—a place where the hazards of the natural world lie waiting to pounce, yet the greatest threats and mysteries are still of an emotional, psychological nature. A family retreat can be derailed by a prowling panther, or by a sexual secret. Among those navigating this place are a resourceful pair of abandoned sisters; a lonely boy, grown up; a restless, childless couple, a searching, homeless woman; and an unforgettable, recurring character—a steely and conflicted wife and mother. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stories in this collection span characters, towns, decades, even centuries, but Florida—its landscape, climate, history, and state of mind—becomes its gravitational center: an energy, a mood, as much as a place of residence. Groff transports the reader, then jolts us alert with a crackle of wit, a wave of sadness, a flash of cruelty, as she writes about loneliness, rage, family, and the passage of time. With shocking accuracy and effect, she pinpoints the moments and decisions and connections behind human pleasure and pain, hope and despair, love and fury—the moments that make us alive. Startling, precise, and affecting, &lt;i&gt;Florida&lt;/i&gt; is a magnificent achievement.</description>

  <description>When the corpse of a beautiful high school student is discovered on a hillside four months after her disappearance on New Year's Eve, all evidence points to her boyfriend, local bad boy Solemn Winter Moon. Despite Solemn's self-incriminating decision to go into hiding, Cork O'Connor, Aurora's former sheriff, isn't about to hang the crime on the kid, whom O'Connor is convinced is innocent. In an uphill battle to clear Solemn's name, Cork encounters no shortage of adversity. Some he knows all too well -- small-town bigotry and bureaucracy foremost among them. What Cork isn't prepared for is the emergence of a long-held resentment hailing from his own childhood. And when Solemn reappears, claiming to have seen a vision of Jesus Christ in Blood Hollow, the mystery becomes thornier than Cork could ever have anticipated. And that's when the miracles start happening....</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Evicted&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Nickel and Dimed&lt;/i&gt; in Stephanie Land's memoir about working as a maid, a beautiful and gritty exploration of poverty in America. Includes a foreword by Barbara Ehrenreich. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"My daughter learned to walk in a homeless shelter."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the gap between upper middle-class Americans and the working poor widens, grueling low-wage domestic and service work--primarily done by women--fuels the economic success of the wealthy. Stephanie Land worked for years as a maid, pulling long hours while struggling as a single mom to keep a roof over her daughter's head. In &lt;i&gt;Maid,&lt;/i&gt; she reveals the dark truth of what it takes to survive and thrive in today's inequitable society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While she worked hard to scratch her way out of poverty as a single parent, scrubbing the toilets of the wealthy, navigating domestic labor jobs, higher education, assisted housing, and a tangled web of government assistance, Stephanie wrote. She wrote the true stories that weren't being told. The stories of overworked and underpaid Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in honest, heart-rending prose and with great insight, &lt;i&gt;Maid&lt;/i&gt; explores the underbelly of upper-middle class America and the reality of what it's like to be in service to them. "I'd become a nameless ghost," Stephanie writes. With this book, she gives voice to the "servant" worker, those who fight daily to scramble and scrape by for their own lives and the lives of their children.</description>

  <description>Romanen åpner med en svimlende beskrivelse av døden. Derfra fortelles det om forfatteren Karl Ove Knausgårds kamp for å mestre livet og seg selv og sine egne ambisjoner på skrivingens vegne, i møte med de menneskene han har rundt seg. Min kamp. Første bok utforsker det å vokse opp og være overgitt en verden som ser ut til å være komplett, avsluttet, lukket. Romanen beskriver det unge blikkets varhet og usikkerhet, der det registrerer andre menneskers tilstedeværelse og vurderinger med en åpenhet som er voldsom og nesten selvutslettende i sin konsekvens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I en borende prosa som oppsøker det sårbare, det pinlige og det eksistensielt betydningsbærende, blir dette en dypt personlig roman, selvutprøvende og kontroversiell. Et eksistensielt omdreiningspunkt er farens død, et annet er kanskje hovedpersonens debut som forfatter.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The outspoken actress, talk show host, and reality television star offers up a no-holds-barred memoir, including an eye-opening insider account of her tumultuous and heart-wrenching thirty-year-plus association with the Church of Scientology.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Leah Remini has never been the type to hold her tongue. That willingness to speak her mind, stand her ground, and rattle the occasional cage has enabled this tough-talking girl from Brooklyn to forge an enduring and successful career in Hollywood. But being a troublemaker has come at a cost.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That was never more evident than in 2013, when Remini loudly and publicly broke with the Church of Scientology. Now, in this frank, funny, poignant memoir, the former &lt;i&gt;King of Queens&lt;/i&gt; star opens up about that experience for the first time, revealing the in-depth details of her painful split with the church and its controversial practices.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Indoctrinated into the church as a child while living with her mother and sister in New York, Remini eventually moved to Los Angeles, where her dreams of becoming an actress and advancing Scientology's causes grew increasingly intertwined. As an adult, she found the success she'd worked so hard for, and with it a prominent place in the hierarchy of celebrity Scientologists alongside people such as Tom Cruise, Scientology's most high-profile adherent. Remini spent time directly with Cruise and was included among the guests at his 2006 wedding to Katie Holmes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when she began to raise questions about some of the church's actions, she found herself a target. In the end, she was declared by the church to be a threat to their organization and therefore a "Suppressive Person," and as a result, all of her fellow parishioners—including members of her own family—were told to disconnect from her. Forever.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bold, brash, and bravely confessional, &lt;i&gt;Troublemaker&lt;/i&gt; chronicles Leah Remini's remarkable journey toward emotional and spiritual freedom, both for herself and for her family. This is a memoir designed to reveal the hard-won truths of a life lived honestly—from an author unafraid of the consequences.</description>

  <description>"When Steve Lopez sees Nathaniel Ayers playing his heart out on a two-string violin on Los Angeles' Skid Row, he finds it impossible to walk away. At first, he is drawn by the opportunity to crank out another column for the Los Angeles Times, just one more item on an ever-growing to-do list: "Violin Man." But what Lopez begins to unearth about the mysterious street musician leaves an indelible impression." "More than thirty years earlier, Ayers had been a promising classical bass student at Juilliard - ambitious, charming, and one of the few African-Americans - until he gradually lost his ability to function, overcome by a mental breakdown. When Lopez finds him, Ayers is alone, suspicious of everyone, and deeply troubled, but glimmers of that brilliance are still there." From an impromptu concert of Beethoven's Eighth in the Second Street tunnel to a performance of Bach's Unaccompanied Cello Suites on Skid Row, the two men learn to communicate through Ayers's music. Lopez collects donated violins, a cello, even a stand-up bass and a piano with the hope that Ayers can be swayed to move off the streets, where every day his well-being is threatened. Their bond takes torturous turns as Lopez imagines he can change Ayers's life - finding him lodging, reconnecting him with his family, taking him to Disney Concert Hall to meet a former Juilliard classmate. For each triumph, there is a crashing disappointment, yet neither man gives up. And though it's Ayers he initially sets out to save, Lopez finds that his own life is profoundly changed. By turns gripping, moving, and inspiring, The Soloist is a story about unwavering commitment, artistic devotion, and the transformative magic ofmusic.</description>

  <description>Malcolm Polstead is the kind of boy who notices everything but is not much noticed himself. And so perhaps it was inevitable that he would become a spy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malcolm's father runs an inn called the Trout, on the banks of the river Thames, and all of Oxford passes through its doors. Malcolm and his dæmon, Asta, routinely overhear news and gossip, and the occasional scandal, but during a winter of unceasing rain, Malcolm catches wind of something new: intrigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He finds a secret message inquiring about a dangerous substance called Dust--and the spy it was intended for finds &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she asks Malcolm to keep his eyes open, Malcolm sees suspicious characters everywhere; Lord Asriel, clearly on the run; enforcement agents from the Magisterium; an Egyptian named Coram with warnings just for Malcolm; and a beautiful woman with an evil monkey for a dæmon. All are asking about the same thing: a girl--just a baby--named Lyra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lyra is the kind of person who draws people in like magnets. And Malcolm will brave any danger, and make shocking sacrifices, to bring her safely through the storm.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <description>A man-made plague has swept the earth, but a small group survives, along with the green-eyed Crakers – a gentle species bio-engineered to replace humans. Toby, onetime member of the Gods Gardeners and expert in mushrooms and bees, is still in love with street-smart Zeb, who has an interesting past. The Crakers’ reluctant prophet, Snowman-the-Jimmy, is hallucinating; Amanda is in shock from a Painballer attack; and Ivory Bill yearns for the provocative Swift Fox, who is flirting with Zeb. Meanwhile, giant Pigoons and malevolent Painballers threaten to attack. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told with wit, dizzying imagination, and dark humour, Booker Prize-winning Margaret Atwood’s unpredictable, chilling and hilarious MaddAddam takes us further into a challenging dystopian world and holds up a skewed mirror to our own possible future.</description>

  <description>Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills — and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit — he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br /&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br /&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/i&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

  <description>In fascinating detail, Sam Quinones chronicles how, over the past 15 years, enterprising sugar cane farmers in a small county on the west coast of Mexico created a unique distribution system that brought black tar heroin—the cheapest, most addictive form of the opiate, 2 to 3 times purer than its white powder cousin—to the veins of people across the United States. Communities where heroin had never been seen before—from Charlotte, NC and Huntington, WVA, to Salt Lake City and Portland, OR—were overrun with it. Local police and residents were stunned. How could heroin, long considered a drug found only in the dense, urban environments along the East Coast, and trafficked into the United States by enormous Colombian drug cartels, be so incredibly ubiquitous in the American heartland? Who was bringing it here, and perhaps more importantly, why were so many townspeople suddenly eager for the comparatively cheap high it offered?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the same dramatic drive of &lt;i&gt;El Narco&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Methland&lt;/i&gt;, Sam Quinones weaves together two classic tales of American capitalism: The stories of young men in Mexico, independent of the drug cartels, in search of their own American Dream via the fast and enormous profits of trafficking cheap black-tar heroin to America’s rural and suburban addicts; and that of Purdue Pharma in Stamford, Connecticut, determined to corner the market on pain with its new and expensive miracle drug, Oxycontin; extremely addictive in its own right. Quinones illuminates just how these two stories fit together as cause and effect: hooked on costly Oxycontin, American addicts were lured to much cheaper black tar heroin and its powerful and dangerous long-lasting high. Embroiled alongside the suppliers and buyers are DEA agents, local, small-town sheriffs, and the US attorney from eastern Virginia whose case against Purdue Pharma and Oxycontin made him an enemy of the Bush-era Justice Department, ultimately stalling and destroying his career in public service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dreamland&lt;/i&gt; is a scathing and incendiary account of drug culture and addiction spreading to every part of the American landscape.</description>

  <description>"Beam presents both a sharp critique of foster-care policies and a searching exploration of the meaning of family."--Publishers Weekly, starred review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who are the children of foster care? What, as a country, do we owe them? Cris Beam, a foster mother herself, spent five years immersed in the world of foster care, looking into these questions and tracing firsthand stories. The result is "To the End of June," an unforgettable portrait that takes us deep inside the lives of foster children at the critical points in their search for a stable, loving family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book mirrors the life cycle of a foster child and so begins with the removal of babies and kids from birth families. There's a teenage birth mother in Texas who signs away her parental rights on a napkin only to later reconsider, crushing the hopes of her baby's adoptive parents. Beam then paints an unprecedented portrait of the intricacies of growing up in the system--the back-and-forth with agencies, the shuffling between pre-adoptive homes and group homes, the emotionally charged tug of prospective adoptive parents and the fundamental pull of birth parents. And then what happens as these system-reared kids become adults? Beam closely follows a group of teenagers in New York who are grappling with what aging out will mean for them and meets a woman who has parented eleven kids from the system, almost all over the age of eighteen, and all still in desperate need of a sense of home and belonging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Focusing intensely on a few foster families who are deeply invested in the system's success, "To the End of June" is essential for humanizing and challenging a broken system, while at the same time it is a tribute to resiliency and offers hope for real change.</description>

  <description>Winner of the prestigious Loft-McKnight Fiction Award and the Anthony Award for Best First Novel, William Kent Krueger has established himself as a startlingly original voice in thriller fiction. With Purgatory Ridge he cements his standing as a suspense writer of the highest caliber. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not far from the small town of Aurora (population 3,752) lies an ancient two-hundred-acre expanse of great white pines, sacred to the Anishinaabe and known to them as Minishoomisag (Our Grandfathers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wealthy industrialist Karl Lindstrom does not have a reputation as a sensitive environmentalist, and some members of the Anishinaabe tribe are concerned about the proximity of the trees to his lumber mill. So when an explosion at the mill results in the death of a night watchman, it's obvious whom suspicion will fall upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cork O'Connor, in the throes of straightening out his life and repairing his marriage, is asked by his successor as sheriff to help with the investigation. His sense of community obliges him to accept, but Cork has distinctly mixed feelings about the case. For one thing, he is part Anishinaabe himself. For another, his lawyer wife, Jo, represents the tribe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, in a secluded house that overlooks the lakeside home of the Lindstrom family, a reclusive shipwreck survivor and his sidekick also seem to be harboring some resentment of their own against the industrialist. And it soon becomes clear to Cork that harmony, both at home and in the town, will be on the back burner for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Kent Krueger's precise and atmospheric prose, combined with his keen eye for the telling details of small-town life and his vivid sense of the land and seascapes of northern Minnesota, will impress and delight both his old fans and those discovering him for the first time.</description>

  <description>The Quetico-Superior Wilderness: more than two million acres of forest, white-water rapids, and uncharted islands on the Canadian/American border. Somewhere in the heart of this unforgiving territory, a young woman named Shiloh -- a country-western singer at the height of her fame -- has disappeared. Her father arrives in Aurora, Minnesota, to hire Cork O'Connor to find his daughter, and Cork joins a search party that includes an ex-con, two FBI agents, and a ten-year-old boy. Others are on her trail as well -- men hired not just to find her, but to kill her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the expedition ventures deeper into the wilderness, strangers descend on Aurora, threatening to spill blood on the town's snowy streets. Meanwhile, out on the Boundary Waters, winter falls hard. Cork's team of searchers loses contact with civilization, and like the brutal winds of a Minnesota blizzard, death -- violent and sudden -- stalks them.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;William Kent Krueger joined the ranks of today's best suspense novelists with this thrilling, universally acclaimed debut. Conjuring "a sense of place he's plainly honed firsthand in below-zero prairie" &lt;i&gt;(Kirkus Reviews),&lt;/i&gt; Krueger brilliantly evokes northern Minnesota's lake country -- and reveals the dark side of its snow-covered landscape.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part Irish, part Anishinaabe Indian, Corcoran "Cork" O'Connor is the former sheriff of Aurora, Minnesota. Embittered by his "former" status, and the marital meltdown that has separated him from his children, Cork gets by on heavy doses of caffeine, nicotine, and guilt. Once a cop on Chicago's South Side, there's not much that can shock him. But when the town's judge is brutally murdered, and a young Eagle Scout is reported missing, Cork takes on a mind-jolting case of conspiracy, corruption, and scandal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a lakeside blizzard buries Aurora, Cork must dig out the truth among town officials who seem dead-set on stopping his investigation in its tracks. But even Cork freezes up when faced with the harshest enemy of all: a small-town secret that hits painfully close to home.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"&lt;i&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/i&gt; set in a high school cheerleading squad...Tense, dark, and beautifully written." --Gillian Flynn, author of &lt;i&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Addy Hanlon has always been Beth Cassidy's best friend and trusted lieutenant. Beth calls the shots and Addy carries them out, a long-established order of things that has brought them to the pinnacle of their high-school careers. Now they're seniors who rule the intensely competitive cheer squad, feared and followed by the other girls -- until the young new coach arrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool and commanding, an emissary from the adult world just beyond their reach, Coach Colette French draws Addy and the other cheerleaders into her life. Only Beth, unsettled by the new regime, remains outside Coach's golden circle, waging a subtle but vicious campaign to regain her position as "top girl" -- both with the team and with Addy herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a suicide focuses a police investigation on Coach and her squad. After the first wave of shock and grief, Addy tries to uncover the truth behind the death -- and learns that the boundary between loyalty and love can be dangerous terrain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The raw passions of girlhood are brought to life in this taut, unflinching exploration of friendship, ambition, and power. Award-winning novelist Megan Abbott, writing with what Tom Perrotta has hailed as "total authority and an almost desperate intensity," provides a harrowing glimpse into the dark heart of the all-American girl.</description>

Her claim to fame is the envy of every freak on the outside: she’s the former lover of Ethan Wolfe, the killer who left more than a dozen dead women in his wake and nearly added Puget Sound State professor Sheila Tao to the tally. Now Abby, serving a nine-year sentence for slashing a police officer’s throat in a moment of rage, has little human contact—save for the letters that pour in from demented fans, lunatics, and creeps. But a new wave of murders has given Abby a possible chance for a plea bargain—because this killer has been sending her love letters, and carving a message on the bodies of the victims: Free Abby Maddox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry Isaac will never forget the attack—or his attacker. The hideous scarring and tortured speech are daily reminders that the one-time Seattle PD officer, now a private investigator, is just lucky to be alive. Abby Maddox deserves to rot in jail—forever, as far as Jerry’s concerned. But she alone may possess crucial evidence—letters from this newest killer—that could crack open the disturbing case. With the help of Professor Sheila Tao, seasoned police detective Mike Torrance, and intuitive criminology student Danny Mercy, Jerry must coax the shattering truth from isolated, dangerous Abby Maddox. Can he put the pieces together before Abby’s number one fan takes another life in the name of a killer’s perverted idea of justice?</description>

  <description>Pulsing with the dark obsession of Radiohead’s song “Creep,” this taut thriller—Jennifer Hillier’s superb debut—rockets from its seductive opening to a heartpounding climax not easily forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If he can’t have her . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Sheila Tao is a professor of psychology. An expert in human behavior. And when she began an affair with sexy, charming graduate student Ethan Wolfe, she knew she was playing with fire. Consumed by lust when they were together, riddled with guilt when they weren’t, she knows the three-month fling with her teaching assistant has to end. After all, she’s finally engaged to a kind and loving investment banker who adores her, and she’s taking control of her life. But when she attempts to end the affair, Ethan Wolfe won’t let her walk away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. . . no one else can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan has plans for Sheila, plans that involve posting a sex video that would surely get her fired and destroy her prestigious career. Plans to make her pay for rejecting him. And as she attempts to counter his every threatening move without her colleagues or her fiancé discovering her most intimate secrets, a shattering crime rocks Puget Sound State University: a female student, a star athlete, is found stabbed to death. Someone is raising the stakes of violence, sex, and blackmail . . . and before she knows it, Sheila is caught in a terrifying cat-and-mouse game with the lover she couldn’t resist—who is now the monster who won’t let her go.</description>

  <description>After a series of kidnappings and murders in Virginia Beach, newspaper reporter Catherine O'Rourke experiences disturbing dreams that detail each crime. In an effort to aid the investigation, she shares them with her confidential source—a detective working on the case. Catherine's intimate knowledge of the crimes immediately makes her a prime suspect. When scientific evidence corroborates her guilt, she's arrested and charged with murder. As she begins to doubt her own innocence, Catherine turns to Las Vegas lawyer Quinn Newberg, a high-priced specialist in the insanity defense. Quinn believes in justice, Vegas-style. But he doesn't believe in the supernatural, or that Catherine's dreams are anything other than the result of a fractured personality disorder. "Who can understand the human mind?" Quinn knows that insanity cases are unpredictable, but nothing had prepared him for "this!" To win, or even survive, Quinn will need more than his famed legal maneuvering and biting skepticism. On this case, he needs a miracle.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;An ax-wielding psychopath cares young Dora Suarez into pieces. On the same night in London, a firearm blows the top off the head of Felix Roatta, part-owner of the seedy Parallel Club. The unnamed narrator, a police sergeant, becomes fixated on Dora and is determined to solve her murder. Then a photo links Suarez to Roatta, and inquiries at the club reveal how vile and inhuman exploitation can become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derek Raymond&lt;/b&gt;’s real name was Robin Cook. He died in London in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>إن الاقتصاد حاليًّا في حالة يرثى لها، ووظيفتك في خطر، هذا إذا كان لا يزال لديك وظيفة من الأساس. هل أخبرك بشيء؟ لقد مللت من تكرار هذا الكلام منذ عدة سنوات.&lt;br /&gt;وقد تطلب الأمر حدوث انهيار اقتصادي عالمي حتى تدرك الغالبية صحة هذا الكلام، ولكنَّ هذا الكتاب لا يتناول كيفية تدهور الأوضاع الاقتصادية، ولا السبب في حدوث ذلك، وإنما يهتم بالكيفية التي تتحول بها مثل هذه الأخبار، لتبدو أخبارًا سارة جدًّا، لكن هذا لن يحدث إلا إذا كنت تعرف كيف تتعامل معها.&lt;br /&gt;لقد تعلمت شئون التجارة والأعمال على يد شخصين: أولهما والدي الذي تلقى مستوى جيدًا جدًّا من التعليم، وكان موظفًا حكوميًّا عالي المستوى، وثانيهما أفضل صديق لوالدي، الذي انقطع عن التعليم، عندما كان في الصف الثامن، ليصبح مليونيرًا عصاميًّا، وفي حين عانى والدي من المشكلات المالية طوال حياته، ومات وليس لديه إلا القليل جدًّا مما جناه في تلك السنوات الطويلة التي قضاها في العمل، أصبح صديق والدي المفضل أحد أغنى الرجال في هاواي.&lt;br /&gt;كنت أعد هذين الشخصين كأنهما "والدي الفقير " و "والدي الغني". كنت أحب والدي الحقيقي كثيرًا وكنت معجبًا به، وقررت أن أساعد أكبر عدد ممكن من الأشخاص ليتجنبوا المرور بتلك المعاناة من الإهانات والإخفاقات التي عاقت طريق والدي.&lt;br /&gt;بعد أن غادرت المنزل، خضت جميع أنواع التجارب، فخدمت في سلاح مشاة البحرية قائدًا لإحدى المروحيات في فيتنام، وتقدمت للعمل في شركة زيروكس، وبدأت العمل وكنت حينها أسوأ موظف مبيعات لديهم، ثم تركتهم بعد أربع سنوات، وأنا أفضل موظف مبيعات. وبعد الاستقالة من زيروكس، طورت عددًا من الشركات العالمية التي تفوق قيمتها المليون دولار، وأصبحت مستعدًّا للتقاعد في عمر الـ ٤٧ لمواصلة شغفي في تعليم الآخرين كيفية تكوين الثروة، وعيش الحياة التي يحلمون بها، بدلًا من الاستسلام للاستقالة الرتيبة والكئيبة.&lt;br /&gt;وفي عام ١٩٩٧، كتبتُ عن تجاربي وخبراتي في كتاب صغير، ولكن لابد أنني لمست وترًا حساسًا عند القليل من القراء على الأقل، حيث تصدَّر هذا الكتاب، وهو الأب الغني والأب الفقير* قائمة الكتب الأكثر مبيعًا وفقًا لجريدة نيويورك تايمز، وتربع على القمة لأكثر من أربع سنوات، ووُصف بأنه "كتاب الأعمال الأفضل مبيعًا على الإطلاق".&lt;br /&gt;ومنذ ذلك الحين، نشرت سلسلة كاملة من كتب Rich Dad، وعلى الرغم من أن كل كتاب من هذه السلسلة كان يركز على موضوع مختلف تمامًا، فإن جميعها تعرض الرسالة نفسها المتضمنة في الكتاب الأول، التي ستجدها في جوهر الكتاب الذي بين يديك:&lt;br /&gt;تولَّ مسئولية تدبير مواردك المالية، وإلا فلتعتد على تلقي الأوامر حتى نهاية حياتك؛ فإنك إما أن تتحكم في المال، أو تدعه يتحكم فيك. الأمر يرجع إلى اختيارك.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;لقد كنت محظوظًا في حياتي بشكل لا يصدق لحصولي على الخبرات والمعلمين الذين أوضحوا لي كيفية تكوين ثروة حقيقية. ونتيجة لذلك، صرت قادرًا على التخلي تمامًا عن أي احتياج إلى العمل. حتى هذا الوقت، كنت أعمل لبناء مستقبل لأسرتي، وأنا الآن أعمل لمساعدتك أنت على بناء مستقبلك.&lt;br /&gt;طوال السنوات العشر الماضية، كرست حياتي لإيجاد أكثر الطرق فاعلية وعملية لمساعدة الأشخاص على تحويل مسار حياتهم في القرن الحادي والعشرين عن طريق تعليمهم كيفية بناء ثروة حقيقية. ومن خلال سلسلة كتب Rich Dad، كتبت أنا وشركائي عن كثير من الأنواع والأنماط المختلفة للمشروعات والاستثمارات، ولكن خلال تلك السنوات من البحث المكثف، صادفت نموذج عمل على وجه التحديد، أعتقد أنه يحمل أروع أمل لأكبر عدد من الأشخاص ليتمكنوا من إحكام السيطرة على حياتهم المالية ومستقبلهم وأحلامهم.&lt;br /&gt;أود إخبارك بأمر آخر، عندما أقول ثروة حقيقية، فأنا لا أتحدث عن المال فحسب؛ لأن المال جزء من الثروة، ولكنه ليس هو الثروة بأكملها؛ حيث يدور بناء ثروة حقيقية حول الشخص الذي يبني، تمامًا كما يدور حول البناء نفسه.&lt;br /&gt;في هذا الكتاب، سأعرض لك لماذا تحتاج إلى تأسيس مشروع خاص بك، وسأوضح لك أيضًا نوع المشروع بالضبط. إن هذا الأمر لا يتعلق بتغيير نوع عملك فحسب، ولكنه يتعلق أيضًا بتغييرك أنت. أستطيع أن أخبرك بكيفية إيجاد ما تحتاج إليه لبناء مشروع ممتاز خاص بك. ولكن عليك أن تنمو أنت أيضًا؛ لتنمية مشروعك.&lt;br /&gt;أهلًا بك في عالم أعمال القرن الحادي والعشرين.</description>

  <description>In this valuable and revealing anthology, cultural critic and bestselling author Roxane Gay collects original and previously published pieces that address what it means to live in a world where women have to measure the harassment, violence, and aggression they face, and where they are “routinely second-guessed, blown off, discredited, denigrated, besmirched, belittled, patronized, mocked, shamed, gaslit, insulted, bullied” for speaking out. Contributions include essays from established and up-and-coming writers, performers, and critics, including actors Ally Sheedy and Gabrielle Union and writers Amy Jo Burns, Lyz Lenz, and Claire Schwartz. Covering a wide range of topics and experiences, from an exploration of the rape epidemic embedded in the refugee crisis to first-person accounts of child molestation, this collection is often deeply personal and is always unflinchingly honest. Like Rebecca Solnit’s &lt;em&gt;Men Explain Things to Me&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Not That Bad&lt;/em&gt; will resonate with every reader, saying “something in totality that we cannot say alone.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searing and heartbreakingly candid, this provocative collection both reflects the world we live in and offers a call to arms insisting that “not that bad” must no longer be good enough.</description>

  <description>Lisey Debusher Landon lost her husband, Scott, two years ago, after a twenty-five year marriage of the most profound and sometimes frightening intimacy. Scott was an award-winning, bestselling novelist and a very complicated man. Early in their relationship, before they married, Lisey had to learn from him about books and blood and bools. Later, she understood that there was a place Scott went--a place that both terrified and healed him, that could eat him alive or give him the ideas he needed in order to live. Now it's Lisey's turn to face Scott's demons, Lisey's turn to go to Boo'ya Moon. What begins as a widow's efforts to sort through the papers of her celebrated husband becomes a nearly fatal journey into the darkness he inhabited. Perhaps King's most personal and powerful novel, Lisey's Story is about the wellsprings of creativity, the temptations of madness, and the secret language of love. &lt;br /&gt;(front flap)</description>

  <description>It is winter in Area X, the mysterious wilderness that has defied explanation for thirty years, rebuffing expedition after expedition, refusing to reveal its secrets. As Area X expands, the agency tasked with investigating and overseeing it—the Southern Reach—has collapsed on itself in confusion. Now one last, desperate team crosses the border, determined to reach a remote island that may hold the answers they've been seeking. If they fail, the outer world is in peril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;Acceptance&lt;/em&gt; tunnels ever deeper into the circumstances surrounding the creation of Area X—what initiated this unnatural upheaval? Among the many who have tried, who has gotten close to understanding Area X—and who may have been corrupted by it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this last installment of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach trilogy, the mysteries of Area X may be solved, but their consequences and implications are no less profound—or terrifying.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The bone-chilling, hair-raising second installment of the Southern Reach Trilogy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After thirty years, the only human engagement with Area X—a seemingly malevolent landscape surrounded by an invisible border and mysteriously wiped clean of all signs of civilization—has been a series of expeditions overseen by a government agency so secret it has almost been forgotten: the Southern Reach. Following the tumultuous twelfth expedition chronicled in &lt;i&gt;Annihilation&lt;/i&gt;, the agency is in complete disarray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Rodríguez (aka "Control") is the Southern Reach's newly appointed head. Working with a distrustful but desperate team, a series of frustrating interrogations, a cache of hidden notes, and hours of profoundly troubling video footage, Control begins to penetrate the secrets of Area X. But with each discovery he must confront disturbing truths about himself and the agency he's pledged to serve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Authority&lt;/i&gt;, the second volume of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach trilogy, Area X's most disturbing questions are answered . . . but the answers are far from reassuring.</description>

In Getting Things Done, veteran coach and management consultant David Allen shares the breakthrough methods for stress-free performance that he has introduced to tens of thousands of people across the country.

  <description>In the summer of 1969, Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel carried out horrific acts of butchery on the orders of the charismatic cult leader Charles Manson. At their murder trial the following year, lead prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi described the two so-called Manson Women as "human monsters." But to anyone who knew them growing up, they were bright, promising girls, seemingly incapable of such an unfathomable crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Award-winning journalist Nikki Meredith began visiting Van Houten and Krenwinkel in prison to discover how they had changed during their incarceration. The more Meredith got to know them, the more she was lured into a deeper dilemma: What compels "normal" people to do unspeakable things?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author's relationship with her subjects provides a chilling lens through which we gain insight into a particular kind of woman capable of a particular kind of brutality. Through their stories, Nikki Meredith takes readers on a dark journey into the very heart of evil.</description>

  <description>A moving, funny, and unforgettable memoir of homeless life in New York&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past sixteen years, Cadillac Man has lived on the streets of New York City. Over those years, he has recorded the facts of his daily life, writing hundreds of thousands of words in a series of spiral-bound notebooks. &lt;i&gt;Cadillac Man: My Life on the Streets&lt;/i&gt; distills those journals into a memoir of homeless life, full of indelible characters and packed with gripping stories. In a gritty, poignant, and funny voice, Cadillac narrates his descent into homelessness, the struggles and unexpected freedoms of his life, and the story of his love affair with a young runaway, whom he eventually (and tragically) reunites with her family. The United States has seven hundred thousand homeless people; ultimately, Cadillac's story is their story.</description>

  <description>Inspired by the website that the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; hailed as "redefining mourning," this book is a fresh and irreverent examination into navigating grief and resilience in the age of social media, offering comfort and community for coping with the mess of loss through candid original essays from a variety of voices, accompanied by gorgeous two-color illustrations and wry infographics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a time when we mourn public figures and national tragedies with hashtags, where intimate posts about loss go viral and we receive automated birthday reminders for dead friends, it’s clear we are navigating new terrain without a road map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s face it: most of us have always had a difficult time talking about death and sharing our grief. We’re awkward and uncertain; we avoid, ignore, or even deny feelings of sadness; we offer platitudes; we send sympathy bouquets whittled out of fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Rebecca Soffer and Gabrielle Birkner, who can help us do better. Each having lost parents as young adults, they co-founded Modern Loss, responding to a need to change the dialogue around the messy experience of grief. Now, in this wise and often funny book, they offer the insights of the Modern Loss community to help us cry, laugh, grieve, identify, and—above all—empathize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soffer and Birkner, along with forty guest contributors including Lucy Kalanithi, singer Amanda Palmer, and CNN’s Brian Stelter, reveal their own stories on a wide range of topics including triggers, sex, secrets, and inheritance. Accompanied by beautiful hand-drawn illustrations and witty "how to" cartoons, each contribution provides a unique perspective on loss as well as a remarkable life-affirming message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brutally honest and inspiring, &lt;em&gt;Modern Loss&lt;/em&gt; invites us to talk intimately and humorously about grief, helping us confront the humanity (and mortality) we all share. Beginners welcome.</description>

  <description>Shep Knacker has long saved for "the Afterlife," an idyllic retreat in the Third World where his nest egg can last forever. Exasperated that his wife, Glynis, has concocted endless excuses why it's never the right time to go, Shep finally announces he's leaving for a Tanzanian island, with or without her. Yet Glynis has some news of her own: she's deathly ill. Shep numbly puts his dream aside, while his nest egg is steadily devastated by staggering bills that their health insurance only partially covers. Astonishingly, illness not only strains their marriage but saves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From acclaimed New York Times bestselling author Lionel Shriver comes a searing, ruthlessly honest novel. Brimming with unexpected tenderness and dry humor, it presses the question: How much is one life worth?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An exposé of Alcoholics Anonymous, twelve-step programs, and the growing for-profit rehab industry and how a failed addiction-treatment model came to dominate America&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; AA has become so infused in our society that it has become practically synonymous with addiction recovery.  Yet, there exists very little empirical data proving that AA and other 12-step programs are effective in helping addicts heal. Despite reports claiming that AA only has a 5–10 percent success rate, countless doctors, judges, and employers continue to refer their addicted patients for treatments based on the 12-step model, rehabilitation facilities center their programs around this model, and many addicts themselves are simply unaware of any other options available to them. This book gives a well-reasoned rebuke to the notion that AA is for everyone, an idea that no other field of medicine would entertain. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Armed with rigorous analysis, cutting-edge research, and convincing case studies, Dr. Dodes builds a powerful and compelling case against the monopoly of the 12-step program. He suggests treatment that takes a multifaceted approach to every patient, acknowledging personal history, psychological and physical health, and the unique road that leads an individual to addiction. &lt;i&gt;The Sober Truth&lt;/i&gt; offers actionable information for addicts, their families, and medical providers seeking a more intelligent, effective, and compassionate approach to understand and treat addiction.</description>

  <description>When an eleven-year-old boy is found murdered in a town park, reliable eyewitnesses undeniably point to the town's popular Little League coach, Terry Maitland, as the culprit. DNA evidence and fingerprints confirm the crime was committed by this well-loved family man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrified by the brutal killing, Detective Ralph Anderson, whose own son was once coached by Maitland, orders the suspect to be arrested in a public spectacle. But Maitland has an alibi. And further research confirms he was indeed out of town that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Anderson and the District Attorney trace the clues, the investigation expands from Ohio to Texas. And as horrifying answers begin to emerge, so King's propulsive story of almost unbearable suspense kicks into high gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry Maitland seems like a nice guy but there is one rock-hard fact, as unassailable as gravity: a man cannot be in two places at the same time. Can he?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; culture reporter Dave Itzkoff, the definitive biography of Robin Williams – a compelling portrait of one of America’s most beloved and misunderstood entertainers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From his rapid-fire stand-up comedy riffs to his breakout role in &lt;i&gt;Mork &amp;amp; Mindy&lt;/i&gt; and his Academy Award-winning performance in &lt;i&gt;Good Will Hunting&lt;/i&gt;, Robin Williams was a singularly innovative and beloved entertainer. He often came across as a man possessed, holding forth on culture and politics while mixing in personal revelations – all with mercurial, tongue-twisting intensity as he inhabited and shed one character after another with lightning speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Dave Itzkoff shows in this revelatory biography, Williams’s comic brilliance masked a deep well of conflicting emotions and self-doubt, which he drew upon in his comedy and in celebrated films like &lt;i&gt;Dead Poets Society; Good Morning, Vietnam; The Fisher King; Aladdin&lt;/i&gt;; and &lt;i&gt;Mrs. Doubtfire&lt;/i&gt;, where he showcased his limitless gift for improvisation to bring to life a wide range of characters. And in &lt;i&gt;Good Will Hunting&lt;/i&gt; he gave an intense and controlled performance that revealed the true range of his talent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Itzkoff also shows how Williams struggled mightily with addiction and depression – topics he discussed openly while performing and during interviews – and with a debilitating condition at the end of his life that affected him in ways his fans never knew. Drawing on more than a hundred original interviews with family, friends, and colleagues, as well as extensive archival research, &lt;i&gt;Robin&lt;/i&gt; is a fresh and original look at a man whose work touched so many lives.</description>

  <description>Milk and honey' is a collection of poetry and prose about survival. About the experience of violence, abuse, love, loss, and femininity. It is split into four chapters, and each chapter serves a different purpose. Deals with a different pain. Heals a different heartache. 'milk and honey' takes readers through a journey of the most bitter moments in life and finds sweetness in them because there is sweetness everywhere if you are just willing to look.</description>

  <description>"&lt;i&gt;Price is the greatest writer of dialogue, living or dead, this country has ever produced. Wry, profane, hilarious, and tragic, sometimes in a single line,&lt;/i&gt; Lush Life &lt;i&gt;is his masterwork. I doubt anyone will write a novel this good for a long, long time.&lt;/i&gt;" — Dennis Lehane&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;i&gt;So, what do you do?&lt;/i&gt;" &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever people asked him, Eric Cash used to have a dozen answers. Artist, actor, screenwriter… But now he's thirty-five years old and he's still living on the Lower East Side, still in the restaurant business, still serving the people he wanted to be. What does Eric do? He manages. Not like Ike Marcus. Ike was young, good-looking, people liked him. Ask him what he did, he wouldn't say tending bar. He was going places--until two street kids stepped up to him and Eric one night and pulled a gun. At least, that's Eric's version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Lush Life,&lt;/i&gt; Richard Price tears the shiny veneer off the 'new' New York to show us the hidden cracks, the underground networks of control and violence beneath the glamour. &lt;i&gt;Lush Life&lt;/i&gt; is an X-ray of the street in the age of no broken windows and "quality of life" squads, from a writer whose "&lt;i&gt;tough, gritty brand of social realism…reads like a movie in prose.&lt;/i&gt;" — Michiko Kakutani, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>THE PAST... Caught behind the lines of Hitler’s Final Solution, Saul Laski is one of the multitudes destined to die in the notorious Chelmno extermination camp. Until he rises to meet his fate and finds himself face to face with an evil far older, and far greater, than the Nazi’s themselves...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PRESENT... Compelled by the encounter to survive at all costs, so begins a journey that for Saul will span decades and cross continents, plunging into the darkest corners of 20th century history to reveal a secret society of beings who may often exist behind the world's most horrible and violent events. Killing from a distance, and by darkly manipulative proxy, they are people with the psychic ability to 'use' humans: read their minds, subjugate them to their wills, experience through their senses, feed off their emotions, force them to acts of unspeakable aggression. Each year, three of the most powerful of this hidden order meet to discuss their ongoing campaign of induced bloodshed and deliberate destruction. But this reunion, something will go terribly wrong. Saul’s quest is about to reach its elusive object, drawing hunter and hunted alike into a struggle that will plumb the depths of mankind’s attraction to violence, and determine the future of the world itself...</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;102 Minutes: The Untold Story of the Fight to Survive Inside the Twin Towers&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; writers Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn vividly recreate the 102-minute span between the moment Flight 11 hit the first Twin Tower on the morning of September 11, 2001, and the moment the second tower collapsed, all from the perspective of those inside the buildings--the 12,000 who escaped, and the 2,749 who did not. It's becoming easier, years later, to forget the profound, visceral responses the Trade Center attacks evoked in the days and weeks following September 11. Using hundreds of interviews, countless transcripts of radio and phone communications, and exhaustive research, Dwyer and Flynn bring that flood of responses back--from heartbreak to bewilderment to fury. The randomness of death and survival is heartbreaking. One man, in the second tower, survived because he bolted from his desk the moment he heard the first plane hit; another, who stayed at his desk on the 97th floor, called his wife in his final moments to tell her to cancel a surprise trip he had planned. In many cases, the deaths of those who survived the initial attacks but were killed by the collapse of the towers were tragically avoidable. Building code exemptions, communication breakdowns between firefighters and police, and policies put in place by building management to keep everyone inside the towers in emergencies led, the authors argue, to the deaths of hundreds who might otherwise have survived. September 11 is by now both familiar and nearly mythological. Dwyer and Flynn's accomplishment is recounting that day's events in a style that is stirring, thorough, and refreshingly understated. &lt;i&gt;--Erica C. Barnett&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The year is 1984 and the city is Tokyo.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young woman named Aomame follows a taxi driver’s enigmatic suggestion and begins to notice puzzling discrepancies in the world around her. She has entered, she realizes, a parallel existence, which she calls 1Q84 —“Q is for ‘question mark.’ A world that bears a question.” Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named Tengo takes on a suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Aomame’s and Tengo’s narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A love story, a mystery, a fantasy, a novel of self-discovery, a dystopia to rival George Orwell’s — &lt;i&gt;1Q84&lt;/i&gt; is Haruki Murakami’s most ambitious undertaking yet: an instant best seller in his native Japan, and a tremendous feat of imagination from one of our most revered contemporary writers.</description>

  <description>First published in 1955, &lt;i&gt;A Night to Remember&lt;/i&gt; remains a completely riveting account of the &lt;i&gt;Titanic&lt;/i&gt;'s fatal collision and the behavior of the passengers and crew, both noble and ignominious. Some sacrificed their lives, while others fought like animals for their own survival. Wives beseeched husbands to join them in lifeboats; gentlemen went taut-lipped to their deaths in full evening dress; and hundreds of steerage passengers, trapped below decks, sought help in vain. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Prepare for a different kind of singularity in this follow-up to the Hugo-nominated novel Blindsight &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the eve of the twenty-second century: a world where the dearly departed send postcards back from Heaven and evangelicals make scientific breakthroughs by speaking in tongues; where genetically engineered vampires solve problems intractable to baseline humans and soldiers come with zombie switches that shut off self-awareness during combat. And it’s all under surveillance by an alien presence that refuses to show itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel Bruks is a living fossil: a field biologist in a world where biology has turned computational, a cat's-paw used by terrorists to kill thousands. Taking refuge in the Oregon desert, he’s turned his back on a humanity that shatters into strange new subspecies with every heartbeat. But he awakens one night to find himself at the center of a storm that will turn all of history inside-out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he’s trapped on a ship bound for the center of the solar system. To his left is a grief-stricken soldier, obsessed by whispered messages from a dead son. To his right is a pilot who hasn’t yet found the man she's sworn to kill on sight. A vampire and its entourage of zombie bodyguards lurk in the shadows behind. And dead ahead, a handful of rapture-stricken monks takes them all to a meeting with something they will only call “The Angels of the Asteroids.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their pilgrimage brings Dan Bruks, the fossil man, face-to-face with the biggest evolutionary breakpoint since the origin of thought itself.</description>

  <description>It's been two months since a myriad of alien objects clenched about the Earth, screaming as they burned. The heavens have been silent since - until a derelict space probe hears whispers from a distant comet. Something talks out there: but not to us. Who to send to meet the alien, when the alien doesn't want to meet? Send a linguist with multiple-personality disorder, and a biologist so spliced to machinery he can't feel his own flesh. Send a pacifist warrior, and a vampire recalled from the grave by the voodoo of paleogenetics. Send a man with half his mind gone since childhood. Send them to the edge of the solar system, praying you can trust such freaks and monsters with the fate of a world. You fear they may be more alien than the thing they've been sent to find - but you'd give anything for that to be true, if you knew what was waiting for them.</description>

  <description>A devastating novel of desperation and revenge from one of today's most compelling new voices in fiction. In this follow-up to her heartbreaking debut, &lt;i&gt;Such a Pretty Girl&lt;/i&gt;, Laura Wiess once again spins a shattering tale of the tragedies that befall young women who are considered society's &lt;i&gt;Leftovers&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blair and Ardith are best friends who have committed an unforgivable act in the name of love and justice. But in order to understand what could drive two young women to such extreme measures, first you'll have to understand why. You'll have to listen as they describe parents who are alternately absent and smothering, classmates who mock and shun anyone different, and young men who are allowed to hurt and dominate without consequence. You will have to learn what it's like to be a teenage girl who locks her bedroom door at night, who has been written off by the adults around her as damaged goods. A girl who has no one to trust except the one person she's forbidden to see. You'll have to understand what it's really like to be forgotten and abandoned in America today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you ready?</description>

  <description>Stephen King returns to the rich landscape of Mid-World, the spectacular territory of the Dark Tower fantasy saga that stands as his most beguiling achievement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roland Deschain and his ka-tet&lt;i&gt;—&lt;/i&gt;Jake, Susannah, Eddie, and Oy, the billy-bumbler—encounter a ferocious storm just after crossing the River Whye on their way to the Outer Baronies. As they shelter from the howling gale, Roland tells his friends not just one strange story but two . . . and in so doing, casts new light on his own troubled past. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his early days as a gunslinger, in the guilt-ridden year following his mother’s death, Roland is sent by his father to investigate evidence of a murderous shape-shifter, a “skin-man” preying upon the population around Debaria. Roland takes charge of Bill Streeter, the brave but terrified boy who is the sole surviving witness to the beast’s most recent slaughter. Only a teenager himself, Roland calms the boy and prepares him for the following day’s trials by reciting a story from the &lt;i&gt;Magic Tales of the Eld &lt;/i&gt;that his mother often read to him at bedtime. “A person’s never too old for stories,” Roland says to Bill. “Man and boy, girl and woman, never too old. We live for them.” And indeed, the tale that Roland unfolds, the legend of Tim Stoutheart, is a timeless treasure for all ages, a story that lives for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King began the Dark Tower series in 1974; it gained momentum in the 1980s; and he brought it to a thrilling conclusion when the last three novels were published in 2003 and 2004. &lt;i&gt;The Wind Through the Keyhole &lt;/i&gt;is sure to fascinate avid fans of the Dark Tower epic. But this novel also stands on its own for all readers, an enchanting and haunting journey to Roland’s world and testimony to the power of Stephen King’s storytelling magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~from first edition jacket</description>

  <description>Stephen King returns to the characters and territory of one of his most popular novels ever, The Shining, in this instantly riveting novel about the now middle-aged Dan Torrance (the boy protagonist of The Shining) and the very special 12-year-old girl he must save from a tribe of murderous paranormals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On highways across America, a tribe of people called The True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmless - mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky 12-year-old Abra Stone learns, The True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the "steam" that children with the "shining" produce when they are slowly tortured to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father's legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant "shining" power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes "Doctor Sleep."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan's own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra's soul and survival. This is an epic war between good and evil, a gory, glorious story that will thrill the millions of hyper-devoted fans of The Shining and wildly satisfy anyone new to the territory of this icon in the King canon.</description>

  <description>#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller! In a high-suspense race against time, three of the most unlikely heroes Stephen King has ever created try to stop a lone killer from blowing up thousands. “&lt;i&gt;Mr. Mercedes&lt;/i&gt; is a rich, resonant, exceptionally readable accomplishment by a man who can write in whatever genre he chooses” (&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the frigid pre-dawn hours, in a distressed Midwestern city, desperate unemployed folks are lined up for a spot at a job fair. Without warning, a lone driver plows through the crowd in a stolen Mercedes, running over the innocent, backing up, and charging again. Eight people are killed; fifteen are wounded. The killer escapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In another part of town, months later, a retired cop named Bill Hodges is still haunted by the unsolved crime. When he gets a crazed letter from someone who self-identifies as the “perk” and threatens an even more diabolical attack, Hodges wakes up from his depressed and vacant retirement, hell-bent on preventing another tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Brady Hartsfield lives with his alcoholic mother in the house where he was born. He loved the feel of death under the wheels of the Mercedes, and he wants that rush again. Only Bill Hodges, with two new, unusual allies, can apprehend the killer before he strikes again. And they have no time to lose, because Brady’s next mission, if it succeeds, will kill or maim thousands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mr. Mercedes&lt;/i&gt; is a war between good and evil, from the master of suspense whose insight into the mind of this obsessed, insane killer is chilling and unforgettable. &lt;b&gt;Now an AT&amp;amp;T Audience Original Series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; WINNER OF THE EDGAR AWARD FOR BEST NOVEL&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The road in front of Dr. Louis Creed's rural Maine home frequently claims the lives of neighborhood pets. Louis has recently moved from Chicago to Ludlow with his wife Rachel, their children and pet cat. Near their house, local children have created a cemetery for the dogs and cats killed by the steady stream of transports on the busy highway. Deeper in the woods lies another graveyard, an ancient Indian burial ground whose sinister properties Louis discovers when the family cat is killed.&lt;br /&gt;source: stephenking.com</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Dark and shocking psychological suspense about a man at war with himself. This is a skillful and assured debut about a deeply unsettling subject.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan has returned from prison to his largely deserted, run-down neighborhood. He has returned to his mother, to his dog, to filling the hot days with walks on the dunes and caring for the fish he keeps in an aquarium in his bedroom - struggling, like him, to survive the oppressive summer heat. But there is a young girl with a chipped front tooth living next door, and feelings he thought forgotten are coming back to Jonathan. His growing obsession with Elke threatens to overwhelm his whole life, as well as hers, but he is determined to make the most of this second chance he has been given. He is determined not to let it happen again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tench&lt;/i&gt; is criminal psychologist Inge Schilperoord's daring first novel: unnerving, morally complicated and utterly gripping, it moves brilliantly through true darkness.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Introducing a dazzling new literary voice--a wholly original novel as groundbreaking as the works of Eimear McBride and Max Porter.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something has happened to Peach. Staggering around the town streets in the aftermath of an assault, Peach feels a trickle of blood down her legs, a lingering smell of her anonymous attacker on her skin. It hurts to walk, but she manages to make her way to her home, where she stumbles into another oddly nightmarish reality: Her parents can't seem to comprehend that anything has happened to their daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, Peach tries to return to the routines of her ordinary life, going to classes, spending time with her boyfriend, Green, trying to find comfort in the thought of her upcoming departure for college. And yet, as Peach struggles through the next few days, she is stalked by the memories of her unacknowledged trauma. Sleeping is hard when she is haunted by the glimpses of that stranger's gaping mouth. Working is hard when her assailant's rancid smell still fills her nostrils. Eating is impossible when her stomach is swollen tight as a drum. Though she tries to close her eyes to what has happened, Peach at last begins to understand the drastic, gruesome action she must take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this astonishing debut, Emma Glass articulates the unspeakable with breathtaking verve. Intensely physical, with rhythmic, visceral prose, &lt;i&gt;Peach&lt;/i&gt; marks the arrival of a visionary new voice.</description>

  <description>What triggers fascination, and how do companies, people, and ideas put those triggers to use?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why are you captivated by some people but not by others? Why do you recall some brands yet forget the rest? In a distracted, overcrowded world, how do certain leaders, friends, and family members convince you to change your behavior? Fascination: the most powerful way to influence decision making. It's more persuasive than marketing, advertising, or any other form of communication. And it all starts with seven universal triggers: lust, mystique, alarm, prestige, power, vice, and trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fascination plays a role in every type of decision making, from the brands you choose to the songs you remember, from the person you marry to the employees you hire. And by activating the right triggers, you can make anything become fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To explore and explain fascination's irresistible influence, Sally Hogshead looks beyond marketing, delving into behavioral and social studies, historical precedents, neurobiology and evolutionary anthropology, as well as conducting in-depth interviews and a national study of a thousand consumers, to emerge with deeply rooted patterns for why, and how, we become captivated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hogshead reveals why the Salem witch trials began with the same fixations as those in "Sex and the City." How Olympic athletes are subject to obsessions similar to those of fetishists. How a 1636 frenzy over Dutch tulip bulbs perfectly mirrors the 2006 real estate bubble. And why a billion-dollar "Just Say No" program actually increased drug use among teens, by activating the same "forbidden fruit" syndrome as a Victoria's Secret catalog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you realize it or not, you're already using the seven triggers. The question is, are you using the right triggers, in the right way, to get your desired result? This book will show you.</description>

  <description>A Magical Key to Unlock Your Creative Wizard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you writing a novel, but having trouble getting your first draft written? You’ve heard of “outlining,” but that sounds too rigid for you. You’ve heard of “organic writing,” but that seems a bit squishy to you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a look at the wildly popular Snowflake Method—a battle-tested series of ten steps that jump-start your creativity and help you quickly map out your story. All around the world, novelists are using the Snowflake Method right now to ignite their imaginations and get their first drafts down on paper. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book, you’ll follow the story of a fictitious novelist as she learns to tap into the amazing power of the Snowflake Method. Almost magically, she finds her story growing from a simple idea into a deep and powerful novel. And she finds her novel changing her—turning her into a stronger, more courageous person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zany, Over the Top, and Just Plain Fun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method is a “business parable”—a how-to guide written in story form. It’s zany. It’s over the top. It’s just plain fun. Most important, it’s effective, because it shows you, rather than telling you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’ll learn by example how to grow your story idea into a sizzling first draft. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’ll discover:&lt;br /&gt;* How to define your “target audience” the right way, so you know exactly how your ideal readers think and feel. Forget what the experts tell you about “demographics.”&lt;br /&gt;* How to create a dynamite selling tool that will instantly tell people whether they’ll love your story or hate it. And you want them to either love it or hate it.&lt;br /&gt;* How to get inside the skin of every one of your characters—even your villain. Especially your villain.&lt;br /&gt;* How to find a deep, emotively powerful theme for your story. Do you know the one best point in your novel to unveil your theme—when your reader is most eager to hear it?&lt;br /&gt;* How to know when to backtrack, and why backtracking is essential to writing great fiction.&lt;br /&gt;* How to fire-test each scene to guarantee it’ll be high-impact—before you write it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excerpt from Chapter 1:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goldilocks had always wanted to write a novel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She learned to read before she went to kindergarten. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In grade school, she always had her nose in a book. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In junior high, the other kids thought she was weird, because she actually liked reading those dusty old novels in literature class. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All through high school, Goldilocks dreamed of writing a book of her own someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she went to college, her parents persuaded her to study something practical. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goldilocks hated practical, and secretly she kept reading novels. But she was a very obedient girl, so she did what her parents told her. She got a very practical degree in marketing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After college, she got a job that bored her to tears—but at least it was practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she got married, and within a few years, she had two children, a girl and then a boy. She quit her job to devote full time to them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the children grew, Goldilocks took great joy in introducing them to the stories she had loved as a child. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her son went off to kindergarten, Goldilocks thought about looking for a job. But her resume now had a seven-year hole in it, and her practical skills were long out of date. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only jobs Goldilocks could qualify for were minimum wage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She suddenly realized that being practical had made her horribly unhappy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a whim, Goldilocks decided to do the one thing she had always wanted more than anything else—she was finally going to write a novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn’t care if it was impractical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn’t care if nobody would ever read her novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was going to do it just because she wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in years, she was going to do something just for herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And nobody was going to stop her.</description>

  <description>No other writer can blend the science of the brain with the love of language like Diane Ackerman. In this extraordinary memoir, she opens a window into the experience of wordlessness—the language paralysis called aphasia. In narrating the recovery of her husband, Paul West, from a stroke that reduced his vast vocabulary to a single syllable, she evokes the joy and mystery of the brain’s ability to find and connect words. Deeply rewarding to readers of all kinds, Ackerman has given us a literary love story, accessible insight into the science and medicine of brain injury,&lt;br /&gt;and invaluable spiritual sustenance in the face of life’s myriad&lt;br /&gt;physical sufferings.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For any woman who has experienced illness, chronic pain, or endometriosis comes an inspiring memoir advocating for recognition of women's health issues&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In the fall of 2010, Abby Norman's strong dancer's body dropped forty pounds and gray hairs began to sprout from her temples. She was repeatedly hospitalized in excruciating pain, but the doctors insisted it was a urinary tract infection and sent her home with antibiotics. Unable to get out of bed, much less attend class, Norman dropped out of college and embarked on what would become a years-long journey to discover what was wrong with her. It wasn't until she took matters into her own hands--securing a job in a hospital and educating herself over lunchtime reading in the medical library--that she found an accurate diagnosis of endometriosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Ask Me About My Uterus&lt;/i&gt;, Norman describes what it was like to have her pain dismissed, to be told it was all in her head, only to be taken seriously when she was accompanied by a boyfriend who confirmed that her sexual performance was, indeed, compromised. Putting her own trials into a broader historical, sociocultural, and political context, Norman shows that women's bodies have long been the battleground of a never-ending war for power, control, medical knowledge, and truth. It's time to refute the belief that being a woman is a preexisting condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The space between life and death is a moment.&lt;br /&gt;But it will remain alive in me for hundreds of thousands of future moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One phone call. That's all it took to change Stephanie Wittels Wachs' life forever..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her younger brother Harris, a star in the comedy world known for his work on shows like Parks and Recreation, had died of a heroin overdose. How do you make sense of such a tragic end to a life of so much hilarious brilliance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In beautiful, unsentimental, and surprisingly funny prose, Stephanie Wittels Wachs alternates between her brother's struggle with addiction, which she learned about three days before her wedding, and the first year after his death, in all its emotional devastation. This compelling portrait of a comedic genius and a profound exploration of the love between siblings is A Year of Magical Thinking for a new generation of readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A heartbreaking but hopeful memoir of addiction, grief, and family, Everything is Horrible and Wonderful will make you laugh, cry, and wonder if that possum on the fence is really your brother's spirit animal.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The story of a young man fighting to recover from a devastating psychotic break and the mother who refuses to give up on him &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zack McDermott, a 26-year-old Brooklyn public defender, woke up one morning convinced he was being filmed, &lt;i&gt;Truman Show-&lt;/i&gt;style, as part of an audition for a TV pilot. Every passerby was an actor; every car would magically stop for him; everything he saw was a cue from "The Producer" to help inspire the performance of a lifetime. After a manic spree around Manhattan, Zack, who is bipolar, was arrested on a subway platform and admitted to Bellevue Hospital. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins the story of Zack's freefall into psychosis and his desperate, poignant, often darkly funny struggle to claw his way back to sanity. It's a journey that will take him from New York City back to his Kansas roots and to the one person who might be able to save him, his tough, big-hearted Midwestern mother, nicknamed the Bird, whose fierce and steadfast love is the light in Zack's dark world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before his odyssey is over, Zack will be tackled by guards in mental wards, run naked through cornfields, receive secret messages from the TV, befriend a former Navy Seal and his talking stuffed monkey, and see the Virgin Mary in the whorls of his own back hair. But with the Bird's help, he just might have a shot at pulling through, starting over, and maybe even meeting a woman who can love him back, bipolar and all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with raw emotional power, humor, and tenderness, GORILLA AND THE BIRD is a bravely honest account of a young man's unraveling and the relationship that saves him.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Although his career as a bestselling author and on &lt;i&gt;The Daily Show With Jon Stewart&lt;/i&gt; was founded on fake news and invented facts, in 2016 that routine didn't seem as funny to John Hodgman anymore. Everyone is doing it now. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disarmed of falsehood, he was left only with the awful truth: John Hodgman is an older white male monster with bad facial hair, wandering like a privileged Sasquatch through three wildernesses: the hills of Western Massachusetts where he spent much of his youth; the painful beaches of Maine that want to kill him (and some day will); and the metaphoric haunted forest of middle age that connects them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vacationland &lt;/i&gt;collects these real life wanderings, and through them you learn of the horror of freshwater clams, the evolutionary purpose of the mustache, and which animals to keep as pets and which to kill with traps and poison. There is also some advice on how to react when the people of coastal Maine try to sacrifice you to their strange god.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though wildly, Hodgmaniacally funny as usual, it is also a poignant and sincere account of one human facing his forties, those years when men in particular must stop pretending to be the children of bright potential they were and settle into the failing bodies of the wiser, weird dads that they are.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A chilling literary horror novel about a young couple who purchase and live in a haunted house. Jac Jemc’s &lt;i&gt;The Grip of It&lt;/i&gt; tells the eerie story of a young couple haunted by their new home. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julie and James settle into a house in a small town outside the city where they met. The move—prompted by James’s penchant for gambling, his inability to keep his impulses in check—is quick and seamless; both Julie and James are happy to leave behind their usual haunts and start afresh. But this house, which sits between ocean and forest, has plans for the unsuspecting couple. As Julie and James try to settle into their home and their relationship, the house and its surrounding terrain become the locus of increasingly strange happenings. The architecture—claustrophobic, riddled with hidden rooms within rooms—becomes unrecognizable, decaying before their eyes. Stains are animated on the wall—contracting, expanding—and map themselves onto Julie’s body in the form of bruises; mold spores taint the water that James pours from the sink. Together the couple embark on a panicked search for the source of their mutual torment, a journey that mires them in the history of their peculiar neighbors and the mysterious residents who lived in the house before Julia and James.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in creepy, potent prose, &lt;i&gt;The Grip of It&lt;/i&gt; is an enthralling, psychologically intense novel that deals in questions of home: how we make it and how it in turn makes us, mapping itself onto bodies and the relationships we cherish.</description>

  <description>In this new approach to understanding the impact of grief, Susan A. Berger goes beyond the commonly held theories of stages of grief with a new typology for self-awareness and personal growth&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;She offers practical advice for healing from a major loss in this presentation of five basic ways, or types, of grieving. These five types describe how different people respond to a major loss. The types are: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   •  &lt;i&gt;Nomads&lt;/i&gt;, who have not yet resolved their grief and don’t often understand how their loss has affected their lives &lt;br /&gt;   •  &lt;i&gt;Memorialists&lt;/i&gt;, who are committed to preserving the memory of their loved ones by creating concrete memorials and rituals to honor them &lt;br /&gt;   •  &lt;i&gt;Normalizers&lt;/i&gt;, who are committed to re-creating a sense of family and community &lt;br /&gt;   •  &lt;i&gt;Activists&lt;/i&gt;, who focus on helping other people who are dealing with the same disease or issues that caused their loved one’s death &lt;br /&gt;   •  &lt;i&gt;Seekers&lt;/i&gt;, who adopt religious, philosophical, or spiritual beliefs to create meaning in their lives &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on research results and anecdotes from working with the bereaved over the past ten years, Berger examines how a person’s worldview is affected after a major loss. According to her findings, people experience significant changes in their sense of mortality, their values and priorities, their perception of and orientation toward time, and the manner in which they “fit” in society. The five types of grieving, she finds, reflect the choices people make in their efforts to adapt to dramatic life changes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By identifying with one of the types, readers who have suffered a recent loss—or whose lives have been shaped by an early loss—find ways of understanding the impact of the loss and of living more fully.</description>

  <description>In this compelling, beautiful memoir, award-winning writer Apricot Irving recounts her childhood as a missionary’s daughter in Haiti during a time of upheaval—both in the country and in her home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apricot Irving grew up as a missionary’s daughter in Haiti—a country easy to sensationalize but difficult to understand. Her father was an agronomist, a man who hiked alone into the hills with a &lt;i&gt;macouti&lt;/i&gt; of seeds to preach the gospel of trees in a deforested but resilient country. Her mother and sisters, meanwhile, spent most of their days in the confines of the hospital compound they called home. As a child, this felt like paradise to Irving; as a teenager, the same setting felt like a prison. Outside of the walls of the missionary enclave, Haiti was a tumult of bugle-call bus horns and bicycles that jangled over hard-packed dirt, the clamor of chickens and cicadas, the sudden, insistent clatter of rain as it hammered across tin roofs and the swell of voices running ahead of the storm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she emerges into womanhood, an already confusing process made all the more complicated by Christianity’s demands, Irving struggles to understand her father’s choices. His unswerving commitment to his mission, and the anger and despair that followed failed enterprises, threatened to splinter his family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful, poignant, and explosive, &lt;i&gt;The Gospel of Trees &lt;/i&gt;is the story of a family crushed by ideals, and restored to kindness by honesty. Told against the backdrop of Haiti’s long history of intervention—often unwelcome—it grapples with the complicated legacy of those who wish to improve the world. Drawing from family letters, cassette tapes, journals, and interviews, it is an exploration of missionary culpability and idealism, told from within.</description>

  <description>Newlyweds Celestial and Roy are the embodiment of both the American Dream and the New South. He is a young executive, and she is an artist on the brink of an exciting career. But as they settle into the routine of their life together, they are ripped apart by circumstances neither could have imagined. In this deft exploration of love, loyalty, race, justice, and both Black masculinity and Black womanhood in 21st century America, Jones achieves that most-elusive of all literary goals: the Great American Novel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Named an Oprah’s Book Club Selection.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ten years ago, four people were brutally murdered. One girl lived.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No one believes her story. &lt;br /&gt;The police think she’s crazy. &lt;br /&gt;Her therapist thinks she’s suicidal. &lt;br /&gt;Everyone else thinks she’s a dangerous drunk. &lt;br /&gt;They’re all right—but did she see the killer? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the anniversary of the murders approaches, Faith Winters is released from the psychiatric hospital and yanked back to the last spot on earth she wants to be—her hometown where the slayings took place. Wracked by the lingering echoes of survivor’s guilt, Faith spirals into a black hole of alcoholism and wanton self-destruction. Finding no solace at the bottom of a bottle, Faith decides to track down her sister’s killer—and then discovers that she’s the one being hunted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can one woman uncover the truth when everyone’s a suspect—including herself?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the mind of Wall Street Journal bestselling author Christopher Greyson comes a story with twists and turns that take the reader on a journey of light and dark, good and evil, to the edge of madness. &lt;i&gt;The Girl Who Lived&lt;/i&gt; should come with a warning label: Once you start reading, you won’t be able to stop. Not since &lt;i&gt;Girl on the Train&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/i&gt; has a psychological thriller kept readers so addicted—and guessing right until the last page. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Jazz Bashara is a criminal.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, sort of. Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you're not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you've got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down. But pulling off the impossible is just the start of her problems, as she learns that she's stepped square into a conspiracy for control of Artemis itself—and that now, her only chance at survival lies in a gambit even riskier than the first.</description>

  <description>Marion Zetland lives with her domineering older brother, John in a decaying Georgian townhouse on the edge of a northern seaside resort. A timid spinster in her fifties who still sleeps with teddy bears, Marion does her best to shut out the shocking secret that John keeps in the cellar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until, suddenly, John has a heart attack and Marion is forced to go down to the cellar herself and face the gruesome truth that her brother has kept hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As questions are asked and secrets unravel, maybe John isn't the only one with a dark side.</description>

  <description>Lo Blacklock, a journalist who writes for a travel magazine, has just been given the assignment of a lifetime: a week on a luxury cruise with only a handful of cabins. The sky is clear, the waters calm, and the veneered, select guests jovial as the exclusive cruise ship, the Aurora, begins her voyage in the picturesque North Sea. At first, Lo's stay is nothing but pleasant: the cabins are plush, the dinner parties are sparkling, and the guests are elegant. But as the week wears on, frigid winds whip the deck, gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can only describe as a dark and terrifying nightmare: a woman being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for and so, the ship sails on as if nothing has happened, despite Lo's desperate attempts to convey that something (or someone) has gone terribly, terribly wrong.</description>

  <description>A first-person account from a young critical care physician describes how toward the end of her medical training she suddenly became a patient fighting for her own life, revealing how her experiences exposed her to flaws in today's care standards and how to better embrace the emotional bond between doctor and patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A first-person account from a young critical care physician describes how toward the end of her medical training she suddenly became a patient fighting for her own life, revealing how her experiences exposed her to flaws in today's care standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A riveting first-hand account of a physician who's suddenly a dying patient and her revelation of the horribly misguided standard of care in the medical world&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Rana Awdish never imagined that an emergency trip to the hospital would result in hemorrhaging nearly all of her blood volume and losing her unborn first child. But after her first visit, Dr. Awdish spent months fighting for her life, enduring consecutive major surgeries and experiencing multiple overlapping organ failures. At each step of the recovery process, Awdish was faced with something even more unexpected: repeated cavalier behavior from her fellow physicians—indifference following human loss, disregard for anguish and suffering, and an exacting emotional distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hauntingly perceptive and beautifully written, In Shock allows the reader to transform alongside Awidsh and watch what she discovers in our carefully-cultivated, yet often misguided, standard of care. Awdish comes to understand the fatal flaws in her profession and in her own past actions as a physician while achieving, through unflinching presence, a crystalline vision of a new and better possibility for us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Dr. Awdish finds herself up against the same self-protective partitions she was trained to construct as a medical student and physician, she artfully illuminates the dysfunction of disconnection. Shatteringly personal, and yet wholly universal, she offers a brave road map for anyone navigating illness while presenting physicians with a new paradigm and rationale for embracing the emotional bond between doctor and patient.</description>

  <description>On an entirely normal, beautiful fall day in Chester’s Mill, Maine, the town is inexplicably and suddenly sealed off from the rest of the world by an invisible force field. Planes crash into it and fall from the sky in flaming wreckage, a gardener’s hand is severed as “the dome” comes down on it, people running errands in the neighboring town are divided from their families, and cars explode on impact. No one can fathom what this barrier is, where it came from, and when—or if—it will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dale Barbara, Iraq vet and now a short-order cook, finds himself teamed with a few intrepid citizens—town newspaper owner Julia Shumway, a physician’s assistant at the hospital, a selectwoman, and three brave kids. Against them stands Big Jim Rennie, a politician who will stop at nothing—even murder—to hold the reins of power, and his son, who is keeping a horrible secret in a dark pantry. But their main adversary is the Dome itself. Because time isn’t just short. It’s running out.&lt;br /&gt;source: stephenking.com</description>

  <description>According to the poet Elias Canetti, "All the things one has forgotten / scream for help in dreams." To the ancient Egyptians they were prophecies, and in world folklore they have often marked visitations from the dead. For Freud they were expressions of "wish fulfillment," and for Jung, symbolic representations of mythical archetypes. Although there is still much disagreement about the significance and function of dreams, they seem to serve as a barometer of current mind and body states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this volume, Deirdre Barrett brings together the study of dreams and the psychology of trauma. She has called on a distinguished group of psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers--among them Rosalind Cartwright, Robert J. Lifton, and Oliver Sacks--to consider how trauma shapes dreaming and what the dreaming mind might reveal about trauma. The book focuses on catastrophic events, such as combat, political torture, natural disasters, and rape. The lasting effects of childhood trauma, such as sexual abuse or severe burns, on personality formation, the nature of memories of early trauma, and the development of defenses related to amnesia and dissociation are all considered. The book also takes up trauma and adult dreams, including Vietnam veterans and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Holocaust survivors and perpetrators, rape victims, and firestorm survivors. Finally, this volume concludes with a look at the potential "traumas of normal life," such as divorce, bereavement, and life-threatening illness, and the role of dreams in working through normal grief and loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taken together, these diverse perspectives illuminate the universal and the particular effects of traumatic experience. For physicians and clinicians, determining the etiology of nightmares offers valuable diagnostic and therapeutic insights for individual treatment. This book provides a way of juxtaposing the research in the separate fields of trauma and dreams, and learning from their discoveries.</description>

  <description>When a beloved high schooler named Lucinda Hayes is found murdered, no one in her sleepy Colorado suburb is untouched—not the boy who loved her too much; not the girl who wanted her perfect life; not the officer assigned to investigate her murder. In the aftermath of the tragedy, these three indelible characters—Cameron, Jade, and Russ—must each confront their darkest secrets in an effort to find solace, the truth, or both. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In crystalline prose, Danya Kukafka offers a brilliant exploration of identity and of the razor-sharp line between love and obsession, between watching and seeing, between truth and memory. Compulsively readable and powerfully moving, &lt;i&gt;Girl in Snow&lt;/i&gt; offers an unforgettable reading experience and introduces a singular new talent in Danya Kukafka.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An all-new epic tale of terror and redemption set in the hinterlands of midcentury New Mexico from the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;The Troop&lt;/i&gt;—which Stephen King raved “scared the hell out of me and I couldn’t put it down...old-school horror at its best.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From electrifying horror author Nick Cutter comes a haunting new novel, reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy's &lt;i&gt;Blood Meridian&lt;/i&gt; and Stephen King’s &lt;i&gt;It&lt;/i&gt;, in which a trio of mismatched mercenaries is hired by a young woman for a deceptively simple task: check in on her nephew, who may have been taken against his will to a remote New Mexico backwoods settlement called Little Heaven. Shortly after they arrive, things begin to turn ominous. Stirrings in the woods and over the treetops—the brooding shape of a monolith known as the Black Rock casts its terrible pall. Paranoia and distrust grips the settlement. The escape routes are gradually cut off as events spiral towards madness. Hell—or the closest thing to it—invades Little Heaven. The remaining occupants are forced to take a stand and fight back, but whatever has cast its dark eye on Little Heaven is now marshaling its powers...and it wants them all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A Finalist for the Edgar Award for Best First Novel&lt;br /&gt; In the country-noir tradition of &lt;i&gt;Winter's Bone&lt;/i&gt; meets 'Breaking Bad,' a savage and beautiful story of a young man seeking redemption.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The area surrounding Cashiers, North Carolina, is home to people of all kinds, but the world that Jacob McNeely lives in is crueler than most. His father runs a methodically organized meth ring, with local authorities on the dime to turn a blind eye to his dealings. Having dropped out of high school and cut himself off from his peers, Jacob has been working for this father for years, all on the promise that his payday will come eventually.  The only joy he finds comes from reuniting with Maggie, his first love, and a girl clearly bound for bigger and better things than their hardscrabble town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jacob has always been resigned to play the cards that were dealt him, but when a fatal mistake changes everything, he’s faced with a choice: stay and appease his father, or leave the mountains with the girl he loves. In a place where blood is thicker than water and hope takes a back seat to fate, Jacob wonders if he can muster the strength to rise above the only life he’s ever known.</description>

  <description>In this sequel to Dawn, Lilith Iyapo has given birth to what looks like a normal human boy named Akin. But Akin actually has five parents: a male and female human, a male and female Oankali, and a sexless Ooloi. The Oankali and Ooloi are part of an alien race that rescued humanity from a devastating nuclear war, but the price they exact is a high one the aliens are compelled to genetically merge their species with other races, drastically altering both in the process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a rehabilitated Earth, this "new" race is emerging through human/Oankali/Ooloi mating, but there are also "pure" humans who choose to resist the aliens and the salvation they offer.These resisters are sterilized by the Ooloi so that they cannot reproduce the genetic defect that drives humanity to destroy itself, but otherwise they are left alone (unless they become violent). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the resisters kidnap young Akin, the Oankali choose to leave the child with his captors, for he the most "human" of the Oankali children will decide whether the resisters should be given back their fertility and freedom, even though they will only destroy themselves again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second volume in Octavia Butler's Xenogenesis series, a powerful tale of alien existence.</description>

  <description>Elyn Saks is a success by any measure: she's an endowed professor at the prestigious University of Southern California Gould School of Law. She has managed to achieve this in spite of being diagnosed as schizophrenic and given a "grave" prognosis—and suffering the effects of her illness throughout her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saks was only eight, and living an otherwise idyllic childhood in sunny 1960s Miami, when her first symptoms appeared in the form of obsessions and night terrors. But it was not until she reached Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar that her first full-blown episode, complete with voices in her head and terrifying suicidal fantasies, forced her into a psychiatric hospital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saks would later attend Yale Law School where one night, during her first term, she had a breakdown that left her singing on the roof of the law school library at midnight. She was taken to the emergency room, force-fed antipsychotic medication, and tied hand-and-foot to the cold metal of a hospital bed. She spent the next five months in a psychiatric ward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So began Saks's long war with her own internal demons and the equally powerful forces of stigma. Today she is a chaired professor of law who researches and writes about the rights of the mentally ill. She is married to a wonderful man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Center Cannot Hold&lt;/i&gt;, Elyn Saks discusses frankly and movingly the paranoia, the inability to tell imaginary fears from real ones, and the voices in her head insisting she do terrible things, as well as the many obstacles she overcame to become the woman she is today. It is destined to become a classic in the genre.</description>

  <description>At the outset of the final installment of our saga, Roland’s ka-tet is scattered across several different wheres and whens. Susannah Dean (still in the clutches of the demon Mia) is in End-World’s Fedic Dogan: a chamber of horrors where magic and technology can be merged and where a monstrous half-human child can be brought forth into the world. Eddie Dean and Roland Deschain are in Maine, 1977, searching for the site of otherworldly walk-in activity, and a possible doorway back to Mid-World. Jake Chambers, Father Callahan, and the bumbler Oy are battling vampires and low men in New York’s Dixie Pig Restaurant, circa 1999, a place where long pig is definitely on the menu. As soon as our tet reunites, they must journey to the headquarters of Thunderclap’s Wolves in order to discover exactly why the Crimson King’s minions have been culling the brains of young children for twin-telepathy enzymes. The answer is more horrible than they realized, and bears directly upon Roland’s quest to reach the Dark Tower.</description>

  <description>The Wolves have been defeated, but our tet faces yet another catastrophe. Susannah Dean’s body has been usurped by a demon named Mia who wants to use Susannah’s mortal form to bear a demon child. Stealing Black Thirteen, Mia has traveled through the Unfound Door to 1999 New York where she plans to give birth to her chap, a child born of two mothers and two fathers who will grow up to be Roland’s nemesis. With the help of the time-traveling Manni, Roland and Eddie plan to follow Susannah while Father Callahan and Jake will find Calvin Tower, owner of the vacant lot where a magical rose grows: a rose that must be saved at all costs. But despite our ka-tet’s intentions, ka has its own plans. Jake, Callahan, and Jake’s bumbler companion are transported to New York to follow Susannah, while Eddie and Roland are tumbled into East Stoneham, Maine, where they are greeted by Eddie’s old enemy, the gangster Balazar. But it isn’t just bullets that Roland and Eddie must brave. Soon they will meet their maker, in the form of a young author named Stephen King.</description>

  <description>Roland and his tet have just returned to the path of the Beam when they discover that they are being followed by a group of inexperienced trackers. The trackers are from the town of Calla Bryn Sturgis, and they desperately need the help of gunslingers. Once every generation, a band of masked riders known as the Wolves gallop out of the dark land of Thunderclap to steal one half of all the twins born in the Callas. When the children are returned, they are roont, or mentally and physically ruined. In less than a month, the Wolves will raid again. In exchange for Roland’s aid, Father Callahan—a priest originally from our world—offers to give Roland a powerful but evil seeing sphere, a sinister globe called Black Thirteen which he has hidden below the floorboards of his church. Not only must Roland and his tet discover a way to defeat the invincible Wolves, but they must also return to New York so that they can save our world’s incarnation of the Dark Tower from the machinations of the evil Sombra Corporation.</description>

  <description>When &lt;i&gt;Trauma and Recovery&lt;/i&gt; was first published in 1992, it was hailed as a groundbreaking work. In the intervening years, Herman’s volume has changed the way we think about and treat traumatic events and trauma victims. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a new afterword, Herman chronicles the incredible response the book has elicited and explains how the issues surrounding the topic have shifted within the clinical community and the culture at large. &lt;i&gt;Trauma and Recovery&lt;/i&gt; brings a new level of understanding to a set of problems usually considered individually. Herman draws on her own cutting-edge research in domestic violence as well as on the vast literature of combat veterans and victims of political terror, to show the parallels between private terrors such as rape and public traumas such as terrorism. The book puts individual experience in a broader political frame, arguing that psychological trauma can be understood only in a social context. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meticulously documented and frequently using the victims’ own words as well as those from classic literary works and prison diaries, &lt;i&gt;Trauma and Recovery&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful work that will continue to profoundly impact our thinking.</description>

  <description>As a research neuroscientist, Lise Eliot has made the study of the human brain her life's work. But it wasn't until she was pregnant with her first child that she became intrigued with the study of brain development. She wanted to know precisely how the baby's brain is formed, and when and how each sense, skill, and cognitive ability is developed. And just as important, she was interested in finding out how her role as a nurturer can affect this complex process. How much of her baby's development is genetically ordained--and how much is determined by environment? Is there anything parents can do to make their babies' brains work better--to help them become smarter, happier people? Drawing upon the exploding research in this field as well as the stories of real children, &lt;b&gt;What's Going On in There?&lt;/b&gt; is a lively and thought-provoking book that charts the brain's development from conception through the critical first five years. In examining the many factors that play crucial roles in that process, &lt;b&gt;What's Going On in There?&lt;/b&gt; explores the evolution of the senses, motor skills, social and emotional behaviors, and mental functions such as attention, language, memory, reasoning, and intelligence. This remarkable book also discusses: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        how a baby's brain is "assembled" from scratch &lt;br /&gt;the critical prenatal factors that shapebrain development &lt;br /&gt;how the birthing process itself affects the brain &lt;br /&gt;which forms of stimulation are most effective at promoting cognitive development &lt;br /&gt;how boys' and girls' brains develop differently &lt;br /&gt;how nutrition, stress, and other physical and social factors can permanently affect a child's brain &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliantly blending cutting-edge science with a mother's wisdom and insight, &lt;b&gt;What's Going On in There?&lt;/b&gt; is an invaluable contribution to the nature versus nurture debate. Children's development is determined both by the genes they are born with and the richness of their early environment. This timely and important book shows parents the innumerable ways in which they can actually help their children grow better brains.</description>

  <description>Roland, Eddie, Susannah, Jake, and Jake’s pet bumbler survive Blaine the Mono’s final crash, only to find themselves stranded in an alternate version of Topeka, Kansas, one that has been ravaged by the superflu virus. While following the deserted I-70 toward a distant glass palace, they hear the atonal squalling of a thinny, a place where the fabric of existence has almost entirely worn away. While camping near the edge of the thinny, Roland tells his ka-tet a story about another thinny, one that he encountered when he was little more than a boy. Over the course of one long magical night, Roland transports us to the Mid-World of long-ago and a seaside town called Hambry, where Roland fell in love with a girl named Susan Delgado, and where he and his old tet-mates Alain and Cuthbert battled the forces of John Farson, the harrier who—with a little help from a seeing sphere called Maerlyn’s Grapefruit—ignited Mid-World’s final war.</description>

  <description>Several months have passed, and Roland’s two new tet-mates have become proficient gunslingers. Eddie Dean has given up heroin, and Odetta’s two selves have joined, becoming the stronger and more balanced personality of Susannah Dean. But while battling The Pusher in 1977 New York, Roland altered ka by saving the life of Jake Chambers, a boy who—in Roland’s where and when—has already died. Now Roland and Jake exist in different worlds, but they are joined by the same madness: the paradox of double memories. Roland, Susannah, and Eddie must draw Jake into Mid-World then follow the Path of the Beam all the way to the Dark Tower. But nothing is easy in Mid-World. Along the way our tet stumbles into the ruined city of Lud, and are caught between the warring gangs of the Pubes and the Grays. The only way out of Lud is to wake Blaine the Mono, an insane train that has a passion for riddling, and for suicidal journeys.</description>

  <description>While pursuing his quest for the Dark Tower through a world that is a nightmarishly distorted mirror image of our own, Roland, the last gunslinger, encounters three mysterious doorways on the beach. Each one enters into the life of a different person living in contemporary New York. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here he links forces with the defiant young Eddie Dean and the beautiful, brilliant, and brave Odetta Holmes, in a savage struggle against underworld evil and otherworldly enemies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, Stephen King has masterfully interwoven dark, evocative fantasy and icy realism.</description>

  <description>Sit. Walk. Write. These are the barest bones of Natalie Goldberg’s revolutionary writing and life practice, which she presents here in book form for the first time. A whole new slant on writing that she developed since the publication of her classic &lt;i&gt;Writing Down the Bones, &lt;/i&gt;True Secret workshops have been limited until now to small, intensive groups at a remote center in the rural Southwest. In &lt;i&gt;The True Secret of Writing, &lt;/i&gt;Goldberg makes this popular seminar available to any reader. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The True Secret is for everyone, like eating and sleeping. It allows you to discover something real about your life, to mine the rich awareness in your mind, and to ground and empower yourself. Goldberg guides you through your own personal or group retreat, illuminating the steps of sitting in silent open mind, walking anchored to the earth, and writing without criticism. Just as Goldberg cuts through her students’ resistance with her no-nonsense instruction—“Shut up and write”—the True Secret cuts to the core of realizing yourself and your world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The capstone to forty years of teaching, &lt;i&gt;The True Secret of Writing &lt;/i&gt;is Goldberg’s Zen boot camp, her legacy teaching. Stories of Natalie’s own search for truth and clarity and her students’ breakthroughs and insights give moving testament to how brilliantly her unique, tough-love method works. Beautiful homages to the work of other great teachers and observers of mind, life, and love provide further secrets and inspiration to which readers will return again and again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her inimitable way, Goldberg will inspire you to pick up the pen, get writing, and keep going. &lt;i&gt;The True Secret of Writing &lt;/i&gt;will help you with your writing—and your life.</description>

  <description>With the fierce emotional and intellectual power of such classics as Jean Rhys's &lt;em&gt;Good Morning, Midnight&lt;/em&gt;, Sylvia Plath's &lt;em&gt;The Bell Jar&lt;/em&gt;, and Clarice Lispector's &lt;em&gt;The Hour of the Star&lt;/em&gt;, Kate Zambreno's novel &lt;em&gt;Green Girl&lt;/em&gt; is a provocative, sharply etched portrait of a young woman navigating the spectrum between anomie and epiphany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First published in 2011 in a small press edition, &lt;em&gt;Green Girl&lt;/em&gt; was named one of the best books of the year by critics including Dennis Cooper and Roxane Gay. In &lt;em&gt;Bookforum&lt;/em&gt;, James Greer called it &lt;i&gt;ambitious in a way few works of fiction are.&lt;/i&gt; This summer it is being republished in an all-new Harper Perennial trade paperback, significantly revised by the author, and including an extensive P.S. section including never before published outtakes, an interview with the author, and a new essay by Zambreno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zambreno's heroine, Ruth, is a young American in London, kin to Jean Seberg gamines and contemporary celebutantes, by day spritzing perfume at the department store she calls Horrids, by night trying desperately to navigate a world colored by the unwanted gaze of others and the uncertainty of her own self-regard. Ruth, the green girl, joins the canon of young people existing in that important, frightening, and exhilarating period of drift and anxiety between youth and adulthood, and her story is told through the eyes of one of the most surprising and unforgettable narrators in recent fiction—a voice at once distanced and maternal, indulgent yet blackly funny. And the result is a piercing yet humane meditation on alienation, consumerism, the city, self-awareness, and desire, by a novelist who has been compared with Jean Rhys, Virginia Woolf, and Elfriede Jelinek.</description>

  <description>To serial slayer Andrew Compton, murder is an art, &lt;i&gt;the most intimate art&lt;/i&gt;. After feigning his own death to escape from prison, Compton makes his way to the United States with the sole ambition of bringing his "art" to new heights. Tortured by his own perverse desires, and drawn to possess and destroy young boys, Compton inadvertently joins forces with Jay Byrne, a dissolute playboy who has pushed his "art" to limits even Compton hadn't previously imagined. Together, Compton and Byrne set their sights on an exquisite young Vietnamese-American runaway, Tran, whom they deem to be the perfect victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swiftly moving from the grimy streets of London's Piccadilly Circus to the decadence of the New Orleans French Quarter, and punctuated by rants from radio talk show host Lush Rimbaud, a.k.a. Luke Ransom, Tran's ex-lover, who is dying of AIDS and who intends to wreak ultimate havoc before leaving this world, &lt;i&gt;Exquisite Corpse&lt;/i&gt; unfolds into a labyrinth of murder and love. Ultimately all four characters converge on a singular bloody night after which their lives will be irrevocably changed — or terminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy Z. Brite dissects the landscape of torture and invites us into the mind of a killer. &lt;i&gt;Exquisite Corpse&lt;/i&gt; confirms Brite as a writer who defies categorization. It is a novel for those who dare trespass where the sacred and profane become one.</description>

  <description>When a middle school girl is abducted in broad daylight, a fellow student and witness to the crime copes with the tragedy in an unforgettable way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens to the girl left behind?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A masked man with a gun enters a sandwich shop in broad daylight, and Meredith Oliver suddenly finds herself ordered to the filthy floor, where she cowers face to face with her nemesis, Lisa Bellow, the most popular girl in her eighth grade class. The minutes tick inexorably by, and Meredith lurches between comforting the sobbing Lisa and imagining her own impending death. Then the man orders Lisa Bellow to stand and come with him, leaving Meredith the girl left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Lisa’s abduction, Meredith spends most days in her room. As the community stages vigils and searches, Claire, Meredith’s mother, is torn between relief that her daughter is alive, and helplessness over her inability to protect or even comfort her child. Her daughter is here, but not.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A captivating debut novel for readers of Celeste Ng's &lt;i&gt;Everything I Never Told You&lt;/i&gt; and Curtis Sittenfeld's &lt;i&gt;Prep&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Most Dangerous Place on Earth&lt;/i&gt; unleashes an unforgettable cast of characters into a realm known for its cruelty and peril: the American high school.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an idyllic community of wealthy California families, new teacher Molly Nicoll becomes intrigued by the hidden lives of her privileged students. Unknown to Molly, a middle school tragedy in which they were all complicit continues to reverberate for her kids: Nick, the brilliant scam artist; Emma, the gifted dancer and party girl; Dave, the B student who strives to meet his parents' expectations; Calista, the hippie outcast who hides her intelligence for reasons of her own. Theirs is a world in which every action may become public: postable, shareable, indelible. With the rare talent that transforms teenage dramas into compelling and urgent fiction, Lindsey Lee Johnson makes vivid a modern adolescence lived in the gleam of the virtual, but rich with the sorrow, passion, and beauty of life in any time, and at any age.</description>

      <![CDATA[An entertaining, but ultimately forgettable read. Ms. Johnson has all the tools of an excellent author: control, quality, immersion, skillful plotting, etc.; however, something about this particular storyline failed to interest me for long after I had put it down. Definitely a library check-out....]]>

  <description>One day in early spring, Dorrit Weger is checked into the Second Reserve Bank Unit for biological material. She is promised a nicely furnished apartment inside the Unit, where she will make new friends, enjoy the state of the art recreation facilities, and live the few remaining days of her life in comfort with people who are just like her. Here, women over the age of fifty and men over sixty-single, childless, and without jobs in progressive industries--are sequestered for their final few years; they are considered outsiders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Unit they are expected to contribute themselves for drug and psychological testing, and ultimately donate their organs, little by little, until the final donation. Despite the ruthless nature of this practice, the ethos of this near-future society and the Unit is to take care of others, and Dorrit finds herself living under very pleasant conditions: well-housed, well-fed, and well-attended. She is resigned to her fate and discovers her days there to be rather consoling and peaceful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she meets a man inside the Unit and falls in love, the extraordinary becomes a reality and life suddenly turns unbearable. Dorrit is faced with compliance or escape, and...well, then what?</description>

  <description>Since&lt;i&gt; Writing the Memoir&lt;/i&gt; came out in early 1997 it has sold roughly 80,000 copies and is consistently praised as "the best book on memoir out there." It is thought-provoking, explanatory, and practical: each chapter ends with writing exercises. It covers everything from questions of truth and ethics to questions of craft and the crucial retrospective voice. An appendix provides information on legal issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judith Barrington, an award-winning memoir writer and acclaimed writing teacher, is attuned to the forces, both external and internal, that work to stop a writer; her tone is respectful of the difficulties and encouraging of taking risks. Her nimble prose, her deep belief in the importance of this genre, and her delight in the rich array of memoirists writing today make this book more than the typical "how-to" creative writing book. In this second edition the author has added new material and reflects on issues raised since &lt;i&gt;Writing the Memoir&lt;/i&gt; was written, early in the memoir boom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"No student of memoir writing could fail to learn from this wise, pragmatic, and confiding book. One hears on every page the voice of an intelligent and responsive teacher, with years of thinking about memoir behind her."--Vivian Gornick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Judith Barrington &lt;/b&gt;is the author of &lt;i&gt;Lifesaving: A Memoir&lt;/i&gt; and numerous individual memoirs which have been published in literary magazines and anthologies. She is the author of three volumes of poetry: &lt;i&gt;Trying to Be an Honest Woman&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;History and Geography, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Horses and the Human Soul&lt;/i&gt; (forthcoming in 2002). She has taught creative writing for the past twenty years.</description>

  <description>"Twelve times a week," answered Uta Hagen when asked how often she'd like to play Martha in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? In the same way, audiences and critics alike could not get enough of Edward Albee's masterful play. A dark comedy, it portrays husband and wife George and Martha in a searing night of dangerous fun and games. By the evening's end, a stunning, almost unbearable revelation provides a climax that has shocked audiences for years. With the play's razor-sharp dialogue and the stripping away of social pretense, Newsweek rightly foresaw Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? as "a brilliantly original work of art--an excoriating theatrical experience, surging with shocks of recognition and dramatic fire [that] will be igniting Broadway for some time to come."</description>

  <description>The spectacular finale to the New York Times bestselling trilogy that began with Mr. Mercedes (winner of the Edgar Award) and Finders Keepers—In End of Watch, the diabolical “Mercedes Killer” drives his enemies to suicide, and if Bill Hodges and Holly Gibney don’t figure out a way to stop him, they’ll be victims themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Room 217 of the Lakes Region Traumatic Brain Injury Clinic, something has awakened. Something evil. Brady Hartsfield, perpetrator of the Mercedes Massacre, where eight people were killed and many more were badly injured, has been in the clinic for five years, in a vegetative state. According to his doctors, anything approaching a complete recovery is unlikely. But behind the drool and stare, Brady is awake, and in possession of deadly new powers that allow him to wreak unimaginable havoc without ever leaving his hospital room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retired police detective Bill Hodges, the unlikely hero of Mr. Mercedes and Finders Keepers, now runs an investigation agency with his partner, Holly Gibney—the woman who delivered the blow to Hartsfield’s head that put him on the brain injury ward. When Bill and Holly are called to a suicide scene with ties to the Mercedes Massacre, they find themselves pulled into their most dangerous case yet, one that will put their lives at risk, as well as those of Bill’s heroic young friend Jerome Robinson and his teenage sister, Barbara. Brady Hartsfield is back, and planning revenge not just on Hodges and his friends, but on an entire city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In End of Watch, Stephen King brings the Hodges trilogy to a sublimely terrifying conclusion, combining the detective fiction of Mr. Mercedes and Finders Keepers with the heart-pounding, supernatural suspense that has been his bestselling trademark. The result is an unnerving look at human vulnerability and chilling suspense. No one does it better than King.</description>

  <description>Can you love more than one person? Have multiple romantic partners, without jealousy or cheating? Absolutely! Polyamorous people have been paving the way, through trial and painful error. Now the new book &lt;i&gt;More Than Two&lt;/i&gt; can help you find your own way. With completely new material and a fresh approach, Franklin Veaux and Eve Rickert wrote &lt;i&gt;More Than Two&lt;/i&gt; to expand on and update the themes and ideas in the wildly popular polyamory website morethantwo.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From partners, authors and practicing polyamorists Franklin Veaux and Eve Rickert comes the long-awaited, wide-ranging resource exploring the often-complex world of living polyamorously.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Highlighting the nuances (no, this isn’t swinging), the relationship options (do you suit a V, an N, an open network?), the myths (don’t count on wild orgies and endless sex—but don’t rule them out, either!) and the expectations (communication, transparency and trust are paramount), the authors share not only their hard-won philosophies about polyamory, but also their hurts and embarrassments.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;More Than Two&lt;/i&gt; is entirely without judgment and peppered with a good dose of humor. Franklin and Eve underscore the importance of engaging in ethical polyamory, while gently guiding readers through the thorny issues of jealousy and insecurity.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And no, they’re not trying to convert you: they know that polyamory isn’t for everyone. Franklin and Eve simply provide those who might be embarking on this lifestyle, or those who have already begun, with a toolkit to help them make informed decisions and set them on a path to enjoying multiple happy, strong, enriching relationships.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;More Than Two&lt;/i&gt; is the book the polyamory community has been waiting for. And who knows? It may just be the book you didn’t even know you were waiting for.</description>

  <description>Shevek, a brilliant physicist, decides to take action. He will seek answers, question the unquestionable, and attempt to tear down the walls of hatred that have isolated his planet of anarchists from the rest of the civilized universe. To do this dangerous task will mean giving up his family and possibly his life—Shevek must make the unprecedented journey to the utopian mother planet, Urras, to challenge the complex structures of life and living, and ignite the fires of change.</description>

  <description>Jenny Block is your average girl next door, a suburban wife and mother for whom married life never felt quite right. She operates from the assumption that most couples who are curious about or engaged in open marriages are in fact more like hernormal people who question whether monogamy is right for them; good people who love their spouses but want variation; capable parents who are not deviant just because they choose to be honest about their desires. &lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Open, &lt;/i&gt; Block paints a down to earth picture of how an open marriage can work, and specifically why it works for her and her husband. In dissecting other people s strong reactions to her choice, she explores the question of why cheating is more socially acceptable than open marriage. In part, she concludes, the lack of models for successful functional open marriages is such that the general public is not yet equipped to handle treating it as anything other than abnormal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Open&lt;/i&gt; challenges our notions of what traditional marriage looks like, and presents one woman s journey down an uncertain path that ultimately proves that open marriage is a viable option, and one that s in fact better for some couples than conventional marriage."</description>

  <description>In the aftermath of a devastating plague, a fearless young heroine embarks on a dangerous and surprising journey to save her world in this brilliantly inventive thriller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the ruins of a future America, fifteen-year-old Ice Cream Star and her nomadic tribe live off the detritus of a crumbled civilization. Theirs is a world of children; before reaching the age of twenty, they all die of a strange disease they call Posies--a plague that has killed for generations. There is no medicine, no treatment; only the mysterious rumor of a cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her brother begins showing signs of the disease, Ice Cream Star sets off on a bold journey to find this cure. Led by a stranger, a captured prisoner named Pasha who becomes her devoted protector and friend, Ice Cream Star plunges into the unknown, risking her freedom and ultimately her life. Traveling hundreds of miles across treacherous, unfamiliar territory, she will experience love, heartbreak, cruelty, terror, and betrayal, fighting to protect the only world she has ever known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A postapocalyptic literary epic as imaginative as &lt;i&gt;The Passage&lt;/i&gt; and as linguistically ambitious as &lt;i&gt;Cloud Atlas&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Country of Ice Cream Star&lt;/i&gt; is a breathtaking work from a writer of rare and unconventional talent.</description>

  <description>By exploring the relationship between the writer and love, grief, place, family, race and violence, John Rember helps you see how to go deep in your writing. He also tells you what you'll find there and how to get back. Along the way, you'll learn how to see the world as a writer sees it.&lt;p&gt;“A big part of writing involves grappling with the terrors and discouragements that come when you have writing skills but can’t project yourself or your work into the future,” says Rember. “My hope is that MFA in a Box will help writers balance the despair of writing with the joy of writing. It’s a book designed to help you to find the courage to put truth into words and to understand that writing is a life-and-death endeavor — but that nothing about a life-and-death endeavor keeps it from being laugh-out-loud funny.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REVIEWS/COMMENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The essential truths about excellent writing are brought under consideration partly through the use of familiar fables and fairy tales. Another part is illustrated by the author’s own life experiences. Rember cleverly makes the reader dig into her own unconscious wisdom to recognize the true jewel at the center of a story. This book is not filled with rules and dogma to guide the writing process. Instead, an understanding of our relationship to our place on earth, acknowledging that our civilization is built on violence, and 'how the big moments in life require a witness,' impel us to infuse our stories with truth." — The Judges of the Hoffer Awards (&lt;i&gt;MFA in a Box&lt;/i&gt; was named to the Hoffer Award Grand Prize Short List in May 2011)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What makes [this book] different than the many, many books about writing on the market today is the way Rember engages his readers in some of the issues every writer faces — writing about place, about family, about grief — not as problems to be overcome but as issues to be understood.” — Jeff Baker, Book Editor, The (Portland) Oregonian &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Witty, audacious, and wise, John Rember’s MFA in a Box is a unique and valuable book that addresses the subject—and the life experience—of Creative Writing from both a practical perspective and in a manner so highly personable you’ll read it like a memoir—and want to meet the author. Rember has the storyteller’s magic. You’ll be enthralled. And walk away a more astute and vibrant writer.” — Robin Metz, author of Unbidden Angel, winner of the Rainer Maria Rilke International Poetry Award, and Director of the Program in Creative Writing at Knox College&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I started reading the book on the plane to a convention. Every chapter is an essay, one of those rich interconnected thought-weavings that we got to listen to as Pacific [University] students, with the addition of a top ten list at the end of each — valuable for focus and review, but also often funny. I found, reading on the plane, that when I was done with the first essay, I didn’t want to read the second. I wanted to write. So I dug out my carry-on and switched activities. On the plane ride home? Same thing. One essay, and then writing. Obviously, this is a rare writing book. I have read quite a few, and I don’t remember any of them making me want to write that moment like this does. The cover says it’s ‘a Why to Write Book,’ and the evidence says it’s convincing.” — Author Felicity Shoulders &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“If you are ready to plunge into the depths of your writer’s soul and uncover the secrets that you might be holding back, then MFA in a Box could change the whole way you think about the process of writing.” — Sharon Harrigan, Author, Poet, Journalist, Walking on the Highway, Dec. 2010&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“John Rember’s MFA in a Box is the best book on writing I’ve read since Stephen King’s On Writing. It should be on every writer’s bookshelf.” — Randy Richardson, author of &lt;i&gt;Lost in the Ivy&lt;/i&gt;, President of the Chicago Writers Association&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“MFA in a Box by John Rember is possibly the best book I’ve read about writing and living the creative life in general, and I have a personal library full of such books. I wish I had read this 30 years ago while I was at [college] hoping to be a writer some day.” — Gretchen Little, ”A Book Review and More,” Squidoo, October 2010 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“There is such a wealth of life in each essay…deep, authentic stuff about relationships, politics, religion, mythology, and everything is discussed with such perfect humor. I love the Rules for Writers at the end of the chapters…great stuff…really useful as well as entertaining. This book should be mandatory for any writing course, undergrad or graduate. This is so much more than a craft book…this is an inspiration. It makes me want to write, helps me find the courage to do so, and allows me see the purpose in the hard work of it.” — Author Rebecca Elgin&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Once a year, scoutmaster Tim Riggs leads a troop of boys into the Canadian wilderness for a three-day camping trip—a tradition as comforting and reliable as a good ghost story and a roaring bonfire. But when an unexpected intruder—shockingly thin, disturbingly pale, and voraciously hungry—stumbles upon their campsite, Tim and the boys are exposed to something far more frightening than any tale of terror. The human carrier of a bioengineered nightmare. An inexplicable horror that spreads faster than fear. A harrowing struggle for survival that will pit the troop against the elements, the infected ... and one another.</description>

  <description>Geraldlynn is a lively, astute 14-year-old. Her family, displaced by Hurricane Katrina, returns home to find a radically altered public education system. Geraldlynn's parents hope their daughter's new school will prepare her for college--but the teenager has ideals and ambitions of her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aidan is a fresh-faced Harvard grad drawn to New Orleans by the possibility of bringing change to a flood-ravaged city. He teaches at an ambitious charter school with a group of newcomers determined to show the world they can use science, data, and hard work to build a model school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Laurie is a veteran educator who becomes principal of one of the first public high schools to reopen after Katrina. Laurie and her staff find they must fight each day not only to educate the city's teenagers, but to keep the Walker community safe and whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this powerful narrative non-fiction debut, the lives of these three characters provide readers with a vivid and sobering portrait of education in twenty-first-century America. &lt;i&gt;Hope Against Hope&lt;/i&gt; works in the same tradition as &lt;i&gt;Random Family&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;There Are No Children Here&lt;/i&gt; to capture the challenges of growing up and learning in a troubled world.</description>

  <description>From the author of &lt;i&gt;L.A. Confidential&lt;/i&gt; comes &lt;i&gt;My Dark Places,&lt;/i&gt; an investigative autobiography by James Ellroy. In 1958, Ellroy's mother, Jean, was raped, killed, and dumped off a road in El Monte, California, a rundown L.A. suburb. The killer was never found, and the case was closed. It was a sordid, back-page homicide that no one remembered. Except her son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Ellroy was ten years old when his mother died. His bereavement was complex and ambiguous: "I cried. I cranked tears out all the way to L.A. I hated her. I hated El Monte. Some unknown killer just bought me a brand-new beautiful life." He grew up obsessed with murdered women and crime. He ran from his mother's ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellroy became a writer of radically provocative and bestselling crime novels. "I wear obsession well," he says. "I've turned it into something." He tried to reclaim his mother through fiction. It didn't work. He quit running and wrote this memoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Dark Places&lt;/i&gt; is Jean and James Ellroy's story—from 1958 to all points past and up to this moment. It is the story of a brilliant homicide detective named Bill Stoner and of the investigation he and Ellroy undertook. It is also an unflinching autobiography with vivid reportage. This is James Ellroy's journey through his most forbidding memories.</description>

  <description>Jean-Paul Sartre, the great French existentialist, displays his mastery of drama in NO EXIT, an unforgettable portrayal of hell.&lt;br /&gt;The play is a depiction of the afterlife in which three deceased characters are punished by being locked into a room together for all eternity. It is the source of Sartre's especially famous and often misinterpreted quotation "L'enfer, c'est les autres" or "Hell is other people", a reference to Sartre's ideas about the Look and the perpetual ontological struggle of being caused to see oneself as an object in the world of another consciousness.</description>

  <description>You land in prison as a twenty-something, faced with the likelihood of spending the rest of your life behind the wall. What do you do? Danner Darcleight started writing. He writes about what he sees, what he has done, and the toll that such witnessing and his own past actions have exacted. Concrete Carnival brings us inside a maximum-security prison, introducing a colorful cast of rogues while revealing the day-to-day struggles experienced by millions of Americans now living inside the world's largest prison complex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by his past, he slips the surly bonds of heroin. He gets stripped, deloused, and assigned an inmate number. He learns to navigate among sociopaths, gangbangers, drug dealers, hustlers, thieves, mercurial prison guards, and his own grinding remorse. He works through recurring thoughts of suicide, benefits from serendipitous encounters, and ultimately meets a loving woman who brings warmth to a harsh existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darcleight pushes past the cliches and caricatures employed by pop culture, offering direct engagement with what it's really like to do time. What begins as frontline reportage becomes an unforgettable case study in resilience and determination against the worst imaginable odds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An exhilarating, picaresque ride through the sights, sounds, and emotions of prison life, Concrete Carnival is a moving portrait of one man's long journey from hopelessness and addiction to love and redemption.</description>

  <description>What if you could live again and again, until you got it right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a cold and snowy night in 1910, Ursula Todd is born to an English banker and his wife. She dies before she can draw her first breath. On that same cold and snowy night, Ursula Todd is born, lets out a lusty wail, and embarks upon a life that will be, to say the least, unusual. For as she grows, she also dies, repeatedly, in a variety of ways, while the young century marches on towards its second cataclysmic world war. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does Ursula's apparently infinite number of lives give her the power to save the world from its inevitable destiny? And if she can - will she?</description>

  <description>Northern California, during the violent end of the 1960s. At the start of summer, a lonely and thoughtful teenager, Evie Boyd, sees a group of girls in the park, and is immediately caught by their freedom, their careless dress, their dangerous aura of abandon. Soon, Evie is in thrall to Suzanne, a mesmerizing older girl, and is drawn into the circle of a soon-to-be infamous cult and the man who is its charismatic leader. Hidden in the hills, their sprawling ranch is eerie and run down, but to Evie, it is exotic, thrilling, charged—a place where she feels desperate to be accepted. As she spends more time away from her mother and the rhythms of her daily life, and as her obsession with Suzanne intensifies, Evie does not realize she is coming closer and closer to unthinkable violence, and to that moment in a girl’s life when everything can go horribly wrong.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A pioneering researcher and one of the world’s foremost experts on traumatic stress offers a bold new paradigm for healing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trauma is a fact of life. Veterans and their families deal with the painful aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence. Such experiences inevitably leave traces on minds, emotions, and even on biology. Sadly, trauma sufferers frequently pass on their stress to their partners and children.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Renowned trauma expert Bessel van der Kolk has spent over three decades working with survivors. In &lt;i&gt;The Body Keeps the Score&lt;/i&gt;, he transforms our understanding of traumatic stress, revealing how it literally rearranges the brain’s wiring—specifically areas dedicated to pleasure, engagement, control, and trust. He shows how these areas can be reactivated through innovative treatments including neurofeedback, mindfulness techniques, play, yoga, and other therapies. Based on Dr. van der Kolk’s own research and that of other leading specialists, &lt;i&gt;The Body Keeps the Score &lt;/i&gt;offers proven alternatives to drugs and talk therapy—and a way to reclaim lives.</description>

  <description>The New York Times bestseller, now available in paperback—Mary Karr’s sequel to the beloved and bestselling The Liars’ Club and Cherry “lassos you, hogties your emotions and won’t let you go” (Michiko Kakutani, New York Times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Karr’s bestselling, unforgettable sequel to her beloved memoirs The Liars’ Club and Cherry—and one of the most critically acclaimed books of the year—Lit is about getting drunk and getting sober; becoming a mother by letting go of a mother; learning to write by learning to live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Boston Globe calls Lit a book that “reminds us not only how compelling personal stories can be, but how, in the hands of a master, they can transmute into the highest art." The New York Times Book Review calls it “a master class on the art of the memoir” in its Top 10 Books of 2009 Citation. Michiko Kakutani calls it “a book that lassos you, hogties your emotions and won’t let you go” in her New York Times review. And Susan Cheever states, simply, that Lit is “the best book about being a woman in America I have read in years."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the New York Times, Lit was named a Best Book of 2009 by the New Yorker (Reviewer Favorite), Entertainment Weekly (Top 10), Time (Top 10), the Washington Post, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Chicago Tribune, the Christian Science Monitor, Slate, the St. Louis Post Dispatch, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, and the Seattle Times.</description>

  <description>Lilith Iyapo has just lost her husband and son when atomic fire consumes Earth—the last stage of the planet’s final war. Hundreds of years later Lilith awakes, deep in the hold of a massive alien spacecraft piloted by the Oankali—who arrived just in time to save humanity from extinction. They have kept Lilith and other survivors asleep for centuries, as they learned whatever they could about Earth. Now it is time for Lilith to lead them back to her home world, but life among the Oankali on the newly resettled planet will be nothing like it was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oankali survive by genetically merging with primitive civilizations—whether their new hosts like it or not. For the first time since the nuclear holocaust, Earth will be inhabited. Grass will grow, animals will run, and people will learn to survive the planet’s untamed wilderness. But their children will not be human. Not exactly.</description>

  <description>Credited with sparking the current memoir explosion, Mary Karr’s &lt;em&gt;The Liars’ Club&lt;/em&gt; spent more than a year at the top of the New York Times list. She followed with two other smash bestsellers: &lt;em&gt;Cherry&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lit&lt;/em&gt;, which were critical hits as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For thirty years Karr has also taught the form, winning graduate teaching prizes for her highly selective seminar at Syracuse, where she mentored such future hit authors as Cheryl Strayed, Keith Gessen, and Koren Zailckas. In &lt;em&gt;The Art of Memoir&lt;/em&gt;, she synthesizes her expertise as professor and therapy patient, writer and spiritual seeker, recovered alcoholic and “black belt sinner,” providing a unique window into the mechanics and art of the form that is as irreverent, insightful, and entertaining as her own work in the genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anchored by excerpts from her favorite memoirs and anecdotes from fellow writers’ experience, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Memoir&lt;/em&gt; lays bare Karr’s own process. (Plus all those inside stories about how she dealt with family and friends get told— and the dark spaces in her own skull probed in depth.) As she breaks down the key elements of great literary memoir, she breaks open our concepts of memory and identity, and illuminates the cathartic power of reflecting on the past; anybody with an inner life or complicated history, whether writer or reader, will relate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joining such classics as Stephen King’s &lt;em&gt;On Writing&lt;/em&gt; and Anne Lamott’s &lt;em&gt;Bird by Bird, The Art of Memoir&lt;/em&gt; is an elegant and accessible exploration of one of today’s most popular literary forms—a tour de force from an accomplished master pulling back the curtain on her craft.</description>

  <description>The world we knew is gone. What world will rise in its place? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Twelve have been destroyed and the terrifying hundred-year reign of darkness that descended upon the world has ended. The survivors are stepping outside their walls, determined to build society anew—and daring to dream of a hopeful future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But far from them, in a dead metropolis, he waits: Zero. The First. Father of the Twelve. The anguish that shattered his human life haunts him, and the hatred spawned by his transformation burns bright. His fury will be quenched only when he destroys Amy—humanity’s only hope, the Girl from Nowhere who grew up to rise against him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last time light and dark will clash, and at last Amy and her friends will know their fate.</description>

  <description>In his internationally bestselling and critically acclaimed novel &lt;i&gt;The Passage&lt;/i&gt;, Justin Cronin constructed an unforgettable world transformed by a government experiment gone horribly wrong. Now the scope widens and the intensity deepens as the epic story surges forward with &lt;i&gt;The Twelve&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the present day, as the man-made apocalypse unfolds, three strangers navigate the chaos. Lila, a doctor and an expectant mother, is so shattered by the spread of violence and infection that she continues to plan for her child’s arrival even as society dissolves around her. Kittridge, known to the world as “Last Stand in Denver,” has been forced to flee his stronghold and is now on the road, dodging the infected, armed but alone and well aware that a tank of gas will get him only so far. April is a teenager fighting to guide her little brother safely through a landscape of death and ruin. These three will learn that they have not been fully abandoned—and that in connection lies hope, even on the darkest of nights.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One hundred years in the future, Amy and the others fight on for humankind’s salvation...unaware that the rules have changed. The enemy has evolved, and a dark new order has arisen with a vision of the future infinitely more horrifying than man’s extinction. If the Twelve are to fall, one of those united to vanquish them will have to pay the ultimate price.</description>

  <description>Like most kids, Katie was a picky eater. She'd sit at the table in silent protest, hide uneaten toast in her bedroom, listen to parental threats that she'd have to eat it for breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in any life a set of circumstance can collide, and normal behavior might soon shade into something sinister, something deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lighter Than My Shadow &lt;/i&gt;is a hand-drawn story of struggle and recovery, a trip into the black heart of a taboo illness, an exposure of those who are so weak as to prey on the vulnerable, and an inspiration to anybody who believes in the human power to endure towards happiness.</description>

  <description>A melancholic memoir of saying goodbye to the familiar Road trips, drunken concerts, and late-night make-out sessions all swirl together in this coming-of-age graphic novel by &lt;i&gt;King Cat&lt;/i&gt; cartoonist John Porcellino. Tackling the pain and uncertainty of the pivotal summer before college, Porcellino's sad and beautiful story is drawn in his sincere, minimalist style. Deceptively and charmingly simple, &lt;i&gt;Perfect Example&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of Porcellino's self-published &lt;i&gt;King Cat&lt;/i&gt; comics, which have won over thousands of readers with their honesty, empathy, and sincerity.</description>

  <description>In 1976, Ben Martini was diagnosed with schizophrenia. A decade later, his brother Olivier was told he had the same disease. For the past thirty years the Martini family has struggled to comprehend and cope with a devastating illness, frustrated by a health care system lacking in resources and empathy, the imperfect science of medication, and the strain of mental illness on familial relationships.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout it all, Olivier, an accomplished visual artist, drew. His sketches, comic strips, and portraits document his experience with, and capture the essence of, this all too frequently misunderstood disease. In "Bitter Medicine," Olivier's poignant graphic narrative runs alongside and communicates with a written account of the past three decades by his younger brother, award-winning author and playwright Clem Martini. The result is a layered family memoir that faces head-on the stigma attached to mental illness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shot through with wry humour and unapologetic in its politics, "Bitter Medicine" is the story of the Martini family, a polemical and poetic portrait of illness, and a vital and timely call for action.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;A guide to the art of personal writing, by the author of &lt;i&gt;Fierce Attachments&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The End of the Novel of Love&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All narrative writing must pull from the raw material of life a tale that will shape experience, transform event, deliver a bit of wisdom. In a story or a novel the "I" who tells this tale can be, and often is, an unreliable narrator but in nonfiction the reader must always be persuaded that the narrator is speaking truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does one pull from one's own boring, agitated self the truth-speaker who will tell the story a personal narrative needs to tell? That is the question &lt;i&gt;The Situation and the Story&lt;/i&gt; asks--and answers. Taking us on a reading tour of some of the best memoirs and essays of the past hundred years, Gornick traces the changing idea of self that has dominated the century, and demonstrates the enduring truth-speaker to be found in the work of writers as diverse as Edmund Gosse, Joan Didion, Oscar Wilde, James Baldwin, or Marguerite Duras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book, which grew out of fifteen years teaching in MFA programs, is itself a model of the lucid intelligence that has made Gornick one of our most admired writers of nonfiction. In it, she teaches us to write by teaching us how to read: how to recognize truth when we hear it in the writing of others and in our own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This book feels like a good lecture or a marinade made by a talented cook. You don't so much read it as absorb it and its wisdom. I have learned from Gornick, and appreciate the lesson. The only downside is a feeling of lack of passion for creative nonfiction. Worthwhile nonetheless. ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Poetic musings on illness and the art of getting by from a mini-comics master&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Hospital Suite&lt;/i&gt; is a landmark work by the celebrated cartoonist and small-press legend John Porcellino—an autobiographical collection detailing his struggles with illness in the 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;br /&gt;     In 1997, John began to have severe stomach pain. He soon found out he needed emergency surgery to remove a benign tumor from his small intestine. In the wake of the surgery, he had numerous health complications that led to a flare-up of his preexisting tendencies toward anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. &lt;i&gt;The Hospital Suite&lt;/i&gt; is Porcellino’s response to these experiences—simply told stories drawn in the honest, heart-wrenching style of his much-loved &lt;i&gt;King-Cat &lt;/i&gt;mini-comics. His gift for spare yet eloquent candor makes &lt;i&gt;The Hospital Suite&lt;/i&gt; an intimate portrayal of one person’s experiences that is also intensely relatable.&lt;br /&gt;     Porcellino’s work is lauded for its universality and quiet, clear-eyed contemplation of everyday life. &lt;i&gt;The Hospital Suite&lt;/i&gt; is a testimony to this subtle strength, making his struggles with the medical system and its consequences for his mental health accessible and engaging.</description>

  <description>For readers of Lena Dunham, Mindy Kaling, and #Girlboss, a hilarious—yet heartfelt—guide to growing up and taking your place in the world by the popular comedian and author of the highly praised &lt;em&gt;Agorafabulous!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the practical aspects of new adulthood can be nerve-wracking—dating, job-hunting, money-managing—the most important task of all is figuring out who you are and where you fit in the world. Author and comedian Sara Benincasa, now in her mid-thirties, had an absolutely harrowing early twenties and now, on the other side, she has a LOT of hard-earned wisdom and common sense to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Real Artists Have Day Jobs&lt;/em&gt; includes 52 witty, provocative essays on how to live like a real adult—especially for those who have chosen a slightly more offbeat path to get there. Chock full of information and advice, Sara’s warm, smart, empathetic, and quirky voice is relatable to everyone from twenty-somethings and recent college grads to anyone a bit older who’s still trying to figure things out. While Sara doesn’t have all of life’s answers, this indispensable book has more than its share!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essays include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to Read a Book, Real Artists Have Day Jobs, The Power of Being a Dork, Put Your Clutter in Purgatory, Ask for Exactly What You Want, Elect Your Own Executive Board.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I subscribe to the notion that if you can laugh at the shittiest moments in your life,you can transcend them. And if other people can laugh at your awful shit as well, then I guess you can officially call yourself a comedian.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Boston, a college student fears leaving her own room—even to use the toilet. In Pennsylvania, a meek personal assistant finally confronts a perpetually enraged gay spiritual guru. In Texas, a rookie high school teacher deals with her male student’s unusually, er, hard personal problem. Sara Benincasa has been that terrified student, that embattled employee, that confused teacher—and so much more. Her hilarious memoir chronicles her attempts to forge a wonderfully weird adulthood in the midst of her lifelong struggle with agoraphobia, depression, and unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relatable, unpretentious, and unsentimental, &lt;em&gt;Agorafabulous!&lt;/em&gt; celebrates eccentricity, resilience, and the power of humor to light up even the darkest corners of our lives. (There are also some sexy parts, but they’re really awkward. Like really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; awkward.)</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Nobel Prize–winning author José Saramago, a magnificent, mesmerizing parable of loss&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A city is hit by an epidemic of "white blindness" that spares no one. Authorities confine the blind to an empty mental hospital, but there the criminal element holds everyone captive, stealing food rations and assaulting women. There is one eyewitness to this nightmare who guides her charges—among them a boy with no mother, a girl with dark glasses, a dog of tears—through the barren streets, and their procession becomes as uncanny as the surroundings are harrowing. As &lt;i&gt;Blindness&lt;/i&gt; reclaims the age-old story of a plague, it evokes the vivid and trembling horrors of the twentieth century, leaving readers with a powerful vision of the human spirit that's bound both by weakness and exhilarating strength.</description>

  <description>A tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that, despite its profound flaws, gave the author the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeannette Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were both their curse and their salvation. Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an "excitement addict." Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story.</description>

  <description>“It took courage to do what Spalding did—courage to make theatre so naked and unadorned, to expose himself in this way and fight the demons in public. In doing so, he entered our hearts—my heart—because he made his struggle my struggle. His life became my life.”—Eric Bogosian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Virtuosic. A master writer, reporter, comic and playwright. Spalding Gray is a sit-down monologist with the soul of a stand-up comedian. A contemporary Gulliver, he travels the globe in search of experience and finds the ridiculous.”—&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2004, we mourned the loss of one of America’s true theatrical innovators. Spalding Gray took his own life by jumping from the Staten Island ferry into the waters of New York Harbor, finally succumbing to the impossible notion that he could in fact swim to Cambodia. At a memorial gathering for family, friends and fans at Lincoln Center in New York, his widow expressed the need to honor Gray’s legacy as an artist and writer for his children, as well as for future generations of fans and readers. Originally published in 1985, &lt;i&gt;Swimming to Cambodia&lt;/i&gt; is reissued here 20 years later in a new edition as a tribute to Gray’s singular artistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writer, actor and performer, &lt;b&gt;Spalding Gray&lt;/b&gt; is the author of &lt;i&gt;Sex and Death to the Age 14&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;Monster in a Box&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;It’s a Slippery Slope&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;Gray’s Anatomy&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Morning, Noon and Night&lt;/i&gt;, among other works. His appearance in &lt;i&gt;The Killing Fields&lt;/i&gt; was the inspiration for his &lt;i&gt;Swimming to Cambodia&lt;/i&gt;, which was also filmed by Jonathan Demme.</description>

  <description>Carolyn's not so different from the other human beings around her. She's sure of it. She likes guacamole and cigarettes and steak. She knows how to use a phone. She even remembers what clothes are for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, she was a normal American herself, once. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was a long time ago, of course—before the time she calls “adoption day,” when she and a dozen other children found themselves being raised by a man they learned to call Father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Father could do strange things. He could call light from darkness. Sometimes he raised the dead. And when he was disobeyed, the consequences were terrible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the years since Father took her in, Carolyn hasn't gotten out much. Instead, she and her adopted siblings have been raised according to Father's ancient Pelapi customs. They've studied the books in his library and learned some of the secrets behind his equally ancient power. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, they've wondered if their cruel tutor might secretly be God. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Father is missing. And if God truly is dead, the only thing that matters is who will inherit his library—and with it, power over all of creation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Carolyn gathers the tools she needs for the battle to come, fierce competitors for this prize align against her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Carolyn can win. She's sure of it. What she doesn't realize is that her victory may come at an unacceptable price—because in becoming a God, she's forgotten a great deal about being human.</description>

  <description>Alcohol was "the gasoline of all adventure" for Sarah Hepola. She spent her evenings at cocktail parties and dark bars where she proudly stayed till last call. Drinking felt like freedom, part of her birthright as a strong, enlightened twenty-first-century woman. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there was a price. She often blacked out, waking up with a blank space where four hours should have been. Mornings became detective work on her own life. What did I say last night? How did I meet that guy? She apologized for things she couldn't remember doing, as though she were cleaning up after an evil twin. Publicly, she covered her shame with self-deprecating jokes, and her career flourished, but as the blackouts accumulated, she could no longer avoid a sinking truth. The fuel she thought she needed was draining her spirit instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A memoir of unblinking honesty and poignant, laugh-out-loud humor, &lt;i&gt;Blackout&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a woman stumbling into a new kind of adventure—the sober life she never wanted. Shining a light into her blackouts, she discovers the person she buried, as well as the confidence, intimacy, and creativity she once believed came only from a bottle. Her tale will resonate with anyone who has been forced to reinvent or struggled in the face of necessary change. It's about giving up the thing you cherish most—but getting yourself back in return.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Keep your eyes peeled for a small black iron door.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down the road from a working-class British pub, along the brick wall of a narrow alley, if the conditions are exactly right, you’ll find the entrance to &lt;i&gt;Slade House&lt;/i&gt;. A stranger will greet you by name and invite you inside. At first, you won’t want to leave. Later, you’ll find that you can’t. Every nine years, the house’s residents—an odd brother and sister—extend a unique invitation to someone who’s different or lonely: a precocious teenager, a recently divorced policeman, a shy college student. But what really goes on inside &lt;i&gt;Slade House&lt;/i&gt;? For those who find out, it’s already too late. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanning five decades, from the last days of the 1970s to the present, leaping genres, and barreling toward an astonishing conclusion, this intricately woven novel will pull you into a reality-warping new vision of the haunted house story—as only David Mitchell could imagine it.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Wake up, genius.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The genius is John Rothstein, an iconic author who created a famous character, Jimmy Gold, but who hasn’t published a book for decades. Morris Bellamy is livid, not just because Rothstein has stopped providing books, but because the nonconformist Jimmy Gold has sold out for a career in advertising. Morris kills Rothstein and empties his safe of cash, yes, but the real treasure is a trove of notebooks containing at least one more Gold novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morris hides the money and the notebooks, and then he is locked away for another crime. Decades later, a boy named Pete Saubers finds the treasure, and now it is Pete and his family that Bill Hodges, Holly Gibney, and Jerome Robinson must rescue from the ever-more deranged and vengeful Morris when he’s released from prison after thirty-five years.</description>

  <description>From the author of the phenomenal #1 New York Times bestseller Tuesdays with Morrie, a novel that explores the unexpected connections of our lives, and the idea that heaven is more than a place; it's an answer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eddie is a wounded war veteran, an old man who has lived, in his mind, an uninspired life. His job is fixing rides at a seaside amusement park. On his 83rd birthday, a tragic accident kills him as he tries to save a little girl from a falling cart. He awakes in the afterlife, where he learns that heaven is not a destination. It's a place where your life is explained to you by five people, some of whom you knew, others who may have been strangers. One by one, from childhood to soldier to old age, Eddie's five people revisit their connections to him on earth, illuminating the mysteries of his "meaningless" life, and revealing the haunting secret behind the eternal question: "Why was I here?"</description>

  <description>Christopher John Francis Boone knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up to 7,057. He relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions. He cannot stand to be touched. And he detests the color yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although gifted with a superbly logical brain, for fifteen-year-old Christopher everyday interactions and admonishments have little meaning. He lives on patterns, rules, and a diagram kept in his pocket. Then one day, a neighbor's dog, Wellington, is killed and his carefully constructive universe is threatened. Christopher sets out to solve the murder in the style of his favourite (logical) detective, Sherlock Holmes. What follows makes for a novel that is funny, poignant and fascinating in its portrayal of a person whose curse and blessing are a mind that perceives the world entirely literally.</description>

  <description>Where the Sidewalk Ends turns forty! Celebrate with this anniversary edition that features an eye-catching commemorative red sticker. This classic poetry collection, which is both outrageously funny and profound, has been the most beloved of Shel Silverstein's poetry books for generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the sidewalk ends, Shel Silverstein's world begins. There you'll meet a boy who turns into a TV set and a girl who eats a whale. The Unicorn and the Bloath live there, and so does Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout who will not take the garbage out. It is a place where you wash your shadow and plant diamond gardens, a place where shoes fly, sisters are auctioned off, and crocodiles go to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shel Silverstein's masterful collection of poems and drawings is one of Parent &amp;amp; Child magazine's 100 Greatest Books for Kids. School Library Journal said, "Silverstein has an excellent sense of rhythm and rhyme and a good ear for alliteration and assonance that make these poems a pleasure to read aloud."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shel Silverstein's incomparable career as a children's book author and illustrator began with Lafcadio, the Lion Who Shot Back. In 1964, Shel's creativity continued to flourish as four more books were published in the same year—Don't Bump the Glump!, A Giraffe and a Half, Who Wants a Cheap Rhinoceros?, and the beloved classic The Giving Tree. Later he continued to build his remarkable body of work with Where the Sidewalk Ends, A Light in the Attic, Falling Up, Every Thing On It, The Missing Piece, The Missing Piece Meets the Big O, and Runny Babbit.</description>

  <description>This is Goethe's first novel, published in 1774. Written in diary form, it tells the tale of an unhappy, passionate young man hopelessly in love with Charlotte, the wife of a friend - a man who he alternately admires and detests. 'The Sorrows of Young Werther' became an important part of the 'Sturm und Drang movement, and greatly influenced later 'Romanticism'. The work is semi-autobiographical - in 1772, two years before the novel was published, Goethe had passed through a similar tempestuous period, when he lost his heart to Charlotte Buff, who was at that time engaged to his friend Johann Christian Kestner.</description>

  <description>The Pulitzer Prize and Drama Critics Circle Award winning play—reissued with an introduction by Arthur Miller (&lt;i&gt;Death of a Salesman&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Crucible&lt;/i&gt;), and Williams’ essay “The World I Live In.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very short list of 20th-century American plays that continue to have the same power and impact as when they first appeared—57 years after its Broadway premiere, Tennessee Williams’ &lt;i&gt;A Streetcar Named Desire&lt;/i&gt; is one of those plays. The story famously recounts how the faded and promiscuous Blanche DuBois is pushed over the edge by her sexy and brutal brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski. &lt;i&gt;Streetcar&lt;/i&gt; launched the careers of Marlon Brando, Jessica Tandy, Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden, and solidified the position of Tennessee Williams as one of the most important young playwrights of his generation, as well as that of Elia Kazan as the greatest American stage director of the ’40s and ’50s.</description>

  <description>The quintessential novel of the Lost Generation, &lt;i&gt;The Sun Also Rises&lt;/i&gt; is one of Ernest Hemingway's masterpieces, and a classic example of his spare but powerful writing style. A poignant look at the disillusionment and angst of the post-World War I generation, the novel introduces two of Hemingway's most unforgettable characters: Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley. The story follows the flamboyant Brett and the hapless Jake as they journey from the wild nightlife of 1920s Paris to the brutal bullfighting rings of Spain with a motley group of expatriates. It is an age of moral bankruptcy, spiritual dissolution, unrealized love, and vanishing illusions. First published in 1926, &lt;i&gt;The Sun Also Rises&lt;/i&gt; helped to establish Hemingway as one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century.</description>

  <description>The &lt;i&gt;Faerie Queene&lt;/i&gt; was the first epic in English and one of the most influential poems in the language for later poets from Milton to Tennyson. Dedicating his work to Elizabeth I, Spenser brilliantly united medieval romance and renaissance epic to expound the glory of the Virgin Queen. The poem recounts the quests of knights including Sir Guyon, Knight of Constance, who resists temptation, and Artegall, Knight of Justice, whose story alludes to the execution of Mary Queen of Scots. &lt;br /&gt;Composed as an overt moral and political allegory, &lt;i&gt;The Faerie Queene&lt;/i&gt;, with its dramatic episodes of chivalry, pageantry and courtly love, is also a supreme work of atmosphere, colour and sensuous description.</description>

  <description>A meaningful play based on the Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925, in which a Tennessee teacher was tried for teaching evolution. The accused was a slight, frightened man who'd deliberately broken the law. His trial was a Roman circus, the chief gladiators being the two great legal giants of the century. Locked in mortal combat, they bellowed &amp;amp; roared imprecations &amp;amp; abuse. The spectators sat uneasily in the sweltering heat with murder in their hearts, barely restraining themselves. America's freedom was at stake.</description>

  <description>"I believe that the reader will discover here the essential nature of one of the strangest and most awful chapters in human history," Arthur Miller wrote of his classic play about the witch-hunts and trials in seventeenth-century Salem, Massachusetts. Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminates the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in 1953, &lt;i&gt;The Crucible&lt;/i&gt; is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's "witch-hunts" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing, "Political opposition... is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WIth an introduction by Christopher Bigsby.&lt;br /&gt;(back cover)</description>

  <description>Stories of famously eccentric Princetonians abound—such as that of chemist Hubert Alyea, the model for &lt;i&gt;The Absent-Minded Professor&lt;/i&gt;, or Ralph Nader, said to have had his own key to the library as an undergraduate. Or the "Phantom of Fine Hall," a figure many students had seen shuffling around the corridors of the math and physics building wearing purple sneakers and writing numerology treatises on the blackboards. The Phantom was John Nash, one of the most brilliant mathematicians of his generation, who had spiraled into schizophrenia in the 1950s. His most important work had been in game theory, which by the 1980s was underpinning a large part of economics. When the Nobel Prize committee began debating a prize for game theory, Nash's name inevitably came up—only to be dismissed, since the prize clearly could not go to a madman. But in 1994 Nash, in remission from schizophrenia, shared the Nobel Prize in economics for work done some 45 years previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Economist and journalist Sylvia Nasar has written a biography of Nash that looks at all sides of his life. She gives an intelligent, understandable exposition of his mathematical ideas and a picture of schizophrenia that is evocative but decidedly unromantic. Her story of the machinations behind Nash's Nobel is fascinating and one of very few such accounts available in print (the CIA could learn a thing or two from the Nobel committees).</description>

  <description>Maybe it was a grandparent, or a teacher or a colleague. Someone older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, and gave you sound advice to help you make your way through it. For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded. Wouldn't you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life. Knowing he was dying of ALS - or motor neurone disease - Mitch visited Morrie in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final 'class': lessons in how to live.</description>

  <description>Isserley picks up hitchhikers with big muscles. She, herself, is tiny-like a kid peering up over the steering wheel. She has a remarkable face and wears the thickest corrective lenses anyone has ever seen. Her posture is suggestive of some spinal problem. Her breasts are perfect; perhaps implants. She is strangely erotic yet somehow grotesque, vulnerable yet threatening. Her hitchhikers are a mixed bunch of men-trailer trash and travelling postgrads, thugs and philosophers. But Isserley is only interested in whether they have families and whether they have muscles. Then, it's only a question of how long she can endure her pain--physical and spiritual--and their conversation. Michel Faber's work has been described as a combination of Roald Dahl and Franz Kafka, as Somerset Maugham shacking up with Ian McEwan. At once humane and horrifying, Under the Skin takes us on a heart-thumping ride through dangerous territory - our own moral instincts and the boundaries of compassion.</description>

  <description>Sara Crewe, an exceptionally intelligent and imaginative student at Miss Minchin's Select Seminary for Young Ladies, is devastated when her adored, indulgent father dies. Now penniless and banished to a room in the attic, Sara is demeaned, abused, and forced to work as a servant. How this resourceful girl's fortunes change again is at the center of &lt;b&gt;A Little Princess&lt;/b&gt;, one of the best-loved stories in all of children's literature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This unique and fully annotated edition appends excerpts from &lt;b&gt;Frances Hodgson Burnett&lt;/b&gt;'s original 1888 novella &lt;b&gt;Sara Crewe&lt;/b&gt; and the stage play that preceded the novel, as well as an early story, "Behind the White Brick," allowing readers to see how A Little Princess evolved. In his delightful introduction, U. C. Knoepflmacher considers the fairy-tale allusions and literary touchstones that place the book among the major works of Victorian literature, and shows it to be an exceptionally rich and resonant novel.</description>

  <description>In Othello, Shakespeare creates a powerful drama of a marriage that begins with fascination (between the exotic Moor Othello and the Venetian lady Desdemona), with elopement, and with intense mutual devotion and that ends precipitately with jealous rage and violent deaths. He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean, moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello's African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine—differences of race, of age, of cultural background—that one should not, perhaps, be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello's standard-bearer, Iago, who hates Othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for Desdemona. As Othello succumbs to Iago's insinuations that Desdemona is unfaithful, fascination—which dominates the early acts of the play—turns to horror, especially for the audience. We are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting Othello in the grip of Iago's schemes; of an innocent Desdemona, who has given herself up entirely to her love for Othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults, the outcome of Othello's mistaken convictions about her faithlessness.</description>
