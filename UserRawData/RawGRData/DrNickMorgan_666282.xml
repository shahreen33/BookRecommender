  <description>A bold, wry, and intimate graphic memoir about American identity, interracial families, and the realities that divide us, from the acclaimed author of The Sleepwalker’s Guide to Dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“By turns hilarious and heart-rending, it’s exactly the book America needs at this moment.”—Celeste Ng&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Who taught Michael Jackson to dance?” &lt;br /&gt;“Is that how people really walk on the moon?”&lt;br /&gt;“Is it bad to be brown?” &lt;br /&gt;“Are white people afraid of brown people?”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like many six-year-olds, Mira Jacob’s half-Jewish, half-Indian son, Z, has questions about everything. At first they are innocuous enough, but as tensions from the 2016 election spread from the media into his own family, they become much, much more complicated. Trying to answer him honestly, Mira has to think back to where she’s gotten her own answers: her most formative conversations about race, color, sexuality, and, of course, love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“How brown is too brown?”&lt;br /&gt;“Can Indians be racist?”&lt;br /&gt;“What does real love between really different people look like?”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Written with humor and vulnerability, this deeply relatable graphic memoir is a love letter to the art of conversation—and to the hope that hovers in our most difficult questions.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Third Reich at War, a &lt;/i&gt;masterly account of Europe in the age of its global hegemony; the latest volume in the Penguin History of Europe series&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Richard J. Evans, bestselling historian of Nazi Germany, returns with a monumental new addition to the acclaimed Penguin History of Europe series, covering the period from the fall of Napoleon to the outbreak of World War I. Evans’s gripping narrative ranges across a century of social and national conflicts, from the revolutions of 1830 and 1848 to the unification of both Germany and Italy, from the Russo-Turkish wars to the Balkan upheavals that brought this era of relative peace and growing prosperity to an end. Among the great themes it discusses are the decline of religious belief and the rise of secular science and medicine, the journey of art, music, and literature from Romanticism to Modernism, the replacement of old-regime punishments by the modern prison, the end of aristocratic domination and the emergence of industrial society, and the dramatic struggle of feminists for women’s equality and emancipation. Uniting the era’s broad-ranging transformations was the pursuit of power in all segments of life, from the banker striving for economic power to the serf seeking to escape the power of his landlord, from the engineer asserting society’s power over the environment to the psychiatrist attempting to exert science’s power over human nature itself.&lt;br /&gt;       The first single-volume history of the century, this comprehensive and sweeping account gives the reader a magnificently human picture of Europe in the age when it dominated the rest of the globe.</description>

  <description>The #1 New York Times bestselling author of Morning Star returns to the Red Rising universe with the thrilling sequel to Iron Gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a decade Darrow led a revolution against the corrupt color-coded Society. Now, outlawed by the very Republic he founded, he wages a rogue war on Mercury in hopes that he can still salvage the dream of Eo. But as he leaves death and destruction in his wake, is he still the hero who broke the chains? Or will another legend rise to take his place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lysander au Lune, the heir in exile, has returned to the Core. Determined to bring peace back to mankind at the edge of his sword, he must overcome or unite the treacherous Gold families of the Core and face down Darrow over the skies of war-torn Mercury. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But theirs are not the only fates hanging in the balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Luna, Mustang, Sovereign of the Republic, campaigns to unite the Republic behind her husband. Beset by political and criminal enemies, can she outwit her opponents in time to save him? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a Red refugee, young Lyria now stands accused of treason, and her only hope is a desperate escape with unlikely new allies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abducted by a new threat to the Republic, Pax and Electra, the children of Darrow and Sevro, must trust in Ephraim, a thief, for their salvation—and Ephraim must look to them for his chance at redemption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As alliances shift, break, and re-form—and power is seized, lost, and reclaimed—every player is at risk in a game of conquest that could turn the Rising into a new Dark Age.</description>

  <description>Isabella Bird writes of her adventures in a manner that captivates her readers Isabella L Bird (1831 - 1904) was a 19th century British traveler and writer. Since her father was a Church of England priest the family moved many times during her childhood. Bird traveled to Colorado when she heard the air was very healthy. She covered the 800 miles on horseback riding like a man and not sidesaddle. Among The Tibetans begins "The Vale of Kashmir is too well known to require description. It is the 'happy hunting-ground' of the Anglo-Indian sportsman and tourist, the resort of artists and invalids, the home of pashm shawls and exquisitely embroidered fabrics, and the land of Lalla Rookh. Its inhabitants, chiefly Moslems, infamously governed by Hindus, are a feeble race, attracting little interest, valuable to travellers as 'coolies' or porters, and repulsive to them from the mingled cunning and obsequiousness which have been fostered by ages of oppression. But even for them there is the dawn of hope, for the Church Missionary Society has a strong medical and educational mission at the capital, a hospital and dispensary under the charge of a lady M.D. have been opened for women, and a capable and upright 'settlement officer, ' lent by the Indian Government, is investigating the iniquitous land arrangements with a view to a just settlement."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Amaryllis Fox's riveting memoir tells the story of her ten years in the most elite clandestine ops unit of the CIA, hunting the world's most dangerous terrorists in sixteen countries while marrying and giving birth to a daughter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amaryllis Fox was in her last year as an undergraduate at Oxford studying theology and international law when her writing mentor Daniel Pearl was captured and beheaded. Galvanized by this brutality, Fox applied to a master's program in conflict and terrorism at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service, where she created an algorithm that predicted, with uncanny certainty, the likelihood of a terrorist cell arising in any village around the world. At twenty-one, she was recruited by the CIA. Her first assignment was reading and analyzing hundreds of classified cables a day from foreign governments and synthesizing them into daily briefs for the president. Her next assignment was at the Iraq desk in the Counterterrorism center. At twenty-two, she was fast-tracked into advanced operations training, sent from Langley to "the Farm," where she lived for six months in a simulated world learning how to use a Glock, how to get out of flexicuffs while locked in the trunk of a car, how to withstand torture, and the best ways to commit suicide in case of captivity. At the end of this training she was deployed as a spy under non-official cover--the most difficult and coveted job in the field as an art dealer specializing in tribal and indigenous art and sent to infiltrate terrorist networks in remote areas of the Middle East and Asia. &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Life Undercover&lt;/i&gt; is exhilarating, intimate, fiercely intelligent--an impossible to put down record of an extraordinary life, and of Amaryllis Fox's astonishing courage and passion.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book reads like a spy thriller, almost. Something is missing, and I'm not quite sure what it is. The book at times felt like a recruiting infomercial for the CIA, and at other times like a real memoir. I couldn't tell if Fox's near-lifelong habit of secrecy made it hard for her to go into en...]]>

  <description>In the early 1900s, teenaged Sunja, the adored daughter of a crippled fisherman, falls for a wealthy stranger at the seashore near her home in Korea. He promises her the world, but when she discovers she is pregnant--and that her lover is married--she refuses to be bought. Instead, she accepts an offer of marriage from a gentle, sickly minister passing through on his way to Japan. But her decision to abandon her home, and to reject her son's powerful father, sets off a dramatic saga that will echo down through the generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richly told and profoundly moving, Pachinko is a story of love, sacrifice, ambition, and loyalty. From bustling street markets to the halls of Japan's finest universities to the pachinko parlors of the criminal underworld, Lee's complex and passionate characters--strong, stubborn women, devoted sisters and sons, fathers shaken by moral crisis--survive and thrive against the indifferent arc of history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A ruthless young assassin's journey for revenge comes to a stunning end in the conclusion of this acclaimed epic fantasy trilogy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Republic of Itreya is in chaos. Mia Corvere has assassinated Cardinal Duomo and rumors of Consul Scaeva’s death ripple through the street of Godsgrave like wildfire. But buried beneath those same streets, deep in the ancient city’s bones, lies a secret that will change the Republic forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mia and her brother Jonnen must journey through the depths of the ancient metropolis. Their quest will take them through the Godsgrave underdark, across the Sea of Swords, back to the library of the Quiet Mountain and the poisoned blades of Mia’s old mentors, and at last the fabled Crown of the Moon. There, Mia will at last discover the origins of the darkin, and learn the destiny that lies in store for her and her world. But with the three suns now in descent, and Truedark on the horizon, will she survive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and internationally bestselling author Jay Kristoff’s writing has been praised by critics and readers alike and has won many awards, including five Aurealis Awards, an ABIA, and David Gemmell Morningstar and Legend awards.</description>

      <![CDATA[Often these fantasy trilogies go wrong trying to outdo themselves in the third volume. They start with a cracking good plot in Vol 1, raise the stakes in Vol 2, and then turn all the characters into gods, or start a meta-commentary in Vol 3, because their authors seem to believe that Vol 3 has to...]]>

  <description>What if you could have a meaningful, well-paid career without a daily commute to a physical office? What if your team or organization could work well together even when physically apart? What if your organization’s “work from home” policy was a competitive advantage, while also helping address important social, diversity, urban planning and environmental issues?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are working in, joining, or starting a distributed team, this book is for you. This easy-to-read book has short chapters with practical takeaways on topics like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Why distributed teams are good for business, diversity, employee retention, society and the environment. &lt;br /&gt;* How to run efficient video calls and meetings while dealing with lots of email and group chat.&lt;br /&gt;* How to handle complex interpersonal topics such as hiring, firing, one-on-ones, reviews, trust and group culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawn from 26+ years working in distributed organizations, this book gathers what did--and did not--work from my own hard-learned lessons, as well as learnings from company founders, hedge fund managers, software developers, data scientists, accountants, book publishers, economists, political organizers, recruiters, military personnel, executive assistants, therapists and medical technicians.</description>

      <![CDATA[Nancy's done it again -- another masterful book on presentations, this time specifically for data geeks. She starts with what's basically the 3-act story structure, with numbers: situation, complication (but), resolution (so). Use the what, why, how structure: we need to do x, because y, how z. A...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An insightful, real-world look at the skills today's global leadership demands&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Leading Across Borders&lt;/i&gt; is the leadership guide for the new business environment. The world's economic center of gravity is shifting at a rapid pace - huge emerging economies have already emerged. As businesses operate in an increasingly global context, the most successful leaders are able to see through the eyes of others and to hear the voices of customers and colleagues from around the world. They build their own personal networks, navigate differences, and work effectively across new borders - both the physical borders between countries and the limits of old leadership paradigms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book features direct input from people in critical roles around the world, advice based on deep practical experience, and new data that identifies the distinctive challenges of leading in an environment becoming more thoroughly interdependent every day. There is valuable advice for anyone taking on a global leadership role. You'll find strategies and tools for working across cultures, leading inclusively, running a matrix team, innovating, integrating an acquisition, and making tough ethical choices. Each chapter challenges established leadership models and shares hard-won expertise in dealing effectively with a changing reality that includes both fast-growth and slow-growth markets. You will learn how to serve more numerous stakeholders and to achieve your goals in a complex organizational structure without having direct lines of authority. This insightful guide helps you work more effectively at the self, team, and organizational levels, so you can get things done and grow your business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The increasing importance of China, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and other developing economies has opened the world of business leadership far beyond our own borders. This book gives you a framework for coordinating it all, and being the leader your organization needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operate insightfully at the personal level in order to better lead others Shape, motivate, and drive your global team to exceptional performance Navigate differences in culture, language, economics, and more Exercise your vision, influence, and expertise to lead your organization forward The trend toward global leadership has emerged full-blown amidst the rising global economy. Today's leadership must understand how to work effectively and efficiently across a variety of contexts. &lt;i&gt;Leading Across Borders&lt;/i&gt; provides a roadmap to the new leadership paradigm, helping you expand your own skillset and create forward momentum.</description>

And how do you tell them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Stories That Stick&lt;/em&gt;, Kindra Hall, professional storyteller and nationally-known speaker, reveals the four unique stories you can use to differentiate, captivate, and elevate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Value Story, to convince customers they need what you provide;&lt;br /&gt;the Founder Story, to persuade investors and customers your organization is worth the investment;&lt;br /&gt;the Purpose Story, to align and inspire your employees and internal customers; and&lt;br /&gt;the Customer Story, to allow those who use your product or service to share their authentic experiences with others.&lt;br /&gt;Telling these stories well is a simple, accessible skill anyone can develop. With case studies, company profiles, and anecdotes backed with original research, Hall presents storytelling as the underutilized talent that separates the good from the best in business. She offers specific, actionable steps readers can take to find, craft, and leverage the stories they already have and simply aren’t telling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every person, every organization has at least four stories at their disposal. Will you tell yours?</description>

  <description>Great leaders are great storytellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to disrupt, inspire, and persuade—go beyond the data. You need a story. As a leader, you can’t ask your team to invest in a vision or a strategy they don’t fully understand or believe in—especially when your ideas challenge the status quo. At a time when disruption is redefining every quadrant of life, those who can get their story straight can win over even the most reluctant audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on 30,000 years of storytelling, Story 10x delivers a fresh approach for how to inspire and influence in the digital age. Most people think of storytelling as “once upon” fairy tales or how to tell a better anecdote. In reality, getting clear on your strategic narrative is how you navigate hypergrowth. In these pages, you’ll learn how to craft an Undeniable Story—a 3-step narrative framework for any high-stakes presentation. Apply the same strategies embraced by Google, Facebook, and Hulu to communicate some of their biggest breakthroughs. Invest in your story, and you can literally bend the limits of time, money, and people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discover your Undeniable Story. Next time you’re in front of senior leaders, investors, customers, or your team, make it difficult—if not impossible—for them to reject the future you’re trying to create. Harness the magic of Story 10x, and turn the impossible into the inevitable.</description>

  <description>Anyone who designs anything to be used by humans -- from physical objects to computer programs to conceptual tools -- must read this book, and it is an equally tremendous read for anyone who has to use anything created by another human. It could forever change how you experience and interact with your physical surroundings, open your eyes to the perversity of bad design and the desirability of good design, and raise your expectations about how things &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B &amp;amp; W photographs and illustrations throughout.</description>

      <![CDATA[This classic book on design was updated about 5 years ago, and it was high time. Not because the principles had changed, but because the examples were all out of date, and it was astonishing how much technology has changed the landscape in the last couple of decades. <br /><br />Norman's great insight is tha...]]>

  <description>This book is about creating your life just as the artist creates a painting, a composer writes a symphony, or the poet writes a poem. Robert Fritz further develops his special insights that he introduced in his best selling book The Path of Least Resistance. In Your Life As Art, Fritz shows the relationship among the mechanics, the orientation, and the depth of the human spirit within the creative process, and how your life itself can be made like a work of art. Your Life As Art breaks new ground, shakes up the status quo, and, at once, is common sense and revolutionary insight that can change the way you understand the dynamics of your life-building process.</description>

  <description>From bestselling author Neal Stephenson and critically acclaimed historical and contemporary commercial novelist Nicole Galland comes a captivating and complex near-future thriller combining history, science, magic, mystery, intrigue, and adventure that questions the very foundations of the modern world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Melisande Stokes, an expert in linguistics and languages, accidently meets military intelligence operator Tristan Lyons in a hallway at Harvard University, it is the beginning of a chain of events that will alter their lives and human history itself. The young man from a shadowy government entity approaches Mel, a low-level faculty member, with an incredible offer. The only condition: she must sign a nondisclosure agreement in return for the rather large sum of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tristan needs Mel to translate some very old documents, which, if authentic, are earth-shattering. They prove that magic actually existed and was practiced for centuries. But the arrival of the scientific revolution and the Age of Enlightenment weakened its power and endangered its practitioners. Magic stopped working altogether in 1851, at the time of the Great Exhibition at London’s Crystal Palace—the world’s fair celebrating the rise of industrial technology and commerce. Something about the modern world "jams" the "frequencies" used by magic, and it’s up to Tristan to find out why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so the Department of Diachronic Operations—D.O.D.O. —gets cracking on its real mission: to develop a device that can bring magic back, and send Diachronic Operatives back in time to keep it alive . . . and meddle with a little history at the same time. But while Tristan and his expanding operation master the science and build the technology, they overlook the mercurial—and treacherous—nature of the human heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with the genius, complexity, and innovation that characterize all of Neal Stephenson’s work and steeped with the down-to-earth warmth and humor of Nicole Galland’s storytelling style, this exciting and vividly realized work of science fiction will make you believe in the impossible, and take you to places—and times—beyond imagining.</description>

And it's a page-turner, especially after it get going in the second act. The last 400 pages or so are really splendid; the set-up is a bit labored and far-f...]]>

Jacka stays true to the arc of this story, pulling no punches, and his storytelling skills are excellent. The suspense is killing me, or at least causing me to lose sleep.]]>

He's been free of him for many years, but now the only way to keep his friends from being harmed is to again work for Richard and his deadly ally. Even worse, he’s forced to bring the Light mage Anne into this servitude as well.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After weeks of being hunted and finally cornered into what he thought was his last stand, Alex never thought his life would be spared—and never anticipated at what price. This time, the diviner can see no way out...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Mage Alex Verus is back in the seventh in the “gorgeously realized”* urban fantasy series from the national bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Veiled&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’m used to people wanting me dead. But, this time, I’m not the only one on the hit list—and time is running out...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Diviner Alex Verus finally made one too many enemies on the Council of Mages, and now one of them is angry enough to have him executed. Fighting for his life is nothing new, but this kill order also calls for the death of Alex’s dependents—and there’s no way that he’ll let Luna, Anne, and Vari take the heat.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; With only a week before he’s history, Alex will have to figure out how to disassociate himself from his friends, scrounge up allies on the Council, and hopefully keep his head attached to his body. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But saving himself is going to bring him into direct opposition with his former master and the Dark mages surrounding him. And, this time, escaping with his life might mean losing his soul...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;National bestselling author Benedict Jacka returns to the world of Alex Verus...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I thought I’d escaped my past. But my old master is back and making a new play for power. And he’s not the only one targeting me…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diviner Alex Verus and the Council that governs the magical community have never gotten along. But with his former teacher back in Britain, Alex is in desperate need of allies, and he’ll do whatever it takes to get them—even if it means accepting a job with the Keepers, enforcing magical law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex forms an uneasy alliance with his new partner, Caldera, but his attempt at legitimacy quickly turns lethal when a mission puts him in possession of an item that factions both inside and outside of the Council would kill to get their hands on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again caught in the middle of a deadly conflict, Alex will need all his abilities to figure out who his friends are—especially when enemies are hiding on all sides…</description>

Now she's in serious trouble, but wants nothing to do with him. Alex has to start wondering if Anne's problem is really with him - or if there's a secret she's trying to hide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, rumours are swirling around London that Alex's former master may be back in town.

  <description>I don’t publicly advertise that I’m a mage, but I don’t exactly hide it either, and one of the odd things I’ve learnt over the years is just how much you can get away with if you’re blatant enough. Hide something behind smoke and mirrors and make people work to find it, and they’ll tear the place down looking for what’s there.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alex Verus is a diviner who can see probable futures—a talent that’s gotten him out of many a tough scrape. But this time, he may be in over his head. Alex was once apprenticed to a Dark mage, and in his service he did a lot of things he isn’t proud of.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As rumors swirl that his old master is coming back, Alex comes face to face with his misdeeds in the form of a young adept whose only goal is to get revenge. Alex has changed his life for the better, but he’s afraid of what his friends—including his apprentice, Luna—will think of his past. But if they’re going to put themselves at risk, they need to know exactly what kind of man they’re fighting for...</description>

  <description>Long defined by popular film adaptations that have reductively portrayed &lt;em&gt;Aladdin&lt;/em&gt; as a simplistic rags-to-riches story for children, this work of dazzling imagination—and occasionally dark themes—finally comes to vibrant new life. “In the capital of one of China’s vast and wealthy kingdoms,” begins Shahrazad— the tale’s imperiled-yet-ingenious storyteller—there lived Aladdin, a rebellious fifteen-year-old who falls prey to a double-crossing sorcerer and is ultimately saved by the ruse of a princess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best-loved folktales of all time, &lt;em&gt;Aladdin&lt;/em&gt; has been capturing the imagination of readers, illustrators, and filmmakers since an eighteenth-century French publication first added the tale to &lt;em&gt;The Arabian Nights&lt;/em&gt;. Yet, modern English translators have elided the story’s enchanting whimsy and mesmerizing rhythms. Now, translator Yasmine Seale and literary scholar Paulo Lemos Horta offer an elegant, eminently readable rendition of &lt;em&gt;Aladdin&lt;/em&gt; in what is destined to be a classic for decades to come.</description>

The story is at once seemingly the most typical of the Nights and at the same time somehow different. For Disney, it's the essence of the Arabian Nights, and many artists have...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The dramatic real life stories of four young people caught up in the mass exodus of Shanghai in the wake of China's 1949 Communist revolution--a precursor to the struggles faced by emigrants today. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shanghai has historically been China's jewel, its richest, most modern and westernized city. The bustling metropolis was home to sophisticated intellectuals, entrepreneurs, and a thriving middle class when Mao's proletarian revolution emerged victorious from the long civil war. Terrified of the horrors the Communists would wreak upon their lives, citizens of Shanghai who could afford to fled in every direction. Seventy years later, members of the last generation to fully recall this massive exodus have revealed their stories to Chinese American journalist Helen Zia, who interviewed hundreds of exiles about their journey through one of the most tumultuous events of the twentieth century. From these moving accounts, Zia weaves together the stories of four young Shanghai residents who wrestled with the decision to abandon everything for an uncertain life as refugees in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benny, who as a teenager became the unwilling heir to his father's dark wartime legacy, must decide either to escape to Hong Kong or navigate the intricacies of a newly Communist China. The resolute Annuo, forced to flee her home with her father, a defeated Nationalist official, becomes an unwelcome exile in Taiwan. The financially strapped Ho fights deportation from the U.S. in order to continue his studies while his family struggles at home. And Bing, given away by her poor parents, faces the prospect of a new life among strangers in America. The lives of these men and women are marvelously portrayed, revealing the dignity and triumph of personal survival.</description>

  <description>Alex Verus is part of a world hidden in plain sight, running a magic shop in London. And while Alex's own powers aren't as showy as some mages, he does have the advantage of foreseeing the possible future--allowing him to pull off operations that have a million-to-one-chance of success. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Alex is approached by multiple factions to crack open a relic from a long-ago mage war, he knows that whatever's inside must be beyond powerful. And thanks to his abilities, Alex can predict that by taking the job, his odds of survival are about to go from slim to none...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An East Asian fantasy reimagining of The Evil Queen legend about one peasant girl's quest to become Empress--and the darkness she must unleash to achieve her destiny.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eighteen-year-old Xifeng is beautiful. The stars say she is destined for greatness, that she is meant to be Empress of Feng Lu. But only if she embraces the darkness within her. Growing up as a peasant in a forgotten village on the edge of the map, Xifeng longs to fulfill the destiny promised to her by her cruel aunt, the witch Guma, who has read the cards and seen glimmers of Xifeng's majestic future. But is the price of the throne too high?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because in order to achieve greatness, she must spurn the young man who loves her and exploit the callous magic that runs through her veins--sorcery fueled by eating the hearts of the recently killed. For the god who has sent her on this journey will not be satisfied until his power is absolute.</description>

  <description>All of us are faced countless times with the challenge of persuading others, whether we're trying to win a trivial argument with a friend or convince our coworkers about an important decision. Instead of relying on untrained instinct--and often floundering or failing as a result--we'd win more arguments if we learned the timeless art of verbal persuasion, rhetoric. &lt;i&gt;How to Win an Argument &lt;/i&gt;gathers the rhetorical wisdom of Cicero, ancient Rome's greatest orator, from across his works and combines it with passages from his legal and political speeches to show his powerful techniques in action. The result is an enlightening and entertaining practical introduction to the secrets of persuasive speaking and writing--including strategies that are just as effective in today's offices, schools, courts, and political debates as they were in the Roman forum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Win an Argument&lt;/i&gt; addresses proof based on rational argumentation, character, and emotion; the parts of a speech; the plain, middle, and grand styles; how to persuade no matter what audience or circumstances you face; and more. Cicero's words are presented in lively translations, with illuminating introductions; the book also features a brief biography of Cicero, a glossary, suggestions for further reading, and an appendix of the original Latin texts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astonishingly relevant, this unique anthology of Cicero's rhetorical and oratorical wisdom will be enjoyed by anyone who ever needs to win arguments and influence people--in other words, all of us.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a gentle introduction to the life, works, and strategies of Cicero, one of the greatest orators and rhetoricians of antiquity. You don't learn a huge amount about any of those things; just enough to whet the appetite. But I imagine the author was strictly instructed not to make the book t...]]>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;The Hidden Life of Trees&lt;/i&gt;, Peter Wohlleben shares his deep love of woods and forests and explains the amazing processes of life, death, and regeneration he has observed in the woodland and the amazing scientific processes behind the wonders of which we are blissfully unaware. Much like human families, tree parents live together with their children, communicate with them, and support them as they grow, sharing nutrients with those who are sick or struggling and creating an ecosystem that mitigates the impact of extremes of heat and cold for the whole group. As a result of such interactions, trees in a family or community are protected and can live to be very old. In contrast, solitary trees, like street kids, have a tough time of it and in most cases die much earlier than those in a group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on groundbreaking new discoveries, Wohlleben presents the science behind the secret and previously unknown life of trees and their communication abilities; he describes how these discoveries have informed his own practices in the forest around him. As he says, a happy forest is a healthy forest, and he believes that eco-friendly practices not only are economically sustainable but also benefit the health of our planet and the mental and physical health of all who live on Earth.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Feyre survived Amarantha's clutches to return to the Spring Court—but at a steep cost. Though she now has the powers of the High Fae, her heart remains human, and it can't forget the terrible deeds she performed to save Tamlin's people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nor has Feyre forgotten her bargain with Rhysand, High Lord of the feared Night Court. As Feyre navigates its dark web of politics, passion, and dazzling power, a greater evil looms—and she might be key to stopping it. But only if she can harness her harrowing gifts, heal her fractured soul, and decide how she wishes to shape her future—and the future of a world cleaved in two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With more than a million copies sold of her beloved Throne of Glass series, Sarah J. Maas's masterful storytelling brings this second book in her seductive and action-packed series to new heights.</description>

  <description>Feyre's survival rests upon her ability to hunt and kill – the forest where she lives is a cold, bleak place in the long winter months. So when she spots a deer in the forest being pursued by a wolf, she cannot resist fighting it for the flesh. But to do so, she must kill the predator and killing something so precious comes at a price ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dragged to a magical kingdom for the murder of a faerie, Feyre discovers that her captor, his face obscured by a jewelled mask, is hiding far more than his piercing green eyes would suggest. Feyre's presence at the court is closely guarded, and as she begins to learn why, her feelings for him turn from hostility to passion and the faerie lands become an even more dangerous place. Feyre must fight to break an ancient curse, or she will lose him forever.</description>

      <![CDATA[Beauty and the Beast meets The Hunger Games. I'm all for the current fashion for retelling fairy tales or evoking an historical era with a magical twist -- the results in the hands of Naomi Novik or Katherine Arden are spectacular.

  <description>While working on his book &lt;i&gt;The Life of Arthur Ransome&lt;/i&gt;, Hugh Brogan chanced upon the unfinished scrip of a thirteenth ‘Swallows and Amazons’ story in Ransome’s desk in the Abbot Hall Museum in Cumbria, where it had lain unknown except to a few. It had no title (‘Coots in the North’ is Brogan’s invention) but there were a few preliminary drawings which Ransome might have included had this gem been brought to life in book form. Why he abandoned it is not know, for he left a clear outline of how he intended to go on once the three young Coots – Joe, Bill and Pete – had completed their hair-raising journey as stowaways from Norfolk to the lakes in the North. There, on a salvage mission, they encounter for the first time the intrepid Nancy Blackett.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Coots in the North’ is introduced by Brogan’s lively account of how Arthur Ransome found fame and fortune through the Swallows and Amazons, and is accompanied in this collection by other delights which turned up among Ransome’s papres in the Brotherton Library at Leeds University. An unfinished Victorian ‘Bevis’-style novel yielded two superb stories, complete in themselves – ‘The Cloudburst’ and a fishing tale called ‘The River Comes First’. The Baltic sailing mysteries originally published in Pall Mall Magazine in 1929, ‘Two Shorts and a Long’ and ‘The Unofficial Side’; the Breton ghost story ‘Ankou’, which first appeared in English review in1914; and an eerie cautionary tale of old Russia called ‘The Shepherd’s Pipe’ complete this testament to Ransome’s storytelling genius, which should not be missed by enthusiasts young or old.</description>

      <![CDATA[For fans of Arthur Ransome, this collection of short stories and a sketch of a longer, 13th Swallows and Amazons novel, is bittersweet. The longer novel, one can already see, would have been just as delightful as the others, and full of the kind of adventure that children in the 1930s could appar...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author and neuroscientist Daniel J. Levitin shifts his keen insights from your brain on music to your brain in a sea of details.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The information age is drowning us with an unprecedented deluge of data. At the same time, we’re expected to make more—and faster—decisions about our lives than ever before. No wonder, then, that the average American reports frequently losing car keys or reading glasses, missing appointments, and feeling worn out by the effort required just to keep up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But somehow some people become quite accomplished at managing information flow. In &lt;i&gt;The Organized Mind&lt;/i&gt;, Daniel J. Levitin, PhD, uses the latest brain science to demonstrate how those people excel—and how readers can use their methods to regain a sense of mastery over the way they organize their homes, workplaces, and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With lively, entertaining chapters on everything from the kitchen junk drawer to health care to executive office workflow, Levitin reveals how new research into the cognitive neuroscience of attention and memory can be applied to the challenges of our daily lives. &lt;i&gt;This Is Your Brain on Music&lt;/i&gt; showed how to better play and appreciate music through an understanding of how the brain works. &lt;i&gt;The Organized Mind&lt;/i&gt; shows how to navigate the churning flood of information in the twenty-first century with the same neuroscientific perspective.</description>

  <description>With all the fire and fury fans have come to expect from internationally bestselling author George R. R. Martin, this is the first volume of the definitive two-part history of the Targaryens in Westeros.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Centuries before the events of A Game of Thrones, House Targaryen—the only family of dragonlords to survive the Doom of Valyria—took up residence on Dragonstone. Fire and Blood begins their tale with the legendary Aegon the Conqueror, creator of the Iron Throne, and goes on to recount the generations of Targaryens who fought to hold that iconic seat, all the way up to the civil war that nearly tore their dynasty apart.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What really happened during the Dance of the Dragons? Why did it become so deadly to visit Valyria after the Doom? What is the origin of Daenerys’s three dragon eggs? These are but a few of the questions answered in this essential chronicle, as related by a learned maester of the Citadel and featuring more than eighty all-new black-and-white illustrations by artist Doug Wheatley. Readers have glimpsed small parts of this narrative in such volumes as The World of Ice &amp;amp; Fire, but now, for the first time, the full tapestry of Targaryen history is revealed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With all the scope and grandeur of Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Fire and Blood is the ultimate game of thrones, giving readers a whole new appreciation for the dynamic, often bloody, and always fascinating history of Westeros.</description>

  <description>The third volume in the 'Corfu Trilogy' continues the accounts of the young Gerald Durrell during the years that he and his family lived in Corfu before the Second World War. While the animals of Corfu are young Gerald's focus, it is the antics of his family and their array of friends and acquaintances that are the centrepiece of the humorous account.</description>

It's the shortest of the three; clearly, Durrell was running out of fodder for these books by this point, but I for one was sorry to have them end. A reader f...]]>

  <description>When the unconventional Durrell family can no longer endure the damp, gray English climate, they do what any sensible family would do: sell their house and relocate to the sunny Greek isle of Corfu. &lt;i&gt;My Family and Other Animals&lt;/i&gt; was intended to embrace the natural history of the island but ended up as a delightful account of Durrell’s family’s experiences, from the many eccentric hangers-on to the ceaseless procession of puppies, toads, scorpions, geckoes, ladybugs, glowworms, octopuses, bats, and butterflies into their home.</description>

  <description>A great deal is happening in London and the country this season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, there's the witch who tried to poison Kate at the Royal College of Wizards. There's also the man who seems to be spying on Cecelia. (Though he's not doing a very good job of it--so just what are his intentions?) And then there's Oliver. Ever since he was turned into a tree, he hasn't bothered to tell anyone where he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, magic is a deadly and dangerous business. And the girls might be in fear for their lives . . . if only they weren't having so much fun!</description>

  <description>In her great historical epic &lt;i&gt;Kristin Lavransdatter&lt;/i&gt;, set in fourteenth-century Norway, Nobel laureate Sigrid Undset tells the life story of one passionate and headstrong woman. Painting a richly detailed backdrop, Undset immerses readers in the day-to-day life, social conventions, and political and religious undercurrents of the period. Now in one volume, Tiina Nunnally's award-winning definitive translation brings this remarkable work to life with clarity and lyrical beauty. &lt;p&gt; As a young girl, Kristin is deeply devoted to her father, a kind and courageous man. But when as a student in a convent school she meets the charming and impetuous Erlend Nikulaussøn, she defies her parents in pursuit of her own desires. Her saga continues through her marriage to Erlend, their tumultuous life together raising seven sons as Erlend seeks to strengthen his political influence, and finally their estrangement as the world around them tumbles into uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With its captivating heroine and emotional potency, &lt;i&gt;Kristin Lavransdatter&lt;/i&gt; is the masterwork of Norway's most beloved author, one of the twentieth century's most prodigious and engaged literary minds and, in Nunnally's exquisite translation, a story that continues to enthrall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Tom Hope doesn’t think he’s much of a farmer, but he’s doing his best. He can’t have been much of a husband to Trudy, either, judging by her sudden departure. It’s only when she returns, pregnant to someone else, that he discovers his surprising talent as a father. So when Trudy finds Jesus and takes little Peter away with her to join the holy rollers, Tom’s heart breaks all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Hannah Babel, quixotic smalltown bookseller: the second Jew—and the most vivid person—Tom has ever met. He dares to believe they could make each other happy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is 1968: twenty-four years since Hannah and her own little boy arrived at Auschwitz. Tom Hope is taking on a batttle with heartbreak he can barely even begin to imagine.</description>

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laia is a slave. Elias is a soldier. Neither is free.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Under the Martial Empire, defiance is met with death. Those who do not vow their blood and bodies to the Emperor risk the execution of their loved ones and the destruction of all they hold dear.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; It is in this brutal world, inspired by ancient Rome, that Laia lives with her grandparents and older brother. The family ekes out an existence in the Empire’s impoverished backstreets. They do not challenge the Empire. They’ve seen what happens to those who do.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But when Laia’s brother is arrested for treason, Laia is forced to make a decision. In exchange for help from rebels who promise to rescue her brother, she will risk her life to spy for them from within the Empire’s greatest military academy.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; There, Laia meets Elias, the school’s finest soldier—and secretly, its most unwilling. Elias wants only to be free of the tyranny he’s being trained to enforce. He and Laia will soon realize that their destinies are intertwined—and that their choices will change the fate of the Empire itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Laurence Olivier was a true legend. No classical actor had ever been such a dazzling star. No star had been such a magnificent actor. In this marvellous autobiography Laurence Olivier tells his own story: his brilliant career as actor, director, film-maker and producer; his role as husband to three women including Vivien Leigh and Joan Plowright; and his many friendships - with Sir Ralph Richardson, Noel Coward and Sir Winston Churchill, to name just a few. &lt;i&gt;Confessions of an Actor&lt;/i&gt; is more than just a memoir. It is a deeply felt testament by one of the most astonishingly gifted artists of all time.</description>

      <![CDATA[Olivier was one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. Perhaps the greatest, though comparison at his lofty level is folly and maybe even wrong-headed. He was also a difficult, vain, and in some ways startlingly weak man. All of this is more or less inadvertently revealed in his autobiograph...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Hold Me Tight&lt;/i&gt; presents a revolutionary new understanding of why and how we love, based on cutting-edge research. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Every day, we hear of relationships failing and questions of whether humans are meant to be monogamous. LOVE SENSE presents new scientific evidence that tells us that humans &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; meant to mate for life. Dr. Johnson explains that romantic love is an attachment bond, just like that between mother and child, and shows us how to develop our "love sense"--our ability to develop long-lasting relationships. Love is not the least bit illogical or random, but actually an ordered and wise recipe for survival. LOVE SENSE covers the three stages of a relationship and how to best weather them; the intelligence of emotions and the logic of love; the physical and psychological benefits of secure love; and much more. Based on groundbreaking research, LOVE SENSE will change the way we think about love.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Heralded by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; as the couples therapy with the highest rate of success, Emotionally Focused Therapy works because it views the love relationship as an attachment bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;This idea, once controversial, is now supported by science, and has become widely popular among therapists around the world. In &lt;i&gt;Hold Me Tight,&lt;/i&gt; Dr. Sue Johnson presents Emotionally Focused Therapy to the general public for the first time. Johnson teaches that the way to save and enrich a relationship is to reestablish safe emotional connection and preserve the attachment bond. With this in mind, she focuses on key moments in a relationship-from "Recognizing the Demon Dialogue" to "Revisiting a Rocky Moment" -- and uses them as touch points for seven healing conversations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through case studies from her practice, illuminating advice, and practical exercises, couples will learn how to nurture their relationships and ensure a lifetime of love.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Bring meaning and joy to all your days with this internationally bestselling guide to the Japanese concept of &lt;i&gt;ikigai&lt;/i&gt; (pronounced &lt;i&gt;ee-key-guy&lt;/i&gt;)—the happiness of always being busy—as revealed by the daily habits of the world’s longest-living people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s your &lt;i&gt;ikigai&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Only staying active will make you want to live a hundred years.” —Japanese proverb&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;According to the Japanese, everyone has an &lt;i&gt;ikigai&lt;/i&gt;—a reason for living. And according to the residents of the Japanese village with the world’s longest-living people, finding it is the key to a happier and longer life. Having a strong sense of &lt;i&gt;ikigai&lt;/i&gt;—the place where passion, mission, vocation, and profession intersect—means that each day is infused with meaning. It’s the reason we get up in the morning. It’s also the reason many Japanese never really retire (in fact there’s no word in Japanese that means &lt;i&gt;retire&lt;/i&gt; in the sense it does in English): They remain active and work at what they enjoy, because they’ve found a real purpose in life—the happiness of always being busy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In researching this book, the authors interviewed the residents of the Japanese village with the highest percentage of 100-year-olds—one of the world’s Blue Zones. &lt;i&gt;Ikigai&lt;/i&gt; reveals the secrets to their longevity and happiness: how they eat, how they move, how they work, how they foster collaboration and community, and—their best-kept secret—how they find the &lt;i&gt;ikigai&lt;/i&gt; that brings satisfaction to their lives. And it provides practical tools to help you discover your own &lt;i&gt;ikigai&lt;/i&gt;. Because who doesn’t want to find happiness in every day?</description>

  <description>Sometimes the hardest part of decision-making is being aware that there's a decision to be made in the first place. "Choose the Life You Want" shows us how we can view our lives as a series of choices. Tal Ben-Shahar advocates a proactive approach to well-being in which every moment offers opportunities for positive changes in our lives. He promises no simple trick or secret, no quick-fix for instant improvement. Instead, he proposes being continuously mindful of the power we hold to choose our courses of action at every moment of our lives. As Ben-Shahar himself writes, "The dramas of life's 'big decisions' (which, almost by definition, are few and far between) should not hide the fact that in life we face choices all the time. Every moment of our waking lives we face choices whose cumulative effect on us is just as great, if not greater, than the effect of the big decisions. I can choose whether to sit up straight or stooped; whether to say a warm word to my partner or give her a sour look; whether to appreciate my health, my friend, and my lunch, or to take these for granted; whether to choose to choose or to remain oblivious to the choices that are there for the making. Individually, these choices may not seem important, but together they are the very bricks that make up the road we create for ourselves."Not to be aware of the choices we make moment by moment, is to relinquish control over our ability to improve our life. For instance, we take it for granted that our feelings are what they are and cannot be altered; we react to someone else's behavior automatically without considering alternative options; we are faced with the same situation over and over again and respond in the same way over and over again--as if no other course of action were available to us. We assume that our thoughts and actions and feelings are inevitable, that we do not have a choice, when in fact we do."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Gods meddle in the fates of men, men play with the fates of gods, and a pretender must be cast down from the throne in this breathtaking first fantasy novel from Ann Leckie, New York Times bestselling author and winner of the Hugo, Nebula, and Arthur C. Clarke Awards.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For centuries, the kingdom of Iraden has been protected by the god known as the Raven. He watches over his territory from atop a tower in the powerful port of Vastai. His will is enacted through the Raven's Lease, a human ruler chosen by the god himself. His magic is sustained via the blood sacrifice that every Lease must offer. And under the Raven's watch, the city flourishes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the power of the Raven is weakening. A usurper has claimed the throne. The kingdom borders are tested by invaders who long for the prosperity that Vastai boasts. And they have made their own alliances with other gods.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is into this unrest that the warrior Eolo--aide to Mawat, the true Lease--arrives. And in seeking to help Mawat reclaim his city, Eolo discovers that the Raven's Tower holds a secret. Its foundations conceal a dark history that has been waiting to reveal itself...and to set in motion a chain of events that could destroy Iraden forever.</description>

  <description>One night on the heath, the brave and respected general Macbeth encounters three witches who foretell that he will become king of Scotland. At first sceptical, he’s urged on by the ruthless, single-minded ambitions of Lady Macbeth, who suffers none of her husband’s doubt. But seeing the prophecy through to the bloody end leads them both spiralling into paranoia, tyranny, madness, and murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shocking tragedy - a violent caution to those seeking power for its own sake - is, to this day, one of Shakespeare’s most popular and influential masterpieces.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;A call-to-arms about the broken nature of artificial intelligence, and the powerful corporations that are turning the human-machine relationship on its head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;We like to think that we are in control of the future of "artificial" intelligence. The reality, though, is that we--the everyday people whose data powers AI--aren't actually in control of anything. When, for example, we speak with Alexa, we contribute that data to a system we can't see and have no input into--one largely free from regulation or oversight. The big nine corporations--Amazon, Google, Facebook, Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba, Microsoft, IBM and Apple--are the new gods of AI and are short-changing our futures to reap immediate financial gain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book, Amy Webb reveals the pervasive, invisible ways in which the foundations of AI--the people working on the system, their motivations, the technology itself--is broken. Within our lifetimes, AI will, by design, begin to behave unpredictably, thinking and acting in ways which defy human logic. The big nine corporations may be inadvertently building and enabling vast arrays of intelligent systems that don't share our motivations, desires, or hopes for the future of humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much more than a passionate, human-centered call-to-arms, this book delivers a strategy for changing course, and provides a path for liberating us from algorithmic decision-makers and powerful corporations.</description>

  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;No one knows how to turn unrelenting self-belief into hard-and-fast career results better than Dre Baldwin. When everyone and everything was telling him to give up on his goal of playing pro basketball, he got focused on his future, and met the challenge head on. In the end, Baldwin succeeded--making a living playing basketball in leagues around the world--and in these pages, he shares all his secrets.&lt;br /&gt;Whether you're just starting out in business or looking to take your career to the next level, &lt;i&gt;Work On Your Game&lt;/i&gt; provides the strategy you need to succeed from the inside-out.

You'll learn how to play the mental game in a way that launches you towards unparalleled achievement.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>If you want to increase team productivity, relieve stress, and be happier at work, you could hire a bunch of workplace consultants, invest in scream therapy, and put Pharrell Williams on repeat—or you could just read Humor That Works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written by Andrew Tarvin, the world’s first Humor Engineer, this a business book on humor. No, that’s not an oxymoron. It really is a business book and it really is about getting better results by having more fun. Because people who use humor in the workplace are more productive, less stressed, and happier. No joke; sources included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal is not to make you funnier—though that may be a side effect—but to make you effective-er. You’ll learn to develop a personal humor habit that’s not about spitting wisecracks or telling the funniest stories, but a way of seeing work in an energizing new way. You’ll build on some of the most important business skills for today’s work environment, develop techniques for leveraging humor, and take action to improve your work immediately. And you’ll have fun doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be stories about grandmas who text, multiple mentions of milkshakes, and exactly seven references to zombies. Oh, and there will be puns. (You’ve been warned.) Looking for success and happiness at work? Discover the missing skill of Humor That Works.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;“This is the best book about the Beatles ever written”  &lt;/strong&gt;—&lt;strong&gt;Mashable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rob Sheffield, the &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; columnist and bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Love Is a Mix Tape&lt;/em&gt; offers an entertaining, unconventional look at the most popular band in history, the Beatles, exploring what they mean today and why they still matter so intensely to a generation that has never known a world without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dreaming the Beatles&lt;/em&gt; is not another biography of the Beatles, or a song-by-song analysis of the best of John and Paul. It isn’t another exposé about how they broke up. It isn’t a history of their gigs or their gear. It is a collection of essays telling the story of what this ubiquitous band means to a generation who grew up with the Beatles music on their parents’ stereos and their faces on T-shirts. What do the Beatles mean today? Why are they more famous and beloved now than ever? And why do they still matter so much to us, nearly fifty years after they broke up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he did in his previous books,&lt;em&gt; Love is a Mix Tape, Talking to Girls About Duran Duran,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Turn Around Bright Eyes&lt;/em&gt;, Sheffield focuses on the emotional connections we make to music. This time, he focuses on the biggest pop culture phenomenon of all time—The Beatles. In his singular voice, he explores what the Beatles mean today, to fans who have learned to love them on their own terms and not just for the sake of nostalgia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dreaming the Beatles&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of how four lads from Liverpool became the world’s biggest pop group, then broke up—but then somehow just kept getting bigger. At this point, their music doesn’t belong to the past—it belongs to right now. This book is a celebration of that music, showing why the Beatles remain the world’s favorite thing—and how they invented the future we’re all living in today.</description>

  <description>From leading psychologist Dr. Kristin Neff comes a step-by-step guide explaining how to be more self-compassionate and achieve your dreams in life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The relentless pursuit of high self-esteem has become a virtual religion—and a tyrannical one at that. Our ultracompetitive culture tells us we need to be constantly &lt;em&gt;above average&lt;/em&gt; to feel good about ourselves, but there is always someone more attractive, successful, or intelligent than we are. And even when we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; manage to grab hold of high self-esteem for a brief moment, we can't seem to keep it. Our sense of self-worth goes up and down like a ping-pong ball, rising and falling in lockstep with our latest success or failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, there is an alternative to self-esteem that many experts believe is a better and more effective path to happiness: self-compassion. The research of Dr. Kristin Neff and other leading psychologists indicates that people who are compassionate toward their failings and imperfections experience greater well-being than those who repeatedly judge themselves. The feelings of security and self-worth provided by self-compassion are also highly stable, kicking in precisely when self-esteem falls down. This book powerfully demonstrates why it's so important to be self-compassionate and give yourself the same caring support you'd give to a good friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This groundbreaking work will show you how to let go of debilitating self-criticism and finally learn to be kind to yourself. Using solid empirical research, personal stories, practical exercises, and humor, Dr. Neff—the world's foremost expert on self-compassion—explains how to heal destructive emotional patterns so that you can be healthier, happier, and more effective. Engaging, highly readable, and eminently accessible, this book has the power to change your life.</description>

  <description>The first volume in legendary master and New York Times bestselling author Raymond E. Feist’s epic heroic fantasy series, The Firemane Saga—an electrifying tale of two young men whose choices will determine a world’s destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For centuries, the five greatest kingdoms of North and South Tembria, twin continents on the world of Garn, have coexisted in peace. But the balance of power is destroyed when four of the kingdoms violate an ancient covenant and betray the fifth: Ithrace, the Kingdom of Flames, ruled by Steveren Langene, known as "the Firemane" for his brilliant red hair. As war engulfs the world, Ithrace is destroyed and the Greater Realms of Tembria are thrust into a dangerous struggle for supremacy.&lt;br /&gt;As a Free Lord, Baron Daylon Dumarch owes allegiance to no king. When an abandoned infant is found hidden in Daylon’s pavilion, he realizes that the child must be the missing heir of the slain Steveren. The boy is valuable—and vulnerable. A cunning and patient man, Daylon decides to keep the baby’s existence secret, and sends him to be raised on the Island of Coaltachin, home of the so-called Kingdom of Night, where the powerful and lethal Nocusara, the "Hidden Warriors," legendary assassins and spies, are trained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, another orphan of mysterious provenance, a young man named Declan, earns his Masters rank as a weapons smith. Blessed with intelligence and skill, he unlocks the secret to forging King’s Steel, the apex of a weapon maker’s trade known by very few. Yet this precious knowledge is also deadly, and Declan is forced to leave his home to safeguard his life. Landing in Lord Daylon’s provinces, he hopes to start anew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, the two young men—an unknowing rightful heir to a throne and a brilliantly talented young swordsmith—will discover that their fates, and that of Garn, are entwined. The legendary, long-ago War of Betrayal has never truly ended . . . and they must discover the secret of who truly threatens their world.</description>

  <description>Miryem is the daughter and granddaughter of moneylenders... but her father isn't a very good one. Free to lend and reluctant to collect, he has loaned out most of his wife's dowry and left the family on the edge of poverty--until Miryem steps in. Hardening her heart against her fellow villagers' pleas, she sets out to collect what is owed--and finds herself more than up to the task. When her grandfather loans her a pouch of silver pennies, she brings it back full of gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But having the reputation of being able to change silver to gold can be more trouble than it's worth--especially when her fate becomes tangled with the cold creatures that haunt the wood, and whose king has learned of her reputation and wants to exploit it for reasons Miryem cannot understand.</description>

I mean, of course, it's about a software engineer discovering the delights of baking, quitting her job, and embracing the slow lane. Sure. But what else? The semi-serio-apocalyptic ending felt tacked on and unconvincing, as if the demands...]]>

  <description>The Great Recession has shuffled Clay Jannon away from life as a San Francisco web-design drone and into the aisles of Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, but after a few days on the job, Clay discovers that the store is more curious than either its name or its gnomic owner might suggest. The customers are few, and they never seem to buy anything; instead, they "check out" large, obscure volumes from strange corners of the store. Suspicious, Clay engineers an analysis of the clientele's behavior, seeking help from his variously talented friends, but when they bring their findings to Mr. Penumbra, they discover the bookstore's secrets extend far beyond its walls.</description>

  <description>Praise for the Shan series: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Nothing I’ve read or seen about how China has systematically crushed the soul of Tibet has been as effective. . . . A thriller of laudable aspirations and achievements.”—&lt;i&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Shan becomes our Don Quixote. . . . Set against a background that is alternately bleak and blazingly beautiful, this is at once a top-notch thriller and a substantive look at Tibet under siege.”—&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; (starred review) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A rich and multilayered story that mirrors the complexity of the surrounding land.”—&lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Pattison thrills both mystery enthusiasts and reader fascinated by, and concerned about, Tibet.”—&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Pattison has taken an unknown world and made it come alive.”—&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summoned to a remote village from the hidden lamasery where he lives, Shan, formerly an investigator in Beijing, must save a comatose man from execution for two murders in which the victims’ arms have been removed. Upon arrival, he discovers that the suspect is not Tibetan but Navajo. The man has come with his niece to seek ancestral ties between their people and the ancient Bon. The recent murders are only part of a chain of deaths. Together with his friends, the monks Gendun and Lokesh, Shan solves the riddle of Dragon Mountain, the place “where world begins.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eliot Pattison&lt;/b&gt; is an international lawyer based near Philadelphia. His four previous Shan novels, set in Tibet, are &lt;i&gt;The Skull Mantra&lt;/i&gt; (which won the Edgar Award for Best First Novel), &lt;i&gt;Water Touching Stone&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bone Mountain&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Beautiful Ghosts&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Return to Daevabad in the spellbinding sequel to THE CITY OF BRASS.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nahri’s life changed forever the moment she accidentally summoned Dara, a formidable, mysterious djinn, during one of her schemes. Whisked from her home in Cairo, she was thrust into the dazzling royal court of Daevabad and quickly discovered she would need all her grifter instincts to survive there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with Daevabad entrenched in the dark aftermath of the battle that saw Dara slain at Prince Ali’s hand, Nahri must forge a new path for herself, without the protection of the guardian who stole her heart or the counsel of the prince she considered a friend. But even as she embraces her heritage and the power it holds, she knows she’s been trapped in a gilded cage, watched by a king who rules from the throne that once belonged to her familyand one misstep will doom her tribe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Ali has been exiled for daring to defy his father. Hunted by assassins, adrift on the unforgiving copper sands of his ancestral land, he is forced to rely on the frightening abilities the marid, the unpredictable water spirits, have gifted him. But in doing so, he threatens to unearth a terrible secret his family has long kept buried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a new century approaches and the djinn gather within Daevabad's towering brass walls for celebrations, a threat brews unseen in the desolate north. It’s a force that would bring a storm of fire straight to the city’s gates . . . and one that seeks the aid of a warrior trapped between worlds, torn between a violent duty he can never escape and a peace he fears he will never deserve.</description>

  <description>Nahri has never believed in magic. Certainly, she has power; on the streets of 18th century Cairo, she’s a con woman of unsurpassed talent. But she knows better than anyone that the trade she uses to get by—palm readings, zars, healings—are all tricks, sleights of hand, learned skills; a means to the delightful end of swindling Ottoman nobles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Nahri accidentally summons an equally sly, darkly mysterious djinn warrior to her side during one of her cons, she’s forced to accept that the magical world she thought only existed in childhood stories is real. For the warrior tells her a new tale: across hot, windswept sands teeming with creatures of fire, and rivers where the mythical marid sleep; past ruins of once-magnificent human metropolises, and mountains where the circling hawks are not what they seem, lies Daevabad, the legendary city of brass, a city to which Nahri is irrevocably bound. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that city, behind gilded brass walls laced with enchantments, behind the six gates of the six djinn tribes, old resentments are simmering. And when Nahri decides to enter this world, she learns that true power is fierce and brutal. That magic cannot shield her from the dangerous web of court politics. That even the cleverest of schemes can have deadly consequences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, there is a reason they say be careful what you wish for...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;It has been twenty years since the end of the war. The dictatorial Augurs - once thought of almost as gods - were overthrown and wiped out during the conflict, their much-feared powers mysteriously failing them. Those who had ruled under them, men and women with a lesser ability known as the Gift, avoided the Augurs' fate only by submitting themselves to the rebellion's Four Tenets. A representation of these laws is now written into the flesh of any who use the Gift, forcing those so marked into absolute obedience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a student of the Gifted, Davian suffers the consequences of a war fought – and lost – before he was born. Despised by most beyond the school walls, he and those around him are all but prisoners as they attempt to learn control of the Gift. Worse, as Davian struggles with his lessons, he knows that there is further to fall if he cannot pass his final tests. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Davian discovers he has the ability to wield the forbidden power of the Augurs, he sets into motion a chain of events that will change everything. To the north, an ancient enemy long thought defeated begins to stir. And to the west, a young man whose fate is intertwined with Davian’s wakes up in the forest, covered in blood and with no memory of who he is…</description>

  <description>The Presidents Club, established at Dwight Eisenhower's inauguration by Harry Truman and Herbert Hoover, is a complicated place: its members are bound forever by the experience of the Oval Office and yet are eternal rivals for history's favor. Among their secrets: How Jack Kennedy tried to blame Ike for the Bay of Pigs. How Ike quietly helped Reagan win his first race in 1966. How Richard Nixon conspired with Lyndon Johnson to get elected and then betrayed him. How Jerry Ford and Jimmy Carter turned a deep enmity into an alliance. The unspoken pact between a father and son named Bush. And the roots of the rivalry between Clinton and Barack Obama. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; magazine editors and presidential historians Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy offer a new and revealing lens on the American presidency, exploring the club as a hidden instrument of power that has changed the course of history.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Wolf &lt;/i&gt;is a thrilling, savagely visceral, politically nuanced, and unexpectedly wry exploration of power - and how far one will go to defend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violence and death have come to the land under the Northern Sky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Anakim dwell in the desolate forests and mountains beyond the black river, the land under the Northern Sky. Their ancient ways are forged in Unthank silver and carved in the grey stone of their heartland, their lives measured out in the turning of centuries, not years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By contrast, the Sutherners live in the moment, their vitality much more immediate and ephemeral than their Anakim neighbors. Fragile is the peace that has existed between these very different races - and that peace is shattered when the Suthern armies flood the lands to the north. These two races revive their age-old hatred and fear of each other. Within the maelstrom of war, two leaders will rise to lead their people to victory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one will succeed.</description>

  <description>From autumn to spring, J.A. Baker set out to track the daily comings and goings of a pair of peregrine falcons across the flat fen lands of eastern England. He followed the birds obsessively, observing them in the air and on the ground, in pursuit of their prey, making a kill, eating, and at rest, activities he describes with an extraordinary fusion of precision and poetry. And as he continued his mysterious private quest, his sense of human self slowly dissolved, to be replaced with the alien and implacable consciousness of a hawk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is this extraordinary metamorphosis, magical and terrifying, that these beautifully written pages record.</description>

  <description>When a relationship ends, the anguish and disappointment can be devastating. A broken heart is genuinely traumatic. Typical recommendations to keep busy, move on, repair your hidden flaws, and then forget about it may not be helpful. In this reading of her book, Susan Piver reveals that heartbreak actually creates an opportunity for genuine emotional and spiritual transformation, enabling you to emerge on the other side stronger, softer, and capable of loving with renewed confidence.</description>

  <description>Restored from Tolkien’s manuscripts and presented for the first time as a fully continuous and standalone story, the epic tale of Beren and Lúthien will reunite fans of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings with Elves and Humans, Dwarves and Orcs and the rich landscape and creatures unique to Tolkien’s Middle-earth. The tale of Beren and Lúthien was, or became, an essential element in the evolution of The Silmarillion, the myths and legends of the First Age of the World conceived by J.R.R. Tolkien. Returning from France and the battle of the Somme at the end of 1916, he wrote the tale in the following year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essential to the story, and never changed, is the fate that shadowed the love of Beren and Lúthien: for Beren was a mortal man, but Lúthien was an immortal Elf. Her father, a great Elvish lord, in deep opposition to Beren, imposed on him an impossible task that he must perform before he might wed Lúthien. This is the kernel of the legend; and it leads to the supremely heroic attempt of Beren and Lúthien together to rob the greatest of all evil beings, Melkor, called Morgoth, the Black Enemy, of a Silmaril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book Christopher Tolkien has attempted to extract the story of Beren and Lúthien from the comprehensive work in which it was embedded; but that story was itself changing as it developed new associations within the larger history. To show something of the process whereby this legend of Middle-earth evolved over the years, he has told the story in his father's own words by giving, first, its original form, and then passages in prose and verse from later texts that illustrate the narrative as it changed. Presented together for the first time, they reveal aspects of the story, both in event and in narrative immediacy, that were afterwards lost.</description>

      <![CDATA[For fans of Tolkien only. This compendium represents several views of the basic myth Tolkien developed and tinkered with over the years in various forms. As a story, it's a corker; as poetry, it's just OK. The short-line bardic form Tolkien imposes on himself makes for difficult versifying. He ha...]]>

  <description>'I was wrong,' said Captain Flint. 'He's not mad but bad. It isn't only eggs he wants. He wants to take the credit for it. You're quite right. It's up to us, it's up to the ship, to see he doesn't.'Dick's birdwatching discovery turns the cruise of the Sea Bear into a desperate chase. Not only do the Swallows and Amazons have to prove the facts of the case but they also have to dodge the savage natives and evade the ruthless pursuit of a fanatic egg-collector, determined to kill a pair of rare birds and steal the credit. Fortunately, Nancy has a few plans.</description>

  <description>Based on the troubadour culture that rose in Provence during the High Middle Ages, this panoramic, absorbing novel beautifully creates an alternate version of the medieval world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The matriarchal, cultured land of Arbonne is rent by a feud between its two most powerful dukes, the noble troubador Bertran de Talair and Urte de Miraval, over long-dead Aelis, lover of one, wife of the other and once heir to the country's throne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the north lies militaristic Gorhaut, whose inhabitants worship the militant god Corannos and are ruled by corrupt, womanizing King Ademar. His chief advisor, the high priest of Corannos, is determined to eradicate the worship of a female deity, whose followers live to the south.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Into this cauldron of brewing disaster comes the mysterious Gorhaut mercenary Blaise, who takes service with Bertran and averts an attempt on his life. The revelation of Blaise's lineage and a claim for sanctuary by his sister-in-law sets the stage for a brutal clash between the two cultures. Intertwined is the tale of a young woman troubadour whose role suggests the sweep of the drama to come.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Following their adventures in &lt;i&gt;The Bear and the Nightingale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Girl in the Tower&lt;/i&gt;, Vasya and Morozko return in this stunning conclusion to the bestselling &lt;i&gt;Winternight Trilogy&lt;/i&gt;, battling enemies mortal and magical to save both Russias, the seen and the unseen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Moscow has been struck by disaster. Its people are searching for answers—and for someone to blame. Vasya finds herself alone, beset on all sides. The Grand Prince is in a rage, choosing allies that will lead him on a path to war and ruin. A wicked demon returns, stronger than ever and determined to spread chaos. Caught at the center of the conflict is Vasya, who finds the fate of two worlds resting on her shoulders. Her destiny uncertain, Vasya will uncover surprising truths about herself and her history as she desperately tries to save Russia, Morozko, and the magical world she treasures. But she may not be able to save them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advance praise for &lt;i&gt;The Winter of the Witch&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Katherine Arden’s Winternight Trilogy isn’t just good—it’s hug-to-your-chest, straight-to-the-favorites-shelf, reread-immediately good, and each book just gets better. The Winter of the Witch plunges us back to fourteenth-century Moscow, where old gods and new vie for the soul of Russia and fate rests on a witch girl’s slender shoulders. Prepare to have your heart ripped out, loaned back to you full of snow and magic, and ripped out some more.”—&lt;b&gt;Laini Taylor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The magical adventure begun in &lt;i&gt;The Bear and the Nightingale&lt;/i&gt; continues as brave Vasya, now a young woman, is forced to choose between marriage or life in a convent and instead flees her home—but soon finds herself called upon to help defend the city of Moscow when it comes under siege.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orphaned and cast out as a witch by her village, Vasya’s options are few: resign herself to life in a convent, or allow her older sister to make her a match with a Moscovite prince. Both doom her to life in a tower, cut off from the vast world she longs to explore. So instead she chooses adventure, disguising herself as a boy and riding her horse into the woods. When a battle with some bandits who have been terrorizing the countryside earns her the admiration of the Grand Prince of Moscow, she must carefully guard the secret of her gender to remain in his good graces—even as she realizes his kingdom is under threat from mysterious forces only she will be able to stop.</description>

  <description>At the edge of the Russian wilderness, winter lasts most of the year and the snowdrifts grow taller than houses. But Vasilisa doesn't mind—she spends the winter nights huddled around the embers of a fire with her beloved siblings, listening to her nurse's fairy tales. Above all, she loves the chilling story of Frost, the blue-eyed winter demon, who appears in the frigid night to claim unwary souls. Wise Russians fear him, her nurse says, and honor the spirits of house and yard and forest that protect their homes from evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Vasilisa's mother dies, her father goes to Moscow and brings home a new wife. Fiercely devout, city-bred, Vasilisa's new stepmother forbids her family from honoring the household spirits. The family acquiesces, but Vasilisa is frightened, sensing that more hinges upon their rituals than anyone knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And indeed, crops begin to fail, evil creatures of the forest creep nearer, and misfortune stalks the village. All the while, Vasilisa's stepmother grows ever harsher in her determination to groom her rebellious stepdaughter for either marriage or confinement in a convent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As danger circles, Vasilisa must defy even the people she loves and call on dangerous gifts she has long concealed—this, in order to protect her family from a threat that seems to have stepped from her nurse's most frightening tales.</description>

It's a beautifully, lushly, imaginatively, riotously, extravagantly, copiously, richly, and hugely retold version. It is to Cinderella as a Whole Foods is to a sprig of lettuce.

  <description>Although it is autumn in the small English town of Bishop’s Lacey, the chapel is decked with exotic flowers. Yes, Flavia de Luce’s sister Ophelia is at last getting hitched, like a mule to a wagon. “A church is a wonderful place for a wedding,” muses Flavia, “surrounded as it is by the legions of the dead, whose listening bones bear silent witness to every promise made at the altar.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flavia is not your normal twelve-year-old girl. An expert in the chemical nature of poisons, she has solved many mysteries, sharpening her considerable detection skills to the point where she had little choice but to turn professional. So Flavia and dependable Dogger, estate gardener and sounding board extraordinaire, set up shop at the once-grand mansion of Buckshaw, eager to serve—not so simple an endeavor with her odious little moon-faced cousin, Undine, constantly underfoot. But Flavia and Dogger persevere. Little does she know that their first case will be extremely close to home, beginning with an unwelcome discovery in Ophelia’s wedding cake: a human finger.</description>

  <description>A TREMBLING EARTH&lt;br /&gt;The flames of civil war sweep across the Shima Imperium. With their plans to renew the Kazumitsu dynasty foiled, the Lotus Guild unleash their deadliest creation—a mechanical goliath known as the Earthcrusher, intended to unite the shattered Empire under a yoke of fear. With the Tiger Clan and their puppet Daimyo Hiro in tow, the Guild marches toward a battle for absolute dominion over the Isles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A BROKEN REBELLION&lt;br /&gt;Yukiko and Buruu are forced to take leadership of the Kagé rebellion, gathering new allies and old friends in an effort to unite the country against the chi-mongers. But the ghosts of Buruu’s past stand between them and the army they need, and Kin’s betrayal has destroyed all trust among their allies. When a new foe joins the war tearing the Imperium apart, it will be all the pair can do to muster the strength to fight, let alone win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A FINAL BATTLE&lt;br /&gt;The traitor Kin walks the halls of Guild power, his destiny only a bloody knife-stroke away. Hana and Yoshi struggle to find their place in a world now looking to them as heroes. Secret cabals within the Lotus Guild claw and struggle; one toward darkness, the other toward light. And as the earth splits asunder, as armies destroy each other for rule over an empire of lifeless ash and the final secret about blood lotus is revealed, the people of Shima will learn one last, horrifying truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing a mother won't do to keep her children by her side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing.</description>

  <description>Winner of the Prix Médicis, this multifaceted literary novel follows the Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher across 17th century Europe and Eleazard von Wogau, a retired French correspondent, through modern Brazil.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Eleazard begins editing a strange, unpublished biography of Kircher, the rest of his life seems to begin unraveling—his ex-wife goes on a dangerous geological expedition to Mato Grosso; his daughter abandons school to travel with her young professor and her lesbian lover to an indigenous beach town, where the trio use drugs and form interdependent sexual relationships; and Eleazard himself starts losing his sanity, escalated by loneliness, and his work on the biography. Patterns begin to emerge from these interwoven narratives, which develop toward a mesmerizing climax.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shortlisted for the Goncourt Prize and the European Book Award, and already translated into 14 languages, &lt;i&gt;Where Tigers Are At Home&lt;/i&gt; is large-scale epic, at once literary and entertaining, that belongs in the company of Umberto Eco and Haruki Murakami.</description>

  <description>A SHATTERED EMPIRE&lt;br /&gt;The mad Shōgun Yoritomo has been assassinated by the Stormdancer Yukiko, and the threat of civil war looms over the Shima Imperium. The Lotus Guild conspires to renew the nation’s broken dynasty and crush the growing rebellion simultaneously – by endorsing a new Shōgun who desires nothing more than to see Yukiko dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A DARK LEGACY&lt;br /&gt;Yukiko and the mighty thunder tiger Buruu have been cast in the role of heroes by the Kagé rebellion. But Yukiko herself is blinded by rage over her father’s death, and her ability to hear the thoughts of beasts is swelling beyond her power to control. Along with Buruu, Yukiko’s anchor is Kin, the rebel Guildsman who helped her escape from Yoritomo’s clutches. But Kin has his own secrets, and is haunted by visions of a future he’d rather die than see realized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A GATHERING STORM&lt;br /&gt;Kagé assassins lurk within the Shōgun’s palace, plotting to end the new dynasty before it begins. A waif from Kigen’s gutters begins a friendship that could undo the entire empire. A new enemy gathers its strength, readying to push the fracturing Shima imperium into a war it cannot hope to survive. And across raging oceans, amongst islands of black glass, Yukiko and Buruu will face foes no katana or talon can defeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ghosts of a blood-stained past.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A #1 internationally bestselling book of spiritual wisdom about learning to love ourselves, with all our imperfections, by the Buddhist author of &lt;i&gt;The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;When you care for yourself first, the world begins to find you worthy of care.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is perfect, but that shouldn't hold us back from love--for the world, for one another, or even for ourselves. In this beautifully illustrated guide, Buddhist teacher Haemin Sunim (whose name means "spontaneous wisdom") draws on examples from his own life and on his years of helping others to introduce us to the art of self-care. When we treat ourselves with compassion, empathy, and forgiveness, we learn to treat others the same way, allowing us to connect with people on a deeper level, bounce back from failure, deal with feeling hurt or depressed, listen more attentively, express ourselves more clearly, and have the courage to pursue what really makes us happy so we can feel complete in ourselves. With more than thirty-five full-color illustrations, &lt;i&gt;Love for Imperfect Things&lt;/i&gt; will appeal to both your eyes and your heart, offering you comfort, encouragement, and wisdom so that you can learn to love yourself, your life, and everyone in it.</description>

      <![CDATA[As an imperfect human myself, I found this book both wonderfully affirming in a general sense and also practically useful. Sunim gives you good thing to think about and do when you're inclined to be too hard on yourself. A must-read for anyone struggling --even occasionally -- with being human. ]]>

  <description>From Acorn to Weasel: a gorgeous, hand-illustrated, large-format spellbook celebrating the magic and wonder of the natural world&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All over the country, there are words disappearing from children's lives. Words like Dandelion, Otter, Bramble, Acorn and Lark represent the natural world of childhood, a rich landscape of discovery and imagination that is fading from children's minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lost Words&lt;/i&gt; stands against the disappearance of wild childhood. It is a joyful celebration of the poetry of nature words and the living glory of our distinctive, British countryside. With acrostic spell-poems by peerless wordsmith Robert Macfarlane and hand-painted illustrations by Jackie Morris, this enchanting book captures the irreplaceable magic of language and nature for all ages.</description>

It starts from the premise that words like "lark" and "raven" are being removed from children's vocabularies in favor of words like "selfie" and "i-phone."

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;–bestselling sequel to &lt;i&gt;The 48 Laws of Power&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mastery&lt;/i&gt; synthesizes the years of research Robert Greene conducted while writing the international bestsellers &lt;i&gt;The 48 Laws of Power&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The 33 Strategies of War&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Art of Seduction&lt;/i&gt; and demonstrates that the ultimate form of power is mastery itself. By analyzing the lives of such past masters as Charles Darwin, Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, and Leonard da Vinci, as well as by interviewing nine contemporary masters, including tech guru Paul Graham and animal rights advocate Temple Grandin, Greene debunks our culture’s many myths about genius and distills the wisdom of the ages to reveal the secret to greatness. With this seminal text as a guide, readers will learn how to unlock the passion within and become masters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

I expected more of a mind control book -- a how-to-manipulate-weaker-humans thing -- but this book is really about the 10,000 hours it proverbially takes to achieve mastery in anything, from playing the guitar to growing orchids. The strength of the book is that Greene take...]]>

  <description>Arashitoras are supposed to be extinct. So when Yukiko and her warrior father Masaru are sent to capture one for the Shõgun, they fear that their lives are over – everyone knows what happens to those who fail the Lord of the Shima Isles. But the mission proves less impossible and more deadly than anyone expects. Soon Yukiko finds herself stranded: a young woman alone in her country's last wilderness, with only a furious, crippled arashitora for company. Although she can hear his thoughts, and saved his life, all she knows for certain is he'd rather see her dead than help her. Yet trapped together in the forest, Yukiko and the beast soon discover a bond that neither of them expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, the country around them verges on collapse. A toxic fuel is choking the land, the machine-powered Lotus Guild is publicly burning those they deem Impure, and the Shõgun cares for nothing but his own dominion. Authority has always made Yukiko, but her world changes when she meets Kin, a young man with secrets, and the rebel Kagé cabal. She learns the horrifying extent of the Shõgun's crimes, both against her country and her family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning to the city, Yukiko is determined to make the Shõgun pay – but what can one girl and a flightless arashitora do against the might of an empire?</description>

  <description>Mia Corvere has found her place among the Blades of Our Lady of Blessed Murder, but many in the Red Church hierarchy think she's far from earned it. Plying her bloody trade in a backwater of the Republic, she's no closer to ending the men who destroyed her familia; in fact, she's told directly that Consul Scaeva is off limits. But after a deadly confrontation with an old enemy, Mia's suspicions about the Red Church's true motives begin to grow.</description>

  <description>In a land where three suns almost never set, a fledgling killer joins a school of assassins, seeking vengeance against the powers who destroyed her family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daughter of an executed traitor, Mia Corvere is barely able to escape her father’s failed rebellion with her life. Alone and friendless, she hides in a city built from the bones of a dead god, hunted by the Senate and her father’s former comrades. But her gift for speaking with the shadows leads her to the door of a retired killer, and a future she never imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Mia is apprenticed to the deadliest flock of assassins in the entire Republic—the Red Church. If she bests her fellow students in contests of steel, poison and the subtle arts, she’ll be inducted among the Blades of the Lady of Blessed Murder, and one step closer to the vengeance she desires. But a killer is loose within the Church’s halls, the bloody secrets of Mia’s past return to haunt her, and a plot to bring down the entire congregation is unfolding in the shadows she so loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will she even survive to initiation, let alone have her revenge?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this latest installment of the beloved and best-selling No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, Precious Ramotswe finds herself running for office--much to her dismay.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Mma Potokwane suggests to Mma Ramotswe that she run for a seat on the Gaborone City Council, Mma Ramotswe is at first reluctant. But when she learns that developers plan to build the flashy Big Fun Hotel next to a graveyard, she allows herself to be persuaded. Her opponent is none other than Mma Makutsi's old nemesis, Violet Sephotho, who is in the pocket of the hotel developers. Although Violet is intent on using every trick in the book to secure her election, Mma Ramotswe refuses to guarantee anything beyond what she can deliver; hence her slogan: "I can't promise anything--but I shall do my best."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Mma Ramotswe has acquired a new client: one of her late father's old friends, who was the victim of a hit-and-run accident. Charlie volunteers to be the lead investigator in the case to prove he's ready to be more than an apprentice, as well as to impress a new girlfriend. With Charlie's inquiries landing him in hot water and Election Day fast approaching, Mma Ramotswe will have to call upon her good humor and gen-erosity of spirit to help the community navigate these thorny issues, and to prove that honesty and compassion will always carry the day.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Learn the best-kept secret of the world's most successful entrepreneurs: EXECUTION!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Kim Perell made headlines for her amazing transformative story of a startup entrepreneur to an internationally renowned CEO and prominent angel investor. From her modest beginnings at her kitchen table, she went from broke to multi-millionaire in just a few short years. Today, she has investments in over 70 startups many of which have been sold to some of the largest Fortune 500 companies. Now, in &lt;i&gt;The Execution Factor&lt;/i&gt;, she offers indispensable wisdom as she shares her personal journey and proven program for achieving success. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Execution Factor&lt;/i&gt; offers a straightforward approach to success -- deliberately designed in a way that anyone can master. Perell flips the notion on its head that success is all about having a great idea, an advanced degree or a high IQ. Because people around the world have achieved their dreams without any of those things. Perell believes the ability to execute is the difference between success and failure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Execution Factor&lt;/i&gt; is for &lt;b&gt;anyone&lt;/b&gt; looking to transform themselves from a "dreamer" to a "doer" and will make you feel like you have a success coach by your side. Perell teaches her unique 5 traits of execution: vision, passion, action, resilience, and relationships. By the time you've completed the book you will have a have a blueprint to achieve your dreams in business and in life. Don't settle for ordinary when you can have extraordinary. Master execution and change your life. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Defeated, crushed, and driven almost to extinction, the remnants of the human race are trapped on a planet that is constantly attacked by mysterious alien starfighters. Spensa, a teenage girl living among them, longs to be a pilot. When she discovers the wreckage of an ancient ship, she realizes this dream might be possible—assuming she can repair the ship, navigate flight school, and (perhaps most importantly) persuade the strange machine to help her. Because this ship, uniquely, appears to have a soul.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the tenth instalment of the Swallows and Amazons series, the young crew come face-to-face with the fiercest pirate of the South China Seas.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;     &lt;i&gt;'So long,' called the harbourmaster. 'Don't run into Missee Lee!'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     The Swallows, Amazons and Captain Flint are on a round-the-world voyage. It's been plain sailing for a hundred ports and now they are on their way to China. A friendly harbourmaster has given them a warning: to watch out for pirates roaming the waters around the Chinese coast, but they haven't paid much heed. Until the day that Gibber the monkey accidentally sinks the faithful Wild Cat. Separated, captured, miles from home, the Swallows and Amazons are about to meet their fate and the pirate who holds it: the legendary Missee Lee.</description>

      <![CDATA[Sadly, this is the one Swallows and Amazons that is too dated to be read with any pleasure today. Dated in its racism and cliched views of Asia. The story is constructed with Ransome's usual expertise and our heroes' capture by and escape from pirates is well told. Ransome brings his nautical kno...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Now in his 85th year, Hollywood legend Michael Caine shares wisdom and stories from his remarkable career in this "engrossing" memoir that "shines with positive energy" (&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;, starred review).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One of our best-loved actors, Michael Caine has starred in over 100 films in his six-decade career, spanning classic movies like &lt;i&gt;Alfie&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Zulu&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Italian Job&lt;/i&gt; (the inspiration for the book title) to playing Alfred opposite Christian Bale's Batman in Christopher Nolan's blockbuster&lt;i&gt; Dark Knight&lt;/i&gt; trilogy. Caine has excelled in every kind of role--with a skill that's made it look easy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Caine knows what success takes. He's made it to the pinnacle of his profession from humble origins. But as he says, "Small parts can lead to big things. And if you keep doing things right, the stars will align when you least expect it." Still working and more beloved than ever, Caine now shares everything he's learned-and "his fans will be rewarded, as will anyone seeking an enjoyable, inspirational read" (&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[A gem from a giant acting legend. I don't think Michael Caine can set a foot wrong whatever he's doing, and he certainly charms his way through tales of Hollywood legends, lessons from his long career, and touching tributes to his family, especially his grandchildren. Pure fun. I hope Michael Cai...]]>

  <description>Sefia is determined to keep Archer out of the Guard's clutches and their plans for war between the Five Kingdoms. The Book, the ancient, infinite codex of the past, present and future, tells of a prophecy that will plunge Kelanna in that bloody war, but it requires a boy—Archer—and Sefia will stop at nothing to ensure his safety. The Guard has already stolen her mother, her father, and her Aunt Nin. Sefia would sooner die than let them take anymore from her—especially the boy she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But escaping the Guard and the Book's prophecy is no easy task. After all, what is written always comes to pass. As Sefia and Archer watch Kelanna start to crumble to the Guard's will, they will have to choose between their love and joining a war that just might tear them apart.</description>

      <![CDATA["She sticks the landing." That's a phrase from gymnastics commentary, and I really wonder why it turns up half-way through this third book of a trilogy which has no other mention of gymnasts that I could find. It's a tiny detail, but I saw too many other such discordant items in this final volume...]]>

  <description>Having barely escaped the clutches of the Guard, Sefia and Archer are back on the run, slipping into the safety of the forest to tend to their wounds and plan their next move. Haunted by painful memories, Archer struggles to overcome the trauma of his past with the impressors, whose cruelty plagues him whenever he closes his eyes. But when Sefia and Archer happen upon a crew of impressors in the wilderness, Archer finally finds a way to combat his nightmares: by hunting impressors and freeing the boys they hold captive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Sefia’s help, Archer travels across the kingdom of Deliene rescuing boys while she continues to investigate the mysterious Book and secrets it contains. But the more battles they fight, the more fights Archer craves, until his thirst for violence threatens to transform him from the gentle boy Sefia knows to a grim warrior with a cruel destiny. As Sefia begins to unravel the threads that connect Archer’s fate to her parents’ betrayal of the Guard so long ago, she and Archer must figure out a way to subvert the Guard’s plans before they are ensnared in a war that will pit kingdom against kingdom, leaving their future and the safety of the entire world hanging in the balance.</description>

All the story lines are nuanced and rich, and the central love story is poignant and believable. Chee really finds her stride in this tale of revenge, magic, pirat...]]>

  <description>An instant New York Times Bestseller, this is a stunning debut set in a world where reading is unheard-of. Perfect for fans of Inkheart and Shadow and Bone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finalist for the Kirkus Prize and nominated for the Goodreads Choice Award!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sefia knows what it means to survive. After her father is brutally murdered, she flees into the wilderness with her aunt Nin, who teaches her to hunt, track, and steal. But when Nin is kidnapped, leaving Sefia completely alone, none of her survival skills can help her discover where Nin’s been taken, or if she’s even alive. The only clue to both her aunt’s disappearance and her father’s murder is the odd rectangular object her father left behind, an object she comes to realize is a book—a marvelous item unheard of in her otherwise illiterate society. With the help of this book, and the aid of a mysterious stranger with dark secrets of his own, Sefia sets out to rescue her aunt and find out what really happened the day her father was killed—and punish the people responsible.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Your voice matters, especially as a leader.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day, you have an opportunity to use your voice to have a positive impact--at work or in your community. You can inspire and persuade your audience--or you can distract and put them to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nervous, rambling robotic--these presentation styles can ruin a talk on even the most critical topics. And with each weak performance, career prospects dim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get ahead and make an impact, you need to deliver well-crafted messages with confidence and authenticity. You must &lt;em&gt;sound &lt;/em&gt;as capable as you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Public speaking is a skill, not a talent. With the right guidance, anyone can be a powerful speaker. Learn to conquer fear, capture attention, motivate action, and take charge of your career with &lt;em&gt;Speak with Impact&lt;/em&gt;. Written by an opera singer turned CEO, speaker, and executive communication coach, the book unravels the mysteries of commanding attention in any setting, professional or personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether it's speaking up at a meeting, presenting to clients, or talking to large groups, the book's easy-to-use frameworks, examples, and exercises help you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kickstart the creative process&lt;br /&gt;Compose a clear and concise message&lt;br /&gt;Engage your audience through storytelling and humor&lt;br /&gt;Banish filler words and uptalk&lt;br /&gt;Strengthen and project your voice&lt;br /&gt;Use breathing techniques to overcome stage fright&lt;br /&gt;Use effective body language&lt;br /&gt;Build your executive presence&lt;br /&gt;Deliver presentations with confidence and authenticity&lt;br /&gt;When you know what to say and how to say it, people listen. Find your powerful voice... and step into leadership. Speak with impact.</description>

  <description>As many as a third of leaders lead at a distance, and the number is rising. Internationally recognized leadership guru Kevin Eikenberry (Remarkable Leadership book and podcast) teams with his Remote Leadership Institute co-founder Wayne Turmel to chart all the ways that remote leadership differs from leading in-person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make leadership happen today we must rely more on technology and far less on face-to face communication. This can make the work of leaders and team members more isolating, frustrating and stressful. This book is for motivated leaders who want to get a handle on their remote work and teams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book is built around the authors' 3 O model: Ourselves, Others, and Outcomes. They explain how to cultivate the mindset and attitude needed to lead oneself effectively at a distance; how to engage others when you're not physically present; and what processes and tools to use to make sure dispersed teams achieve the desired outcomes. In some ways the job of a leader has changed less than we think. Leadership is leadership and people are people. But (and it is a pretty big but) how we do it needs to evolve if we want the results and outcomes our organizations demand, leaders need, and their team members deserve.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He is a Legend.&lt;br /&gt;She is a Prodigy.&lt;br /&gt;Who will be Champion?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;June and Day have sacrificed so much for the people of the Republic—and each other—and now their country is on the brink of a new existence. June is back in the good graces of the Republic, working within the government’s elite circles as Princeps-Elect, while Day has been assigned a high-level military position. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But neither could have predicted the circumstances that will reunite them: just when a peace treaty is imminent, a plague outbreak causes panic in the Colonies, and war threatens the Republic’s border cities. This new strain of plague is deadlier than ever, and June is the only one who knows the key to her country’s defense. But saving the lives of thousands will mean asking the one she loves to give up everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With heart-pounding action and suspense, Marie Lu’s bestselling trilogy draws to a stunning conclusion.</description>

Born into the slums, fifteen-year-old Day is the country's most wanted criminal. But his motives may not be as malicious as they seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From very different worlds, June and Day have no reason to cross paths—until the day June's brother, Metias, is murdered and Day becomes the prime suspect. Caught in the ultimate game of cat and mouse, Day is in a race for his family's survival, while June seeks to avenge Metias's death. But in a shocking turn of events, the two uncover the truth of what has really brought them together, and the sinister lengths their country will go to keep its secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternate Cover edition for ISBN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29863705-legend" rel="nofollow"&gt;9780399256752&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Could psychedelic drugs change our worldview? One of America's most admired writers takes us on a mind-altering journey to the frontiers of human consciousness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;When LSD was first discovered in the 1940s, it seemed to researchers, scientists and doctors as if the world might be on the cusp of psychological revolution. It promised to shed light on the deep mysteries of consciousness, as well as offer relief to addicts and the mentally ill. But in the 1960s, with the vicious backlash against the counter-culture, all further research was banned. In recent years, however, work has quietly begun again on the amazing potential of LSD, psilocybin and DMT. Could these drugs in fact improve the lives of many people? Diving deep into this extraordinary world and putting himself forward as a guinea-pig, Michael Pollan has written a remarkable history of psychedelics and a compelling portrait of the new generation of scientists fascinated by the implications of these drugs. &lt;i&gt;How to Change Your Mind&lt;/i&gt; is a report from what could very well be the future of human consciousness.</description>

  <description>A language barrier is no match for love. Lauren Collins discovered this firsthand when, in her early thirties, she moved to London and fell for a Frenchman named Olivier—a surprising turn of events for someone who didn’t have a passport until she was in college. But what does it mean to love someone in a second language? Collins wonders, as her relationship with Olivier continues to grow entirely in English. Are there things she doesn’t understand about Olivier, having never spoken to him in his native tongue? Does “I love you” even mean the same thing as “Je t’aime”? When the couple, newly married, relocates to Francophone Geneva, Collins—fearful of one day becoming "a Borat of a mother" who doesn’t understand her own kids—decides to answer her questions for herself by learning French. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;When in French&lt;/i&gt; is a laugh-out-loud funny and surprising memoir about the lengths we go to for love, as well as an exploration across culture and history into how we learn languages—and what they say about who we are. Collins grapples with the complexities of the French language, enduring excruciating role-playing games with her classmates at a Swiss language school and accidentally telling her mother-in-law that she’s given birth to a coffee machine. In learning French, Collins must wrestle with the very nature of French identity and society—which, it turns out, is a far cry from life back home in North Carolina. Plumbing the mysterious depths of humanity’s many forms of language, Collins describes with great style and wicked humor the frustrations, embarrassments, surprises, and, finally, joys of learning—and living in—French.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Plunge into the Norfolk Broads as the Ds join up with the Coot Club once again, this time to solve a very baffling crime.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;     &lt;i&gt;'Why shouldn't we be detectives too?'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     When Dick and Dorothea arrive in the Norfolk Broads all set for a blissful summer on the river, they find their friends the Death and Glories in a very bad situation. Accused of setting boats adrift, sabotage and theft, the boys are under suspicion by everyone on the river. And in the meantime, the real culprits are still at large. There's no choice but to form a crime-busting team: The Big Six. As the evidence stacks against them, can they solve the mystery and trap the real criminals?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The counterintuitive approach to achieving your true potential, heralded by the &lt;i&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/i&gt; as a groundbreaking idea of the year.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The path to fulfillment, whether at work or at home, is almost never a straight line. Ask anyone who has achieved their biggest goals or who thrives in their relationships, and you’ll hear stories of many unexpected detours along the way. What separates those who rise to these challenges and those who get derailed? The answer is agility—emotional agility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emotional agility is a four-step approach that allows us to navigate life’s twists and turns with self-acceptance, clear-sightedness, and an open mind. In her more than twenty years of research, Susan David has found that no matter how intelligent, resilient, or creative people are, when they ignore how situations or interactions make them feel, they miss opportunities to gain insight, getting hooked by thoughts, emotions, and habits that prevent them from reaching their full potential. Emotionally agile people experience the same stresses and setbacks as anyone else, but they know how to adapt, aligning their actions with their values and making small changes that lead to a life of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on her extensive professional research, her international consulting work, and her own experiences growing up in Apartheid-era South Africa and losing her father at a young age, David shows how anyone can become more emotionally agile and thrive in an uncertain world. Written with authority, wit, and empathy, &lt;i&gt;Emotional Agility&lt;/i&gt; will help you live your most successful life, whoever you are and whatever you face. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the FREE Emotional Agility Insights Quiz here: &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bitly.com/ea-quiz" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://bitly.com/ea-quiz&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Everyone knows that timing is everything. But we don't know much about timing itself. Our lives are a never-ending stream of "when" decisions: when to start a business, schedule a class, get serious about a person. Yet we make those decisions based on intuition and guesswork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timing, it's often assumed, is an art. In &lt;i&gt;When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing&lt;/i&gt;, Pink shows that timing is really a science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on a rich trove of research from psychology, biology, and economics, Pink reveals how best to live, work, and succeed. How can we use the hidden patterns of the day to build the ideal schedule? Why do certain breaks dramatically improve student test scores? How can we turn a stumbling beginning into a fresh start? Why should we avoid going to the hospital in the afternoon? Why is singing in time with other people as good for you as exercise? And what is the ideal time to quit a job, switch careers, or get married?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A field guide to the twenty-first century, written by one of its most celebrated observers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his most ambitious work to date, Thomas L. Friedman shows that we have entered an age of dizzying acceleration--and explains how to live in it. Due to an exponential increase in computing power, climbers atop Mount Everest enjoy excellent cell-phone service and self-driving cars are taking to the roads. A parallel explosion of economic interdependency has created new riches as well as spiraling debt burdens. Meanwhile, Mother Nature is also seeing dramatic changes as carbon levels rise and species go extinct, with compounding results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do these changes interact, and how can we cope with them? To get a better purchase on the present, Friedman returns to his Minnesota childhood and sketches a world where politics worked and joining the middle class was an achievable goal. Today, by contrast, it is easier than ever to be a maker (try 3-D printing) or a breaker (the Islamic State excels at using Twitter), but harder than ever to be a leader or merely "average." Friedman concludes that nations and individuals must learn to be fast (innovative and quick to adapt), fair (prepared to help the casualties of change), and slow (adept at shutting out the noise and accessing their deepest values). With vision, authority, and wit, &lt;i&gt;Thank You for Being Late&lt;/i&gt; establishes a blueprint for how to think about our times.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Swallows are marooned with just a little sailing boat for company. Will they survive their chance to become true explorers?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;     When the Walker family's holiday plans are ruined by Daddy having to work, the whole summer seems lost at sea. But a dull holiday for the children is too miserable to bear so their parents hatch a plan. The Swallows are to be marooned on an island with only a blank map and a little sailing dinghy. Their task? To explore and chart the area, avoid the endless mud and survive. And what do they discover? Well, they might not be as alone as they first thought.</description>

      <![CDATA[Secret Water was first published in 1939, when its author was 56. Arthur Ransom was finished with his Russian adventures by then, but he may have still been a spy, and perhaps a double agent working for both the Soviets and the British.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The celebrated author of &lt;i&gt;A Spy Among Friends&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rogue Heroes&lt;/i&gt; returns with his greatest spy story yet, a thrilling Cold War-era tale of Oleg Gordievsky, the Russian whose secret work helped hasten the collapse of the Soviet Union.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone could be considered a Russian counterpart to the infamous British double-agent Kim Philby, it was Oleg Gordievsky. The son of two KGB agents and the product of the best Soviet institutions, the savvy, sophisticated Gordievsky grew to see his nation's communism as both criminal and philistine. He took his first posting for Russian intelligence in 1968 and eventually became the Soviet Union's top man in London, but from 1973 on he was secretly working for MI6. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nearly a decade, as the Cold War reached its twilight, Gordievsky helped the West turn the tables on the KGB, exposing Russian spies and helping to foil countless intelligence plots, as the Soviet leadership grew increasingly paranoid at the United States's nuclear first-strike capabilities and brought the world closer to the brink of war. Desperate to keep the circle of trust close, MI6 never revealed Gordievsky's name to its counterparts in the CIA, which in turn grew obsessed with figuring out the identity of Britain's obviously top-level source. Their obsession ultimately doomed Gordievsky: the CIA officer assigned to identify him was none other than Aldrich Ames, the man who would become infamous for secretly spying for the Soviets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfolding the delicious three-way gamesmanship between America, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and culminating in the gripping cinematic beat-by-beat of Gordievsky's nail-biting escape from Moscow in 1985, Ben Macintyre's latest may be his best yet. Like the greatest novels of John le Carré, it brings readers deep into a world of treachery and betrayal, where the lines bleed between the personal and the professional, and one man's hatred of communism had the power to change the future of nations.</description>

  <description>Elizabeth Bear concludes her award-winning epic fantasy trilogy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re Temur, exiled heir to his grandfather’s Khaganate, has finally raised his banner and declared himself at war with his usurping uncle. With his companions—the Wizard Samarkar, the Cho-tse Hrahima, and the silent monk Brother Hsiung—he must make his way to Dragon Lake to gather his army of followers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Temur has many enemies, and they are not idle. The sorcerer who leads the Nameless Assassins, whose malice has shattered the peace of all the empires of the Celedon Highway, has struck at Temur’s uncle already. To the south, in the Rasan empire, a magical plague rages. To the east, the great city of Asmaracanda has burned, and the Uthman Caliph is deposed. And in the hidden ancient empire of Erem, Temur’s son has been born and a new moon has risen in the Eternal Sky.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I received my first cybernetic arm when I was eight years old.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naomi Shimizu has undergone several enhancements. A cybernetic arm, to replace her crushed one. Smooth pale skin and visual implants, to replace what was lost in an accident. Over the course of her life, she has traded organic body parts for constructed ones—not always with her consent. So now, Naomi works for the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene under the Cybernetic Registry, to halt and prevent the blackmarket sale of cybernetic mods. But modifications have a way of changing a girl—and Naomi will do anything it takes to do her job. To be perfect.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;'Like to spend a night in the Goblin?&lt;/i&gt;’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Swallows are staying on the Suffolk coast while they wait for their father to return home from China. But although the harbour is bursting with bobbing yachts, barges and steamers, this year there's no chance of any sailing for the landlocked Swallows. That is until they rescue young Jim Brading and his boat the &lt;i&gt;Goblin&lt;/i&gt; from a sticky situation and to their delight are recruited as crew members. Mother agrees they can go, on one condition – they absolutely must not sail out past Beach End Buoy and into the open sea…</description>

      <![CDATA[The best of the Swallows and Amazons. Certainly the most thrilling. And unimaginable today - four underage youth left alone on a boat, out of touch of adults, forced to sail that boat through a storm to another country before re-connecting with the adult world? Impossible. Wonderful. Terrifying.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Presented by Patrick and Se&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;á&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;n Hemingway, this augmented edition of Ernest Hemingway’s classic novel of love during wartime features early drafts and, for the first time, all of the author’s alternate endings. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written when Ernest Hemingway was thirty years old and lauded as the best American novel to emerge from World War I, &lt;i&gt;A Farewell to Arms &lt;/i&gt;is the unforgettable story of an American ambulance driver on the Italian front and his passion for a beautiful English nurse. Set against the looming horrors of the battlefield—weary, demoralized men marching in the rain during the German attack on Caporetto; the profound struggle between loyalty and desertion—this gripping, semiautobiographical work captures the harsh realities of war and the pain of lovers caught in its inexorable sweep. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ernest Hemingway famously said that he rewrote the ending to &lt;i&gt;A Farewell to Arms &lt;/i&gt;thirty-nine times to get the words right. This edition collects all of the alternative endings together for the first time, along with early drafts of other essential passages, offering new insight into Hemingway’s craft and creative process and the evolution of one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century. Featuring Hemingway’s own 1948 introduction to an illustrated reissue of the novel, a personal foreword by the author’s son Patrick Hemingway, and a new introduction by the author’s grandson Seán Hemingway, this edition of &lt;i&gt;A Farewell to Arms &lt;/i&gt;is truly a celebration.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A rigorous, skeptical, deeply reported look at the new science behind the mind's surprising ability to heal the body&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever felt a surge of adrenaline after narrowly avoiding an accident? Salivated at the sight (or thought) of a sour lemon? Felt turned on just from hearing your partner's voice? If so, then you've experienced how dramatically the workings of your mind can affect your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet while we accept that stress or anxiety can damage our health, the idea of "healing thoughts" was long ago hijacked by New Age gurus and spiritual healers. Recently, however, serious scientists from a range of fields have been uncovering evidence that our thoughts, emotions and beliefs can ease pain, heal wounds, fend off infection and heart disease and even slow the progression of AIDS and some cancers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Cure&lt;/i&gt;, award-winning science writer Jo Marchant travels the world to meet the physicians, patients and researchers on the cutting edge of this new world of medicine. We learn how meditation protects against depression and dementia, how social connections increase life expectancy and how patients who feel cared for recover from surgery faster. We meet Iraq war veterans who are using a virtual arctic world to treat their burns and children whose ADHD is kept under control with half the normal dose of medication. We watch as a transplant patient uses the smell of lavender to calm his hostile immune system and an Olympic runner shaves vital seconds off his time through mind-power alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on the very latest research, Marchant explores the vast potential of the mind's ability to heal, lays out its limitations and explains how we can make use of the findings in our own lives. With clarity and compassion, &lt;i&gt;Cure&lt;/i&gt; points the way towards a system of medicine that treats us not simply as bodies but as human beings.</description>

That’s just what the Swallows and Amazons and Dick and Dorothea decide to hunt for in the hills high above the lake. But it’s a hot and dry summer and water is in scarce supply. Worse still for the troubled campers, they have competition: Squashy Hat. Anybody can see he is a prospector. And talk about squashy hats! The children have never seen squashier. Just who is he and what sort of traps is he laying? Using pigeons to carry messages, braving dangerous mines and fires, the Swallows, Amazons and D’s Mining Company must stake their claim before their dreaded rival...</description>

  <description>In the Tale of &lt;i&gt;The Fall of Gondolin&lt;/i&gt; are two of the greatest powers in the world. There is Morgoth of the uttermost evil, unseen in this story but ruling over a vast military power from his fortress of Angband. Deeply opposed to Morgoth is Ulmo, second in might only to Manwë, chief of the Valar: he is called the Lord of Waters, of all seas, lakes, and rivers under the sky. But he works in secret in Middle-earth to support the Noldor, the kindred of the Elves among whom were numbered Húrin and Túrin Turambar.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Central to this enmity of the gods is the city of Gondolin, beautiful but undiscoverable. It was built and peopled by Noldorin Elves who, when they dwelt in Valinor, the land of the gods, rebelled against their rule and fled to Middle-earth. Turgon King of Gondolin is hated and feared above all his enemies by Morgoth, who seeks in vain to discover the marvellously hidden city, while the gods in Valinor in heated debate largely refuse to intervene in support of Ulmo’s desires and designs.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Into this world comes Tuor, cousin of Túrin, the instrument of Ulmo’s designs. Guided unseen by him Tuor sets out from the land of his birth on the fearful journey to Gondolin, and in one of the most arresting moments in the history of Middle-earth the sea-god himself appears to him, rising out of the ocean in the midst of a storm. In Gondolin he becomes great; he is wedded to Idril, Turgon’s daughter, and their son is Eärendel, whose birth and profound importance in days to come is foreseen by Ulmo.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; At last comes the terrible ending. Morgoth learns through an act of supreme treachery all that he needs to mount a devastating attack on the city, with Balrogs and dragons and numberless Orcs. After a minutely observed account of the fall of Gondolin, the tale ends with the escape of Túrin and Idril, with the child Eärendel, looking back from a cleft in the mountains as they flee southward, at the blazing wreckage of their city. They were journeying into a new story, the Tale of Eärendel, which Tolkien never wrote, but which is sketched out in this book from other sources.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Following his presentation of &lt;i&gt;Beren and Lúthien &lt;/i&gt;Christopher Tolkien has used the same ‘history in sequence’ mode in the writing of this edition of &lt;i&gt;The Fall of Gondolin. &lt;/i&gt;In the words of J.R.R. Tolkien, it was ‘the first real story of this imaginary world’ and, together with &lt;i&gt;Beren and Lúthien &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; The Children of Húrin&lt;/i&gt;, he regarded it as one of the three ‘Great Tales’ of the Elder Days.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Shattered Pillars&lt;/i&gt; is the second book of Bear's &lt;i&gt;The Eternal Sky&lt;/i&gt; trilogy and the sequel to &lt;i&gt;Range of Ghosts&lt;/i&gt;. Set in a world drawn from our own great Asian Steppes, this saga of magic, politics and war sets Re-Temur, the exiled heir to the great Khagan and his friend Sarmarkar, a Wizard of Tsarepheth, against dark forces determined to conquer all the great Empires along the Celedon Road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Bear is an astonishing writer, whose prose draws you into strange and wonderful worlds, and makes you care deeply about the people and the stories she tells. The world of &lt;i&gt;The Eternal Sky&lt;/i&gt; is broadly and deeply created—her award-nominated novella, "Bone and Jewel Creatures" is also set there.</description>

  <description>Among Shakespeare's plays, "Hamlet" is considered by many his masterpiece. Among actors, the role of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, is considered the jewel in the crown of a triumphant theatrical career. Now Kenneth Branagh plays the leading role and co-directs a brillant ensemble performance. Three generations of legendary leading actors, many of whom first assembled for the Oscar-winning film "Henry V", gather here to perform the rarely heard complete version of the play. This clear, subtly nuanced, stunning dramatization, presented by The Renaissance Theatre Company in association with "Bbc" Broadcasting, features such luminaries as Sir John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, Emma Thompson and Christopher Ravenscroft. It combines a full cast with stirring music and sound effects to bring this magnificent Shakespearen classic vividly to life. Revealing new riches with each listening, this production of "Hamlet" is an invaluable aid for students, teachers and all true lovers of Shakespeare - a recording to be treasured for decades to come.</description>

      <![CDATA[It was time to re-read this classic. One of my favorite questions to ask of the play is, was Hamlet indecisive, as he's usually portrayed, or frenetic, bouncing from one idea to another after the vision of the ghost convinces him of his suspicions that "something is rotten" in Denmark?

  <description>In the brief golden years of King Edward VII’s reign, Rosie McCosh and her three sisters are growing up in an idyllic and eccentric household in Kent, with their ‘pals’ the Pitt boys on one side of the fence and the Pendennis boys on the other. But their days of childhood innocence and adventure are destined to be followed by the apocalypse that will overwhelm their world as they come to adulthood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Rosie, the path ahead is full of challenges: torn between her love for two young men, her sense of duty and her will to live her life to the full, she has to navigate her way through extraordinary times. Can she, and her sisters, build new lives out of the opportunities and devastations that follow the Great War?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louis de Bernières’ magnificent and moving novel follows the lives of an unforgettable cast of characters as the Edwardian age disintegrates into the Great War, and they strike out to seek what happiness can be salvaged from the ruins of the old world.</description>

  <description>C IS FOR CALCULATED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you go about solving an attempted murder when the victim has lost a good part of his memory? It's one of Kinsey's toughest cases yet, but she never backs down from a challenge. Twenty-three-year-old Bobby Callahan is lucky to be alive after a car forced his Porsche over a bridge and into a canyon. The crash left Bobby with a clouded memory. But he can't shake the feeling it was no random accident and that he's still in danger…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C IS FOR CRIME&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only clues Kinsey has to go on are a little red address book and the name "Blackman." Bobby can't remember who he gave the address book to for safekeeping. And any chances of Bobby regaining his memory are dashed when he's killed in another automobile accident just three days after he hires Kinsey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C IS FOR CORPSE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Kinsey digs deeper into her investigation, she discovers Bobby had a secret worth killing for―and unearthing that secret could send Kinsey to her own early death…</description>

  <description>Although business has been slow lately for P.I. Kinsey Millhone, she's reluctant to take on the case of locating Beverly Danziger's sister Elaine Boldt. It's a small matter that Beverly should be able to handle herself. So why is she enlisting Kinsey's services? Beverly claims she needs Elaine's signature on some documents so that she can collect a small inheritance. But the whole affair doesn't sit well with Kinsey. And if there's something she's learned in her line of work, it's to always follow your instincts…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinsey's hunch proves true when she begins her inquiries into Elaine's whereabouts and discovers that the attractive widow was last seen in a flashy lynx coat boarding a plane for Boca Raton. But the more Kinsey searches for Elaine the more questions she encounters. Is Elaine's disappearance tied in to the brutal murder several months ago of one of her bridge partners? And what happened to Elaine's Persian cat who seems to have also vanished?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things take a turn for the worse when a stranger vandalizes the home of one of Elaine's neighbors and another neighbor turns up murdered. With her reputation and career on the line, Kinsey risks all to find a missing woman and a killer who's waiting in the shadows to strike again…</description>

      <![CDATA[There's a rich vein of humor in Grafton's second outing in the Kinsey Millhone series. The stakes don't seem all that high at first - even though we guess that the disappearance is actually a murder. It seems like petty crime and graft. But Grafton keeps the fun and the plot moving, and before we...]]>

  <description>To American observers, the Arab world often seems little more than a distant battleground characterized by religious zealotry and political chaos. Years of tone-deaf US policies have left the region powerless to control its own destiny—playing into a longstanding sense of shame and impotence for a once-mighty people. In this definitive account, preeminent historian Eugene Rogan traces five centuries of Arab history, from the Ottoman conquests through the British and French colonial periods and up to the present age of unipolar American hegemony. The Arab world is now more acutely aware than ever of its own vulnerability, and this sense of subjection carries with it vast geopolitical consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing from Arab sources little known to Western readers, Rogan's &lt;i&gt;The Arabs&lt;/i&gt; will transform our understanding of the past, present, and future of one of the world's most tumultuous regions.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A IS FOR AVENGER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tough-talking former cop, private investigator Kinsey Millhone has set up a modest detective agency in a quiet corner of Santa Teresa, California. A twice-divorced loner with few personal possessions and fewer personal attachments, she's got a soft spot for underdogs and lost causes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A IS FOR ACCUSED&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's why she draws desperate clients like Nikki Fife. Eight years ago, she was convicted of killing her philandering husband. Now she's out on parole and needs Kinsey's help to find the real killer. But after all this time, clearing Nikki's bad name won't be easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A IS FOR ALIBI&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there's one thing that makes Kinsey Millhone feel alive, it's playing on the edge. When her investigation turns up a second corpse, more suspects, and a new reason to kill, Kinsey discovers that the edge is closer--and sharper--than she imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A" Is for Alibi&lt;br /&gt;"B" Is for Burglar&lt;br /&gt;"C" Is for Corpse&lt;br /&gt;"D" Is for Deadbeat&lt;br /&gt;"E" Is for Evidence&lt;br /&gt;"F" Is for Fugitive&lt;br /&gt;"G" Is for Gumshoe&lt;br /&gt;"H" Is for Homicide&lt;br /&gt;"I" Is for Innocent&lt;br /&gt;"J" Is for Judgment&lt;br /&gt;"K" Is for Killer&lt;br /&gt;"L" is for Lawless&lt;br /&gt;"M" Is for Malice&lt;br /&gt;"N" Is for Noose&lt;br /&gt;"O" Is for Outlaw&lt;br /&gt;"P" Is for Peril &lt;br /&gt;"Q" Is for Quarry&lt;br /&gt;"R" Is for Ricochet &lt;br /&gt;"S" Is for Silence &lt;br /&gt;"T" Is for Trespass&lt;br /&gt;"U" Is for Undertow &lt;br /&gt;"V" Is for Vengeance &lt;br /&gt;"W" Is for Wasted &lt;br /&gt;"X" &lt;br /&gt; “Y” Is for Yesterday&lt;br /&gt;The letter Z was unfinished at the time of her death 12/28/2017</description>

  <description>Robert Langdon, Harvard professor of symbology and religious iconology, arrives at the ultramodern Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao to attend a major announcement—the unveiling of a discovery that “will change the face of science forever.” The evening’s host is Edmond Kirsch, a forty-year-old billionaire and futurist whose dazzling high-tech inventions and audacious predictions have made him a renowned global figure. Kirsch, who was one of Langdon’s first students at Harvard two decades earlier, is about to reveal an astonishing breakthrough . . . one that will answer two of the fundamental questions of human existence.&lt;p&gt;As the event begins, Langdon and several hundred guests find themselves captivated by an utterly original presentation, which Langdon realizes will be far more controversial than he ever imagined. But the meticulously orchestrated evening suddenly erupts into chaos, and Kirsch’s precious discovery teeters on the brink of being lost forever. Reeling and facing an imminent threat, Langdon is forced into a desperate bid to escape Bilbao. With him is Ambra Vidal, the elegant museum director who worked with Kirsch to stage the provocative event. Together they flee to Barcelona on a perilous quest to locate a cryptic password that will unlock Kirsch’s secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigating the dark corridors of hidden history and extreme religion, Langdon and Vidal must evade a tormented enemy whose all-knowing power seems to emanate from Spain’s Royal Palace itself... and who will stop at nothing to silence Edmond Kirsch. On a trail marked by modern art and enigmatic symbols, Langdon and Vidal uncover clues that ultimately bring them face-to-face with Kirsch’s shocking discovery... and the breathtaking truth that has long eluded us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Springtime in Styria. And that means war. Springtime in Styria. And that means revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been nineteen years of blood. The ruthless Grand Duke Orso is locked in a vicious struggle with the squabbling League of Eight, and between them they have bled the land white. While armies march, heads roll and cities burn, behind the scenes bankers, priests and older, darker powers play a deadly game to choose who will be king.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;War may be hell but for Monza Murcatto, the Snake of Talins, the most feared and famous mercenary in Duke Orso's employ, it's a damn good way of making money too. Her victories have made her popular - a shade too popular for her employer's taste. Betrayed, thrown down a mountain and left for dead, Murcatto's reward is a broken body and a burning hunger for vengeance. Whatever the cost, seven men must die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her allies include Styria's least reliable drunkard, Styria's most treacherous poisoner, a mass-murderer obsessed with numbers and a Northman who just wants to do the right thing. Her enemies number the better half of the nation. And that's all before the most dangerous man in the world is dispatched to hunt her down and finish the job Duke Orso started...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Springtime in Styria. And that means revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For most of us, having a baby is the most profound, intense, and fascinating experience of our lives. Now scientists and philosophers are starting to appreciate babies, too. The last decade has witnessed a revolution in our understanding of infants and young children. Scientists used to believe that babies were irrational, and that their thinking and experience were limited. Recently, they have discovered that babies learn more, create more, care more, and experience more than we could ever have imagined. And there is good reason to believe that babies are actually smarter, more thoughtful, and even more conscious than adults. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new science holds answers to some of the deepest and oldest questions about what it means to be human. A new baby’s captivated gaze at her mother’s face lays the foundations for love and morality. A toddler’s unstoppable explorations of his playpen hold the key to scientific discovery. A three-year-old’s wild make-believe explains how we can imagine the future, write novels, and invent new technologies. Alison Gopnik - a leading psychologist and philosopher, as well as a mother - explains the groundbreaking new psychological, neuroscientific, and philosophical developments in our understanding of very young children, transforming our understanding of how babies see the world, and in turn promoting a deeper appreciation for the role of parents.&lt;/p&gt;

Once the half-grown-ups reached age seven, that was the age of reason and they could be judged as adults, at least by God, and found wanting.

  <description>Four hundred years from now mankind is strung out across a region of interstellar space inherited from an ancient civilization discovered on Mars. The colonies are linked together by the occasional sublight colony ship voyages and hyperspatial data-casting. Human consciousness is digitally freighted between the stars and downloaded into bodies as a matter of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But some things never change. So when ex-envoy, now-convict Takeshi Kovacs has his consciousness and skills downloaded into the body of a nicotine-addicted ex-thug and presented with a catch-22 offer, he really shouldn't be surprised. Contracted by a billionaire to discover who murdered his last body, Kovacs is drawn into a terrifying conspiracy that stretches across known space and to the very top of society.</description>

  <description>Following the best-selling "Paris to the Moon, " the continuation of the Gopniks' adventures against the panorama of a different though no less storied city as they attempt to make a new home for themselves. &lt;br /&gt;Autumn 2000: After five years in Paris, Adam Gopnik moves his family back to a New York that seems, at first, safer and shinier than ever. Here in the wondrously strange "neighborhood" of Manhattan we observe the triumphs and travails of father, mother, son, and daughter; and of the teachers, coaches, therapists, adversaries, and friends who round out the extended urban family. From Bluie, a goldfish fated to meet a Hitchcockian end, to Charlie Ravioli, an imaginary playmate who, being a New Yorker, is too busy to play, the Gopniks' new home is under the spell of the sort of characters only the city's unique civilization of childhood could produce. &lt;br /&gt;Not long after their return, the fabric of living will be rent by the events of 9/11, but like a magic garment will reweave itself, reviving normalcy in a world where Jewish jokes mingle with debates about the problem of consciousness, the price of real estate, and the meaning of modern art. Along the way, the impermanence and transcendence of life will be embodied in the person of a beloved teacher and coach who, even facing death, radiates a distinctively local light. &lt;br /&gt;Written with Gopnik's signature mix of mind and heart, elegant and exultantly alert to the minute miracles that bring a place to life, "Through the Children's Gate" is a chronicle, by turns tender and hilarious, of a family taking root in the unlikeliest patch of earth.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Zen Masters of Japan&lt;/i&gt; is the second book in a series that traces Zen's profoundly historic journey as it spread eastward from China and Japan, toward the United States. Following &lt;i&gt;Zen Masters of China&lt;/i&gt;, this book concentrates on Zen's significant passage through Japan. More specifically, it describes the lineage of the great teachers, the Zen monk pioneers who set out to enlighten an island ready for an inner transformation based on compassionate awareness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the existing Buddhist establishment in Japan met early Zen pioneers like Dogen and Eisai with fervent resistance, Zen Buddhism ultimately persevered and continued to become further transformed in its passage through Japan. The Japanese culture and Japanese Buddhism practices further deepened and strengthened Zen training by combining it with a variety of esoteric contemplative arts—the arts of poetry, the tea ceremony, calligraphy, and archery. &lt;i&gt;Zen Masters of Japan&lt;/i&gt; chronicles this journey with each Zen master profiled. The book shows how the new practices soon gained popularity among all walks of life—from the lowly peasant, offering a hope of reincarnation and a better life; to the Samurai warrior due to its casual approach to death; to the ruling classes, challenging the intelligentsia because of its scholarly roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A collection of Zen stories, meditation, and their wisdom, &lt;i&gt;Zen Masters of Japan&lt;/i&gt; also explores the ellusive state of 'No Mind' achieved in Japan that is so fundamental to Zen practices today.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Zen Masters of China&lt;/i&gt; presents more than 300 traditional Zen stories and koans, far more than any other collection. Retelling them in their proper place in Zen's historical journey through Chinese Buddhist culture, it also tells a larger story: how, in taking the first step east from India to China, Buddhism began to be Zen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stories of Zen are unlike any other writing, religious or otherwise. Used for centuries by Zen teachers as aids to bring about or deepen the experience of awakening, they have a freshness that goes beyond religious practice and a mystery and authenticity that appeal to a wide range of readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Placed in chronological order, these stories tell the story of Zen itself, how it traveled from West to East with each Zen master to the next, but also how it was transformed in that journey, from an Indian practice to something different in Chinese Buddhism (Ch'an) and then more different still in Japan (Zen). The fact that its transmission was so human, from teacher to student in a long chain from West to East, meant that the cultures it passed through inevitably changed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Zen Masters of China&lt;/i&gt; is first and foremost a collection of mind-bending Zen stories and their wisdom. More than that, without academic pretensions or baggage, it recounts the genealogy of Zen Buddhism in China and, through koan and story, illuminates how Zen became what it is today.</description>

      <![CDATA[There's a mild irony in collecting all the Zen stories you can find into one volume, since the very idea of Zen is that all it takes is one such koan to jar the student loose from his attachments and propel him to enlightenment. But never mind. These stories have far more power in their original...]]>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Oathbringer&lt;/i&gt;, the third volume of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Stormlight Archive, humanity faces a new Desolation with the return of the Voidbringers, a foe with numbers as great as their thirst for vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dalinar Kholin's Alethi armies won a fleeting victory at a terrible cost: The enemy Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm, which now sweeps the world with destruction, and in its passing awakens the once peaceful and subservient parshmen to the horror of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar's blood-soaked past and stand together--and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past--even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Rootabaga Country--where the railroad tracks go from straight to zigzag, where the pigs wear bibs, and where the Village of Cream Puffs floats in the wind. You'll meet baby balloon pickers, flummywisters, corn fairies, and blue foxes--and if you're not careful, you may never find your way back home!&lt;br /&gt;These beautiful new editions retain the original illustrations by Maud and Miska Petersham, and feature gorgeous new jackets by acclaimed illustrator Kurt Cyrus. Carl Sandburg's irrepressible, zany, and completely original &lt;i&gt;Rootabaga Stories&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;More Rootabaga Stories&lt;/i&gt; will stand alone on children's bookshelves--when they aren't in children's hands.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In this must-read book for anyone striving to succeed, pioneering psychologist Angela Duckworth shows parents, educators, students, and business people both seasoned and new that the secret to outstanding achievement is not talent but a focused persistence called grit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do some people succeed and others fail? Sharing new insights from her landmark research on grit, Angela Duckworth explains why talent is hardly a guarantor of success. Rather, other factors can be even more crucial such as identifying our passions and following through on our commitments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on her own powerful story as the daughter of a scientist who frequently bemoaned her lack of smarts, Duckworth describes her winding path through teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience, which led to the hypothesis that what really drives success is not genius, but a special blend of passion and long-term perseverance. As a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Duckworth created her own character lab and set out to test her theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, she takes readers into the field to visit teachers working in some of the toughest schools, cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she's learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers; from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to the cartoon editor of &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winningly personal, insightful, and even life-changing, &lt;i&gt;Grit&lt;/i&gt; is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down, and how that not talent or luck makes all the difference.</description>

  <description>Brandon Sanderson creates worlds, and those worlds are linked. His universe spans the Stormlight Archive, the Mistborn series the tales of Elantris, and others, comprising a unique constellation of vividly imagined realms known as the Cosmere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the first time anywhere, stories representing each of these planets, and their fully realized and distinct magic systems, have been collected in a single spectacular volume. &lt;i&gt;Arcanum Unbounded: The Cosmere Collection&lt;/i&gt; brings together tales spanning the known limits of Sanderson's universe--including the never-before-published &lt;i&gt;Edgedancer&lt;/i&gt;, a thrilling new novella of the Stormlight Archive--along with charts, illustrations, notes...and secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cosmere Collection&lt;/i&gt; encompasses six worlds in all, explored across nine astonishing works of short fiction: &lt;b&gt;Sel&lt;/b&gt; ("The Hope of Elantris" and &lt;i&gt;The Emperor's Soul&lt;/i&gt;); &lt;b&gt;Scadrial&lt;/b&gt; ("The Eleventh Metal," "Allomancer Jak and the Pits of Eltania, Episodes Twenty-eight Through Thirty," and &lt;i&gt;Mistborn: Secret History&lt;/i&gt;); &lt;b&gt;Taldain&lt;/b&gt; ("White Sand"); &lt;b&gt;Threnody&lt;/b&gt; (“Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell”); &lt;b&gt;First of the Sun&lt;/b&gt; (“Sixth of the Dusk”); and &lt;b&gt;Roshar&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Edgedancer&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These exciting tales will catapult you onto an unprecedented journey across a cosmos only Brandon Sanderson could have envisioned. &lt;i&gt;Arcanum Unbounded: The Cosmere Collection&lt;/i&gt; is an indispensible volume no Sanderson fan can do without.</description>

      <![CDATA[Some of these stories are wonderful, and some are just OK. The inclusion of a graphic novel, followed by the word version, seems like padding.

  <description>&lt;p&gt;'Small hostilities were growing; vague jealousies were gaining strength; and far off, wasn't there a nebulous hint of approaching tragedy in the air?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welworth Garden City in the 1940s is a forward-thinking town where free spirits find a home-vegetarians, socialists, and an array of exotic religious groups. Chief among these are the Children of Osiris, led by the eccentric High Prophet, Eustace K. Mildmann. The cult is a seething hotbed of petty resentment, jealousy and dark secrets - which eventually lead to murder. The stage is set for one of Inspector Meredith's most bizarre and exacting cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This witty crime novel by a writer on top form is a neglected classic of British crime fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction by Martin Edwards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Great fun from the classical era of the British mystery. Bude has a grand time parodying the fad for spiritualism based (very loosely) on Egyptian mysteries, and his delineation of "Cooism," is hilarious. The murder is distinctly secondary, but you won't care -- it's all splendid fun.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Being able to speak is what makes us human.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’ve ever felt the shock of listening to a recording of your own voice, you realise how important your voice is to your personal identity. We judge others – and whether we trust them – not just by their words but by the way they talk: their intonation, their pitch, their accent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now You’re Talking&lt;/i&gt; explores the full range of our voice – how we speak and how we sing; how our vocal anatomy works; what happens when things go wrong; and how technology enables us to imitate and manipulate the human voice. Trevor Cox talks to vocal coaches who help people to develop their new voice after a gender change; to record producers whose use of technology has transformed the singing voice; and to computer scientists who replicate the human voice in their development of artificial intelligence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning with the Neanderthals, &lt;i&gt;Now You’re Talking &lt;/i&gt;takes us all the way to the digital age – with the frightening prospect that we may soon hear ‘Unexpected item in the bagging area’ more frequently than a friendly ‘Hello, how are you?’ in the street.</description>

  <description>What does everyone in the modern world need to know? Renowned psychologist Jordan B. Peterson's answer to this most difficult of questions uniquely combines the hard-won truths of ancient tradition with the stunning revelations of cutting-edge scientific research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humorous, surprising, and informative, Dr. Peterson tells us why skateboarding boys and girls must be left alone, what terrible fate awaits those who criticize too easily, and why you should always pet a cat when you meet one on the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does the nervous system of the lowly lobster have to tell us about standing up straight (with our shoulders back) and about success in life? Why did ancient Egyptians worship the capacity to pay careful attention as the highest of gods? What dreadful paths do people tread when they become resentful, arrogant, and vengeful? Dr. Peterson journeys broadly, discussing discipline, freedom, adventure, and responsibility, distilling the world's wisdom into 12 practical and profound rules for life. 12 Rules for Life shatters the modern commonplaces of science, faith, and human nature while transforming and ennobling the mind and spirit of its listeners.</description>

  <description>Based on thousands of pages from Leonardo's astonishing notebooks and new discoveries about his life and work, Walter Isaacson weaves a narrative that connects his art to his science. He shows how Leonardo's genius was based on skills we can improve in ourselves, such as passionate curiosity, careful observation, and an imagination so playful that it flirted with fantasy. He produced the two most famous paintings in history, The Last Supper and the Mona Lisa. But in his own mind, he was just as much a man of science and technology. With a passion that sometimes became obsessive, he pursued innovative studies of anatomy, fossils, birds, the heart, flying machines, botany, geology, and weaponry. His ability to stand at the crossroads of the humanities and the sciences, made iconic by his drawing of Vitruvian Man, made him history's most creative genius</description>

Instead, he gives us his thinking, largely through a spirited discussion of the notebooks and how they reveal the contours of da Vinci's thought.

    &lt;strong&gt;Why is paying for things painful?&lt;/strong&gt;
   
   
    &lt;strong&gt;Why are we comfortable overpaying for something in the present just because we’ve overpaid for it in the past?&lt;/strong&gt;
   
   
    &lt;strong&gt;Why is it easy to pay $4 for a soda on vacation, when we wouldn’t spend more than $1 on that same soda at our local grocery store?&lt;/strong&gt;
   
 &lt;p&gt;We think of money as numbers, values, and amounts, but when it comes down to it, when we actually use our money, we engage our hearts more than our heads. Emotions play a powerful role in shaping our financial behavior, often making us our own worst enemies as we try to save, access value, and spend responsibly. In &lt;em&gt;Dollars and Sense&lt;/em&gt;, bestselling author and behavioral economist Dan Ariely teams up with financial comedian and writer Jeff Kreisler to challenge many of our most basic assumptions about the precarious relationship between our brains and our money. In doing so, they undermine many of personal finance’s most sacred beliefs and explain how we can override some of our own instincts to make better financial choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring a wide range of everyday topics—from the lure of pain-free spending with credit cards to the  pitfalls of household budgeting to the seductive power of holiday sales—Ariely and Kreisler demonstrate how our misplaced confidence in our spending habits frequently leads us astray, costing us more than we realize, whether it’s the real value of the time we spend driving forty-five minutes to save $10 or our inability to properly assess what the things we buy are actually worth. Together Ariely and Kreisler reveal the emotional forces working against us and how we can counteract them. Mixing case studies and anecdotes with concrete advice and lessons, they cut through the unconscious fears and desires driving our worst financial instincts and teach us how to improve our money habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result not only reveals the rationale behind our most head-scratching financial choices but also offers clear guidance for navigating the treacherous financial landscape of the brain. Fascinating, engaging, funny, and essential, &lt;em&gt;Dollars and Sense&lt;/em&gt; provides the practical tools we need to understand and improve our financial choices, save and spend smarter, and ultimately live better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Shevek, a brilliant physicist, decides to take action. He will seek answers, question the unquestionable, and attempt to tear down the walls of hatred that have isolated his planet of anarchists from the rest of the civilized universe. To do this dangerous task will mean giving up his family and possibly his life—Shevek must make the unprecedented journey to the utopian mother planet, Urras, to challenge the complex structures of life and living, and ignite the fires of change.</description>

  <description>The epic story of the rise and fall of the empire of cotton, its centrality to the world economy, and its making and remaking of global capitalism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cotton is so ubiquitous as to be almost invisible, yet understanding its history is key to understanding the origins of modern capitalism. Sven Beckert’s rich, fascinating book tells the story of how, in a remarkably brief period, European entrepreneurs and powerful statesmen recast the world’s most significant manufacturing industry, combining imperial expansion and slave labor with new machines and wage workers to change the world. Here is the story of how, beginning well before the advent of machine production in the 1780s, these men captured ancient trades and skills in Asia, and combined them with the expropriation of lands in the Americas and the enslavement of African workers to crucially reshape the disparate realms of cotton that had existed for millennia, and how industrial capitalism gave birth to an empire, and how this force transformed the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The empire of cotton was, from the beginning, a fulcrum of constant global struggle between slaves and planters, merchants and statesmen, workers and factory owners. Beckert makes clear how these forces ushered in the world of modern capitalism, including the vast wealth and disturbing inequalities that are with us today. The result is a book as unsettling as it is enlightening: a book that brilliantly weaves together the story of cotton with how the present global world came to exist.&lt;b&gt;

  <description>Forced to surrender his ship, the Sutherland, after a long and bloody battle, Captain Horatio Hornblower now bides his time as a prisoner in a French fortress. Within days he and his first lieutenant, Bush, who was crippled in the last fight, are to be taken to Paris to be tried on trumped-up charges of violating the laws of war, and most probably executed as part of Napoleon's attempt to rally the warweary empire behind him. Even if Hornblower escapes this fate and somehow finds his way back to England, he will face court-martial for his surrender of a British ship. As fears for his life and his reputation compete in his mind with worries about his pregnant wife and his possibly widowed lover, the indomitable captain impatiently awaits the chance to make his next move.</description>

  <description>On an Aegean island one summer, an English traveller meets an enigmatic elderly Frenchwoman. He is captivated by a painting she owns of a busy Caribbean port overlooked by a volcano and, in time, she shares the story of her youth there in the early twentieth century. Set in the tropical luxury of the island of Saint-Jacques, hers is a tale of romantic intrigue and decadence amongst the descendents of slaves and a fading French aristocracy. But on the night of the annual Mardi Gras ball, catastrophe overwhelms the island and the world she knew came to an abrupt and haunting end. The Violins of Saint-Jacques captures the unforeseen drama of forces beyond human control. &lt;br /&gt;Originally published in 1953, it was immediately hailed as a rare and exotic sweep of colour across the drab monochrome of the post-war years, and it has lost nothing of its original flavour.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unscaled&lt;/i&gt; identifies the forces that are reshaping the global economy and turning one of the fundamental laws of business and society--the economies of scale--on its head.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An innovative trend combining technology with economics is unraveling behemoth industries--including corporations, banks, farms, media conglomerates, energy systems, governments, and schools-that have long dominated business and society. Size and scale have become a liability. A new generation of upstarts is using artificial intelligence to automate tasks that once required expensive investment, and "renting" technology platforms to build businesses for hyper-focused markets, enabling them to grow big without the bloat of giant organizations.&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Unscaled&lt;/i&gt;, venture capitalist Hemant Taneja explains how the unscaled phenomenon allowed Warby Parker to cheaply and easily start a small company, build a better product, and become a global competitor in no time, upending entrenched eyewear giant Luxottica. It similarly enabled Stripe to take on established payment processors throughout the world, and Livongo to help diabetics control their disease while simultaneously cutting the cost of treatment. The unscaled economy is remaking massive, deeply rooted industries and opening up fantastic possibilities for entrepreneurs, imaginative companies, and resourceful individuals. It can be the model for solving some of the world's greatest problems, including climate change and soaring health-care costs, but will also unleash new challenges that today's leaders must address.</description>

  <description>In Super Bowl XLIX, Seahawks coach Pete Carroll made one of the most controversial calls in football history: With 26 seconds remaining, and trailing by four at the Patriots' one-yard line, he called for a pass instead of a hand off to his star running back. The pass was intercepted and the Seahawks lost. Critics called it the dumbest play in history. But was the call really that bad? Or did Carroll actually make a great move that was ruined by bad luck?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the best decision doesn't yield the best outcome every time. There's always an element of luck that you can't control, and there is always information that is hidden from view. So the key to long-term success (and avoiding worrying yourself to death) is to think in bets: How sure am I? What are the possible ways things could turn out? What decision has the highest odds of success? Did I land in the unlucky 10% on the strategy that works 90% of the time? Or is my success attributable to dumb luck rather than great decision making?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie Duke, a former World Series of Poker champion turned business consultant, draws on examples from business, sports, politics, and (of course) poker to share tools anyone can use to embrace uncertainty and make better decisions. For most people, it's difficult to say "I'm not sure" in a world that values and, even, rewards the appearance of certainty. But professional poker players are comfortable with the fact that great decisions don't always lead to great outcomes and bad decisions don't always lead to bad outcomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By shifting your thinking from a need for certainty to a goal of accurately assessing what you know and what you don't, you'll be less vulnerable to reactive emotions, knee-jerk biases, and destructive habits in your decision making. You'll become more confident, calm, compassionate and successful in the long run.</description>

  <description>The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling authors of &lt;i&gt;The Carrot Principle&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;All In&lt;/i&gt; deliver a breakthrough, groundbreaking guide for building today’s most collaborative teams—so any organization can operate at peak performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A massive shift is taking place in the business world. In today’s average company, up to eighty percent of employees’ days are now spent working in teams. And yet the teams most people find themselves in are nowhere near as effective as they could be. They’re often divided by tensions, if not outright dissension, and dysfunctional teams drain employees’ energy, enthusiasm, and creativity. Now Adrian Gostick and Chester Elton share the proven ways managers can build cohesive, productive teams, despite the distractions and challenges every business is facing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Best Team Wins&lt;/i&gt;, Gostick and Elton studied more than 850,000 employee engagement surveys to develop their “Five Disciplines of Team Leaders,” explaining how to recognize and motivate different generations to enhance individual engagement; ways to promote healthy discord and spark innovation; and techniques to unify customer focus and build bridges across functions, cultures, and distance. They’ve shared these disciplines with their corporate clients and have now distilled their breakthrough findings into a succinct, engaging guide for business leaders everywhere. Gostick and Elton offer practical ways to address the &lt;i&gt;real &lt;/i&gt;challenges today’s managers are facing, such as the rise of the Millennials, the increasing speed of change, the growing number of global and virtual teams, and the friction created by working cross-functionally.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a must-read for anyone looking to maximize performance at work, from two of the most successful corporate consultants of their generation, whom &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; called “creative and refreshing.”</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A radical, evidence-based new vision for healing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forty-five per cent of adults experience chronic health problems, such as back pain, headaches, fatigue, obesity, diabetes, dementia, and depression. These illnesses rarely respond to conventional medicine alone, progressing in almost all cases. Yet in his almost 40 years as a doctor and health researcher, Wayne Jonas has helped many of his patients to recover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he can help you, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How Healing Works&lt;/i&gt; reveals that only 20 per cent of healing comes from medicine or surgery, while 80 per cent depends on other factors — a patient’s physical environment, their lifestyle, their values, and more. It offers practical advice on working with your doctor to construct a personal, integrative plan for healing and offers examples of what this might look like. The key to success is finding out what works for you — whether this is conventional medicine, complementary therapies, or something else entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the argument that you can simply ‘think yourself’ better. Rather, it uses case studies and rigorous scientific research to show how, if you understand how healing really works, you can take greater control of your recovery, increase the likelihood that any treatment will be effective, prevent many of the diseases of ageing, and significantly reduce your dependence on medicine.</description>

  <description>Patrick Leigh Fermor (1915-2011) was a war hero whose exploits in Crete are legendary, and above all he is widely acclaimed as the greatest travel writer of our times, notably for his books about his walk across pre-war Europe, &lt;i&gt;A Time of Gifts&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Between the Woods and the Water&lt;/i&gt;; he was a self-educated polymath, a lover of Greece and the best company in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Artemis Cooper has drawn on years of interviews and conversations with Paddy and his closest friends as well as having complete access to his archives. Her beautifully crafted biography portrays a man of extraordinary gifts - no one wore their learning so playfully, nor inspired such passionate friendship.</description>

      <![CDATA[This early collection has all the strengths and weaknesses of Neruda's poetry -- the passion, the reach, the loves, and the metaphors that take on a life of their own. For me, to dip into a Neruda poem is like putting a toe into the sea, feeling the shock of the cold, the flare of the salt scents...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;They call him father, liberator, warlord, Reaper. But he feels a boy as he falls toward the pale blue planet, his armor red, his army vast, his heart heavy. It is the tenth year of war and the thirty-second of his life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A decade ago, Darrow was the hero of the revolution he believed would break the chains of the Society. But the Rising has shattered everything: Instead of peace and freedom, it has brought endless war. Now he must risk everything he has fought for on one last desperate mission. Darrow still believes he can save everyone, but can he save himself?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And throughout the worlds, other destinies entwine with Darrow’s to change his fate forever: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A young Red girl flees tragedy in her refugee camp and achieves for herself a new life she could never have imagined.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An ex-soldier broken by grief is forced to steal the most valuable thing in the galaxy—or pay with his life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And Lysander au Lune, the heir in exile to the sovereign, wanders the stars with his mentor, Cassius, haunted by the loss of the world that Darrow transformed, and dreaming of what will rise from its ashes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Red Rising&lt;/i&gt; was the story of the end of one universe, and &lt;i&gt;Iron Gold&lt;/i&gt; is the story of the creation of a new one. Witness the beginning of a stunning new saga of tragedy and triumph from masterly &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Pierce Brown.</description>

Finding one's power, wielding power, for good or ill, losing power, and finding out that power doesn't bring you what you hoped, necessarily.

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Geoffrey West's research centres on a quest to find unifying principles and patterns connecting everything, from cells and ecosystems to cities, social networks and businesses.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scale&lt;/i&gt; addresses big, urgent questions about global sustainability, population explosion, urbanization, ageing, cancer, human lifespans and the increasing pace of life, but also encourages us to question the world around us. Why can we live for 120 years but not for a thousand? Why does the pace of life continually increase? Why do mice live for just two or three years and elephants for up to 75? Why do companies behave like mice, and are they all destined to die? Do cities, companies and human beings have natural, pre-determined lifespans? Are we just a fascinating experiment in natural selection that is ultimately doomed to fail? And what is the origin of the magic number 4 that seems to determine much of physiology and life-history from birth to death?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>One of the greatest feats in Patrick Leigh Fermor's remarkable life was the kidnapping of General Kreipe, the German commander in Crete, on 26 April 1944. He and Captain Billy Moss hatched a daring plan to abduct the general, while ensuring that no reprisals were taken against the Cretan population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dressed as German military police, they stopped and took control of Kreipe's car, drove through twenty-two German checkpoints, then succeeded in hiding from the German army before finally being picked up on a beach in the south of the island and transported to safety in Egypt on 14 May.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Abducting a General&lt;/i&gt; is Leigh Fermor's own account of the kidnap, published for the first time. Written in his inimitable prose, and introduced by acclaimed SOE historian Professor Roderick Bailey, it is a glorious first-hand account of one of the great adventures of the Second World War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included in this book are Leigh Fermor's intelligence reports, sent from caves deep within Crete yet still retaining his remarkable prose skills, which bring the immediacy of SOE operations vividly alive, as well as the peril which the SOE and Resistance were operating under; and a guide to the journey that Kreipe was taken on from the abandonment of his car to the embarkation site so that the modern visitor can relive this extraordinary event.</description>

Dedicated to art, idealistic and naive, his marriage failed because he was unwilling to consummate it. He championed the works of J. M. W. Turner and the Pre...]]>

  <description>Flavia is enjoying the summer, spending her days punting along the river with her reluctant family. Languishing in boredom, she drags a slack hand in the water, and catches her fingers in the open mouth of a drowned corpse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to shore, the dead man is found to be dressed in blue silk with ribbons at the knee, and wearing a single red ballet slipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flavia needs to put her super-sleuthing skills to the test to investigate the murder of three gossips in the local church, and to keep her sisters out of danger. But what could possibly connect the son of an executed killer, a far too canny police constable, a travelling circus, and the publican's mysteriously talented wife?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A five-hundred-year-old legend. An ancient curse. A stunning medical mystery. And a pioneering journey into the unknown heart of the world's densest jungle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the days of conquistador Hernán Cortés, rumors have circulated about a lost city of immense wealth hidden somewhere in the Honduran interior, called the White City or the Lost City of the Monkey God. Indigenous tribes speak of ancestors who fled there to escape the Spanish invaders, and they warn that anyone who enters this sacred city will fall ill and die. In 1940, swashbuckling journalist Theodore Morde returned from the rainforest with hundreds of artifacts and an electrifying story of having found the Lost City of the Monkey God-but then committed suicide without revealing its location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three quarters of a century later, bestselling author Doug Preston joined a team of scientists on a groundbreaking new quest. In 2012 he climbed aboard a rickety, single-engine plane carrying the machine that would change everything: lidar, a highly advanced, classified technology that could map the terrain under the densest rainforest canopy. In an unexplored valley ringed by steep mountains, that flight revealed the unmistakable image of a sprawling metropolis, tantalizing evidence of not just an undiscovered city but an enigmatic, lost civilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Venturing into this raw, treacherous, but breathtakingly beautiful wilderness to confirm the discovery, Preston and the team battled torrential rains, quickmud, disease-carrying insects, jaguars, and deadly snakes. But it wasn't until they returned that tragedy struck: Preston and others found they had contracted in the ruins a horrifying, sometimes lethal-and incurable-disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suspenseful and shocking, filled with colorful history, hair-raising adventure, and dramatic twists of fortune, &lt;i&gt;The Lost City of the Monkey God&lt;/i&gt; is the absolutely true, eyewitness account of one of the great discoveries of the twenty-first century.</description>

  <description>The four Melkerson children are a little bit worried on reaching Seacrow Island, where their father has rented a cottage for the whole summer without even setting eyes on it. On the boat a man told Pelle, the youngest Melkerson, that the cottage’s roof leaks. They disembark in the pouring rain.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Seacrow Island, however, turns out to be full of all sorts of wonderful surprises. Pelle loves animals, and here he finds Bosun, the most gigantic dog he’s ever seen, along with his irrepressible owner, Tjorven. Johan and Niklas meet Teddy and Freddy, two girls, as it turns out, who know all about boats and exploring. As for nineteen-year-old Malin, she falls in love for the first time. By the end of the summer, all four children and their father know that Seacrow Island is home.</description>

  <description>Nothing "goes viral." If you think a popular movie, song, or app came out of nowhere to become a word-of-mouth success in today's crowded media environment, you're missing the real story. Each blockbuster has a secret history--of power, influence, dark broadcasters, and passionate cults that turn some new products into cultural phenomena. Even the most brilliant ideas wither in obscurity if they fail to connect with the right network, and the consumers that matter most aren't the early adopters, but rather their friends, followers, and imitators -- the audience of your audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his groundbreaking investigation, &lt;i&gt;Atlantic&lt;/i&gt; senior editor Derek Thompson uncovers the hidden psychology of why we like what we like and reveals the economics of cultural markets that invisibly shape our lives. Shattering the sentimental myths of hit-making that dominate pop culture and business, Thompson shows quality is insufficient for success, nobody has "good taste," and some of the most popular products in history were one bad break away from utter failure. It may be a new world, but there are some enduring truths to what audiences and consumers want. People love a familiar surprise: a product that is bold, yet sneakily recognizable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every business, every artist, every person looking to promote themselves and their work wants to know what makes some works so successful while others disappear. &lt;i&gt;Hit Makers&lt;/i&gt; is a magical mystery tour through the last century of pop culture blockbusters and the most valuable currency of the twenty-first century--people's attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the dawn of impressionist art to the future of Facebook, from small Etsy designers to the origin of Star Wars, Derek Thompson leaves no pet rock unturned to tell the fascinating story of how culture happens and why things become popular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Hit Makers&lt;/i&gt;, Derek Thompson investigates: &lt;br /&gt; - The secret link between ESPN's sticky programming and the The Weeknd's catchy choruses&lt;br /&gt; - Why Facebook is the world's most important modern newspaper&lt;br /&gt; - How advertising critics predicted Donald Trump&lt;br /&gt; - The 5th grader who accidentally launched "Rock Around the Clock," the biggest hit in rock and roll history&lt;br /&gt; - How Barack Obama and his speechwriters think of themselves as songwriters&lt;br /&gt; - How Disney conquered the world--but the future of hits belongs to savvy amateurs and individuals&lt;br /&gt; - The French collector who accidentally created the Impressionist canon&lt;br /&gt; - Quantitative evidence that the biggest music hits aren't always the best&lt;br /&gt; - Why almost all Hollywood blockbusters are sequels, reboots, and adaptations&lt;br /&gt; - Why one year--1991--is responsible for the way pop music sounds today&lt;br /&gt; - Why another year --1932--created the business model of film&lt;br /&gt; - How data scientists proved that "going viral" is a myth&lt;br /&gt; - How 19th century immigration patterns explain the most heard song in the Western Hemisphere</description>

  <description>Four decades ago, Richard Forthrast, the black sheep of an Iowa family, fled to a wild and lonely mountainous corner of British Columbia to avoid the draft. Smuggling backpack loads of high-grade marijuana across the border into Northern Idaho, he quickly amassed an enormous and illegal fortune. With plenty of time and money to burn, he became addicted to an online fantasy game in which opposing factions battle for power and treasure in a vast cyber realm. Like many serious gamers, he began routinely purchasing virtual gold pieces and other desirables from Chinese gold farmers—young professional players in Asia who accumulated virtual weapons and armor to sell to busy American and European buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Richard, the game was the perfect opportunity to launder his aging hundred dollar bills and begin his own high-tech start up—a venture that has morphed into a Fortune 500 computer gaming group, Corporation 9592, with its own super successful online role-playing game, T’Rain. But the line between fantasy and reality becomes dangerously blurred when a young gold farmer accidently triggers a virtual war for dominance—and Richard is caught at the center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this edgy, 21st century tale, Neal Stephenson, one of the most ambitious and prophetic writers of our time, returns to the terrain of his cyberpunk masterpieces &lt;i&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/i&gt;, leading readers through the looking glass and into the dark heart of imagination.</description>

  <description>In the late 1940s Patrick Leigh Fermor, now widely regarded as one of the twentieth century’s greatest travel writers, set out to explore the then relatively little-visited islands of the Caribbean. Rather than a comprehensive political or historical study of the region, &lt;i&gt;The Traveller’s Tree&lt;/i&gt;, Leigh Fermor’s first book, gives us his own vivid, idiosyncratic impressions of Guadeloupe, Martinique, Dominica, Barbados, Trinidad, and Haiti, among other islands. Here we watch Leigh Fermor walk the dusty roads of the countryside and the broad avenues of former colonial capitals, equally at home among the peasant and the elite, the laborer and the artist. He listens to steel drum bands, delights in the Congo dancing that closes out Havana’s Carnival, and observes vodou and Rastafarian rites, all with the generous curiosity and easy erudition that readers will recognize from his subsequent classic accounts &lt;i&gt;A Time of Gifts&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Between the Woods and the Water&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Casablanca&lt;/i&gt; was first released in 1942, just two weeks after the city of Casablanca itself surrendered to American troops led by General Patton. Featuring a pitch-perfect screenplay, a classic soundtrack, and unforgettable performances by Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and a deep supporting cast, Casablanca was hailed in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; as “a picture that makes the spine tingle and the heart take a leap.” The film won Oscars for best picture, best director, and best screenplay, and would go on to enjoy more revival screenings than any other movie in history. It became so firmly ensconced in the cultural imagination that, as Umberto Eco once said, &lt;i&gt;Casablanca&lt;/i&gt; is “not &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; movie; it is ‘movies.’ ”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;We’ll Always Have Casablanca&lt;/i&gt; is celebrated film historian Noah Isenberg’s rich account of this most beloved movie’s origins. Through extensive research and interviews with filmmakers, film critics, family members of the cast and crew, and diehard fans, Isenberg reveals the myths and realities behind &lt;i&gt;Casablanca&lt;/i&gt;’s production, exploring the transformation of the unproduced stage play into the classic screenplay, the controversial casting decisions, the battles with Production Code censors, and the effect of the war’s progress on the movie’s reception. Isenberg particularly focuses on the central role refugees from Hitler’s Europe played in the production (nearly all of the actors and actresses cast in &lt;i&gt;Casablanca&lt;/i&gt; were immigrants).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, Isenberg turns to &lt;i&gt;Casablanca&lt;/i&gt;’s long afterlife and the reasons it remains so revered. From the Marx Brothers’ 1946 spoof hit, &lt;i&gt;A Night in Casablanca&lt;/i&gt;, to loving parodies in &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; cartoons, &lt;i&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/i&gt; skits, and &lt;i&gt;Simpsons&lt;/i&gt; episodes, Isenberg delves into the ways the movie has lodged itself in the American psyche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with fresh insights into &lt;i&gt;Casablanca&lt;/i&gt;’s creation, production, and legacy, &lt;i&gt;We’ll Always Have Casablanca&lt;/i&gt; is a magnificent account of what made the movie so popular and why it continues to dazzle audiences seventy-five years after its release.</description>

  <description>In an old mansion in Cennethisar (formerly a fishing village, now a posh resort near Istanbul) the old widow Fatma awaits the annual summer visit of her grandchildren: Faruk, a dissipated failed historian; his sensitive leftist sister, Nilgun; and the younger grandson, Metin, a high school student drawn to the fast life of the nouveaux riches, who dreams of going to America. The widow has lived in the village for decades, ever since her husband, an idealistic young doctor, first arrived to serve the poor fishermen. Now mostly bedridden, she is attended by her faithful servant Recep, a dwarf--and the doctor's illegitimate son. Mistress and servant share memories, and grievances, of those early years. But it is Recep's cousin Hassan, a high school dropout, and fervent right-wing nationalist, who will draw the visiting family into the growing political cataclysm, in this spell-binding novel depicting Turkey's tumultuous century-long struggle for modernity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Translated by Robert Finn</description>

  <description>A hilarious and deeply touching debut novel about a son, the mother who left him as a child, and how his search to uncover the secrets of her life leads him to reclaim his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Samuel Andresen-Anderson: stalled writer, bored teacher at a local college, obsessive player of an online video game. He hasn't seen his mother, Faye, since she walked out when he was a child. But then one day there she is, all over the news, throwing rocks at a presidential candidate. The media paints Faye as a militant radical with a sordid past, but as far as Samuel knows, his mother never left her small Iowa town. Which version of his mother is the true one? Determined to solve the puzzle--and finally have something to deliver to his publisher--Samuel decides to capitalize on his mother's new fame by writing a tell-all biography, a book that will savage her intimately, publicly. But first, he has to locate her; and second, to talk to her without bursting into tears. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Samuel begins to excavate her history, the story moves from the rural Midwest of the 1960s to New York City during the Great Recession and Occupy Wall Street to the infamous riots at the 1968 Chicago Democratic National Convention, and finally to Norway, home of the mysterious Nix that his mother told him about as a child. And in these places, Samuel will unexpectedly find that he has to rethink everything he ever knew about his mother--a woman with an epic story of her own, a story she kept hidden from the world.</description>

  <description>A sequel to SHANTARAM but equally a standalone novel, The Mountain Shadow follows Lin on further adventures in shadowy worlds and cultures. It is a novel about seeking identity, love, meaning, purpose, home, even the secret of life...As the story begins, Lin has found happiness and love, but when he gets a call that a friend is in danger, he has no choice but to go to his aid, even though he knows that leaving this paradise puts everything at risk, including himself and his lover. When he arrives to fulfil his obligation, he enters a room with eight men: each will play a significant role in the story that follows. One will become a friend, one an enemy, one will try to kill Lin, one will be killed by another... Some characters appeared in Shantaram, others are introduced for the first time, including Navida Der, a half-Irish, half-Indian detective, and Edras, a philosopher with fundamental beliefs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gregory David Roberts is an extraordinarily gifted writer whose stories are richly rewarding on many levels. Like Shantaram, The Mountain Shadow will be a compelling adventure story with a profound message at its heart.</description>

      <![CDATA[What a shock. Shantaram was a life-changing, epic, soul-enriching novel. This sequel is virtually unreadable. "A single mistake can burn down a forest in your heart, hiding all the stars, in all the skies." Really? What happened here? It's as if Roberts lined up an endless series of fortune cooki...]]>

  <description>Josh Groban has lauded live musical theater as his biggest artistic inspiration. Since the tender age of nine, Josh has been deeply moved by the power of the theatrical arts. His love for musical theater gently simmered while his career as a recording artist exploded. After his debut album went multiplatinum in 2001, Joshs subsequent releases led to Billboard chart toppers, sold-out world tours, myriad TV appearances, duets with musical legends such as Celine Dion and Barbra Streisand, and several Grammy nominations. Yet it was with album number seven, his passion project, that his childhood dream was realized.</description>

  <description>In this unique primer, an experienced civil engineer and instructor presents the physics and fundamentals that underlie the many fields of engineering. Far from a dry, nuts-and-bolts exposition, however, 101 THINGS I LEARNED® IN ENGINEERING SCHOOL probes real-world examples to show how the engineer's way of thinking can-and sometimes cannot-inform our understanding of how things work. Questions from the simple to the profound are illuminated throughout: Why shouldn't soldiers march across a bridge? Why do buildings want to float and cars want to fly? What is the difference between thinking systemically and thinking systematically? How can engineering solutions sympathize with the natural environment? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Presented in the familiar, illustrated format of the popular 101 THINGS I LEARNED® series, 101 THINGS I LEARNED® IN ENGINEERING SCHOOL offers an informative resource for students, general readers, and even experienced engineers, who will discover within many provocative new insights into familiar principles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Road rage. Domestic violence. Professionally angry TV and radio commentators. We’re a society that is swimming in anger, always about to snap. Leonard Scheff, a trial attorney, once used anger to fuel his court persona, until he came to realize just how poisonous anger is. That and his intense study of Buddhism and meditation changed him. His transformation can be summarized in a simple parable: Imagine you are circling a crowded parking lot when, just as you spot a space, another driver races ahead and takes it. Easy to imagine the rage. But now imagine that instead of another driver, a cow has lumbered into that parking space and settled down. The anger dissolves into bemusement. What really changed? You—your perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using simple Buddhist principles and applying them in a way that is easy for non-Buddhists to understand and put into practice, Scheff and Edmiston have created an interactive book that helps readers change perspective, step by step, so that they can replace the anger in their lives with a newfound happiness. Based on the successful anger management program Scheff created, The Cow in the Parking Lot shows how anger is based on unmet demands, and introduces the four most common types—Important and Reasonable (you want love from your partner); Reasonable but Unimportant (you didn’t get that seat in the restaurant window); Irrational (you want respect from a stranger); and the Impossible (you want someone to fix everything wrong in your life).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scheff and Edmiston show how, once we identify our real unmet demands we can dissolve the anger; how, once we understand our "buttons," we can change what happens when they’re pushed. He shows how to laugh at ourselves—a powerful early step in changing angry behavior. By the end, as the reader continues to observe and fill in the exercises honestly, it won’t matter who takes that parking space—only you can make yourself angry.</description>

  <description>Roumeli is not to be found on present-day maps. It is the name once given to northern Greece—stretching from the Bosporus to the Adriatic and from Macedonia to the Gulf of Corinth, a name that evokes a world where the present is inseparably bound up with the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Roumeli&lt;/i&gt; describes Patrick Leigh Fermor’s wanderings in and around this mysterious and yet very real region. He takes us with him among Sarakatsan shepherds, to the monasteries of Meteora and the villages of Krakora, and on a mission to track down a pair of Byron’s slippers at Missolonghi. As he does, he brings to light the inherent conflicts of the Greek inheritance—the tenuous links to the classical and Byzantine heritage, the legacy of Ottoman domination—along with an underlying, even older world, traces of which Leigh Fermor finds in the hills and mountains and along stretches of barely explored coast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Roumeli&lt;/i&gt; is a companion volume to Patrick Leigh Fermor’s famous&lt;i&gt; Mani: Travels in the Southern Peloponnese&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>A young black man calling himself Victor has struck a bargain with federal law enforcement, working as a bounty hunter for the US Marshall Service in exchange for his freedom. He's got plenty of work. In this version of America, slavery continues in four states called "the Hard Four." On the trail of a runaway known as Jackdaw, Victor arrives in Indianapolis knowing that something isn't right--with the case file, with his work, and with the country itself.&lt;br /&gt; As he works to infiltrate the local cell of a abolitionist movement called the Underground Airlines, tracking Jackdaw through the back rooms of churches, empty parking garages, hotels, and medical offices, Victor believes he's hot on the trail. But his strange, increasingly uncanny pursuit is complicated by a boss who won't reveal the extraordinary stakes of Jackdaw's case, as well as by a heartbreaking young woman and her child--who may be Victor's salvation. &lt;br /&gt;Victor believes himself to be a good man doing bad work, unwilling to give up the freedom he has worked so hard to earn. But in pursuing Jackdaw, Victor discovers secrets at the core of the country's arrangement with the Hard Four, secrets the government will preserve at any cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Underground Airlines &lt;/i&gt;is a ground-breaking novel, a wickedly imaginative thriller, and a story of an America that is more like our own than we'd like to believe.</description>

      <![CDATA[An astonishing re-imagining of what the US would be like if slavery had stuck around. Winters manages to make it -- just -- credible -- and therefore as awful as it sounds. The real purpose, I imagine, is to get us to confront some home truths about race relations in this country. On that level,...]]>

  <description>Long ago, poets were Seers with access to powerful magic. Following a cataclysmic battle, the enchantments of Eivar were lost–now a song is only words and music, and no more. But when a dark power threatens the land, poets who thought only to gain fame for their songs face a task much greater: to restore the lost enchantments to the world. And the road to the Otherworld, where the enchantments reside, will imperil their lives and test the deepest desires of their hearts.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;Ted Chiang's first published story, "&lt;i&gt;Tower of Babylon&lt;/i&gt;," won the Nebula Award in 1990. Subsequent stories have won the Asimov's SF Magazine reader poll, a second Nebula Award, the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award, and the Sidewise Award for alternate history. He won the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 1992. Story for story, he is the most honored young writer in modern SF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, collected here for the first time are all seven of this extraordinary writer's stories so far-plus an eighth story written especially for this volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if men built a tower from Earth to Heaven-and broke through to Heaven's other side? What if we discovered that the fundamentals of mathematics were arbitrary and inconsistent? What if there were a science of naming things that calls life into being from inanimate matter? What if exposure to an alien language forever changed our perception of time? What if all the beliefs of fundamentalist Christianity were literally true, and the sight of sinners being swallowed into fiery pits were a routine event on city streets? These are the kinds of outrageous questions posed by the stories of Ted Chiang. Stories of your life . . . and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[ A new master of the sci-fi short story. Chiang's tales are haunting, mind-expanding, and almost always based on science. My only cavil is that they sometimes focus too much on the science and not enough on the human emotions the science stirs up. ]]>

  <description>An odd couple patrols a county full of mythological beasts and ornery locals. A familiar youngster from the world of The Last Unicorn is gifted in magic but terrible at spell-casting. A seemingly incorruptible judge meets his match in a mysterious thief who steals his heart. Two old friends discover that the Overneath goes anywhere, including locations better left unvisited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lyrical, witty, and insightful, The Overneath is Peter S. Beagle's much-anticipated return to the short form. In these uniquely beautiful and wholly original tales, with new and uncollected work, Beagle once again proves himself a master of the imagination.</description>

  <description>A century and a half after the publication of "Origin of Species, " evolutionary thinking has expanded beyond the field of biology to include virtually all human-related subjects--anthropology, archeology, psychology, economics, religion, morality, politics, culture, and art. Now a distinguished scholar offers the first comprehensive account of the evolutionary origins of art and storytelling. Brian Boyd explains why we tell stories, how our minds are shaped to understand them, and what difference an evolutionary understanding of human nature makes to stories we love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Art is a specifically human adaptation, Boyd argues. It offers tangible advantages for human survival, and it derives from play, itself an adaptation widespread among more intelligent animals. More particularly, our fondness for storytelling has sharpened social cognition, encouraged cooperation, and fostered creativity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After considering art as adaptation, Boyd examines Homer's "Odyssey" and Dr. Seuss's "Horton Hears a Who!" demonstrating how an evolutionary lens can offer new understanding and appreciation of specific works. What triggers our emotional engagement with these works? What patterns facilitate our responses? The need to hold an audience's attention, Boyd underscores, is the fundamental problem facing all storytellers. Enduring artists arrive at solutions that appeal to cognitive universals: an insight out of step with contemporary criticism, which obscures both the individual and universal. Published for the bicentenary of Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of "Origin of Species, " Boyd's study embraces a Darwinian view of human nature and art, and offers a credo for a new humanism.</description>

  <description>With &lt;i&gt;Hope in the Dark&lt;/i&gt;, Rebecca Solnit makes a radical case for hope as a commitment to act in a world whose future remains uncertain and unknowable. Drawing on her decades of activism and a wide reading of environmental, cultural, and political history, Solnit argues that radicals have a long, neglected history of transformative victories, that the positive consequences of our acts are not always immediately seen, directly knowable, or even measurable, and that pessimism and despair rest on an unwarranted confidence about what is going to happen next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally published in 2004, now with a new foreword and afterword, Solnit’s influential book shines a light into the darkness of our time in an unforgettable new edition.</description>

  <description>The Mani, at the tip of Greece's-and Europe's-southernmost promontory, is one of the most isolated regions of the world. Cut off from the rest of the country by the towering range of the Taygetus and hemmed in by the Aegean and Ionian seas, it is a land where the past is still very much a part of its people's daily lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patrick Leigh Fermor, who has been described as "a cross between Indiana Jones, James Bond, and Graham Greene," bridges the genres of adventure story, travel writing, and memoir to reveal an ancient world living alongside the twentieth century. Here, in the book that confirmed his reputation as one of the English language's finest writers of prose, Patrick Leigh Fermor carries the reader with him on his journeys among the Greeks of the mountains, exploring their history and time-honored lore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mani&lt;/i&gt; is a companion volume to Patrick Leigh Fermor's celebrated &lt;i&gt;Roumeli: Travels in Northern Greece&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Remember when presidents spoke in complete sentences instead of in unhinged tweets? David Litt does. In his comic, coming-of-age memoir, he takes us back to the Obama years – and charts a path forward in the age of Trump&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than any other presidency, Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House were defined by young people – twenty-somethings who didn’t have much experience in politics (or anything else, for that matter), yet suddenly found themselves in the most high-stakes office building on earth. David Litt was one of those twenty-somethings. After graduating from college in 2008, he went straight to the Obama campaign. In 2011, he became one of the youngest White House speechwriters in history. Until leaving the White House in 2016, he wrote on topics from healthcare to climate change to criminal justice reform. As President Obama’s go-to comedy writer, he also took the lead on the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, the so-called “State of the Union of jokes.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in this refreshingly honest memoir, Litt brings us inside Obamaworld. With a humorists’ eye for detail, he describes what it’s like to accidentally trigger an international incident or nearly set a president’s hair aflame. He answers questions you never knew you had: Which White House men’s room is the classiest? What do you do when the commander in chief gets your name wrong? Where should you never, under any circumstances, change clothes on Air Force One? With nearly a decade of stories to tell, Litt makes clear that politics is completely, hopelessly absurd.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it’s also important. For all the moments of chaos, frustration, and yes, disillusionment, Litt remains a believer in the words that first drew him to the Obama campaign: “People who love this country can change it.” In telling his own story, Litt sheds fresh light on his former boss’s legacy. And he argues that, despite the current political climate, the politics championed by Barack Obama will outlive the presidency of Donald Trump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of hilarious stories and told in a truly original voice, &lt;em&gt;Thanks, Obama&lt;/em&gt; is an exciting debut about what it means – personally, professionally, and politically – to grow up.</description>

  <description>Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi are approached by their part-time colleague, Mr. Polopetsi, with a troubling story: A woman, accused of being rude to a valued customer, has been wrongly dismissed from her job at an office furniture store. Never one to let an act of injustice go unanswered, Mma Ramotswe begins to investigate but soon discovers unexpected information that causes her to reluctantly change her views about the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other surprises await our intrepid proprietress in the course of her inquiries. Mma Ramotswe is puzzled when she happens to hear of a local nurse named Mingie Ramotswe. She thought she knew everybody by the name of Ramotswe and that they were all related. Who is this mystery lady? Then she is alerted by Mma Potokwani that an unpleasant figure from her past has recently been spotted in town. Mma Ramotswe does her best to avoid the man, but it seems that he may have returned to Botswana specifically to seek her out. What could he want from her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the generosity and good humor that guide all her endeavors, Mma Ramotswe will untangle these questions for herself and for her loved ones, ultimately bringing to light important truths about friendship and family - both the one you're born with and the one you choose.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling Tad Williams’ ground-breaking epic fantasy saga of Osten Ard begins an exciting new cycle! • Volume One of &lt;i&gt;The Last King of Osten Ard&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dragonbone Chair, the first volume of Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, was published in hardcover in October, 1988, launching the series that was to become one of the seminal works of modern epic fantasy. Many of today’s top-selling fantasy authors, from Patrick Rothfuss to George R. R. Martin to Christopher Paolini credit Tad with being the inspiration for their own series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, twenty-four years after the conclusion of Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, Tad returns to his beloved universe and characters with The Witchwood Crown, the first novel in the long-awaited sequel trilogy, The Last King of Osten Ard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty years have passed since the events of the earlier novels, and the world has reached a critical turning point once again. The realm is threatened by divisive forces, even as old allies are lost, and others are lured down darker paths. Perhaps most terrifying of all, the Norns—the long-vanquished elvish foe—are stirring once again, preparing to reclaim the mortal-ruled lands that once were theirs....</description>

The quest of a young man or woman to find oneself, define one's role in life, and save the world while one is at it -- that seems far away. Motives are sus...]]>
