  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sexing the Cherry &lt;/i&gt;celebrates the power of the imagination as it playfully juggles with our perception of history and reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a story about love and sex; lies and truths; and twelve dancing princesses who lived happily ever after, but not with their husbands.</description>

  <description>Henri had a passion for Napoleon and Napoleon had a passion for chicken. From Boulogne to Moscow Henri butchered for his Emperor and never killed a single man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, in Venice, the city of chance and disguises, Villanelle was born with the webbed feet of her boatman father - but in the casinos she gambled her heart and lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the soldier-chef's love for Napoleon turns to hate he finds the Venetian beauty, and together they flee to the canals of darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'It's a fantasy, a vivid dream... &lt;b&gt;inventive and brilliant&lt;/b&gt;' &lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'&lt;b&gt;As moving and funny as it is skilful&lt;/b&gt;, and reflects the author's formidable appetite for life' &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'&lt;b&gt;A book of great imaginative audacity and assurance&lt;/b&gt;...brilliantly physical (and funny) detail" &lt;i&gt;Times Literary Supplement&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Its concentrated, beautifully detailed prose recalls the diction of fairy tales; its plot incorporates their magic, their shrewd wit and brutality...&lt;b&gt;a deeply imagined and beautiful book, often arrestingly so&lt;/b&gt;' &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gideon the Ninth &lt;/i&gt;is the most fun you'll ever have with a skeleton.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emperor needs necromancers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ninth Necromancer needs a swordswoman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gideon has a sword, some dirty magazines, and no more time for undead bullshit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamsyn Muir's &lt;i&gt;Gideon the Ninth&lt;/i&gt; unveils a solar system of swordplay, cut-throat politics, and lesbian necromancers. Her characters leap off the page, as skillfully animated as necromantic skeletons. The result is a heart-pounding epic science fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought up by unfriendly, ossifying nuns, ancient retainers, and countless skeletons, Gideon is ready to abandon a life of servitude and an afterlife as a reanimated corpse. She packs up her sword, her shoes, and her dirty magazines, and prepares to launch her daring escape. But her childhood nemesis won't set her free without a service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House and bone witch extraordinaire, has been summoned into action. The Emperor has invited the heirs to each of his loyal Houses to a deadly trial of wits and skill. If Harrowhark succeeds she will become an immortal, all-powerful servant of the Resurrection, but no necromancer can ascend without their cavalier. Without Gideon's sword, Harrow will fail, and the Ninth House will die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, some things are better left dead.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was one hell of a trip! Though I’ve definitely read better written books and had a time getting into the world at times, the action sequences, the mystery and the dynamics between the characters (most notably Gideon and Harrowhark!) made this book super enjoyable. I will probably want to rev...]]>

  <description>Fiercely told, this is a timely coming-of-age story, told in verse about the journey to self-acceptance. Perfect for fans of Sarah Crossan, Poet X and Orangeboy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A boy comes to terms with his identity as a mixed-race gay teen - then at university he finds his wings as a drag artist, The Black Flamingo. A bold story about the power of embracing your uniqueness. Sometimes, we need to take charge, to stand up wearing pink feathers - to show ourselves to the world in bold colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I masquerade in makeup and feathers and I am applauded.*</description>

  <description>A compelling collection of poems that explores the emotions and experiences of growing up as a mixed-race woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From acclaimed performance poet Sophia Thakur comes a powerful new collection of poems exploring issues of identity, difference, perseverance, relationships, fear, loss and joy. The collection is arranged as life is: from youth to school, to home life, falling in love and falling straight back out again. The poems draw on the author’s experience as a young mixed-race young woman trying to make sense of a lonely and complicated world. With a strong narrative voice and emotional empathy, this is poetry that will resonate with all young people, whatever their background, and whatever their dreams. As she says, she hopes the poems will help readers "grow through what they go through".</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Have you ever heard of supernovas? They shine brighter than anything else in the sky and then fade out really quickly, a short burst of extraordinary energy. I like to think you and Ben were like that . . . in that short time, you had more passion than some people have in a lifetime.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elsie Porter is an average twentysomething and yet what happens to her is anything but ordinary. On a rainy New Year's Day, she heads out to pick up a pizza for one. She isn't expecting to see anyone else in the shop, much less the adorable and charming Ben Ross. Their chemistry is instant and electric. Ben cannot even wait twenty-four hours before asking to see her again. Within weeks, the two are head over heels in love. By May, they've eloped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only nine days later, Ben is out riding his bike when he is hit by a truck and killed on impact. Elsie hears the sirens outside her apartment, but by the time she gets downstairs, he has already been whisked off to the emergency room. At the hospital, she must face Susan, the mother-in-law she has never met and who doesn't even know Elsie exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interweaving Elsie and Ben's charmed romance with Elsie and Susan's healing process, &lt;i&gt; Forever, Interrupted&lt;/i&gt; will remind you that there's more than one way to find a happy ending.</description>

  <description>Boy meets boy. Boys become friends. Boys fall in love. An LGBTQ+ graphic novel about life, love, and everything that happens in between: this is the second volume of HEARTSTOPPER, for fans of The Art of Being Normal, Holly Bourne and Love, Simon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick and Charlie are best friends. Nick knows Charlie's gay, and Charlie is sure that Nick isn't. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But love works in surprising ways, and Nick is discovering all kinds of things about his friends, his family ... and himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heartstopper is about friendship, loyalty and mental illness. It encompasses all the small stories of Nick and Charlie's lives that together make up something larger, which speaks to all of us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second volume of Heartstopper, with more to come. Volume two collects all of chapter three from the ongoing web series.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Bri wants to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. Or at least make it out of her neighborhood one day. As the daughter of an underground rap legend who died before he hit big, Bri’s got big shoes to fill. But now that her mom has unexpectedly lost her job, food banks and shutoff notices are as much a part of Bri’s life as beats and rhymes. With bills piling up and homelessness staring her family down, Bri no longer just wants to make it—she has to make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Come Up&lt;/i&gt; is Angie Thomas’s homage to hip-hop, the art that sparked her passion for storytelling and continues to inspire her to this day. It is the story of fighting for your dreams, even as the odds are stacked against you; of the struggle to become who you are and not who everyone expects you to be; and of the desperate realities of poor and working-class black families.</description>

Although it didn’t quite pack the same punch as The Hate U Give and a lot of romance subplots felt unnecessary, this was still a beautifully crafted story. Just like in THUG, the familial relationships and the insightful way they were explored was by far the strong...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Times &lt;/i&gt;Top 10 Bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER, WITH OVER THREE MILLION COPIES SOLD AROUND THE WORLD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;'Is it the world that's busy, or my mind?'&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world moves fast, but that doesn't mean we have to. In this timely guide to mindfulness, Haemin Sunim, a Buddhist monk born in Korea and educated in the United States, offers advice on everything from handling setbacks to dealing with rest and relationships, in a beautiful book combining his teachings with calming full-colour illustrations. Haemin Sunim's simple messages - which he first wrote when he responded to requests for advice on social media - speak directly to the anxieties that have become part of modern life and remind us of the strength and joy that come from slowing down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugely popular in Korea, Haemin Sunim is a Zen meditation teacher whose teachings transcend religion, borders and ages. With insight and compassion drawn from a life full of change, the bestselling monk succeeds at encouraging all of us to notice that when you slow down, the world slows down with you.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;*May this book find the person it needs to. May they find every word they were looking for.*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I know you don’t want to talk sometimes. Sometimes because it hurts and sometimes because you’re just not supposed to talk about what you want to talk about. Sometimes it can be hard to say, “this is beautiful,” when no one else can see what you see. Or, “Here, this is where the pain is.”  But some part of you knows, the truth about the words you cannot say is that they only hurt until you say them. They only hurt until the person who needs to hear them, hears them.  Because we are human, and the closest we’ve ever come to showing each other who we really are, and how we love, is with words. So I’m going to try to say to you here, what I wish you’d say to me too. Please.&lt;br /&gt;Listen. We can change things.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here.&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A beautiful guide for learning to love ourselves, from the author of the internationally bestselling &lt;i&gt;The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is perfect. But that doesn't stop us from imagining ourselves smarter, funnier, richer, or thinner, and how much happier we would then be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love for Imperfect Things, &lt;/i&gt;by the bestselling Korean monk, Haemin Sunim, shows how the path to happiness and peace of mind includes not only strong relationships with others, but also letting go of worries about ourselves. Packed with his typical spiritual wisdom, Sunim teaches us to embrace our flaws rather than trying to overcome them, and demonstrates that love has very little to do with perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With chapters on self-compassion, relationships, empathy, courage, family, healing, our true nature, and acceptance, as well as beautiful full-colour illustrations, &lt;i&gt;Love for Imperfect Things&lt;/i&gt; is a much-needed guide for learning to love ourselves - imperfections and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Universal truths, beautifully expressed,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;lovingly illustrated &lt;/b&gt;. . . this is a book to keep close at hand' - Mark Williams, co-author of 'Mindfulness: Finding Peace in a Frantic World', on 'The Things You Can See'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'A&lt;b&gt; remarkable gift, a compendium of practical wisdom&lt;/b&gt;. It is accessible brilliance' - Allan Lokos, founder and guiding teacher, Community Meditation Center, NYC, on 'The Things You Can See'</description>

  <description>When Ben De Backer comes out to their parents as nonbinary, they're thrown out of their house and forced to move in with their estranged older sister, Hannah, and her husband, Thomas, whom Ben has never even met. Struggling with an anxiety disorder compounded by their parents' rejection, they come out only to Hannah, Thomas, and their therapist and try to keep a low profile in a new school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ben's attempts to survive the last half of senior year unnoticed are thwarted when Nathan Allan, a funny and charismatic student, decides to take Ben under his wing. As Ben and Nathan's friendship grows, their feelings for each other begin to change, and what started as a disastrous turn of events looks like it might just be a chance to start a happier new life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At turns heartbreaking and joyous, &lt;i&gt;I Wish You All the Best&lt;/i&gt; is both a celebration of life, friendship, and love, and a shining example of hope in the face of adversity.</description>

  <description>Max: Chill. Sports. Video games. Gay and not a big deal, not to him, not to his mom, not to his buddies. And a secret: An encounter with an older kid that makes it hard to breathe, one that he doesn't want to think about, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jordan: The opposite of chill. Poetry. His "wives" and the Chandler Mall. Never been kissed and searching for Mr. Right, who probably won't like him anyway. And a secret: A spiraling out of control mother, and the knowledge that he's the only one who can keep the family from falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throw in a rickety, 1980s-era food truck called Coq Au Vinny. Add in prickly pears, cloud eggs, and a murky idea of what's considered locally sourced and organic. Place it all in Mesa, Arizona, in June, where the temp regularly hits 114. And top it off with a touch of undeniable chemistry between utter opposites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of one summer, two boys will have to face their biggest fears and decide what they're willing to risk -- to get the thing they want the most.</description>

  <description>All Evie wants is to be normal. She’s almost off her meds and at a new college where no one knows her as the girl-who-went-crazy. She’s even going to parties and making friends. There’s only one thing left to tick off her list…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But relationships are messy – especially relationships with teenage guys. They can make any girl feel like they’re going mad. And if Evie can’t even tell her new friends Amber and Lottie the truth about herself, how will she cope when she falls in love?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author Maureen Johnson weaves a delicate tale of murder and mystery in the first book of a striking new series, perfect for fans of Agatha Christie and E. Lockhart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellingham Academy is a famous private school in Vermont for the brightest thinkers, inventors, and artists. It was founded by Albert Ellingham, an early twentieth century tycoon, who wanted to make a wonderful place full of riddles, twisting pathways, and gardens. “A place,” he said, “where learning is a game.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after the school opened, his wife and daughter were kidnapped. The only real clue was a mocking riddle listing methods of murder, signed with the frightening pseudonym “Truly, Devious.” It became one of the great unsolved crimes of American history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True-crime aficionado Stevie Bell is set to begin her first year at Ellingham Academy, and she has an ambitious plan: She will solve this cold case. That is, she will solve the case when she gets a grip on her demanding new school life and her housemates: the inventor, the novelist, the actor, the artist, and the jokester. But something strange is happening. Truly Devious makes a surprise return, and death revisits Ellingham Academy. The past has crawled out of its grave. Someone has gotten away with murder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two interwoven mysteries of this first book in the Truly Devious series dovetail brilliantly, and Stevie Bell will continue her relentless quest for the murderers in books two and three.</description>

  <description>Sparrow has always had a difficult time making friends. She would always rather stay home on the weekends with her mother, an affluent IT executive at a Manhattan bank, reading, or watching the birds, than play with other kids. And that's made school a lonely experience for her. It's made LIFE a lonely experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the one teacher who really understood her -- Mrs. Wexler, the school librarian, a woman who let her eat her lunch in the library office rather than hide in a bathroom stall, a woman who shared her passion for novels and knew just the ones she'd love -- is killed in a freak car accident, Sparrow's world unravels and she's found on the roof of her school in an apparent suicide attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of an insightful therapist, Sparrow finally reveals the truth of her inner life. And it's here that she discovers an outlet in rock &amp;amp; roll music...</description>

If the initial premise itself weren’t cliché enough, the execution fell into the trap of romanticising mental illness to the point where it didn’t properly address Sparrow’s depression and anxiety at all.

  <description>Goodreads Choice Award-winning poet and USA TODAY bestselling author Amanda Lovelace presents the mermaid’s voice returns in this one — the third and final installment in her “women are some kind of magic” series, featuring a foreword from Lang Leav and 13 guest poems from leading voices in poetry such as Nikita Gill, KY Robinson, and Orion Carloto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mermaid is known for her siren song, luring bedroom-eyed sailors to their demise. However, beneath these misguided myths are tales of escapism and healing, which Lovelace weaves throughout this empowering collection of poetry, taking you on a journey from the sea to the stars. They tried to silence her once and for all, but the mermaid’s voice returns in this one.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <description>What happens when we die? Is this really all there is? What exists beyond this life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex Duncan is just an ordinary 14 year old boy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His main worries are homework, girls, the school bully...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and his sister, Jenna who has ovarian cancer, stage B. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As his parents retreat into themselves, Alex is desperate to find a way to help, a way to make things better for his sister. After all, it’s the not knowing that’s the worst thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whilst he tries to untangle the ultimate question, life still goes on: his best friend seems oblivious to his feelings about her, the school bully has taken a special interest in him, and everything he does just makes him feel more and more awkward and out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Alex learns on his journey helps him to come to terms with not only his sister's mortality but also how he and his family and friends cope with that most compelling of questions: what lies beyond?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgia Springate’s debut novel, Beyond, is a touchingly compelling and uplifting coming-of-age story about love, loss and discovery. Get it today, and take an emotional journey through one boy’s quest to understand that most tricky of questions: what lies beyond this life?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Year of the Runaways&lt;/i&gt; tells of the bold dreams and daily struggles of an unlikely family thrown together by circumstance. Thirteen young men live in a house in Sheffield, each in flight from India and in desperate search of a new life. Tarlochan, a former rickshaw driver, will say nothing about his past in Bihar; and Avtar has a secret that binds him to protect the choatic Randeep. Randeep, in turn, has a visa-wife in a flat on the other side of town: a clever, devout woman whose cupboards are full of her husband's clothes, in case the immigration men surprise her with a call. Sweeping between India and England, and between childhood and the present day, this generous, unforgettable novel is - as with Rohinton Mistry's &lt;i&gt;A Fine Balance&lt;/i&gt; - a story of dignity in the face of adversity and the ultimate triumph of the human spirit.</description>

  <description>For a while, Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six were everywhere. Their albums were on every turntable, they sold out arenas from coast to coast, their sound defined an era. And then, on 12 July 1979, they split. Nobody ever knew why. Until now. They were lovers and friends and brothers and rivals. They couldn't believe their luck, until it ran out. This is their story of the early days and the wild nights, but everyone remembers the truth differently. The only thing they all know for sure is that from the moment Daisy Jones walked barefoot onstage at the Whisky, their lives were irrevocably changed. Making music is never just about the music. And sometimes it can be hard to tell where the sound stops and the feelings begin.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br /&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br /&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/i&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

  <description>Contexts includes twenty-six selections, from James's letters, notebooks, and other writings during the period 1863-1908, centering on the ghost story, the supernatural and, in particular, "my little book," The Turn of the Screw. Also reproduced are four paintings by Charles Demuth. The essays in Criticism span one hundred years, providing a rich array of perspectives on James and his story. Representing contemporary reactions are pieces by Henry Harland, John D. Barry, Oliver Elton, William Lyon Phelps, and Virginia Woolf. The section also includes landmark criticism by Harold Goddard, Edna Kenton, Edmund Wilson, Katherine Anne Porter, Robert B. Heilman, R. P. Blackmur, Maurice Blanchot, and Leon Edel. Recent, fresh approaches to James's work are presented by Tzvetan Todorov, Shoshana Felman, Henry Sussman, Bruce Robbins, Ned Lukacher, Paul B. Armstrong, and T. J. Lustig. A Chronology and Selected Bibliography are included.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Eleanor West’s Home for Wayward Children&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Solicitations&lt;br /&gt;No Visitors&lt;br /&gt;No Quests&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children have always disappeared under the right conditions; slipping through the shadows under a bed or at the back of a wardrobe, tumbling down rabbit holes and into old wells, and emerging somewhere... else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But magical lands have little need for used-up miracle children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy tumbled once, but now she’s back. The things she’s experienced... they change a person. The children under Miss West’s care understand all too well. And each of them is seeking a way back to their own fantasy world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Nancy’s arrival marks a change at the Home. There’s a darkness just around each corner, and when tragedy strikes, it’s up to Nancy and her new-found schoolmates to get to the heart of the matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter the cost.</description>

  <description>In case you’re wondering, this is not a love story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Tori Spring. I like to sleep and I like to blog. Last year – before all that stuff with Charlie and before I had to face the harsh realities of A-Levels and university applications and the fact that one day I really will have to start talking to people – I had friends. Things were very different, I guess, but that’s all over now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there’s Solitaire. And Michael Holden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t know what Solitaire are trying to do, and I don’t care about Michael Holden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This incredible debut novel by outstanding young author Alice Oseman is perfect for fans of John Green, Rainbow Rowell and all unflinchingly honest writers.</description>

  <description>Raw, captivating, and undeniably real, Nic Stone joins industry giants Jason Reynolds and Walter Dean Myers as she boldly tackles American race relations in this stunning debut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justyce McAllister is top of his class and set for the Ivy League—but none of that matters to the police officer who just put him in handcuffs. And despite leaving his rough neighborhood behind, he can't escape the scorn of his former peers or the ridicule of his new classmates. Justyce looks to the teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for answers. But do they hold up anymore? He starts a journal to Dr. King to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then comes the day Justyce goes driving with his best friend, Manny, windows rolled down, music turned up—way up, sparking the fury of a white off-duty cop beside them. Words fly. Shots are fired. Justyce and Manny are caught in the crosshairs. In the media fallout, it's Justyce who is under attack.</description>

  <description>Winter lasts most of the year at the edge of the Russian wilderness, and in the long nights, Vasilisa and her siblings love to gather by the fire to listen to their nurse’s fairy tales. Above all, Vasya loves the story of Frost, the blue-eyed winter demon. Wise Russians fear him, for he claims unwary souls, and they honor the spirits that protect their homes from evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Vasya’s widowed father brings home a new wife from Moscow. Fiercely devout, Vasya’s stepmother forbids her family from honoring their household spirits, but Vasya fears what this may bring. And indeed, misfortune begins to stalk the village. As its defenses weaken and evil from the forest creeps nearer, Vasilisa must call upon dangerous gifts she has long concealed.</description>

  <description>A missing girl on a journey of revenge. A &lt;i&gt;Serial&lt;/i&gt;―like podcast following the clues she's left behind. And an ending you won't be able to stop talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadie hasn't had an easy life. Growing up on her own, she's been raising her sister Mattie in an isolated small town, trying her best to provide a normal life and keep their heads above water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Mattie is found dead, Sadie's entire world crumbles. After a somewhat botched police investigation, Sadie is determined to bring her sister's killer to justice and hits the road following a few meager clues to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When West McCray―a radio personality working on a segment about small, forgotten towns in America―overhears Sadie's story at a local gas station, he becomes obsessed with finding the missing girl. He starts his own podcast as he tracks Sadie's journey, trying to figure out what happened, hoping to find her before it's too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtney Summers has written the breakout book of her career. Sadie is propulsive and harrowing and will keep you riveted until the last page.</description>

Along with the PHENOMENAL audiobook (which I 1000000% recommend), this story about one girl’s grief and lust for revenge and the podcast that follows in her tracks is both haunting and beautiful. And the ending gives a clo...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Charlie, a highly-strung, openly gay over-thinker, and Nick, a cheerful, soft-hearted rugby player, meet at a British all-boys grammar school. Friendship blooms quickly, but could there be something more...?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie Spring is in Year 10 at Truham Grammar School for Boys. The past year hasn't been too great, but at least he's not being bullied anymore, and he's sort of got a boyfriend, even if he's kind of mean and only wants to meet up in secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Nelson is in Year 11 and on the school rugby team. He's heard a little about Charlie - the kid who was outed last year and bullied for a few months - but he's never had the opportunity to talk to him. That is, until the start of January, in which Nick and Charlie are placed in the same form group and made to sit together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They quickly become friends, and soon Charlie is falling hard for Nick, even though he doesn't think he has a chance. But love works in surprising ways, and sometimes good things are waiting just around the corner...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Solitaire&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Radio Silence&lt;/i&gt; comes a bind up of the first two chapters of Heartstopper, an &lt;a href="http://heartstoppercomic.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;ongoing webcomic&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

  <description>Every year, the people of the Protectorate leave a baby as an offering to the witch who lives in the forest. They hope this sacrifice will keep her from terrorizing their town. But the witch in the forest, Xan, is kind and gentle. She shares her home with a wise Swamp Monster named Glerk and a Perfectly Tiny Dragon, Fyrian. Xan rescues the abandoned children and deliver them to welcoming families on the other side of the forest, nourishing the babies with starlight on the journey. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One year, Xan accidentally feeds a baby moonlight instead of starlight, filling the ordinary child with extraordinary magic. Xan decides she must raise this enmagicked girl, whom she calls Luna, as her own. To keep young Luna safe from her own unwieldy power, Xan locks her magic deep inside her. When Luna approaches her thirteenth birthday, her magic begins to emerge on schedule--but Xan is far away. Meanwhile, a young man from the Protectorate is determined to free his people by killing the witch. Soon, it is up to Luna to protect those who have protected her--even if it means the end of the loving, safe world she’s always known.&amp;lt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The incomparable Ali Smith melds the tale and the essay into a magical hybrid form, a song of praise to the power of stories in our lives&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In February 2012, the novelist Ali Smith delivered the Weidenfeld lectures on European comparative literature at St. Anne’s College, Oxford. Her lectures took the shape of this set of discursive stories. Refusing to be tied down to either fiction or the essay form, &lt;i&gt;Artful&lt;/i&gt; is narrated by a character who is haunted—literally—by a former lover, the writer of a series of lectures about art and literature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hypnotic dialogue unfolds, a duet between and a meditation on art and storytelling, a book about love, grief, memory, and revitalization. Smith’s heady powers as a fiction writer harmonize with her keen perceptions as a reader and critic to form a living thing that reminds us that life and art are never separate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Artful &lt;/i&gt;is a book about the things art can do, the things art is full of, and the quicksilver nature of all artfulness. It glances off artists and writers from Michelangelo through Dickens, then all the way past postmodernity, exploring every form, from ancient cave painting to 1960s cinema musicals. This kaleidoscope opens up new, inventive, elastic insights—on the relation of aesthetic form to the human mind, the ways we build our minds from stories, the bridges art builds between us. &lt;i&gt;Artful&lt;/i&gt; is a celebration of literature’s worth in and to the world and a meaningful contribution to that worth in itself. There has never been a book quite like it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Witness the fate of beloved heroes - and enemies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BALANCE OF POWER HAS FINALLY TIPPED...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precarious equilibrium among four Londons has reached its breaking point. Once brimming with the red vivacity of magic, darkness casts a shadow over the Maresh Empire, leaving a space for another London to rise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL CRUMBLE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kell - once assumed to be the last surviving &lt;i&gt;Antari&lt;/i&gt; - begins to waver under the pressure of competing loyalties. And in the wake of tragedy, can Arnes survive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL RISE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lila Bard, once a commonplace - but never common - thief, has survived and flourished through a series of magical trials. But now she must learn to control the magic, before it bleeds her dry. Meanwhile, the disgraced Captain Alucard Emery of the &lt;i&gt;Night Spire&lt;/i&gt; collects his crew, attempting a race against time to acquire the impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL TAKE CONTROL?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And an ancient enemy returns to claim a crown while a fallen hero tries to save a world in decay.</description>

  <description>Few stories are as widely read and as universally cherished by children and adults alike as &lt;i&gt;The Little Prince. &lt;/i&gt;Richard Howard's translation of the beloved classic beautifully reflects Saint-Exupéry's unique and gifted style. Howard, an acclaimed poet and one of the preeminent translators of our time, has excelled in bringing the English text as close as possible to the French, in language, style, and most important, spirit. The artwork in this edition has been restored to match in detail and in color Saint-Exupéry's original artwork. Combining Richard Howard's translation with restored original art, this definitive English-language edition of&lt;i&gt; The Little Prince&lt;/i&gt; will capture the hearts of readers of all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This title has been selected as a Common Core Text Exemplar (Grades 4-5, Stories).</description>

  <description>One of the most spectacular successes of the flourishing literary marketplace of eighteenth-century London, Pamela also marked a defining moment in the emergence of the modern novel. In the words of one contemporary, it divided the world "into two different Parties, Pamelists and Antipamelists," even eclipsing the sensational factional politics of the day. Preached for its morality, and denounced as pornography in disguise, it vividly describes a young servant's long resistance to the attempts of her predatory master to seduce her. Written in the voice of its low-born heroine, Pamela is not only a work of pioneering psychological complexity, but also a compelling and provocative study of power and its abuse.&lt;br /&gt; Based on the original text of 1740, from which Richardson later retreated in a series of defensive revisions, this edition makes available the version of Pamela that aroused such widespread controversy on its first appearance.</description>

  <description>Nate never imagined that he would be attacked by his best friend, Cam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Nate is being called to deliver a sworn statement that will get Cam convicted. The problem is, the real story isn’t that easy or convenient—just like Nate and Cam’s friendship. Cam challenged Nate on every level from the day the boys met. He pushed him to break the rules, to dream, and to accept himself. But Nate—armed with a fierce moral code and conflicted by his own beliefs—started to push back. With each push, Nate and Cam moved closer to each other—but also spiraled closer to their breaking points.</description>

  <description>It has been four months since a mysterious obsidian stone fell into Kell's possession. Four months since his path crossed with Delilah Bard. Four months since Prince Rhy was wounded, and since the nefarious Dane twins of White London fell, and four months since the stone was cast with Holland's dying body through the rift--back into Black London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, restless after having given up his smuggling habit, Kell is visited by dreams of ominous magical events, waking only to think of Lila, who disappeared from the docks as she always meant to do. As Red London finalizes preparations for the Element Games--an extravagant international competition of magic meant to entertain and keep healthy the ties between neighboring countries--a certain pirate ship draws closer, carrying old friends back into port.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while Red London is caught up in the pageantry and thrills of the Games, another London is coming back to life. After all, a shadow that was gone in the night will reappear in the morning. But the balance of magic is ever perilous, and for one city to flourish, another London must fall.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was VERY different from the first book. Blimey! <br /><br />Where as A Darker Shade of Magic was much more plot heavy, this second instalment is much slower and much more character dense in comparison. Therefore, because I wasn’t expecting that at all, it took me a while to get into the slow burn nature...]]>

  <description>Paris, at the dawn of the modern age:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince Sebastian is looking for a bride―or rather, his parents are looking for one for him. Sebastian is too busy hiding his secret life from everyone. At night he puts on daring dresses and takes Paris by storm as the fabulous Lady Crystallia―the hottest fashion icon in the world capital of fashion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian’s secret weapon (and best friend) is the brilliant dressmaker Frances―one of only two people who know the truth: sometimes this boy wears dresses. But Frances dreams of greatness, and being someone’s secret weapon means being a secret. Forever. How long can Frances defer her dreams to protect a friend? Jen Wang weaves an exuberantly romantic tale of identity, young love, art, and family. A fairy tale for any age, &lt;i&gt;The Prince and the Dressmaker&lt;/i&gt; will steal your heart.</description>

  <description>From critically acclaimed author Alice Oseman comes a smartly crafted contemporary YA novel, perfect for readers who love Rainbow Rowell’s &lt;em&gt;Fangirl&lt;/em&gt;. This is an utterly captivating and authentic new teen novel from the author of &lt;em&gt;Solitaire&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;VOYA&lt;/em&gt; said “could put her among the great young adult fiction authors.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances Janvier spends most of her time studying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows Aled Last as that quiet boy who gets straight As.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You probably think that they are going to fall in love or something. Since he is a boy and she is a girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don’t. They make a podcast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world determined to shut them up, knock them down, and set them on a cookie cutter life path, Frances and Aled struggle to find their voices over the course of one life-changing year. Will they have the courage to show everyone who they really are? Or will they be met with radio silence?</description>

It's a defiant hobby with dangerous consequences, which Kell is now seeing firsthand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an exchange goes awry, Kell escapes to Grey London and runs into Delilah Bard, a cut-purse with lofty aspirations. She first robs him, then saves him from a deadly enemy, and finally forces Kell to spirit her to another world for a proper adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now perilous magic is afoot, and treachery lurks at every turn. To save all of the worlds, they'll first need to stay alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Shades of Magic series&lt;/u&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He endured the storm. Found the sun. And became the rainbow…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam Payne’s debut poetry collection, &lt;i&gt;this boy is a rainbow&lt;/i&gt;, tells a touching story of gay love and heartache, healing and empowerment. It is the story of a boy who lost love and thought he would never be whole again. Divided into three chapters, it follows his journey as he endured the storm, found the sun, and became the rainbow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring over two-hundred original poems and illustrations, the collection encourages readers not only to survive the storm, but to thrive in it. And when the storm is over, be ready to let love in again. For love is everywhere, if only you open your heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt; for throwing me&lt;br /&gt; into the bared teeth&lt;br /&gt;of a treacherous storm&lt;br /&gt;if you hadn’t &lt;br /&gt;i wouldn’t be&lt;br /&gt; the rainbow&lt;br /&gt; i am today&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Reclusive Hollywood icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant to write her story, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career, Monique listens in fascination. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the ‘80s - and, of course, the seven husbands along the way - Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. But as Evelyn’s story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with Reid's signature talent for creating "complex, likeable characters" (&lt;i&gt;Real Simple&lt;/i&gt;), this is a mesmerizing journey through the splendour of Old Hollywood into the sobering realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means - and what it costs - to face the truth.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Cinderella goes to the con in this fandom-fueled twist on the classic fairy tale.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part romance, part love letter to nerd culture, and all totally adorbs, Geekerella is a fairy tale for anyone who believes in the magic of fandom. Geek girl Elle Wittimer lives and breathes &lt;i&gt;Starfield&lt;/i&gt;, the classic sci-fi series she grew up watching with her late father. So when she sees a cosplay contest for a new &lt;i&gt;Starfield&lt;/i&gt; movie, she has to enter. The prize? An invitation to the ExcelsiCon Cosplay Ball, and a meet-and-greet with the actor slated to play Federation Prince Carmindor in the reboot. With savings from her gig at the Magic Pumpkin food truck (and her dad’s old costume), Elle’s determined to win…unless her stepsisters get there first.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Teen actor Darien Freeman used to live for cons—before he was famous. Now they’re nothing but autographs and awkward meet-and-greets. Playing Carmindor is all he’s ever wanted, but the &lt;i&gt;Starfield&lt;/i&gt; fandom has written him off as just another dumb heartthrob. As ExcelsiCon draws near, Darien feels more and more like a fake—until he meets a girl who shows him otherwise.</description>

  <description>#AlexFromTarget meets queer Prince Charming in this glittering romcom following a teen music prodigy and the handsome socialite who unwittingly turns him into an internet sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a dingy Los Angeles club late one night, Cameron and Nate meet and find they have much more in common than their love of an obscure indie band. But when Nate learns that Cameron is the heir to a record label, the very one that destroyed his father's life, he runs away as fast as he can. The only evidence of their brief but intense connection is a blurry photo Cameron snaps of Nate's Sharpie-decorated Chuck Taylors as he flees. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that Cameron is a real life Prince Charming--he's handsome, famous, and rich--it's only fitting that he sets out to find the owner of the Sharpied shoes. Cameron's twin sister, a model and socialite, posts the picture of Nate's shoes on Instagram to her legions of fans with the caption, "Anyone know the gorgeous owner of these shoes? My hottie brother is looking for him." The internet just about breaks with the news of a modern fairy tale and the two become entwined in each other's lives in this sparkling story about the power of music, the demons that haunt us, and the flutterings of first real love.</description>

  <description>The witch: supernaturally powerful, inscrutably independent, and now—indestructible. These moving, relatable poems encourage resilience and embolden women to take control of their own stories. Enemies try to judge, oppress, and marginalize her, but the witch doesn’t burn in this one.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Everyone’s a Aliebn When Ur a Aliebn Too &lt;/em&gt;is the illustrated story of a lonely alien sent to observe Earth, only to meet all sorts of creatures with all sorts of perspectives on life, love, and happiness, all while learning to feel a little better about being an alien—based on the enormously popular Twitter account, @jonnysun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the unforgettable story of Jomny, a lonely alien who, for the first time ever, finds a home on our planet after learning that earthlings can feel lonely too. Jomny finds friendship in a bear tired of other creatures running away in fear, an egg struggling to decide what to hatch into, an owl working its way to being wise, a tree feeling stuck in one place, a tadpole coming to terms with turning into a frog, a dying ghost, a puppy unable to express itself, and many more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through this story of a lost, lonely and confused alien finding friendship, acceptance, and love among the creatures of Earth, we will all learn how to be a little more human. And for all of us earth-bound creatures here on this planet, we can all be reminded that sometimes, it takes an outsider to help us see ourselves for who we truly are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

Next to Rob is Ben - best man and the best friend any two people ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that's the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because if it wasn't Rob waiting for her at the altar, there's a strong chance it would be Ben. Loyal and sensitive Ben has always kept his feelings to himself, but if he turned round and told Maddy she was making a mistake, would she listen? And would he be right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best friends since childhood, Maddy, Ben and Rob thought their bond was unbreakable. But love changes everything. Maddy has a choice to make but will she choose wisely? Her heart, and the hearts of the two best men she knows, depend on it...</description>

  <description>This is almost a love story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellis and Michael are twelve when they first become friends, and for a long time it is just the two of them, cycling the streets of Oxford, teaching themselves how to swim, discovering poetry, and dodging the fists of an overbearing father. And then one day this closest of friendships grows into something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then we fast forward a decade or so, to find that Ellis is married to Annie, and Michael is nowhere in sight. Which leads to the question, what happened in the years between?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is almost a love story. But it's not as simple as that.</description>

  <description>Deep beneath the sea, off the cold Irish coast, Gaia is a young mermaid who dreams of freedom from her controlling father. On her first swim to the surface, she is drawn towards a human boy. She longs to join his carefree world, but how much will she have to sacrifice? What will it take for the little mermaid to find her voice? Hans Christian Andersen's original fairy tale is reimagined through a searing feminist lens, with the stunning, scalpel-sharp writing and world building that has won Louise her legions of devoted fans. A book with the darkest of undercurrents, full of rage and rallying cries: storytelling at its most spellbinding.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sarai has lived and breathed nightmares since she was six years old.&lt;br /&gt;She believed she knew every horror, and was beyond surprise.&lt;br /&gt;She was wrong.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of tragedy, neither Lazlo nor Sarai are who they were before. One a god, the other a ghost, they struggle to grasp the new boundaries of their selves as dark-minded Minya holds them hostage, intent on vengeance against Weep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lazlo faces an unthinkable choice--save the woman he loves, or &lt;i&gt;everyone else?&lt;/i&gt;--while Sarai feels more helpless than ever. But is she? Sometimes, only the direst need can teach us our own depths, and Sarai, the muse of nightmares, has not yet discovered what she's capable of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As humans and godspawn reel in the aftermath of the citadel's near fall, a new foe shatters their fragile hopes, and the mysteries of the Mesarthim are resurrected: Where did the gods come from, and why? What was done with thousands of children born in the citadel nursery? And most important of all, as forgotten doors are opened and new worlds revealed: Must heroes always slay monsters, or is it possible to save them instead?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love and hate, revenge and redemption, destruction and salvation all clash in this gorgeous sequel to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Strange the Dreamer&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For readers of &lt;i&gt;Girl in Pieces&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Way I Used to Be&lt;/i&gt; comes an emotionally gripping story about facing hard truths in the aftermath of sexual assault.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Mara and Owen are as close as twins can get, so when Mara’s friend Hannah accuses Owen of rape, Mara doesn't know what to think. Can her brother really be guilty of such a violent act? Torn between her family and her sense of right and wrong, Mara feels lost, and it doesn’t help that things are strained with her ex-girlfriend, Charlie. As Mara, Hannah, and Charlie come together in the aftermath of this terrible crime, Mara must face a trauma from her own past and decide where Charlie fits into her future. With sensitivity and openness, this timely novel confronts the difficult questions surrounding consent, victim blaming, and sexual assault.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; The stories never tell you what to do when the knight who rescues you turns out to be more dangerous than the dragon he saved you from. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sweetest Kind of Poison is a collection of poetry about toxic relationships and letting go of what no longer serves you. It takes you through the fall, the collapse, the withdrawal, the recovery, and the now, chronicling a journey of abuse, heartache, confidence, self-love, letting go, and growing up. Because sometimes only our darkest experiences can bring out our raw strength and help us find the people we are meant to be.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the vein of It's Kind of a Funny Story and All the Bright Places, comes a captivating, immersive exploration of life with mental illness.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sixteen-year-old Mel Hannigan, bipolar disorder makes life unpredictable. Her latest struggle is balancing her growing feelings in a new relationship with her instinct to keep everyone at arm's length. And when a former friend confronts Mel with the truth about the way their relationship ended, deeply buried secrets threaten to come out and upend her shaky equilibrium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the walls of Mel's compartmentalized world crumble, she fears the worst--that her friends will abandon her if they learn the truth about what she's been hiding. Can Mel bring herself to risk everything to find out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In A Tragic Kind of Wonderful, Eric Lindstrom, author of the critically acclaimed Not If I See You First, examines the fear that keeps us from exposing our true selves, and the courage it takes to be loved for who we really are.</description>

  <description>Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the kingdom of Phthia. Here he is just another unwanted boy living in the shadow of King Peleus and his golden son, Achilles. Yet one day, Achilles takes the shamed prince under his wing. As they grow into young men their bond blossoms into something far deeper - despite the displeasure of Achilles's mother. When word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, the men of Greece are called upon to lay siege to Troy in her name. Seduced by the promise of a glorious destiny, Achilles joins their cause. Torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus follows Achilles into war, little knowing that the years that follow will test everything they have learned.</description>

I thought I was going to LOVE this book as it touches on themes that are very important to me... and I’m so sad that I didn’t even make it halfway through before I knew I just wasn’t going to enjoy it.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;We watch the bird as it flies high above us, singing like it's the only thing in the world that matters. &lt;br /&gt;And I feel it - that life can be beautiful. That there are possibilities.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Keep your head down and don't borrow trouble&lt;/i&gt; is the motto Joni lives by, and so far it's seen her family through some tough times. It's not as if she has the power to change anything important anyway. Like Dad's bad back, or the threat of losing their house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Annabel breezes into her life, Joni's sure they're destined to clash. Pretty, poised, privileged - the daughter of the richest family in town must have it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But sometimes you find a matching spirit where you least expect it. Sometimes love can defy difference. And sometimes life asks you to be bigger and braver …</description>

  <description>A young girl in Harlem discovers slam poetry as a way to understand her mother’s religion and her own relationship to the world. Debut novel of renowned slam poet Elizabeth Acevedo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xiomara Batista feels unheard and unable to hide in her Harlem neighborhood. Ever since her body grew into curves, she has learned to let her fists and her fierceness do the talking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Xiomara has plenty she wants to say, and she pours all her frustration and passion onto the pages of a leather notebook, reciting the words to herself like prayers—especially after she catches feelings for a boy in her bio class named Aman, who her family can never know about. With Mami’s determination to force her daughter to obey the laws of the church, Xiomara understands that her thoughts are best kept to herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when she is invited to join her school’s slam poetry club, she doesn’t know how she could ever attend without her mami finding out, much less speak her words out loud. But still, she can’t stop thinking about performing her poems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because in the face of a world that may not want to hear her, Xiomara refuses to be silent.</description>

  <description>Eddy knows he’s not like other teenagers. He doesn’t look like them. He doesn’t think like them. He doesn’t go to school or have friends like they do. Eddy’s not even allowed to leave his bedroom – except on shower day of course. He doesn’t know why; all Eddy knows is that he’s different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abandoned by his mother and kept locked away by his grandmother, Eddy must spend his life watching the world go by from his bedroom window. Until Reagan Crowe moves in next door and everything starts to change. She’s kind, funny, beautiful, and most importantly, she’s Eddy’s first friend. Over time, Reagan introduces Eddy to the strange and wonderful world outside his bedroom: maths, jam, love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But growing up isn’t that simple for either of them. And Eddy has a secret. The tree that’s slowly creeping in through his window from the garden is no ordinary tree. But then again, Eddy’s no ordinary boy. He’s special…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set over the course of five years, T is for Tree is moving, life-affirming, and shows that we can all find greatness in the small things.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The dream chooses the dreamer, not the other way around—&lt;/b&gt;and Lazlo Strange, war orphan and junior librarian, has always feared that his dream chose poorly. Since he was five years old he’s been obsessed with the mythic lost city of Weep, but it would take someone bolder than he to cross half the world in search of it. Then a stunning opportunity presents itself, in the person of a hero called the Godslayer and a band of legendary warriors, and he has to seize his chance or lose his dream forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened in Weep two hundred years ago to cut it off from the rest of the world? What exactly did the Godslayer slay that went by the name of &lt;i&gt;god&lt;/i&gt;? And what is the mysterious problem he now seeks help in solving?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answers await in Weep, but so do more mysteries—including the blue-skinned goddess who appears in Lazlo’s dreams. How did he dream her before he knew she existed? And if all the gods are dead, why does she seem so real?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Welcome to Weep.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Adam has just been diagnosed with schizophrenia. He sees and hears people who aren’t there: Rebecca, a beautiful girl who understands him; the Mob Boss, who harasses him; and Jason, the naked guy who’s unfailingly polite. It should be easy to separate the real from the not real, but Adam can't.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Still, there’s hope. As Adam starts fresh at a new school, he begins a drug trial that helps him ignore his visions. Suddenly everything seems possible, even love. When he meets Maya, a fiercely intelligent girl, he desperately wants to be the great guy that she thinks he is. But then the miracle drug begins to fail, and Adam will do anything to keep Maya from discovering his secret.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The bestselling novel about love, loss and hope from the twice Carnegie Medal-winning Patrick Ness. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conor has the same dream every night, ever since his mother first fell ill, ever since she started the treatments that don't quite seem to be working. But tonight is different. Tonight, when he wakes, there's a visitor at his window. It's ancient, elemental, a force of nature. And it wants the most dangerous thing of all from Conor. It wants the truth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patrick Ness takes the final idea of the late, award-winning writer Siobhan Dowd and weaves an extraordinary and heartbreaking tale of mischief, healing and above all, the courage it takes to survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;'What kind of circus is only open at night?'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. The black sign, painted in white letters that hangs upon the gates, reads:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Opens at Nightfall&lt;br /&gt;Closes at Dawn&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As dusk shifts to twilight, tiny lights begin to flicker all over the tents, as though the whole of the circus is covered in fireflies. When the tents are aglow, sparkling against the night sky, the sign lights up: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Le Cirque des Rêves&lt;br /&gt;The Circus of Dreams.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gates shudder and unlock, seemingly by their own volition. They swing outward, inviting the crowd inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Now the circus is open. &lt;br /&gt;Now you may enter.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the show's creators comes the groundbreaking novel inspired by the Broadway smash hit Dear Evan Hansen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Evan Hansen,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today's going to be an amazing day and here's why...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a letter that was never meant to be seen by anyone draws high school senior Evan Hansen into a family's grief over the loss of their son, he is given the chance of a lifetime: to belong. He just has to stick to a lie he never meant to tell, that the notoriously troubled Connor Murphy was his secret best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, Evan isn't invisible anymore--even to the girl of his dreams. And Connor Murphy's parents, with their beautiful home on the other side of town, have taken him in like he was their own, desperate to know more about their enigmatic son from his closest friend. As Evan gets pulled deeper into their swirl of anger, regret, and confusion, he knows that what he's doing can't be right, but if he's helping people, how wrong can it be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No longer tangled in his once-incapacitating anxiety, this new Evan has a purpose. And a website. He's confident. He's a viral phenomenon. Every day is amazing. Until everything is in danger of unraveling and he comes face to face with his greatest obstacle: himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple lie leads to complicated truths in this big-hearted coming-of-age story of grief, authenticity and the struggle to belong in an age of instant connectivity and profound isolation.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Call Me by Your Name&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a sudden and powerful romance that blossoms between an adolescent boy and a summer guest at his parents' cliffside mansion on the Italian Riviera. Each is unprepared for the consequences of their attraction when, during the restless summer weeks, unrelenting currents of obsession, fascination, and desire intensify their passion and test the charged ground between them. Recklessly, the two verge toward the one thing both fear they may never truly find again: total intimacy.</description>

  <description>Tomi Adeyemi conjures a stunning world of dark magic and danger in her West African-inspired fantasy debut Children of Blood and Bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They killed my mother.&lt;br /&gt;They took our magic.&lt;br /&gt;They tried to bury us. &lt;br /&gt;Now we rise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zelie remembers when the soil of Orisha hummed with magic. When different clans ruled - Burners igniting flames, Tiders beckoning waves, and Zelie's Reaper mother summoning forth souls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everything changed the night magic disappeared. Under the orders of a ruthless king, anyone with powers was targeted and killed, leaving Zelie without a mother and her people without hope. Only a few people remain with the power to use magic, and they must remain hidden. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zelie is one such person. Now she has a chance to bring back magic to her people and strike against the monarchy. With the help of a rogue princess, Zelie must learn to harness her powers and outrun the crown prince, who is hell-bent on eradicating magic for good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danger lurks in Orisha, where strange creatures prowl, and vengeful spirits wait in the waters. Yet the greatest danger may be Zelie herself as she struggles to come to terms with the strength of her magic - and her growing feelings for an enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie of Children of Blood and Bone is in development at Fox 2000/Temple Hill Productions with the incredible Karen Rosenfelt and Wyck Godfrey (Twilight, Maze Runner, The Fault In Our Stars) producing it.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Your soul is too heavy to pass through this door; leave the weight of the world in the world from before.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evie Snow is eighty-two when she quietly passes away in her sleep, surrounded by her children and grandchildren. It's the way most people wish to leave the world but when Evie reaches the door of her own private heaven, she finds that she's become her twenty-seven-year-old self and the door won't open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evie's soul must be light enough to pass through so she needs to get rid of whatever is making her soul heavy. For Evie, this means unburdening herself of the three secrets that have weighed her down for over fifty years, so she must find a way to reveal them before it's too late. As Evie begins the journey of a lifetime, she learns more about life and love than she ever thought possible, and somehow , some way, she may also find her way back to her long lost love . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powerful, magical and utterly romantic, &lt;i&gt;On the Other Side&lt;/i&gt; will transport you to a world that is impossible to forget. This is a love story like no other which will have you weeping because of the sheer joy and beauty of it all.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Fangirl&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda&lt;/i&gt; in this funny and poignant coming-of-age novel from &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Christina Lauren about two boys who fall in love in a writing class—one from a progressive family and the other from a conservative religious community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years ago, Tanner Scott’s family relocated from California to Utah, a move that nudged the bisexual teen temporarily back into the closet. Now, with one semester of high school to go, and no obstacles between him and out-of-state college freedom, Tanner plans to coast through his remaining classes and clear out of Utah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when his best friend Autumn dares him to take Provo High’s prestigious Seminar—where honor roll students diligently toil to draft a book in a semester—Tanner can’t resist going against his better judgment and having a go, if only to prove to Autumn how silly the whole thing is. Writing a book in four months sounds simple. Four months is an eternity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out, Tanner is only partly right: four months &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a long time. After all, it takes only one second for him to notice Sebastian Brother, the Mormon prodigy who sold his own Seminar novel the year before and who now mentors the class. And it takes less than a month for Tanner to fall completely in love with him.</description>

  <description>Scott Ferdowsi has a track record of quitting. Writing the Great American Novel? Three chapters. His summer internship? One week. His best friends know exactly what they want to do with the rest of their lives, but Scott can hardly commit to a breakfast cereal, let alone a passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With college applications looming, Scott's parents pressure him to get serious and settle on a career path like engineering or medicine. Desperate for help, he sneaks off to Washington, DC, to seek guidance from a famous professor who specializes in grit, the psychology of success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He never expects an adventure to unfold out of what was supposed to be a one-day visit. But that's what Scott gets when he meets Fiora Buchanan, a ballsy college student whose life ambition is to write crossword puzzles. When the bicycle she lends him gets Scott into a high-speed chase, he knows he's in for the ride of his life. Soon, Scott finds himself sneaking into bars, attempting to pick up girls at the National Zoo, and even giving the crossword thing a try--all while opening his eyes to fundamental truths about who he is and who he wants to be.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A #1 New York Times-bestseller &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon Snow is the worst Chosen One who's ever been chosen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's what his roommate, Baz, says. And Baz might be evil and a vampire and a&lt;i&gt; complete git&lt;/i&gt;, but he's probably right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half the time, Simon can't even make his wand work, and the other half, he starts something on fire. His mentor's avoiding him, his girlfriend broke up with him, and there's a magic-eating monster running around, wearing Simon's face. Baz would be having a field day with all this, if he were here — it's their last year at the Watford School of Magicks, and Simon's infuriating nemesis didn't even bother to show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Carry On&lt;/i&gt; is a love letter to love stories and the power of words - to every 'chosen one' who ever had more on their mind than saving the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a BIZARRE book. Though the writing is very strong and the dynamics between most of the characters are really enjoyable, the amount of perspectives incorporated throughout the story felt unnecessary at times and made the plot (especially towards the final act of the book) hard to follow....]]>

  <description>My disease is as rare as it is famous. It’s a form of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, but basically, I’m allergic to the world. I don’t leave my house, have not left my house in fifteen years. The only people I ever see are my mom and my nurse, Carla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then one day, a moving truck arrives. New next door neighbors. I look out the window, and I see him. He’s tall, lean and wearing all black—black t-shirt, black jeans, black sneakers and a black knit cap that covers his hair completely. He catches me looking and stares at me. I stare right back. His name is Olly. I want to learn everything about him, and I do. I learn that he is funny and fierce. I learn that his eyes are Atlantic Ocean-blue and that his vice is stealing silverware. I learn that when I talk to him, my whole world opens up, and I feel myself starting to change—starting to want things. To want out of my bubble. To want everything, everything the world has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe we can’t predict the future, but we can predict some things. For example, I am certainly going to fall in love with Olly. It’s almost certainly going to be a disaster.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this highly anticipated sequel to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling &lt;em&gt;The Gentleman’s Guide to Vice and Virtue&lt;/em&gt;, Felicity Montague must use all her womanly wits and wiles to achieve her dreams of becoming a doctor—even if she has to scheme her way across Europe to do it. A must-have for fans of Mackenzi Lee’s extraordinary and Stonewall Honor-winning novel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year after an accidentally whirlwind grand tour with her brother Monty, Felicity Montague has returned to England with two goals in mind—avoid the marriage proposal of a lovestruck suitor from Edinburgh and enroll in medical school. However, her intellect and passion will never be enough in the eyes of the administrators, who see men as the sole guardians of science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then a window of opportunity opens—a doctor she idolizes is marrying an old friend of hers in Germany. Felicity believes if she could meet this man he could change her future, but she has no money of her own to make the trip. Luckily, a mysterious young woman is willing to pay Felicity’s way, so long as she’s allowed to travel with Felicity disguised as her maid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of her suspicions, Felicity agrees, but once the girl’s true motives are revealed, Felicity becomes part of a perilous quest that leads them from the German countryside to the promenades of Zurich to secrets lurking beneath the Atlantic.</description>

  <description>Theodore Finch is fascinated by death, and he constantly thinks of ways he might kill himself. But each time, something good, no matter how small, stops him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violet Markey lives for the future, counting the days until graduation, when she can escape her Indiana town and her aching grief in the wake of her sister's recent death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Finch and Violet meet on the ledge of the bell tower at school, it's unclear who saves whom. And when they pair up on a project to discover the 'natural wonders' of their state, both Finch and Violet make more important discoveries: It's only with Violet that Finch can be himself - a weird, funny, live-out-loud guy who's not such a freak after all. And it's only with Finch that Violet can forget to count away the days and start living them. But as Violet's world grows, Finch's begins to shrink.</description>

Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he climbs into the sidecar of Hagrid's motorbike and takes to the skies, leaving Privet Drive for the last time, Harry Potter knows that Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters are not far behind.

Secrets and suspicion are spreading through the wizarding world, and Hogwarts itself is not safe. Harry is convinced that Malfoy bears the Dark Mark: there is a Death Eater amongst them. Harry will need powerful magic and true friends as he explores Voldemort’s darkest secrets, and Dumbledore prepares him to face his destiny ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: harrypotter.bloomsbury.com</description>

  <description>"There will be three tasks, spaced throughout the school year, and they will test the champions in many different ways... their magical prowess - their daring - their powers of deduction - and, of course, their ability to cope with danger."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Triwizard Tournament is to be held at Hogwarts. Only wizards who are over seventeen are allowed to enter - but that doesn't stop Harry dreaming that he will win the competition. Then at Hallowe'en, when the Goblet of Fire makes its selection, Harry is amazed to find his name is one of those that the magical cup picks out. He will face death-defying tasks, dragons and Dark wizards, but with the help of his best friends, Ron and Hermione, he might just make it through - alive!&lt;br /&gt;--back cover</description>

  <description>"Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transportation for the stranded witch or wizard. Just stick out your wand hand, step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Knight Bus crashes through the darkness and screeches to a halt in front of him, it's the start of another far from ordinary year at Hogwarts for Harry Potter. Sirius Black, escaped mass-murderer and follower of Lord Voldemort, is on the run - and they say he is coming after Harry. In his first ever Divination class, Professor Trelawney sees an omen of death in Harry's tea leaves... But perhaps most terrifying of all are the Dementors patrolling the school grounds, with their soul-sucking kiss...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--back cover</description>

  <description>Harry Potter's life is miserable. His parents are dead and he's stuck with his heartless relatives, who force him to live in a tiny closet under the stairs. But his fortune changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues him from his relatives and takes him to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally feels like a normal kid. But even within the Wizarding community, he is special. He is the boy who lived: the only person to have ever survived a killing curse inflicted by the evil Lord Voldemort, who launched a brutal takeover of the Wizarding world, only to vanish after failing to kill Harry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Harry's first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything is perfect. There is a dangerous secret object hidden within the castle walls, and Harry believes it's his responsibility to prevent it from falling into evil hands. But doing so will bring him into contact with forces more terrifying than he ever could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of sympathetic characters, wildly imaginative situations, and countless exciting details, the first installment in the series assembles an unforgettable magical world and sets the stage for many high-stakes adventures to come.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Evan Panos doesn’t know where he fits in. His strict Greek mother refuses to see him as anything but a disappointment. His quiet, workaholic father is a staunch believer in avoiding any kind of conflict. And his best friend Henry has somehow become distractingly attractive over the summer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tired, isolated, scared—Evan’s only escape is drawing in an abandoned church that feels as lonely as he is. And, yes, he kissed one guy over the summer. But it’s his best friend Henry who’s now proving to be irresistible. It’s Henry who suddenly seems interested in being more than friends. And it’s Henry who makes him believe that he’s more than his mother’s harsh words and terrifying abuse. But as things with Henry heat up, and his mother’s abuse escalates, Evan has to decide how to find his voice in a world where he has survived so long by avoiding attention at all costs.</description>

  <description>Milk and honey' is a collection of poetry and prose about survival. About the experience of violence, abuse, love, loss, and femininity. It is split into four chapters, and each chapter serves a different purpose. Deals with a different pain. Heals a different heartache. 'milk and honey' takes readers through a journey of the most bitter moments in life and finds sweetness in them because there is sweetness everywhere if you are just willing to look.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Joe hasn't seen his brother in ten years. Ed didn't walk out on the family, not exactly. It's something more brutal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed's locked up -- on death row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now his execution date has been set, and the clock is ticking. Joe is determined to spend those last weeks with his brother, no matter what other people think ... and no matter whether Ed committed the crime. But did he? And does it matter, in the end? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This poignant, timely, heartbreaking novel asks big questions: What value do you place on life? What can you forgive? And just how do you say goodbye?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Her story is a phenomenon. Her life is a disaster.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the real world, Eliza Mirk is shy, weird, and friendless. Online, she’s LadyConstellation, the anonymous creator of the wildly popular webcomic &lt;i&gt;Monstrous Sea&lt;/i&gt;. Eliza can’t imagine enjoying the real world as much as she loves the online one, and she has no desire to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Wallace Warland, &lt;i&gt;Monstrous Sea&lt;/i&gt;’s biggest fanfiction writer, transfers to her school. Wallace thinks Eliza is just another fan, and as he draws her out of her shell, she begins to wonder if a life offline might be worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Eliza’s secret is accidentally shared with the world, everything she’s built—her story, her relationship with Wallace, and even her sanity—begins to fall apart.</description>

  <description>Arthur is only in New York for the summer, but if Broadway has taught him anything, it’s that the universe can deliver a showstopping romance when you least expect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben thinks the universe needs to mind its business. If the universe had his back, he wouldn’t be on his way to the post office carrying a box of his ex-boyfriend’s things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Arthur and Ben meet-cute at the post office, what exactly does the universe have in store for them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe nothing. After all, they get separated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe everything. After all, they get reunited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if they can’t quite nail a first date . . . or a second first date . . . or a third?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if Arthur tries too hard to make it work . . . and Ben doesn’t try hard enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if life really isn’t like a Broadway play?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if it is?</description>

  <description>When it comes to drumming, Leah Burke is usually right on the beat - but real life is a little harder to manage. She loves to draw but is too self-conscious to show it. And she hasn't mustered the courage to tell her friends she's bisexual, not even her openly gay BFF, Simon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Leah really doesn't know what to do when her rock-solid friend group starts to fracture. With prom and college on the horizon, tensions are running high and it's hard for Leah to strike the right note while the people she loves are fighting - especially when she realizes she might love one of them more than she ever intended ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Becky Albertalli returns to the world of her acclaimed debut novel, &lt;i&gt;Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda&lt;/i&gt;, in this warm and humorous story of first love and senior-year angst.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Yale hopeful Bronwyn has never publicly broken a rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sports star Cooper only knows what he's doing in the baseball diamond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad boy Nate is one misstep away from a life of crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prom queen Addy is holding together the cracks in her perfect life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And outsider Simon, creator of the notorious gossip app at Bayview High, won't ever talk about any of them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He dies 24 hours before he could post their deepest secrets online. Investigators conclude it's no accident. All of them are suspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has secrets, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really matters is how far you'll go to protect them.</description>

  <description>If you asked anyone in his small Vermont town, they’d tell you the facts: James Liddell, star athlete, decent student and sort-of boyfriend to cute, peppy Theresa, is a happy, funny, carefree guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But whenever James sits down at his desk to write, he tells a different story. As he fills his drawers with letters to the people in his world—letters he never intends to send—he spills the truth: he’s trying hard, but he just isn’t into Theresa. It’s a boy who lingers in his thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He feels trapped by his parents, his teammates, and the lies they’ve helped him tell, and he has no idea how to escape. Is he destined to live a life of fiction?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He’s in love with the boy next door.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gideon &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; has a plan. His plans include running for class president, leading the yearbook committee, and having his choice of colleges. They do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; include falling head over heels for his best friend and next door neighbor, Kyle. It’s a distraction. It’s pointless, as Kyle is already dating the gorgeous and popular head cheerleader, Ruby. And Gideon doesn’t know what to do…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyle &lt;i&gt;finally&lt;/i&gt; feels like he has a handle on life. He has a wonderful girlfriend, a best friend willing to debate the finer points of Lord of the Rings, and social acceptance as captain of the basketball team. Then, both Ruby and Gideon start acting &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; weird, just as his spot on the team is threatened, and Kyle can’t quite figure out what he did wrong…</description>

  <description>Part Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, part Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, Adam Silvera's extraordinary debut confronts race, class, and sexuality during one charged near-future summer in the Bronx. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Aaron Soto is struggling to find happiness after a family tragedy leaves him reeling. He's slowly remembering what happiness might feel like this summer with the support of his girlfriend Genevieve, but it's his new best friend, Thomas, who really gets Aaron to open up about his past and confront his future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Thomas and Aaron get closer, Aaron discovers things about himself that threaten to shatter his newfound contentment. A revolutionary memory-alteration procedure, courtesy of the Leteo Institute, might be the way to straighten himself out. But what if it means forgetting who he truly is?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A deeply moving memoir about the year that would forever change both a family and a country.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In November 2014, thirteen members of the Biden family gathered on Nantucket for Thanksgiving, a tradition they had been celebrating for the past forty years; it was the one constant in what had become a hectic, scrutinized, and overscheduled life. The Thanksgiving holiday was a much-needed respite, a time to connect, a time to reflect on what the year had brought, and what the future might hold. But this year felt different from all those that had come before. Joe and Jill Biden's eldest son, Beau, had been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor fifteen months earlier, and his survival was uncertain. "Promise me, Dad," Beau had told his father. "Give me your word that no matter what happens, you're going to be all right." Joe Biden gave him his word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Promise Me, Dad&lt;/i&gt; chronicles the year that followed, which would be the most momentous and challenging in Joe Biden's extraordinary life and career. Vice President Biden traveled more than a hundred thousand miles that year, across the world, dealing with crises in Ukraine, Central America, and Iraq. When a call came from New York, or Capitol Hill, or Kyiv, or Baghdad -- Joe, I need your help -- he responded. For twelve months, while Beau fought for and then lost his life, the vice president balanced the twin imperatives of living up to his responsibilities to his country and his responsibilities to his family. And never far away was the insistent and urgent question of whether he should seek the presidency in 2016.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year brought real triumph and accomplishment, and wrenching pain. But even in the worst times, Biden was able to lean on the strength of his long, deep bonds with his family, on his faith, and on his deepening friendship with the man in the Oval Office, Barack Obama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing with poignancy and immediacy, Joe Biden allows readers to feel the urgency of each moment, to experience the days when he felt unable to move forward as well as the days when he felt like he could not afford to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a book written not just by the vice president, but by a father, grandfather, friend, and husband. &lt;i&gt;Promise Me, Dad&lt;/i&gt; is a story of how family and friendships sustain us and how hope, purpose, and action can guide us through the pain of personal loss into the light of a new future.</description>

  <description>It all begins with a fugitive billionaire and the promise of a cash reward. &lt;i&gt;Turtles All the Way Down&lt;/i&gt; is about lifelong friendship, the intimacy of an unexpected reunion, Star Wars fan fiction, and tuatara. But at its heart is Aza Holmes, a young woman navigating daily existence within the ever-tightening spiral of her own thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his long-awaited return, John Green shares Aza's story with shattering, unflinching clarity.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Katie Price has a rare disease that makes exposure to even the smallest amount of sunlight deadly. Confined to her house during the day, her company is limited to her widowed father and her best (okay, only) friend. It isn't until after nightfall that Katie's world opens up, when she takes her guitar to the local train station and plays for the people coming and going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie Reed is a former all-star athlete at a crossroads in his life - and the boy Katie has secretly admired from afar for years. When he happens upon her playing guitar one night, fate intervenes and the two embark on a star-crossed romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they challenge each other to chase their dreams and fall for each other under the summer night sky, Katie and Charlie form a bond strong enough to change them - and everyone around them - forever.</description>

  <description>One night on the heath, the brave and respected general Macbeth encounters three witches who foretell that he will become king of Scotland. At first sceptical, he’s urged on by the ruthless, single-minded ambitions of Lady Macbeth, who suffers none of her husband’s doubt. But seeing the prophecy through to the bloody end leads them both spiralling into paranoia, tyranny, madness, and murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shocking tragedy - a violent caution to those seeking power for its own sake - is, to this day, one of Shakespeare’s most popular and influential masterpieces.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time&lt;/i&gt; is a murder mystery novel like no other. The detective, and narrator, is Christopher Boone. Christopher is fifteen and has Asperger's Syndrome. He knows a very great deal about maths and very little about human beings. He loves lists, patterns and the truth. He hates the colours yellow and brown and being touched. He has never gone further than the end of the road on his own, but when he finds a neighbour's dog murdered he sets out on a terrifying journey which will turn his whole world upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~from back cover</description>

      <![CDATA[This is my favourite book of all time. And I can truly truly say that. As someone who was given this book after my own diagnosis with Aspergers Syndrome, Christopher’s story changed mine and my family’s lives. Of course, it took 12-year-old me a long time to read it and even longer to understand...]]>

  <description>I'm halfway through my life, or maybe more, and I'm finally awake to the fact that it's in my hands alone. I've believed in other people, had faith, been patient, waiting for my moment -- enough, already. Who have I been kidding? Nora Eldridge has always been a good girl: a good daughter, colleague, friend, employee. She teaches at an elementary school in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the children and the parents adore her; but her real passion is her art, which she makes alone, unseen. To be an artist is, she is sure, her real destiny. Then one day Reza Shahid appears in her classroom: eight years old, a perfect, beautiful boy. Reza's parents are on a year-long visit from Paris: Skandar, his father, has a fellowship at Harvard; Sirena, his mother, is a glamorous installation artist apparently on the brink of huge success. For that magical year, Nora is admitted into their charmed circle, and everything is transformed. Or so she believes. As it turns out, her liberation from the benign shackles of her old life is not quite what it seems, and she is about to suffer a betrayal more monstrous than anything she could have imagined.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The beloved &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller—with more than five million copies sold—by the author of &lt;i&gt;One Plus One &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; The Girl You Left Behind&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; They had nothing in common until love gave them everything to lose . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Louisa Clark is an ordinary girl living an exceedingly ordinary life—steady boyfriend, close family—who has barely been farther afield than their tiny village. She takes a badly needed job working for ex–Master of the Universe Will Traynor, who is wheelchair bound after an accident. Will has always lived a huge life—big deals, extreme sports, worldwide travel—and now he’s pretty sure he cannot live the way he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Will is acerbic, moody, bossy—but Lou refuses to treat him with kid gloves, and soon his happiness means more to her than she expected. When she learns that Will has shocking plans of his own, she sets out to show him that life is still worth living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Love Story&lt;/i&gt; for this generation, &lt;i&gt;Me Before You&lt;/i&gt; brings to life two people who couldn’t have less in common—a heartbreakingly romantic novel that asks, &lt;i&gt;What do you do when making the person you love happy also means breaking your own heart?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The stunning sequel, &lt;i&gt;After You&lt;/i&gt;, will be published on 9/29 by Pamela Dorman Books/Viking. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>On an unseasonably warm autumn day, an American teacher walks down a staircase beneath Sofia's National Palace of Culture, looking for sex. Among the stalls of a public bathroom he encounters Mitko, a charismatic young hustler. He returns to Mitko again and again over the next few months, and their trysts grow increasingly intimate and unnerving as the enigma of this young man becomes inseparable from that of his homeland, Bulgaria, a country with a difficult past and an uncertain future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garth Greenwell's &lt;i&gt;What Belongs to You &lt;/i&gt;is a stunning debut about an American expat struggling with his own complicated inheritance while navigating a foreign culture. Lyrical and intense, it tells the story of a man caught between longing and resentment, unable to separate desire from danger, and faced with the impossibility of understanding those he most longs to know.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;You can't stop the future. You can't rewind the past. The only way to learn the secret. . . is to press play.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clay Jensen doesn't want anything to do with the tapes Hannah Baker made. Hannah is dead. Her secrets should be buried with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Hannah's voice tells Clay that his name is on her tapes-- and that he is, in some way, responsible for her death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All through the night, Clay keeps listening. He follows Hannah's recorded words throughout his small town. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. . .and what he discovers changes his life forever.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book is controversial for good reason. Its depiction of suicide can be interpreted in many different ways and by having the narrative sympathise with Hannah to a degree, it can be interpreted that Asher is glamorising her death. That being said, suicide in general will divide opinions and I...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The powerful and timely contemporary classic by Jennifer Brown -- now including the bonus &lt;i&gt;Hate List&lt;/i&gt; novella &lt;i&gt;Say Something&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five months ago, Valerie Leftman's boyfriend, Nick, opened fire on their school cafeteria. Shot trying to stop him, Valerie inadvertently saved the life of a classmate, but was implicated in the shootings because of the list she helped create. A list of people and things she and Nick hated. The list he used to pick his targets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after a summer of seclusion, Val is forced to confront her guilt as she returns to school to complete her senior year. Haunted by the memory of the boyfriend she still loves and navigating rocky relationships with her family, former friends, and the girl whose life she saved, Val must come to grips with the tragedy that took place and her role in it, in order to make amends and move on with her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer Brown's critically acclaimed novel now features a brand-new cover and the bonus novella &lt;i&gt;Say Something&lt;/i&gt;, another arresting story that digs deeper into the powerful themes of &lt;i&gt;Hate List&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Dante can swim. Ari can't. Dante is articulate and self-assured. Ari has a hard time with words and suffers from self-doubt. Dante gets lost in poetry and art. Ari gets lost in thoughts of his older brother who is in prison. Dante is fair skinned. Ari's features are much darker. It seems that a boy like Dante, with his open and unique perspective on life, would be the last person to break down the walls that Ari has built around himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But against all odds, when Ari and Dante meet, they develop a special bond that will teach them the most important truths of their lives, and help define the people they want to be. But there are big hurdles in their way, and only by believing in each other―and the power of their friendship―can Ari and Dante emerge stronger on the other side.</description>

  <description>Tretch lives in a very small town where everybody's in everybody else's business. Which makes it hard for him to be in love with his straight best friend. For his part, Matt is completely oblivious to the way Tretch feels -- and Tretch can't tell whether that makes it better or worse.The problem with living a lie is that the lie can slowly become your life. For Tretch, the problem isn't just with Matt. His family has no idea who he really is and what he's really thinking. The girl at the local bookstore has no clue how off-base her crush on him is. And the guy at school who's a thorn in Tretch's side doesn't realize how close to the truth he's hitting.Tretch has spent a lot of time dancing alone in his room, but now he's got to step outside his comfort zone and into the wider world. Because like love, a true self can rarely be contained.</description>

  <description>Sixteen year old Solomon has agoraphobia. He hasn't left his house in three years, which is fine by him. At home, he is the master of his own kingdom--even if his kingdom doesn't extend outside of the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ambitious Lisa desperately wants to go to a top tier psychiatry program. She'll do anything to get in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lisa finds out about Solomon's solitary existence, she comes up with a plan sure to net her a scholarship: befriend Solomon. Treat his condition. And write a paper on her findings. To earn Solomon's trust, Lisa begins letting him into her life, introducing him to her boyfriend Clark, and telling him her secrets. Soon, Solomon begins to open up and expand his universe. But all three teens have grown uncomfortably close, and when their facades fall down, their friendships threaten to collapse as well.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"What's the point of having a voice if you're gonna be silent in those moments you shouldn't be?"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Starr lives in two worlds: the poor neighbourhood where she was born and raised and her posh high school in the suburbs.

      <![CDATA[This book took me by surprise. I knew that it would not always be an easy read, and I was right as there were a lot of very upsetting, hard-hitting and frustrating scenes in this book.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I don't entirely understand how anyone gets a boyfriend. Or a girlfriend. It just seems like the most impossible odds. A perfect alignment of feelings and circumstances&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly Peskin-Suso knows all about unrequited love. No matter how many times her twin sister, Cassie, tells her to woman up, Molly is &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; careful. &lt;i&gt;Better to be careful than be hurt&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Cassie gets a new girlfriend who comes with a cute hipster-boy sidekick, everything changes. Will is funny, flirtatious, and basically the perfect first boyfriend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's only one problem: Molly's coworker, Reid, the awkward Tolkien superfan, she could &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; fall for … right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A heart-warming and hilarious story about growing up and learning to be comfortable in your own skin.</description>

  <description>From the author of &lt;i&gt;The Five Stages of Andrew Brawley &lt;/i&gt;comes a brand-new novel about a teenage boy who must decide whether or not the world is worth saving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry Denton has spent years being periodically abducted by aliens. Then the aliens give him an ultimatum: The world will end in 144 days, and all Henry has to do to stop it is push a big red button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only he isn’t sure he wants to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, life hasn’t been great for Henry. His mom is a struggling waitress held together by a thin layer of cigarette smoke. His brother is a jobless dropout who just knocked someone up. His grandmother is slowly losing herself to Alzheimer’s. And Henry is still dealing with the grief of his boyfriend’s suicide last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wiping the slate clean sounds like a pretty good choice to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Henry is a scientist first, and facing the question thoroughly and logically, he begins to look for pros and cons: in the bully who is his perpetual one-night stand, in the best friend who betrayed him, in the brilliant and mysterious boy who walked into the wrong class. Weighing the pain and the joy that surrounds him, Henry is left with the ultimate choice: push the button and save the planet and everyone on it…or let the world—and his pain—be destroyed forever.</description>

  <description>First drink, first prank, first friend, first girl, last words… A poignant and moving crossover novel about making friends and growing up from American author, John Green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miles Halter is fascinated by famous last words – and tired of his safe, boring and rather lonely life at home. He leaves for boarding school filled with cautious optimism, to seek what the dying poet Francois Rabelais called the "Great Perhaps." Much awaits Miles at Culver Creek, including Alaska Young. Clever, funny, screwed-up, and dead sexy, Alaska will pull Miles into her labyrinth and catapult him into the Great Perhaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for Alaska brilliantly chronicles the indelible impact one life can have on another.</description>

  <description>Marriage can be a real killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn’t do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her razor-sharp writing and trademark psychological insight, Gillian Flynn delivers a fast-paced, devilishly dark, and ingeniously plotted thriller that confirms her status as one of the hottest writers around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most critically acclaimed suspense writers of our time, New York Times bestseller Gillian Flynn takes that statement to its darkest place in this unputdownable masterpiece about a marriage gone terribly, terribly wrong. The Chicago Tribune proclaimed that her work “draws you in and keeps you reading with the force of a pure but nasty addiction.” Gone Girl’s toxic mix of sharp-edged wit and deliciously chilling prose creates a nerve-fraying thriller that confounds you at every turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: gillian-flynn.com</description>

  <description>Henry “Monty” Montague was born and bred to be a gentleman, but he was never one to be tamed. The finest boarding schools in England and the constant disapproval of his father haven’t been able to curb any of his roguish passions—not for gambling halls, late nights spent with a bottle of spirits, or waking up in the arms of women or men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Monty embarks on his Grand Tour of Europe, his quest for a life filled with pleasure and vice is in danger of coming to an end. Not only does his father expect him to take over the family’s estate upon his return, but Monty is also nursing an impossible crush on his best friend and traveling companion, Percy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still it isn’t in Monty’s nature to give up. Even with his younger sister, Felicity, in tow, he vows to make this yearlong escapade one last hedonistic hurrah and flirt with Percy from Paris to Rome. But when one of Monty’s reckless decisions turns their trip abroad into a harrowing manhunt that spans across Europe, it calls into question everything he knows, including his relationship with the boy he adores.</description>

  <description>This Special Edition of &lt;i&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/i&gt; includes the most extensive interview Suzanne Collins has given since the publication of &lt;i&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/i&gt;, featuring an absorbing behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the series; an engaging archival conversation between Suzanne Collins and YA legend Walter Dean Myers on writing about war; and a timeline of highlights from the first ten years of &lt;i&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/i&gt;. The Special Edition answers many questions fans have had over the years, and gives great insight into the creation of this era-defining work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister’s place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.</description>

  <description>The compelling story of two outsiders striving to find their place in an unforgiving world. Drifters in search of work, George and his simple-minded friend Lennie have nothing in the world except each other and a dream--a dream that one day they will have some land of their own. Eventually they find work on a ranch in California’s Salinas Valley, but their hopes are doomed as Lennie, struggling against extreme cruelty, misunderstanding and feelings of jealousy, becomes a victim of his own strength. Tackling universal themes such as the friendship of a shared vision, and giving voice to America’s lonely and dispossessed, &lt;i&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/i&gt; has proved one of Steinbeck’s most popular works, achieving success as a novel, a Broadway play and three acclaimed films.</description>

  <description>George Orwell's timeless and timely allegorical novel—a scathing satire on a downtrodden society’s blind march towards totalitarianism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A farm is taken over by its overworked, mistreated animals. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned—a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell’s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.</description>

  <description>'Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lawyer's advice to his children as he defends the real mockingbird of Harper Lee's classic novel - a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores the irrationality of adult attitudes to race and class in the Deep South of the thirties. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina of one man's struggle for justice. But the weight of history will only tolerate so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird is a coming-of-age story, an anti-racist novel, a historical drama of the Great Depression and a sublime example of the Southern writing tradition.</description>
