  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lost. Stolen. Forgotten… until the Alphabits step in.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Team A.L.P.H.A. spinoff series.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sam Remington, former leader of Team Beta, has a new dream: to lead a team whose sole purpose is to protect those most vulnerable—shifter pups. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His new mate, Dean, shares his passion. As a child counselor, Dean is all too familiar with the darker side of the world when it comes to pups. If Sam can rescue them, Dean will do his best to help fix them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sanctioned by Team Alpha’s bossman, the great Ray Perkins himself, Alphabits is Sam’s baby. This new hand-picked team consists of five highly-trained wolf alphas—and one bumbling bear who couldn’t take a hint. As always with a new team, personalities will clash. But at the end of the day, they all share a common goal help lost, missing, and hurting children—starting with the needy wolf pup who lives across the street from Sam and Dean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Alphabits aren’t vigilantes. These former soldiers and officers of the law have to do things by the book—even when it tears them apart to do so. But once all their ducks are in a row, the bad guys had better beware! You do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; want this team of protective alphas on your tail. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the first in a new series in the Team A.L.P.H.A. world, but can definitely be read as a stand-alone novel. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and some violence. Prepare your box of tissues and lock up your heart, because this book contains a fluffy little wolf pup who’s about to steal it away. HEA definitely included, intended for 18+ readers only. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Business is tough for Critter Catchers, the animal control company owned by best friends Demetrius and Cody. Their first big job was a few months ago, but no one likes to talk about it because that critter turned out to be a murderous wolf man. When a new job finally appears, they jump at it, and end up chasing an unidentified creature through the woods around Parson’s Hollow. Soon they’re smack dab in the middle of another potential paranormal case, complete with a mysterious blood-thirsty creature, a secretive laboratory, and a farmer they’re not sure they can trust!</description>

  <description>What do the hot, genius entrepreneur and I have in common? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Absolutely nothing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Taika Parata may be rich as hell, but he’s a total jerk. He spends his days traveling the globe in the lap of luxury, while I dreamed of leaving my tiny hometown for a nomadic life and never got further than Boston. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when fate throws us together, our preconceptions are challenged and suddenly we both have an entirely new perception of the world… and each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This is a 12K SHORT STORY that was first available as part of Volume 2 of the Heart2Heart charity anthology. No content has been changed or added. It has ties to the O'Leary universe, but can easily be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;True love is the only magic Sean has ever wished for…&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After being rescued from a vicious gang of thieving swans by fellow swan shifter Kellan, Sean is starting over in the magical town of Vale Valley. Despite being so young, he aches to find his Alpha so he can begin his forever after. And once he’s spent lots of time with Kellan and Vic’s adorable hatchling, he also dreams of having an egg of his very own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Avi is Vale Valley’s recently hired fire chief and an eagle shifter. He can’t keep his eyes off the blond cutie who’s a server at the Vale Valley Inn restaurant, but he’s so busy with his job. In addition, he’s much older than the delectable Sean. Avi decides he should probably just behave and keep his wings to himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes all a fated mate needs is a swift kick in the ass. When Sean repeatedly fails to convince Avi they were meant to be, he enlists the help of his new friends. Too bad there’s an old enemy skulking around who can’t wait to ruin everything… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; A Swan’s Love Song is the fourth book in Season 3 of the Vale Valley series. Each installment of the series can be enjoyed without reading the others. However, reading A Swan for Christmas and A Hatching for Valentine’s from Seasons 1 &amp;amp; 2 would add to the enjoyment of this book. This mpreg, age gap romance novella features a swan and eagle who are fated mates and struggling to figure out this whole love thing. So grab a tall, cool glass of lemonade, put your feet up and enjoy a sweet dose of smexy mpreg. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A Summer Romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Psychic Copeland Forbes is still recovering from a gunshot wound that nearly ended his life. Back at work for the first time since the shooting, Jude and Cope interview a potential client who claims he’s being haunted by an ex-boyfriend. A man, they discover, that is missing and presumed dead. Making matters worse, Cope can’t connect with the man’s spirit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ghost Detective Jude Byrne is torn between working the case and insisting Cope stay home to recover. After almost losing him once, Jude doesn’t want to take any chances with the second chance they have been given. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the suspect list continues to grow, so do incidences of phantom chest pains for Cope. Convinced he’s not crazy, Cope enlists the help of Madam Aurora to make contact with the reticent spirit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Jude and Cope find the killer or will the next ghost pain finish what Cope’s gunman started? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Once upon a time a young man pissed off the king of the fae... Spoiler alert: don’t do that.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alpha Zane had the perfect life: money, a hot boyfriend, and a wonderful future waiting for him. &lt;br /&gt;Only that boyfriend was not who he seemed—yet, somehow, Zane was the one who ended up cursed by the King of the Fae. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now Zane’s a urisk—a kind of brownie fae—and tied to Lake Vale Valley. He spends his days with his cat, Pixiedoodle, his only human contact the delivery service that drops off his orders, leaving them on the front porch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Omega Felix makes ends meet delivering for a local company. When he’s asked to deliver outside his normal area to Vale Valley, he begrudgingly agrees. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The delivery is a disaster from the long walk up the dirt drive to the angry man shouting at him to leave the goods on the porch and go away. Which would be fine if he didn’t scent the curmudgeon as his mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes having fae abilities sucks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zane’s too scared to let the omega see him and run away or worse—be disgusted—even as Felix chips away at the barriers Zane has set in place to protect his heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But he’s about to realize that in Vale Valley love conquers all, true love wins, and curses can be broken when a true mate accepts his love for exactly who he is both inside and out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Omega and the Beast is book one of Season Three of the popular multi-author series, Vale Valley, a small town open to everyone who needs love and a home. Omega and the Beast is a super sweet with knotty heat modern day fairy tale retelling with an mpreg twist.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ground zero, noun: the center or origin of rapid, intense, or violent activity or change.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Heat, humidity, and homicide are things veteran detective Sawyer Key expects to encounter on his first day with the Savannah Police Department, but the hostile reception from his new partner catches him by surprise. Sawyer isn’t a stranger to heartache and recognizes that Royce Locke is a wounded man who’s reeling from a devastating loss. Relentless and patient in all things, Sawyer is determined to make the new partnership work. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Savannah, Georgia is known for her quirky people, oak trees draped in Spanish moss, and antebellum architecture. Beneath the Southern charm and hospitality, festering hatred and violence is soaring with the summer temperatures. Locke and Key find themselves at the epicenter when their first case involves the death of a former shock jock who appears to be the victim of vigilante justice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Opposites in nearly every way, the two detectives set aside their differences to take back their city and restore law and order. From this reluctant truce, an intense attraction grows that will either tighten or shatter their tenuous bond. Falling for his partner spells inevitable disaster, but Sawyer’s always been a sucker for wounded things. Sawyer could be the key to the life Royce has always wanted, if he’s brave enough to trust him. The fuse is lit, the clock is running, and the zero hour is upon them. Tick tock. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ground Zero is the first book in the Zero Hour series, which follows Locke and Key’s investigations and evolving relationship. Ground Zero has a happy-for-now ending with no cliffhanger. It contains mature language and sexual content intended for adults 18 and older. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Tate: I’ve spent most of my life waiting for my fated mate. The one person in this world made just for me. The one Fate had determined was perfect for me in every way. And now that he’s here, he isn’t anything like I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hollis: No ties, no clans, no mate; that’s the way I choose to live my life. I don’t want anyone having power over me in any way, and if anyone thinks that just because Tate is my mate, I have no choice but to stay with him, they’re mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When lynx shifter Hollis Roby is sent to Copper Creek to assist with a murder investigation, the last thing he expects to find is his fated mate; especially since he doesn’t even believe fated mates exist. However, that’s the only explanation for the irresistible pull he feels toward clan Beta Tate Decker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deeper they go into the investigation, the more obvious it becomes that there’s more going on in Copper Creek than a simple homicide. Trapped in the middle between a corrupt Council and a human supremacist group, the clan is counting on Hollis and Tate to figure out who’s responsible. Not only for the murders, but for the other odd happenings in the area, as well.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Snow &amp;amp; Winter: Book Four&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been a full year since the mystery that brought antique shop owner and part-time amateur sleuth Sebastian Snow together with NYPD homicide detective Calvin Winter. Patience, sanity, and their very lives have been put to the test, but love has persevered. Although Sebastian is now New York City’s best-known busybody, he’s done solving crimes and wants nothing more than to plan a romantic budget wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Snow’s Antique Emporium receives a decapitated human head in the mail and the holidays are gory once again. Sebastian patently disregards the mystery of a lifetime because he is &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; with death and danger—but the killer escalates. Before Sebastian knows it, his closest friends and family are dragged into a series of horrific murders with antiquated clues hinting to the infamous Victorian American Bones Wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clock is ticking to recover a long-lost artifact linked to paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope and to capture a murderer. But it’s not Sebastian who may become the next target—it’s Calvin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Whyborne, Griffin, and their friends have faced down cultists, monsters, and sorcerers. But their greatest challenge is now upon them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the return voyage from Balefire Manor, Whyborne receives the worst news possible: Widdershins has fallen before the onslaught of the Fideles and their servants. There’s still time to stop the return of the Masters, but that window grows shorter by the hour. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Together with Christine and Iskander, Whyborne and Griffin must reach Widdershins to face the ultimate test—and decide the fate of the world, once and for all.</description>

  <description>Jamie:&lt;br /&gt;I only have two rules: I don’t tangle with anyone who wants a relationship. And I’m the one who decides when it’s over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guys I see are quick and dirty—that’s what I want. I keep my head down and my heart to myself. The only person who sees the real me is my daughter, and I need it to stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My life is small, and the guys at my new job hate me—and they’ve got plenty of good reasons. I’m not the kind of guy who deserves a redemption. I keep my life simple, small, and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I kept it that way. The minute I saw Cole Gunn, everything changed. He’s a hardbodied bundle of sensuality and pent-up desire. He keeps looking my way when I run into him at the gym. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cole is the exception to both of my rules—but he’s an ex-con, I’m a cop, and my boss was the one who landed him in prison for a decade. But that’s not going to stop me from trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cole:&lt;br /&gt;I don’t fit in here in Abingdon. I don’t have a fancy job, and I got my degree in prison instead of at Jackson Academy. My only goal now is survival, and I don’t have time for anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I had dreams. I wanted a boyfriend, maybe a family. That went down the tubes the second I was convicted. My name has been cleared, but the scars are still there—and no good man would want anything to do with me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I say Jamie Grant was a good man? He’s not. But he might be the brashest son of a b*tch I’ve ever met. He rolled up to my uncle’s farm the week after I got out of the clink to accuse me of stealing the beehives on my property, and he started undressing me with his eyes long before he proved my innocence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dodge every one of his advances. I keep telling him he’s pissing me off, that I don’t want a damn bit of what he’s offering, that he’s a fool for hanging around. None of that is true, of course, and that sizzling hot smirk tells me he knows it. I can’t get that infuriating man off my mind—and the things I’d do to him in bed would make a stripper blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the midst of an investigation where I’m getting framed all over again, Jamie Grant is the only one who cares about my story. He keeps coming back, begging for more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is what life is like on the outside, I might just want more of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smoking Gunn is the seventh book in the Bridge to Abingdon series. Each book focuses on one sizzling couple, and each can be read as a standalone. There’s plenty of hot mm love, lots of sensual firsts, lovely beehives, crazy uncles, and an HEA that’s sweeter than honey. Cole Gunn and Jamie Grant are the redemption at the end of the Abingdon Series. Enjoy!</description>

  <description>Cody Bower and Demetrius Singleton have been friends for over twenty years even though they are polar opposites. Cody is tall, handsome, athletic, and straight, and Demetrius is average height, more of a thinker, and gay. They have started an animal control business together and have to figure out how to be business partners without letting it affect their friendship, but that’s the least of their problems. When one of their first clients ends up brutally murdered in what appears to be an animal attack, the two realize something big and dangerous is stalking their tiny town of Parson’s Hollow, and it’s up to them to catch it before it kills again.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Falcon:&lt;/b&gt; Three years ago I arrived at the scene of an art heist to find Kingston Wilde tied to a radiator, claiming to be an innocent bystander in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was only later I learned he was actually, the elusive art thief I’d been tracking for years. And I was the one who’d let him sweet-talk his way out of my grasp. Ever since, I’ve made it my mission to get my hands on him again, and this time I don’t plan on letting go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, fate has other plans. A priceless artifact has gone missing, and King is the only one who can help recover it. I thought nothing could be worse than being forced to work with the egotistical SOB, but I was wrong. Falling for the charming art thief in the middle of an operation is way, way worse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;King:&lt;/b&gt; The key to being a good art thief is knowing when to call it quits. After one close call too many, I decide that time is now and head home to Hobie, Texas, intending to hang up my lock picks for good. Unfortunately, the FBI has other plans. Agent Dirk Falcon approaches me with an offer I can’t refuse: full immunity for my past crimes in exchange for helping him with one last job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The catch? The job involves stealing from the very man who taught me everything I know. The same man who double-crossed me years ago. Pulling this off means trusting Falcon and his team, but how do I trust the sexy agent when he’s staked his career on taking me down?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Weston “Major” Marian:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After running away at the age of seventeen, I found a home in the Army. It wasn’t long before my fellow soldiers became family, giving purpose to my time in Vietnam. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But everything changes when Doc Wilde joins my medevac crew. A night alone in the jungle after a helicopter crash forces us to rely on each other for survival, the secrets we share cementing a bond between us deeper than any I’ve ever known. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Doc begins to play a starring role in my late night fantasies even though he can never be anything more than a friend, a brother-in-arms. He’s straight, with family back in Texas, and I could kiss my career goodbye if anyone in the Army discovered my secret. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When our tours finally end, and we go our separate ways, Doc heads home to his perfect family while I continue to serve. I thought that was the end of our story. Turns out I was wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liam “Doc” Wilde:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I wind up on the front lines in Vietnam young and afraid, it’s Major Marian who comes to my rescue. He’s tough, brave, and quiet, and he vows to keep me safe. He’s the only reason I make it home alive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For some, a friendship like ours might have ended once we left the jungle behind, but life without Major Marian isn’t an option. Over time, our connection continues to grow. It’s no surprise when, years later, an unexpected illness turns my life upside down, he’s the first person I turn to for help. &lt;br /&gt;And, as always, he drops everything to rescue me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I soon realize that at every step of my life, Major has been there, by my side, putting me first. All this time he’s been standing in the sidelines, waiting patiently to hand over his heart into my safekeeping. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even though I never imagined building a future with another man, seeing Major in this new light is a revelation. And suddenly I can’t imagine my life any other way.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It's all fun and games until someone loses a hand.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dixon has been dying to introduce Yuri to Uncle Fonzo, the Hand of his family, and now he'll finally get that chance. All they need to do is meet him at a traveling carnival with an unused piece of Spellcraft. Easy peasy, right? Not even a little. And even worse, they might encounter a clown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uncle Fonzo has left a trail of magical destruction in his wake, but he claims he's been helping people. Spellcrafters are a slippery bunch, and it's hard to say if he's stretching the truth or telling an outright lie. One thing's for sure, he's between a rock and a hard place now, and if he doesn't deliver an outrageous ransom to Strange Manor by midnight, all deals are off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a lackluster carnival with a booby-trapped tour bus to the decrepit mausoleum behind an old mental asylum, the Spellcraft leads Dixon and Yuri on a goose chase that's not only wild…but deadly.</description>

  <description>What happens when a snarky hitman and a by-the-book PI cross paths?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leland&lt;br /&gt;Being a hitman has its perks, but I never thought getting an accidental mooning by an attractive PI while he’s caught on a fence would be one of them. While it’s not exactly love at first sight, he’s captured my interest and won’t let go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, I find myself caught in a game of cat and mouse, determined to attract the attention of Jackson, the PI who should be my enemy. He pretends like he’s not flattered by my flowers and the mentions of my totally-not-fictitious blow-up doll Randy (or was it Dandy?), but I know better. Why else would he be teaming up with me to bring down Hardek, one of the city’s most ruthless criminals? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackson&lt;br /&gt;Even though the cops are telling me that the hitman is a notorious contract killer, I can’t help but admit that I’m drawn to him. He’s funny, charismatic, and attractive. There’s no way this ridiculous man can be the person the cops are after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Leland ends up at my doorstep injured, I’m faced with a tough choice. It’s my duty to hand him over to law enforcement, but my heart has other plans. I want to keep him. To protect him. To be with him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though one question remains: why in the world does the man have so many d*mn guns?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contains: shenanigans on a swing that you would NOT find at a playground, a car chase that sadly doesn't have flips or explosions, a horsey ride sans horse, cuddles, an exuberant mutt, a suspicious chief of police, and lots and lots of laughs.</description>

  <description>Former Army Ranger turned government assassin Álvaro Montero and CIA Officer Caiden Cardosa crossed paths two years ago in Vienna, where their encounter ended less than amicably—despite the explosive sexual chemistry between them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now Caiden is riding a desk at Langley after his cover is blown. And Álvaro—who was “killed”—has a new identity and purpose as Delta/D, an operative for the Locke and Keyes Agency, under the leadership of the mysterious Alpha Orion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When D and Caiden team up in a deadly black ops mission, the urge to kill each other will have to take a back seat to the desire for revenge against the man who betrayed them both. Surviving the mission won’t be easy. Resisting the passion between them—that might be impossible. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Psychic Copeland Forbes can’t get a good night’s sleep. His dreams are being haunted by two restless spirits, one crying out for his help and, the other bent on destroying him. Only able to communicate through dreams, the anguished spirit gives Cope just enough information to send him running back home to New Orleans to solve the mystery. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ghost Detective Jude Byrne is against Cope going back to The Big Easy. It was trouble as long as the Mississippi that sent Copeland fleeing New Orleans in the first place but, if Cope insists on going, Jude is going to. To make the mission as safe as possible, Jude puts together a team of psychics, warlocks, and detectives he’s hoping are strong enough to keep everyone, namely Cope, safe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the spirits’ identities are revealed, tragedy strikes a member of the ghost detective team. Will help arrive in time or will they be left with only the ghost of a chance? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>What happens when you find out the one person who always rubs you the wrong way can rub you the right way even better? &lt;br /&gt;Taylor loathes boats and the water, but he accepts an invitation for a short cruise with his latest fling because the dick is good and he has the vacation time. How bad could it be? When he’s stood up and stranded without a cabin by the dick, he can’t believe who comes to his rescue. How in the hell is he supposed to survive four days in the same room with his secret wet dream armed with only a suitcase full of lingerie? He’ll need every last bit of self-control to survive without climbing and claiming mount Bart all for himself. &lt;br /&gt;Bart’s brother won a cruise and convinced Bart to go. At the very last minute, his brother backs out and he winds up with a huge king suite all to himself. After the ship sails, he sees his favorite sexy designer desperately trying to find a place to stay on the sold-out cruise. Thrilled to come to the rescue, he offers to share his cabin since there’s plenty of room. It’s just the chance he’s been looking for to get Taylor to slow down and see what’s in front of him. Even if Taylor pretends to be immune to his charms, Bart’s a man with a plan and four days to make it happen. &lt;br /&gt;Between Taylor’s suitcase of sexy fun, Bart’s surprising romantic side, and an unexpected Tropical Storm, these men will realize that being up the creek without a paddle is sometimes exactly where you’re meant to be. &lt;br /&gt;Author Note: This book is a stand-alone which follows two characters who were first introduced in the Just the Way You Are series of books. It is not necessary to have read those books to enjoy this one. However, if you’re curious about their world, there’s more to explore! &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Ben - &lt;i&gt;Free spirit. Nomad. Drifter.&lt;/i&gt; Those are the labels my family always threw at me. I’ve been on my own and on the road—nothing but me and my motorcycle—for a long time now and that’s the way I like it. When an old friend badgers me into going on a singles cruise, I moan and groan through the whole thing until I find myself in the middle of perfect blue water, getting to know the most beautiful—and uptight man—I’ve ever met. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Silas - My twin sister, Simone, is pure evil. Why else would she force a mandatory vacation from our co-owned bakery on me? While I don’t agree that I’m too high-strung, I will admit that my anxiety does sometimes get the best of me. &lt;i&gt;But a singles cruise?&lt;/i&gt; I don’t want or have time for a relationship despite what she might think. I give in and go on the cruise, not expecting anything except plenty of sunshine and all the cocktails my drink package will allow, when the perfect stranger settles into the seat next to me and takes my breath away. The only problem? We couldn’t be more opposite if we tried. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ship Off is a stand-alone novella of approximately 30,000 words. It features an exciting time at sea, a terrible Hawaiian shirt collection, and two completely opposite men who couldn’t be more perfect for each other. HEA guaranteed.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Davis ~ Life hasn’t been the same since Conrad and I lost our boyfriend Eric in a tragic accident. We’ve started looking for a third again, but the men we’ve met are wanting a one-time experience. It’s all just fun to them, but this is our lifestyle, and we want another man to love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Conrad ~ I’m missing our man more than words can say, but that isn’t the only problem. I’d never told my family I was in a triad, so when they came to the funeral and treated Davis like a close friend, without knowing the depth of his sorrow, it gutted me. He deserves better than that. As hopeful as I am we’ll meet someone on this cruise, I’m not sure I’m ready to live honestly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shane ~ When my friends convince me to splurge and treat myself for a college graduation present, I wasn’t sure a singles cruise was the way to go. What are the chances that the only two men I’m interested in now that I’m here are looking for a third, or that one of them is my best friend’s older brother? But maybe a few days of living the fantasy won’t hurt anyone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fun in the sun is easy, but what happens when three men go back to real life? Lucky for Conrad and Shane, Davis has his eye on the prize and he’s not backing down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shipping Our Loves is a 55,000 word standalone novel intended for 18+ &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;When the seas of love grow choppy, sometimes the best course is to abandon ship!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two years ago, Ryan Abernathy was too tongue-tied, too introverted, and entirely too nervous to flirt with his hot but presumably straight new roommate. So when Ryan’s sister swooped in and scooped the hottie up for herself, he accepted his fate and kept his crush a secret. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sawyer Muller never meant to find himself in a fake relationship with his sexy roommate's sister. And how was he supposed to know that Ryan would become his bestie and star in way too many of his dreams? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Things get complicated when Julia Abernathy strikes a deal with Sawyer to upgrade from fake boyfriend to groom, though they only need to stay married long enough for her to get her trust fund. They plan a fun cruise ship wedding with her entire family in tow. Sawyer figures it sounds like an adventure, and when they quietly divorce later, he’ll finally be free of all the fakery. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With Julia and Ryan’s homophobic, snooty family present, the pressure is turned up… especially when Sawyer finds himself jilted at the altar and drowning in a sea of blame. His only life preserver is the Abernathy sibling he can’t admit to wanting… Ryan. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is an mm romantic comedy set in the Valentines Inc. world. Watch out for an awkward first kiss, a record-making group wedding, and sexy competitive shuffleboard. Before you board this ship, make sure you pack a fan because things are about to heat up on board this vessel!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Brantley Phipps doesn’t need a boyfriend. In his line of work, relationships are impossible. All he wants is one night of fun before he starts his three-month rotation as Assistant Hotel Director on a cruise ship. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He scores the jackpot with a hot older guy who hits all his yes, please buttons and who wants the same thing as him. Talk about a night to remember. That should last him a while… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until he discovers that his one-night stand is none other than the legendary Captain Silver Fox aka his boss for the next three months. Oops. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Still, it shouldn’t be an issue because Brantley doesn’t do coworkers and Fox is known for being strict as hell about not dating employees. That should make things easy, if not for that pesky attraction that keeps flaring up whenever they're in the same room. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's gonna be a long three months... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shipping the Captain has an age gap, yummy steamy scenes, a Caribbean setting, and a summer fling that turns into an embarrassing case of falling for the boss. It’s the sixth book in the Valentine’s Inc. Cruises series but can be read as a complete standalone. The only connection in the series is the shared premise of the Valentine’s Inc. cruise.</description>

  <description>Dawson Hoshaw lives by one motto—work hard, play harder. As the owner of Blue Lotus, a tattoo and piercing shop, he’s got the first part covered. The second part, he accomplishes through meaningless hookups and no-strings-attached encounters. It’s safer this way, with no risk of getting his heart broken again. But when his best friend, Peyton, enters him in a contest—and wins—Dawson finds himself the recipient of an all-expenses paid singles cruise around Australia, courtesy of Valentine’s Inc. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As long as he can remember, Stephen Kincaid has known it’s his duty to take over his family’s chain of men’s clothing stores. The closer his father grows to retirement, the more responsibility Steven assumes. Running multiple businesses and living up to expectations doesn’t leave him with much time for dating, and he can’t remember the last time he took a vacation. So when he wins a contest he didn’t even enter, he can’t pass up the opportunity to see Australia before returning to his humdrum life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a mix-up forces Dawson and Steven to share a cabin, their dream vacation turns into a nightmare. It wouldn’t be so bad if they could escape each other during the day, but it’s hard not to run into one another. And the more time they spend together, the more they find they don’t want to stay away. After a night of passion, Stephen and Dawson can’t help giving in to the growing feelings between them. But how can they make this vacation fling work once they go back to the real world? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Battle Ship is a Valentine’s Inc. novella, but you will see familiar faces with this Forever in Middlebury Crossover. It can be read as a standalone and is intended for adults 18 and over.</description>

  <description>Photographer Upton Sanders is a proverbial third wheel. Still single after his best friend met the love of his life on the Valentine’s Inc. dating app, Upton assumes he’ll be alone forever. Everything changes when his friends surprise him with a week-long singles cruise. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Travel agent Walsh Dunne has never left the state of North Carolina. With the ink on his hospitality degree still wet, he embarks on the S.S. Neptune to learn about the cruise industry and the ship’s exotic ports of call. It isn’t until a chance encounter with Upton that Walsh learns this is no ordinary cruise. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Excited to attend the Ship Happens dating events, Upton has zero luck meeting the man of his dreams. The one man he is forever running into, Walsh, keeps rescuing him from sticky situations. Finished with the vain men he’s met so far, Upton and Walsh team up to explore the islands. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sparks fly between the men, making them think a relationship in the real world is possible. Back on shore, both men are excited about the future, until an emergency calls Walsh back home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can the star-crossed lovers find a way back to each other? Or will their love go down with the ship? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A happy ever after is not in the cards for me. But a short fling aboard a ship crossing the Atlantic might just be exactly what I need.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When my friends suggest I take a much-needed vacation on their Valentine’s Inc. hosted cruise, I leap at the chance. I don’t have a lot of expectations for this matchmaking singles cruise—I’m certainly not looking for a future Mr. Chase Kelton. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I’m not prepared for is walking into my assigned suite to find a man passed out on the first day. I recognized the shy barista immediately. He’s been serving me my morning fix for a year and driving me crazy with the hard shell he keeps locked around him. I want to break it. I know there’s an entirely different man beneath it that I’m itching to reveal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reign is the proverbial fish out of water, and when I learn the real reason he’s on this cruise, I see an opportunity I can’t resist. He needs a companion to show him the ropes—I can do that and so much more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;An introverted barista with a crush, a wealthy executive afraid to fall in love, and a twist on fake boyfriends. Shipping Orders is a full length, standalone novel in the Valentine’s Inc. multi-author series.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Falling in love with your boss is never a good idea. Now if someone could just explain that to my heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dane: &lt;br /&gt;When I first started working for Holt Atwood, I respected him. That respect turned to like, and eventually into love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Holt is married to his job, and I am not about playing second fiddle to mergers and acquisitions. So it’s time to move on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can do this one last thing for him though. I can go on this singles cruise with him and help him see that work isn’t all there is to life. If I can do that, I will feel better about leaving him with such short notice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Holt: &lt;br /&gt;Work has been my focus for so long I’ve forgotten what it’s like to just let go and have fun. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At first, when my parents insisted I go on this cruise because I was on the fast track to burn out, I thought I could take my assistant along and make it a work trip. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Dane has other ideas, and the longer I am around him outside of work, the more I realize maybe everyone is right. Maybe I have been so focused on work I’ve missed what’s really important. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just hope it’s not too late to convince Dane I want him for more than work. I want him forever.</description>

  <description>Cold Case Sergeant Ronan O’Mara wakes to a shocking midnight phone call. The body of a man killed in a shoot-out with the F.B.I. has vanished from the Suffolk County Morgue. What’s even more shocking than the missing corpse, is the identity of the second man apprehended at the scene. Mitchell Bond, aka, Tommy O’Neil was Ronan’s second-grade classmate and best friend until he was kidnapped in broad daylight, steps from his front door. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even though psychic Tennyson Grimm hadn’t heard of Ronan’s childhood friend before now, he’s suddenly consumed by thoughts of the man. Thanks to Ten’s gift he knows twelve missing children linked to Mitchell Bond are alive, but he is uncertain of where to find them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Ronan is finally given the opportunity to speak to his long-lost friend, accusations begin to fly. Ronan is blindsided and begins to question everything he knew about Tommy, his kidnapping, and whether or not he could possibly have played a role in it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While Tennyson races to put the pieces together to save the missing children, Ronan is forced to come to terms with a past he thought was long dead and buried. Can he set aside his own emotions long enough to put a stop to this deadly hunt? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Two mismatched men. One unlikely friendship.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jordan Kingsley is Hollydale’s most hated alpha. The man is seen as nothing more than a pretentious twit who doesn’t care about anyone but himself. So then, why does he find himself diving into a pond to save a life? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trevor Johnson is the most accident-prone omega around. Kicked out by his father after finding himself pregnant, he wanders around town trying to figure out what to do. A fall into the duck pond at Plumtree park is nearly his undoing until Jordan rescues him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Citing the old proverb that he’s responsible for the life he saved, Jordan shocks himself by befriending Trevor and offering him a place to stay. While other people have found the omega’s klutzy tendencies to be annoying, Jordan can’t help but be charmed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite an age gap and the unplanned baby that’s on the way with no sire in sight, these unlikely friends just might find that they’re a perfect match. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Return to the world of Hollydale with a quirky romance filled with all the fluffy feels that you’d expect from a Hollydale novella. This is the thirteenth book of The Hollydale Omegas series but is absolutely able to be read as a standalone. This is a 26k novella and definitely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;”Shane is my stepbrother; he's family and strictly off-limits.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shane Prescott is a fun-loving omega with a knack for landing in trouble. He prides himself on efficiently running the waitstaff at his brother’s restaurant, Kamasouptra. Between his brother-slash-bestie, Keith, and his dog, Rocky, Shane doesn’t need anything else to make him happy. Love would be nice, but that ship sailed the day his mom married Keith’s dad. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Keith Anderson is focused on two things: making Kamasouptra the premiere place to dine in Hollydale and not giving into his feelings for his stepbrother. For the past several years, his life has been running smoothly to the point of being in rut. Keith’s life begins to change when an offbeat old lady befriends him and starts to make Keith think that it’s time to alpha up and chase what he really wants. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Between a smarmy food critic, April Fools pranks gone wrong, and two helpful old coots who dispense their unsolicited folksy wisdom to the brothers—you’ll be in stitches as you root for a pair of men who are so busy trying to follow societal expectations that they’re oblivious to the clear signs that maybe… just maybe… they were never meant to have a brotherly relationship in the first place. Things are about to change in major ways for this pair of stepbrothers, if they can just be brave enough to take a chance for happiness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to the world of Hollydale with a quirky romance full of all the fluffy feels that you’d expect from a Hollydale novella. This is the eleventh book of The Hollydale Omegas series but is absolutely able to be read as a standalone. This is a 32k novella and definitely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The first rule of business is that you don’t mix it with pleasure. But if you &lt;/i&gt;do&lt;i&gt; get involved with your business partner? Try not to knock him up… it goofs up the dividends.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tired of the playboy lifestyle, Gabe Smythe is ready for change. To start his new life, he’s come to Hollydale with one goal—to reunite with his long-lost brother, Rafe. Along the way, if he happens to meet a sweet omega who’d make a nice little homemaker, even better! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cody Harper isn’t looking to settle down, and he’s definitely not ever tying himself to anyone. Casual sex and friends with extra-special benefits? Sure! Romance and relationships? Nope. Not gonna happen—especially not with Gabe, his sexy business partner at Nut Juices, the hot new smoothie shop they run together with the help of their quirky employee, Tofer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can their friendship and partnership survive an accidental pregnancy? As Cody and Gabe laugh their way from partners… to friends with bennies… to co-parents, they’ll discover that life isn’t always black and white, and sometimes a little compromise comes in handy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Return to the world of Hollydale with a quirky, holiday romance full of all the fluffy feels and sweet heat that you’d expect from a Hollydale story. This is the tenth book of The Hollydale Omegas series but is absolutely able to be read as a standalone. This is a 34k novel and definitely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;You can’t plan when you’ll fall in love—sometimes it just kinda sneaks up on you.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Todd Foxx was only looking to unwind from the stress of running The Sausage Shack when he went out for an evening of fun at The Big O. After he ended the evening by hooking up with a hot new alpha in town, he certainly never thought he’d see him again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hugo Keller left his high-profile job as a certified cicerone back east and moved across country to take a brewmaster job in Hollydale’s unique beer garden and sausage restaurant. A single dad, his only plans involved giving his young son a place to put down roots and focusing on his new job—even if it was a major step down from where he began. He certainly never expected to see his smoking hot one night stand again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can two men—and one precocious little boy—find a way to make a family? As Hugo and Todd slowly journey from lovers to coworkers to friends and back to lovers, they’ll need to deal with an ex-wife with boundary issues, a surprise pregnancy, and mysterious “mill girls” who like to giggle in the night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to the world of Hollydale with a quirky romance full of all the fluffy feels and sweet heat that you’d expect from a Hollydale story. This is the ninth book of The Hollydale Omegas series but is absolutely able to be read as a standalone. This is a 42k novel and definitely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Sometimes love will come in the most unexpected places.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Scott is a YouTuber known for his popular &lt;i&gt;Outdoor Omega&lt;/i&gt; adventure videos. While on a trip through the Winnipeg area to film a zip lining adventure, he detours to a small neighboring town for their annual sugaring off festival. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Justin is a seasoned constable with the RCMP… yep, he’s a hot, alpha Mountie and Scott can’t stop sneaking peeks at the guy who seems to pop up around every corner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Through a weird twist of fate—and a little help from a local legend named Amik—Scott and Justin find themselves stranded together in a remote cabin for several days. The two hit it off with an almost instant connection, but Scott is an American whose travel visa is about to expire and his law-abiding Mountie isn’t about to let him stay illegally. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Return to the world of Hollydale with quirky romance full of all the fluffy feels that you’d expect from a Hollydale novella. This is the eighth book of The Hollydale Omegas series but is absolutely able to be read as a standalone. This is a 26k novella and definitely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>An M/M Omegaverse Mpreg Romance &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The best gifts in life will sometimes catch you by surprise.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Luke is a YouTuber known for his popular &lt;i&gt;Omega Manny Diary&lt;/i&gt; videos. After a brief-yet-secret fling with his boss Ian’s best friend, he finds himself left with an even larger secret: Grazer’s baby. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grazer had a lot of fun with Luke, but he’d been upfront with him from the beginning. He’d always preferred to chase silver foxes—not young, fertile pups. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nearly two years after their last hot night together, Grazer returns to Hollydale, fresh from a year of guarding the toddler of a celebrity. He’s at loose ends, not to mention lonely, and wondering if maybe he’d been too brash when writing off love and fatherhood in the past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Grazer runs into Luke and discovers his life-altering secret, can they find a way to forgive the mistakes of the past and grab their second chance at romance? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Return to Hollydale for this second chance, secret baby romance where May learns to be the December in an age gap relationship. This is the seventh book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is about 34k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"I know you're not the kind of omega who needs an alpha to protect him. You’re strong enough on your own. That's why you're my bromega... a bro who happens to be an omega that I would give anything for... "&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Greg may be an omega, but he doesn't let that define him. Aside from his almost compulsive need to clean, the most important thing to him is his job as the long-time bartender at The Big O. Greg is far from a delicate omega. In fact, he’s the same size as his best friend - an alpha who he always falls back into bed with when they’re between relationships. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Braden is a casual kind of alpha bro. He spends his time - and makes his money - playing video games. A slacker who never leaves the house, let alone bothers with unnecessary details like getting dressed, Braden is happy to settle into a non-relationship agreement with his bestie. It’s not like they’re gonna do anything silly like fall in love anyway - they’re just bros being bros. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Greg saves the life of a quirky Irishman, he’s given an unexpected boon - his lifelong infertility is miraculously cured and he finds himself pregnant. Too bad nobody gave him the heads up that this was even a possibility. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Return to Hollydale for a friends to lovers tale of two guys who are perfect for each other, if they can just open their hearts and risk their friendship by taking a chance on love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the sixth book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is about 27k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Because Stix are better than Ballz... &lt;br /&gt;Come in for our eclairs, and stay for the fabulous coffee. &lt;br /&gt;Show this flyer for a 10% discount! &lt;br /&gt;Ask about our Flakey Tasters Club!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kent crumpled the lame azz flyer in his hand and looked across the street at the Salty Stix bakery and thought to himself... this is war.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Single father Pierre Duchamp has recently returned to Hollydale with plans to open Salty Stix, an authentic French bakery like the one he apprenticed at in Paris. The omega doesn’t have, need, or even want an alpha in his life—especially a provincial small town rube that doesn’t understand the concept of a little healthy competition. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kent Hawkins doesn’t want drama. He just wants to spend his days making candy for Sweet Ballz—a place that is so much more than just a job, it’s his life. If only the thieving French baker across the street would quit revamping and one-upping Kent’s recipes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A one-night stand gone wrong… two dessert loving men who can’t find a way to reduce their boil to a simmer… and a mysterious hippie who keeps accidentally making things worse while he blithely totes around his little harp. Celebrate Valentine’s Day in Hollydale—a sweet little town where strange things happen but your friends are always there to have your back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the fifth book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is about 27k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.</description>

  <description>"I promise, I'm not going anywhere. I found everything that I never thought I wanted right here with you." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cecil is an unconventional omega. Owner of Second Chances, Hollydale’s Thrift Store and Consignment Shop, the closest he wants to get to an alpha is when he picks one up for a few hours of fun on a Saturday night. And even then, they’d better be polite enough to disappear before he wakes up. Yet for some reason, after picking up Hollydale’s most elusive playboy bachelor for a spot of fun after Tom’s wedding, Cecil is almost relieved to find Ian still there the following morning when he gets the call from a social worker that he’s been named the guardian of an orphaned two day old infant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ian’s entire adult life has been spent climbing the ladder to partnership at his law firm, and squeezing in a little fun with omegas in his spare time. Settling down with one and starting a family is so far from his thoughts it’s laughable. So why does he find himself sticking around to help the adorably awkward omega as he struggles to keep a tiny human alive? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Return to Hollydale for a little post-holiday fun while Ian and Cecil figure out that, sometimes, sticking around is more fun than a one night stand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the fourth book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is about 30k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Grayson&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was a billionaire by the age of thirty—I’ve always taken what I wanted, and I never let anyone stand in my way. That attitude got me my own private island and a bevy of people to do my bidding. But it didn’t get me the one man that got away—Liam Gold. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Liam is back in Abingdon now, and he’s just as beautiful as the day he left. He’s also covered in tattoos, living in a van, and completely unemployed. Definitely not an appropriate match. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when have I ever been appropriate? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liam&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;People seem to think that just because I’m &lt;i&gt;homeless,&lt;/i&gt; I shouldn’t be living with a mega-hot billionaire. Kinda seems like they’re jealous, don’t you think? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say I’m a swindler. A con artist. A gold digger. Hungry for Grayson Ellis, and even hungrier for his money. So what if I am? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I never got a real chance to be with Grayson. We were too young and too scared to make it work. Now that I’m back, and Grayson has offered to give me a hand, I’ll accept whatever he has to give. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Let the people say what they want. I am running a long con, but it’s not what they think. If I can get that man to fall in love with me, I’ll move heaven and earth to make him happy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone deserves a second chance. Even a stone cold loser like me.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Noble:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I learned long ago that I could look—but never touch. My father made it clear: I was no longer his son if I ever sinned with a man. But Connor Strong took hold of my heart the moment I saw on him. And he made that sin sound so, so sweet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My dad is the most powerful Evangelical preacher in the country. Millions of people watch him on TV every Sunday morning. I’m the church’s golden boy—handsome, well-behaved, and &lt;i&gt;straight&lt;/i&gt;. But a man like Connor Strong couldn’t be wrong in God’s eyes. And the way he kisses me is a spiritual revelation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Connor makes sparks fly whenever he touches me. He teaches me, slowly and tenderly, and shows me exactly what he needs. He tells me I’m the perfect boyfriend, except for one thing. I’m not out. I can’t be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But there are some things worth fighting for. And Connor Strong tops the list. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connor: &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I came to Abingdon after my ex broke my heart. I resigned myself to a life alone. But when Noble Hansen walks into my bakery, sculpted and towering like a Norse god, I realize I &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; that man in my life. Sure, Noble’s a closet case and has some major issues with his mysterious family. But once he gets a taste, he can’t get enough—and I can't get enough of him, either. He’s at my house every night, and I’m fine with staying secret during the day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But drama comes along with dating the world's kindest evangelical superstar. When anti-trans protesters fill the town, Connor stands up to them. And when one of the protesters gets assaulted, I'm the one getting accused. I have an alibi, but I can't use it without letting everyone know his secret: I was in bed with Noble, teaching him something &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; new. I could 'out' Noble, change his entire life. But he’s not just a fling or a rebound. Noble is my &lt;i&gt;everything,&lt;/i&gt; and I won’t reveal his secret, especially not while Reverend Hansen is watching his every move. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it turns out that Noble is far braver than I ever imagined. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Noble and Strong is the fifth book in the Bridge to Abingdon series. Each book focuses on one adorable couple, and each can be read as a standalone novel. Noble and Connor have a tense, exciting, and sensual relationship with lots of first-time moments and out-for-you drama! There’s also your favorite Abingdon grandma, Gil Steele doing hot cop things in uniform, loads of rainbow baked goods, and a redemption story you’ll never expect. Connor and Noble are the defenders of Abingdon’s LGBTQ+ community, and they won’t let hate take over their town!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Tom Collins is a lonely omega. One by one, Tom's watched his friends pair up and find their forever mates while Tom goes out alone to flirt with randos at the Big O. Manager of Sweet Ballz, the popular candy shop in downtown Hollydale, Tom has his career on track. Now if he could just find an alpha to stick around for longer than a night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Colin Samuels is busy. As an alpha specializing in emergency medicine, he keeps a punishing schedule. He doesn't have time, patience or even the energy to take up with an omega. Especially not a sassy little brat like the one he keeps running into. All he wanted was one hot night with the guy, not forever. So why can't he get the frustrating twink out of his mind? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Tom finally find love? Will Dr. Samuels get that speculum dislodged from his rear pocket and give them a chance? And who is the little girl that hits both men right smack in the feels? And what's the story with Tofer O'Toole, the new cage dancer at the Big O? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the third book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is about 30k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.</description>

  <description>Be careful what you witch for… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ghost Detective Jude Byrne is missing the excitement of the high-profile investigations he and his partner have been handling. Every time the bell jingles over the shop door, he finds himself hoping it’s their next big case. Jude gets his wish and then some when Anson Hollister, curator of the Salem Witch House, walks into West Side Magick with a frightening story to tell. He’s been visited by the spirit of Thatcher Webb, the judge who’d presided over the Salem Witch Trials, sentencing nineteen innocent women to hang. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Psychic Copeland Forbes is enjoying the slower pace of life with Jude. Back from vacation and settled into their new house, he’s content working cases that don’t make him want to sleep with the lights on. Agreeing to take Anson’s case, Cope becomes violently ill on a trip to investigate The Witch House, making him fear there is something more sinister involved rather than the simple haunting Anson described. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With no sign of Thatcher Webb’s spirit, the investigation is at a near standstill, until warlock Callum Churchill, who’s ancestor, Abigail, was one of Thatcher Webb’s victims, disappears on a visit to The Witch House. Can Jude and Cope find the missing witch and put a stop to the diabolical goings on or will they become the next spirits haunting the ghost house? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Everything Dominic Price has worked hard to uphold is about to come crashing down on everything he holds dear.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much for the quiet life. Just as assistant US attorney and brewery owner Dominic Price is settling into a comfy new chapter with his partner, FBI agent Cameron Byrne, the sudden death of Nic’s father puts their happily-ever-after in jeopardy. Nic immediately suspects foul play, his prime suspect a notorious gangster his father was indebted to—only now the loan shark is out for blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cam has been longing for Nic to finally let him in on this very personal case. But when Nic’s belief that he’s the sole Price heir is upended, the line between personal and professional starts to blur, leaving Cam unsure of where he stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nic is depending on Cam’s kidnap and rescue expertise to save his recently discovered family member before it’s too late. But with a dangerous threat closing in, the ghosts from Nic’s past cast long shadows. Any relationship could crack under the pressure, but for Nic, finding his family might mean losing the love of his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the Carina Press Romance Promise: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is approximately 72,000 words</description>

  <description>Assistant US attorney Dominic Price is staring down the barrel of his father’s debts. The bull’s-eye on his back makes him a threat to everyone he cares about, so when his lover wants to go public with their relationship, he bolts. Not because he isn’t in love—he can’t stomach the thought of putting Cam in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kidnap and rescue expert Cameron Byrne is determined to figure out what trouble Nic is running from, but devastating news from home brings him back to Boston and to the cold case that has haunted his family for two decades. Shoving aside his pride, he calls Nic for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together they search for answers, navigating the minefield of Cam’s past. But when they get too close to the truth, Cam must use every skill in his arsenal to save the man he loves…before it’s too late.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Layla Reyne spins off from her pulse-pounding Agents Irish and Whiskey books with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Imperial Stout&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, the first installment in the Trouble Brewing series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a good thing assistant US attorney Dominic Price co-owns a brewery. He could use a cold one. Nic’s star witness has just been kidnapped, his joint operation with the FBI is in jeopardy, his father’s shady past is catching up with him and the hot new special agent in San Francisco is the kind of distraction best handled with a stiff drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kidnap and rescue expert Cameron Byrne has his own ideas about how to handle Nic, but his skills are currently needed elsewhere. The by-the-book FBI agent goes deep undercover as a member of an infamous heist crew in order to save Nic’s witness, break up the crew and close the case before anyone else gets hurt. Nic in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things heat up when Cam falls for Nic, and the witness falls for Cam. As the crew’s suspicions grow, Cam must decide how far he’s willing to go—and how far into his own dark past he’s willing to dive—to get everyone out alive.</description>

  <description>I vow to love you and protect you as my omega, my husband, and my mate. I vow to be a good father to every child born of your womb whether born of my seed or not. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Christian Hawkins, owner and operator of Greasy Fingers Garage in Hollydale is in a rut. His life is spent taking care of his business and looking after his younger brother Kent. The scent of cinnamon is everywhere as the alpha finds himself haunted by the memory of the omega that he ran into...literally...on his way home from work one night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the run from the abusive ex who had no desire to be a father to the child he carries, omega Liam Leigh finds himself homeless, hungry, alone, and pregnant in the sweet little town of Hollydale just a couple weeks before Thanksgiving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Christian and Liam both keep running into each other, as well as an odd little old man with a penchant for appearing just when he's most needed. But what's up with the unique golden tipped white feathers that keep popping up? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the second book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is 31k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language. Caution for possible triggers: The homeless MC is an assault survivor. No assault scenes are shown, just a factual, non-detailed accounting of past events.</description>

  <description>FBI agents Aidan "Irish" Talley and Jameson "Whiskey" Walker can't get a moment's peace. Their hunt for the terrorist Renaud seems to be nearing an end, until a fire allows him to slip through their fingers—and puts Jamie's life in danger. When Jamie is nearly killed, Aidan learns how many forms loss can take. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aidan says &lt;i&gt;I love you&lt;/i&gt; just moments before learning that Jamie's been keeping a devastating secret about Aidan's late husband. How quickly trust and love can go up in flames. When Aidan requests a solo undercover assignment, Jamie hopes Aidan will find a way to forgive him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the explosions are far from over. Aidan's cover lands him in the heart of the terrorist's conspiracy, and Jamie will have to put his life, his career and his freedom on the line to save the man who has become his entire world. Partners, always is a promise he intends to keep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;b&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise&lt;/b&gt;: all the romance you're looking for with an HEA/HFN. It's a promise!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Professionally, the FBI team of Aidan "Irish" Talley and Jameson "Whiskey" Walker is as good as it gets, closing cases faster than any team at the Bureau. Personally, it’s a different story. Aidan’s feelings for Jamie scare the hell out of him: he won’t risk losing another love no matter how heart-tripping the intimacy between them. And loss is a grim reality with the terrorist Renaud still on their trail, leaving a pile of bodies in his wake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going undercover on a new case gets them out of town and off the killer's radar. They're assigned to investigate an identity theft ring involving a college basketball team in Jamie's home state, where Jamie's past makes him perfect for the role of coach. But returning to the court brings more than old memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As secrets and shocking betrayals abound, none may be more dangerous than the one Jamie’s been keeping: a secret about the death of Aidan’s husband that could blow his partner's world apart and destroy forever the fragile bonds of trust and love building between them.</description>

  <description> Mineral spas are so calm and relaxing...unless they smell like a derrière at a bean-lover's convention, that is!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dixon and Yuri have a hot tip that Uncle Fonzo is taking the waters at Spring Falls Hot Spring Spa. Not only is the spring stinky enough to make your eyes water—but the foul odor reaches peak level just as the resort is gearing up for a visit from an important critic that will make or break its reputation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, this wouldn't be Dixon’s problem...except it appears that a piece of his uncle's Spellcraft might be responsible. He can't be entirely sure, though, since that particular slip of paper managed to go through the shredder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dixon and Yuri pitch in to help the spa's owner appease a jilted bride, an obnoxious businessman, and the world's most boring critic while they scramble to reconstruct the shredded Spellcraft. Can they fix the wonky spell before it does any permanent damage? Or will all their efforts at saving the spa end up swirling down the drain?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The ABCs of Spellcraft is a series filled with bad jokes and good magic, where MM Romance meets Paranormal Cozy. A perky hero, a brooding love interest, and delightfully twisty-turny stories that never end up quite where you'd expect. The books are best read in order, so be sure to start at the beginning with Quill Me Now.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>(Alpha Omega M/M Gay Mpreg Romance) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;One is accused. One is betrayed. One is a killer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Midwife-apprentice, Kyle’s sheltered world is shattered when a patient’s mate flies into a murderous rage and attacks him. Kyle is rescued by a handsome alpha visitor, but as attraction blazes between the two men, and they fall into each other’s dreams, what starts as lust becomes something impossible. Kyle is a beta. He can’t be an alpha’s true mate. And yet, what else explains their connection? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pine Creek Lake alpha, Shadow isn’t looking for his true mate when he stumbles across a beta being attacked in the middle of the night. But when a simple rescue reveals a chain of possible murders, Shadow must learn the truth about the man in his dreams before it’s too late.

Is Kyle as ignorant as he pretends, or is he hiding a dangerous secret? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Kyle and Shadow work together to discover the truth, both men are forced to question their deepest assumptions about themselves and each other. Are they fated mates? Is Kyle living a lie? And when the truth is revealed, will Kyle have the courage to face it before Shadow suffers the same death as the others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find out in Omega Shadow, Book 3 of the Pine Creek Lake Den series, an action-packed Mpreg romance with a happily ever after to melt your heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast paced.

  <description>Ghost Detective Jude Byrne has just landed in magical Key West, Florida for two weeks of fun in the sun. He’s looking forward to working on his tan instead of on haunted houses. Sitting at the hotel bar, he overhears a radio call-in show interviewing a terrified man about the harrowing experiences he had with a ghost at Casa Flores, a local bed and breakfast. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Psychic Copeland Forbes is equally thrilled to be on vacation. He’s still dealing with the effects of the Lewis case and a few weeks in the sun is just what the doctor ordered. Hearing the caller on the radio changes everything. He knows he needs to get involved with this case and places a call to PRIDE XM to offer his services to the scared young man. What starts out as a friendly phone call turns into a bet with Jude and Cope spending the night in this haunted hotel where things do, in fact, go bump in the night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The vacationing duo soon find out they have a mystery on their hands. Casa Flores was the home of a Cuban cigar baron and his second wife. The problem was that Santiago Flores’s first wife was still alive and well back in Havana. When she learned of her husband’s betrayal, she came to Key West for revenge. In the end, mysterious deaths visited all three members of the Flores family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Jude and Cope get to the bottom of what really happened at Casa Flores or will they become the latest victims in this ghost town? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Gerald's story continues as he finds not one but two alphas to love. This book can be read as a standalone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ezra has finally decided his big house is just depressing without people living in it. His attempts at finding a sane roommate are scary at first, but he doesn't throw in the towel right away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gerald is happy for his best friend and former roommate, but he can't afford to pay the full rent on his own. So when he sees an ad for a low-cost room for rent that sounds too good to be true, he wonders if it was meant to be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tyler is staying in Oak Grove for a job that should only take a few months, but living out of a hotel gets old real fast. So when he learns about a room for rent in a nice house near town, he's happy to have a more comfortable place to live. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When these three men finally connect, the chemistry between them is undeniable, but Tyler doesn't plan to stay. And what the three of them have together just doesn't feel right when one is missing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Omega Shaken is a sweet and sexy story about two alphas who fall for a sweet omega. You'll enjoy this story if you like knotty heat and adorable babies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For adult readers.</description>

  <description>A Non Shifter Alpha Omega MPreg Romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitch opened The Fallen Nut as a safe haven for alphas and omegas to meet up. Keeping omegas safe was a priority for him and his brother Ike after their younger brother was killed ten years earlier. As one of the hottest bars in Oak Grove, The Fallen Nut was the pinnacle of success for local craft brewers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kaden didn't know much about brewing beer, but he committed to helping out his brother with his craft beer: Tapped. When Tapped was named as a finalist in the quarterly contest at The Fallen Nut to get keg space, Kaden was happy for his brother. At least until realizing Ike would be out of town for the event and Kaden would have to take charge of promoting Tapped and getting enough votes to win. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Mitch saw Kaden, he had to have him. They had a quick encounter and both went their separate ways. But once wasn't enough for either of them. And when they're paths cross again, their connection is stronger than ever and undeniable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Omega On Tap is a sexy and romantic romance with plenty of knotty heat, male pregnancy, a cute baby, and an HEA.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I’ve been giving Axel not so subtle hints for months.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He comes in once a week for a shave and takes a piece of my heart with him every time he goes. The late night barbershop here at Principal Ink feels more like home than the crowded apartment I share with several roommates. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I know Brandon wants me as much as I want him, but there’s a secret I’ve kept from the people at the social club connecting the tattoo shop with the barbershop where Brandon works, and exposing my secret might burst the bubble I’ve created. He might not want me after I reveal what I’ve been hiding. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; One night, a box shows up at Principal Ink, a box that will change our lives forever. Axel won’t have a choice but to come clean, but will Brandon ever be able to trust him again? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Alpha’s Biker-Kissed Omega is a sweet with knotty heat mpreg with a rescued baby, successful but troubled alpha, and the omega who makes them a family. &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;All I hoped for was a quiet life teaching in a small town… &lt;br /&gt;But the first few days spent in a motel left me feeling ungrounded, and the assignment to teach omega studies had me considering running back to the big city for fear of letting a bunch of kids down. Could I do justice to the subject?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then Principal Armison walked into my classroom, offered to rent me the apartment above his garage, and, while he offered to be no more than my principal and my landlord, I hoped this alpha would also see we were destined to be mates. Because I knew we were with every fiber of my being. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But this principal was far more than just an academic. When he left school every day he donned leathers and hopped on his motorcycle to ride to Principal Ink…his tattoo shop, barber shop, and biker social club. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was starting to feel like I was in over my head, but in such a good way. He was all my fantasies rolled into one. And with every day we spent together, I saw more of why he’d make such a great partner in life and, sooner than I ever dreamed, father of the child I was carrying. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Alpha’s Principal-Kissed Omega is a sweet with knotty heat mpreg romance. It is book seven in the Alpha-Kissed series, but can be read as a standalone.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>MM Non-Shifter Mpreg Romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I never learned how to swim.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Fear had ruled over most of my life from fear of the water to my choice of alpha. Now that I’d left him, it was time to face all the facets of life. What I hadn’t expected was that my swimming teacher, the lifeguard at a local kids’ club would not only be the teacher I needed, but more. Harris might just prove to be the anchor I needed in life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When I saw Luca, knees wobbling by the pool, I knew something more than a fear of water plagued this omega. My protective instinct kicked in full-time. I needed to know him, keep him safe, share my life with him—and not just in the pool. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Alpha’s Lifeguard-Kissed Omega is a sweet with knotty heat mm mpreg romance. It is Book 6 of the Alpha Kissed series but can be read as a standalone.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>An M/M Non-Shifter Mpreg Romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A long time ago, I met the alpha of my dreams. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We spent one night together, the most amazing of my life. He left me a note, but fate had other plans. I never knew his name, but he left me with something else—his babe in my stomach. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now that my child and I have moved to a new town, I’ve found him again. But I have to tell him this boy is his son and hope he doesn’t hate me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All these years the only thing Bennett had of me was the first letter of my name and memories of that one night. But he has a son, so he must have a mate. I still love him, that fiery ginger from the rock concert. And I wonder why his son looks a little like me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Alpha’s Ginger- Kissed Omega is a MM non-shifter mpreg with a devoted ginger omega, a strong intelligent alpha, and a secret child and adorable baby. The Alpha’s Ginger-Kissed Omega is part of the Alpha Kissed series but can be read as a standalone &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>An M/M Non-Shifter Mpreg Romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Of course I’ve noticed him.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He’s Hal, the singer who everyone loves and fawns over all night. There is no shortage of suitors surrounding his piano while he sings songs that drive directly into my heart. I wouldn’t stand a chance. So I sit here on my barstool and listen and pretend he might know I’m alive. &lt;br /&gt;But he never takes anyone home, and I doubt he’s going to start with me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I’m not the type of guy who approaches a man like him. I see him every night I perform at the Moonlight Lounge. The songs I choose are pointed in his direction, but nothing seems to make him look my way for more than a few seconds. His sweater vests and ties make him look a little uptight but I know there’s more. The way he bites his lip. The smooth manner in which he tips back his drink. The outline of biceps under the button down shirt I need to know him. Because my gut says he´s mine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; The Alpha’s Cranberry-Kissed Omega is a MM non-shifter mpreg with a hot musical alpha, a ninja competitor, psychologist omega, and a holiday surprise meeting that sets everything in motion. The Alpha’s Cranberry-Kissed Omega is part of the Alpha Kissed series but can be read as a standalone.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>MM Non-Shifter Mpreg Romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What better place to meet your fated mate than an extraordinary candy store?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And what better season than Halloween? Liam is arranging the amazing treats in the window of his gourmet candy shop, Sugar, when a jogger taps on the window. Despite his policy not to let strangers in when he’s alone in the closed store, this stranger is too irresistible to send away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Edison has had his eye on the hot alpha store owner for months but has finally gathered his courage to approach him. To his relief and delight, the man of his dreams asks him out on a date. Sweet! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when a little boy who attends the afterschool activities at Edison’s community center falls into desperate need, he is called upon to take him into his home and so a family begins. A foster child who has been so badly harmed brings challenges, and only a very strong, loving alpha would want to take on both an omega and the injured child.

  <description>Dating is out for omegas like me, at least, I’ve made it my rule. An alpha craves an omega who can give him a family. And I’m just fine with my life. My work as a freelance photographer makes it possible for me to give the kids I take in lots of time, something they need and deserve. Most of them haven’t had an easy life. And Robbie...my current foster child needs my love and care more than any of the others so far. I thought I had it all figured out, but meeting Patrick has thrown me for a loop. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Patrick deserves more than a lesser omega, a broken shell of who I should be. But I can’t help myself. His searing looks plus that signature pumpkin spice scent demand I pay attention. Pursue him. See if there is a chance he could be mine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Autumn brings with it cooler days, but with Patrick in my life, the nights only grow hotter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;MM Non-Shifter Mpreg Romance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The heart’s a resilient beast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight months after the car crash that changed everything, FBI agent Aidan Talley is back at work. New department, new case and a new partner. Smart, athletic and handsome, Jameson Walker is twelve years his junior. Even if Aidan was ready to move on—and he's not—Jamie is off-limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie's lusted after Aidan for three years, and the chance to work with San Francisco's top agent directly is too good to pass up. Aidan is prickly—to put it mildly—but a growing cyber threat soon proves Jamie's skills invaluable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie's talents paint a target on his back, and Aidan is determined to protect him. But with hack after hack threatening a high-security biocontainment facility, time is running out to thwart a deadly terrorist attack. They'll have to filter out distractions, on the case and in their partnership, to identify the real enemy, solve the case and save thousands of lives, including their own.</description>

  <description>“I will always love you, both in this life and the next. I vow to love you, honor you, and stay by your side through haunted houses, dead relatives, and random appearances of red croquet balls.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Milo is a mild-mannered omega who just wants to save his Sweet Ballz, the candy shop he owns on Main St. in Hollydale. Someday maybe he will find an alpha as awesome as the book boyfriends he reads about in the popular books by his favorite author. But for now, Milo is content to be at home curled up with his favorite romance books. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rafe is a lonely alpha trying to juggle his writing career while settling into the gorgeous old manor he's just purchased in quaint Hollydale. He just wants to have a home of his own away from the craziness of his rich, socialite family. All Rafe wants is peace and quiet to secretly write his popular romance novels, and to maybe someday find a sweet omega to love like the ones he writes about every night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rafe can't explain the odd happenings in his new home, or the strangely sweet little old lady who comes and goes, even when the doors are locked. Is he being gas-lighted or is there more going on? Rafe and Milo could be perfect for each other, if they can first overcome the red croquet balls that life keeps throwing at them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the first book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is 35k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;FIVE JOBS. FIVE CHANCES FOR REDEMPTION. One thing’s for sure: these men are no angels.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing like being blackmailed by a dead man to really bring a group of cons together. The deal is simple, we do the jobs and Charlie’s lawyer wipes the slate clean for each of us, one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job number two lands right in my lap. I’m Bond. Wesley Bond. (I can’t resist saying it that way. Blame my dad, if you can find him.) You could call me a hacker. I redistribute wealth - moving it from rich slimebags to poorer but infinitely more deserving people - and make a tidy profit as I do.  My mission, should I choose to accept it, is to bring down some modern-day slave traders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I definitely choose to accept it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the life of the one person in this world I love on the line, I can’t afford any screw ups or distractions. Unfortunately, my biggest distraction is my biggest asset - Danny Monroe. Danny is a leftover complication from our first job; a victim of the vicious senator we’d gotten locked up. He’s a smart, funny, gorgeous, ex-prostitute, who can’t seem to keep his clothes on. I can’t seem to keep my mouth shut around him. But I need a fake boyfriend, and Danny is the only option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fooling the world into thinking we’re in love will be easy; fooling myself that I’m not might be impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t know who the bad guy is, we have no idea how to prove anything. There’s no internet on the island, no cell service, and i’ll have only the bare bones of my gear. If I’m going to do this, I’m going to need all the help I can get. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Like it or not, we’re all in this together.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>&lt;i&gt;To save his lover, he must become his own worst nightmare.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Nick Sewell. Non-conformist. Werewolf. The first puts him at odds with his colleagues’ idea of how an All Saints College lecturer should behave. The second, bestowed upon him by an ex-boyfriend, puts him at odds with himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s his tendency to change into a wolf on the full moon. And his visceral attraction to Julian Lauder, a troubled young German student. Despite his determination not to act on his desire, Nick’s brutal response to seeing Julian with another man frightens them both. At first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Nick learns that Julian is not only a naturally submissive werewolf, but one who has learned better how to deal with just being a werewolf. That explains the attraction, but it doesn’t make it any easier when the tables are turned, and Julian—once the student—is now teaching Nick…who still isn’t happy about conforming to the “werewolf way”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, reports of a strange wolf stalking the town barely register on Nick’s radar—until Julian disappears. Accusing eyes—both wolf and human—are turned toward Nick. Even with the help of friends, hope is growing as cold as the kidnapper’s trail. Unless Nick gives free rein to the wolf’s inhuman power… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Product Warnings: Contains hot outdoor sex, alliterative insults, allusions to abuse, and really awful sherry.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;First impressions can doom second chances.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bran Roscarrock has been living in the closet all his life. As heir to an expansive family legacy in the town of Porthkennack, old-fashioned ideals of respectability and duty were drummed into him since childhood, and he’s never dared to live—or love—openly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam Ferreira, an old friend of Bran’s brother, Jory, is a disgraced academic desperate to leave his dead-end job. When Jory asks him to take over as curator of a planned exhibition on Edward of Woodstock, the fourteenth-century Black Prince, Sam leaps at the chance to do what he loves and make a fresh start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Bran’s funding the exhibition, and though sparks fly between the two men, they’re not all happy ones. Bran idolises Prince Edward as a hero, while Sam’s determined to present a balanced picture. With neither of them prepared to give ground, a hundred years of war seems all too possible. And if Bran finds out about Sam’s past, his future may not be bright, and their budding romance may be lost to history.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;After decades of unrequited love, this kangaroo will jump at the chance for a date. Any date.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lovelorn kangaroo shifter Hamish Mulherne, drummer for the mega-hit rock band Hunter’s Moon, waited years for the band’s jaguar shifter bassist to notice him. Instead, she’s just gotten married and is in a thriving poly relationship. How is Hamish supposed to compete with that? But with everyone else in the band mated and revoltingly happy, he needs somebody. Since he can’t expect true love to strike twice, he signs up with Supernatural Selection. Because what the hell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Zeke Oz was placed at Supernatural Selection through the Sheol work-release program, he thought he was the luckiest demon alive. But when he seems responsible for several massive matchmaking errors, he’s put on notice: find the perfect match for Hamish, or get booted back to Sheol for good. The only catch? He has to do it without the agency’s matchmaking spells, and Hamish simply will not engage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Zeke starts to believe that the reason all of Hamish’s dates fizzle is because nobody in the database is good enough for him. And Hamish realizes that his perfect match might be the cute demon who’s trying so hard to make him happy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Word count: 84,500; page count: 320&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Does a bear shift in the woods?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, partially. That was what got grizzly shifter Ted Farnsworth into trouble. He wasn’t &lt;i&gt;trying&lt;/i&gt; to break the Secrecy Pact. He just wants people to see the real him. So he signs up with the mate-matching service Supernatural Selection—which guarantees marriage to a perfect partner. Not only will Ted never be lonely again, but once his new beaver shifter husband arrives, they’ll build Ted’s dream wilderness retreat together. &lt;i&gt;Win-win&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quentin Bertrand-Harrington, scion of an incubus dynasty, has abstained from sex since nearly killing his last lover. When his family declares it’s time for him to marry, Quentin decides the only way not to murder his partner is to pick someone who’s already dead. Supernatural Selection finds him the ideal vampire, and Quentin signs the marriage agreement sight unseen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a mix-up at Supernatural Selection contracts Quentin with Ted. What’s Ted supposed to do with an art historian who knows more about salad forks than screwdrivers? And how can Quentin resist Ted’s mouthwatering life force? Yet as they work together to untangle their inconvenient union, they begin to wonder if their unexpected match might be perfect after all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Bad Valentine Book 4. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Compton owns a small but mighty fashion magazine. He already has enough on his plate, between work and, well, work. There’s no room for a kid in his life but when his sister drops her seven-year-old daughter for an extended stay, he has to figure it out. Just before his niece arrives, Nick meets a blazing hot firefighter. They get on like a house a fire and the sex—scorching. Too bad the he disappeared in the morning. Like smoke. Now Nick’s stuck with a kid he doesn’t know how to manage and without the man he’d love to get his hands on again. &lt;br /&gt;Dylan Gil wishes like hell he hadn’t taken his roommates advice and lied about who he was. He’s finally met someone he really likes and can’t stop thinking about. But now he’s too embarrassed to confess that he’s just a second-grade teacher, not a manly firefighter. Good thing that work gets distracting, particularly when one of his brightest students goes to stay with her uncle and all hell breaks loose. Some people shouldn’t be allowed to have kids. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If the term “dad pants” means anything it’s that taking care of children and fashion aren’t compatible. Does that mean these two doomed? Or is this the beginning of forever? &lt;br /&gt;A contemporary gay romantic comedy by Dev Bentham, Temporary Dad features mistaken identity, opposites attracting, a one night stand and some steamy mm romance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Temporary Dad is part of the Bad Valentine collection, along with Hidden Hearts by Clare London, Quill Me Now by Jordan Castillo Price and Love Magic by Jesi Lea Ryan</description>

  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;It’s time to put away silly ideas about whether or not you should be an Alpha and accept that it was never up to you in the first place.  You can’t protect what’s yours unless you claim it and take your rightful place.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Chase Coleman is content with the life he’s made for himself as Sheriff of a sleepy little West Texas town. He might have walked away from his role as the Alpha apparent of his home pride but he didn’t regret making the choice to live as an out gay man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Paxton Summers could see that Chase was the Alpha of the town’s shifters whether he wanted to accept the title or not. Once he realizes that he and the sexy sheriff are fated mates, it becomes his mission to make Chase see he never had to choose between his destiny and being true to himself—because Copper Creek was exactly where he was meant to be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Chase just needs to see that he hadn’t left his future behind at all, instead all along he’d been Chasing Fate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>I’m not a fighter. I never was. So how do I make the one man who might just be worth fighting for see that? &lt;br /&gt;At twenty-five years old, Ford Cornell should have his whole life ahead of him but instead, the would-be artist is drowning in denial and just trying to get through each day. And the boy who once believed life was about following impossible dreams has finally come to accept that it’s really only about surviving a living nightmare… one of his own making. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the bruises are becoming harder to hide. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So is the truth… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I refuse to fall for a guy who won’t accept the truth about who he is or what he wants. Not again… &lt;br /&gt;They say bad things happen in threes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Sherriff Camden Wells, it’s more like fours… or fives… or dozens. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After an ugly lie destroys his career and the man he’d planned to spend the rest of his life with cuts him to the core with the ultimate betrayal, forty-year-old Cam is counting on his new job as sheriff of the quiet town of Pelican Bay to be the fresh start he needs. What he isn’t counting on is meeting a young man who makes him want to break all his own rules. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He wants me to accept something that will cause me to lose everything. I may not have much but it’s something and something is better than nothing… right? &lt;br /&gt;Ford’s gotten used to his role as his older brother’s punching bag and being his mother’s never-ending disappointment. They may not be the Cleavers but family is family and Ford’s seen up close and personal what happens when you don’t have anyone in your corner… or when you go against family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And there’s just no way he’s strong enough to survive that… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nothing about us should make sense but maybe that’s why it does… &lt;br /&gt;Two men… one living a lie and one knocking down the walls of the closet he was forced to live in for so long. When one white-hot encounter leads to another and then another, Ford and Cam are forced to accept that their need for each other isn’t going away anytime soon. But being together means one will need to go against everything he believes in. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So which man will bend and which will break? And what will the truth ultimately reveal? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**This book CAN be read as a standalone, but you may want to consider checking out books 1 and 2 in the series to fully enjoy all the secondary characters you'll meet in this story. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 1 - Locked in Silence &lt;br /&gt;Book 2 - Sanctuary Found</description>

  <description>The big day has finally arrived for Cold Case Captain Kevin Fitzgibbon. He and his fiancé, Jace Lincoln, are getting married in a lavish wedding high atop Boston. Making their special day even more remarkable is a rare appearance by the Northern Lights. The happy couple has said, “I do,” taken hundreds of pictures, and shared their first dance. All is well, until Kevin’s phone rings with news of a mass casualty shooting event a block from their wedding venue. With the suspect still at large, Kevin’s duty as a police officer takes precedence over his long-awaited wedding reception. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Newlywed, Jace Lincoln can’t help feeling like the appearance of the Aurora Borealis is a harbinger of bad things to come. He can’t believe his new husband is leaving him in the middle of their reception, but knows this is what he signed up for as the husband of police captain. Jace sends Kevin off with his blessing and a kiss, praying he won’t go from husband to widower in the same day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Events take an even more unexpected turn when Kevin’s search for the armed suspect leads him to find something truly astonishing: a newborn baby girl left abandoned in a dumpster. In that moment of heartbreaking magic, Fitzgibbon knows he was meant to fight for this tiny soul. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the fight to save the baby girl begins, the prediction made months before by Madam Aurora begins to take shape. Fitzgibbon can only hope that he and Jace are ready for the battle to come. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Museum Curator, Riordan Quinn, is still reeling from the tragic death of his husband a year ago. He knows life must go on for him and his two young daughters, and the first step is a dance recital for Isla, his oldest child. Things start to go awry the morning of the dance when the ballerina can’t find part of her costume. The day goes from bad to worse when his tiny dancer refuses to go onstage and dance with her class. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sitting in the audience, Cold Case Detective, Faulkner Hayes, can’t believe his eyes when a handsome man runs up onstage at his niece’s dance recital and starts dancing with his young daughter, who’s suffering an obvious bout of stage fright. He’s stunned a second time when he finds out that the dancing man is the father of his niece’s best friend. Thrown together later at a party, Faulkner realizes Riordan is tailor-made for him. He’s just not sure what the protocol is for courting recently widowed men. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Faulk makes his move and asks Riordan out, strange things start to happen. Is it just coincidence or the spirit of Riordan’s husband not giving his blessing to this fledgling relationship? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s only one man who can settle this question once and for all. When things seem darkest for Riordan and Faulk, Tennyson Grimm steps in to decipher what Stephen Walker-Quinn is really trying to say to his surviving husband and his tiny dancers. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Cold Case Sergeant, Ronan O’Mara, is set to return to work at the Boston Police Department after the birth of his first child, when a knock at the door brings back a part of his past he thought was gone forever: his father, John. The only thing that Ronan knows about his father is that the man was a no-good drunk who was gone from Ronan’s life before his first birthday. Now that John is back, all he wants is a chance to tell his side of the story. Not surprisingly, Ronan wants no part of this reunion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No one is more stunned by this turn of events than psychic, Tennyson Grimm. He’s been in contact with Ronan’s deceased mother, Erin, since he and Ronan started working together. Surely if there was more to the story about Ronan’s father, Erin would have told him. Caught between a rock and a hard place, Tennyson is left to navigate the minefield of this complicated father-son relationship, while trying to support the man he loves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When John O’Mara finally gets the opportunity to explain where he’s been for the last thirty years and, more importantly, why he stayed away, will Ronan and Tennyson jump in to help him solve the decades old crime that kept him away from his family? Or will Ronan stand by what he’s always believed to be the truth about his father? A truth that might just turn out to be dead wrong. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Nikki:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I left for Cali the night of my graduation with nothing but a pink boa, a pair of strappy gold heels, and my silver eyeshadow from Sally Beauty Supply. I sang for pennies on Hollywood Boulevard in my broke and desperate days. Now at twenty-six, I’ve got more Grammys than Madonna and a growing empire. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fame was everything I expected and nothing that I ever wanted. At the end of the day I’m on my own, with an overbearing manager and security team as my only friends. I made this life, and now I live in it alone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a stalker starts following me, and the paparazzi ambush me outside of a nightclub, I’m at my breaking point. That’s when Fox Lee appears—out of nowhere—tall and gorgeous with salt-and-pepper hair and a wicked smile that shakes me to my core. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He takes my hand and sweeps me away from the flashing lights and screaming fans. He even keeps me safe when the stalker shows up at my house the next day. &lt;br /&gt;I’d wrap myself up in Fox Lee and never come up for air. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But he doesn’t want me. He just wants to be my &lt;i&gt;lawyer.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fox:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nikki Rippon is the most fascinating man I’ve met in years, and I count Robert De Niro as a close friend. I’d like to save Nikki—and savor his cherry pink lips. But I need to keep things cool and professional, even if he’s the smartest, funniest, and sexiest man in my contacts list. He’s at least a decade too young for me, and he needs legal representation against the hellions taking advantage of him—not a boyfriend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When he invites me up to his place, I almost cave. Every minute I spend with him, I fall deeper and deeper. He can make a Lakers jersey look like couture or rock a Prada polo with Jimmy Choo heels. He’s infinitely loyal, utterly hilarious, and more talented than any other musician who’s walked through my doors. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ever since my parents kicked me out at seventeen for being a little too &lt;i&gt;queer,&lt;/i&gt; I haven't let anyone in. I don’t do relationships, especially not with glam pop stars with a closet full of Gucci. But Nikki’s wearing me down, bit by bit. He’s staying at my place, taking us on dates I never expected. And we even manage to escape to my beach home on the East Coast without a single fan noticing—almost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just when things seem perfect, the ghosts of Nikki’s past start to close in on us, threatening the life we’re creating together. It turns out that when you’re spending your nights with the world’s biggest pop star, people can get a little ...jealous. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’d convinced myself Nikki needed a knight in shining armor. But when I find myself trapped in the trunk of a moving car, my hands tied and my mouth gagged, it all becomes crystal clear: Nikki is the savior I always needed. And the only man I’ve ever loved. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Silver Fox is the fourth book in the Bridge to Abingdon series. Each book focuses on one amazing couple, and each can be read as a total standalone. Fox and Nikki have more steam than any other couple in the series! There’s also a bodyguard bestie, a closet full of Prada, and an unforgettable night under the stars. Add a swirl of mystery, a secret boat trip down the coast, and a twist you won’t see coming… and you’ve got Silver Fox. Nikki Rippon and Fox Lee are the soul of Abingdon, and they start off the story of Abingdon with a BANG.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Elias:&lt;br /&gt;I broke Zane Chase’s heart twenty years ago, on the night I left Abingdon. I knew we’d never have a happy ending. I played straight for years. I made my life perfect through sheer force of will—I built a billion dollar company, married a good girl, even had a kid. I hid myself for decades, and I got exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it all came crashing down. My company fired me, the wife ditched my gay a$s and took our daughter with her. The only place to go is home. My first night Abingdon, I run right into Zane. His crystal blue eyes and sculpted body wake something deep inside of me. I need him in my life—and in my bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I offer Zane a cool million to work with me, to build something new in Abingdon—something amazing. I don’t know what the hell I’m doing. I’ve never been with a man before. And I’ve never fallen in love. I thought there were no happy endings, but Zane is showing me that I might be wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when everything seems perfect, my ex drops drops my daughter with me and disappears from both of our lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I’m not just an unemployed a$shole in a small town, I’m also a single dad to a traumatized kid whose mom has vanished. My girl doesn’t trust me, and I desperately need a crash course in parenting. I thought Zane was my second chance at life—but he’s too good to drag into this mess I’ve created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zane:&lt;br /&gt;Elias Spaulding is a total d*ck. He’s rude and presumptuous—seems he never learned any damn manners. He’s got wild ideas, fast cars, and more money than God. He’s everything I should hate. Instead, he’s the most fascinating man I’ve met in years. And deep down, he’s the same boy who stole that first kiss from me in the darkness of my dorm room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beneath his bluster is a man who wants a real life—a home, a family, someone to love. I was never the kind to settle down, not since I left for New York. But something’s telling me that Elias might be worth the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m falling in love with Elias, whether I like it or not. I can see myself here, in Abingdon, building a life with him and his daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dangerous ghost from Elias’ past appears, threatening to ruin everything we’ve built. Elias keeps trying to push me away in the midst of all the drama, but this time, I’m not leaving. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elias Spaulding was my first love, and now he’s my home. I won’t let him go without a fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chase Me Home is the third novel in the Bridge to Abingdon series. Each book focuses on one amazing couple, and each can be read as a fabulous standalone read. Chase Me Home has steamy first-time love scenes, a lot of family drama, some adorable kittens, a British nanny, and a much needed update for Jackson Academy. Elias and Zane are the hope of Abingdon, and they're working hard to bring it into the twenty-first century. Enjoy!</description>

  <description>Ever since Antonio began working as a dancer at Frank’s club, he’s been trying to get Frank’s attention. To others, Frank might not be the ultimate catch, but to Antonio, he’s the man of his dreams. The problem is, Frank has already turned Antonio down out of fear for Antonio’s safety following an abduction and near-death experience. But Antonio is not ready to give up. He is determined to win him over on Valentine’s Day, no matter what he has to do. Even if it requires some unusual help from his friends, Felix and Lane. Nothing is too far for Antonio, not even a botched kidnapping. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dancing in Darkness is a 20k-word novella featuring true love, abductions gone wrong, and a family that may be a bit too extreme. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This novella takes place after the events of In Darkness 3. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Felix and Lane are struggling with just how boring a “normal” life is, so when they get a chance to jump into action, they do so without a second thought—especially since they’re offered a lot of money. The request is simple: find a way to retrieve a watch from police custody. But things are never as easy as they seem. Suddenly, they’re caught in the middle of a family feud that could turn deadly. But no matter what, through kidnappings, car chases, and cooking mishaps, Felix knows that as long as Lane is by his side, they will find a way to set things right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deception in Darkness is 100k words of snark, stripping gone horribly wrong, and true love. Oh, and Felix steals another animal. Of course he does. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Charleston is reeling beneath the onslaught of demons unleashed by the vampire spirit Drugoy and his human host Yuri. Alone and drained almost to the point of death, Gray and Caleb must make their way across a city gone mad in hopes of putting an end to Yuri and Dru. But the other drakul isn’t the only enemy they have to worry about. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After the death of a rogue agent at Gray’s teeth, John’s faith in his lovers has been badly shaken. But when SPECTR Chief Barillo orders the vampire destroyed by any means possible, John and his allies find themselves in a race to find Gray and Caleb before their fellow SPECTR agents. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because their only hope of stopping Yuri and Dru is by working together. And if they fail to unite, the streets of Charleston will run red with blood.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Caught between the worlds of human and drakul, Caleb and Gray must make a fateful choice.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big changes are afoot at SPECTR. John Starkweather, once a hotshot field agent, is now benched. Instead of chasing down demons during Charleston’s biggest outbreak, he’s stuck interviewing exorcists about a previous case. But what at first seems like a busywork assignment takes a darker turn, as John begins to suspect the increase in possessions might not be coincidence, but part of an unseen conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vampire spirit Gray was made to hunt demons and drink their blood. He and his human host, Caleb Jansen, ought to be at the forefront of SPECTR’s field team. But their new partners refuse to let Gray use any of his abilities, let alone actually hunt and fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, Caleb and Gray have allies outside of SPECTR: the only other living drakul, Drugoy and his host Yuri Azarov. Yuri and Dru live by no mortal’s rules, and they can show Caleb and Gray how to do the same…depending on how far they’re willing to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because breaking the rules comes with a cost, and the price of Caleb and Gray’s freedom may be the life of the man they love.</description>

  <description>Detective Bill Quigley fell in love with the familiar Isaac the night they met. But after more than two years, it’s time to admit to himself that Isaac doesn’t return his feelings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isaac knows he’s too broken by his experiences for anyone to fall in love with. Especially someone like Bill, who deserves a partner unplagued by Isaac’s nightmares and doubts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When children go missing from an orphanage, Bill and Isaac must work together to find them. And as years of yearning threaten to ignite into passion, they must decide once and for all whether to take a chance on love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Micah&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Constantine Ross is a cocky, provoking little...&lt;i&gt;yeah.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I swear, I'd think that even if his family's business wasn't my biggest competition.&lt;br /&gt;It's time someone taught the man a lesson or two about life.&lt;br /&gt;At least that's what I tell myself when I offer him a job.&lt;br /&gt;Call it my good deed for the year... maybe the century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now he's in my shop.&lt;br /&gt;In my space.&lt;br /&gt;In my every damn thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In. My. Bed. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And how the hell am I supposed to resist him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Constantine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be the first to admit I've royally screwed up, but what can I say?&lt;br /&gt;I was a stupid teen who lost his dad and spiraled out of control.&lt;br /&gt;Almost a decade later, I'm still trying to make amends.&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I need is my family's arch-nemesis wading into my life like he's got all the answers.&lt;br /&gt;Except... I really need money, and the arrogant jerk offered me a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can deal with Micah's attitude.&lt;br /&gt;My attraction to him? That's different.&lt;br /&gt;He's my boss, not my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;And he's way too old for me.&lt;br /&gt;But God, he's gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;Dominant.&lt;br /&gt;Compelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to want him...&lt;br /&gt;But I can't turn away.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Daniel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suck at relationships and don’t trust anyone, but there are reasons for that. For one thing, every person I’ve ever cared about has let me down. The only recent exception: O’Leary’s town veterinarian...my new best friend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I came to O’Leary for a fresh start. To pare things down to essentials. To forget about the failures in my past. The last thing I need is complications, and most definitely &lt;br /&gt;Not. &lt;br /&gt;A. &lt;br /&gt;Boyfriend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Julian&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve lived in O’Leary my entire life and learned to fly under the radar a long time ago. I do what’s expected, say what’s expected, and keep to myself as much as possible. It’s a hell of a lot simpler spending my time working with animals than trying to interact with actual people. The one unlikely exception: the gorgeous guy who moved to a cabin just outside of town and somehow became my best friend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But friendships are complicated, and one morning I find myself accidentally telling the whole town the biggest lie of my life. Which is how Daniel Michaelson, my very straight, very hot best friend becomes my fake boyfriend, even though he’s most definitely &lt;br /&gt;Not. &lt;br /&gt;My. &lt;br /&gt;Lover. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Lorcán Kennedy is a take-no-prisoner vampire whose grit is tested when slain vampires start showing up in his sector. His investigation reveals a blessed weapon was used in the slayings, which leads him to a rogue hunter with a grudge against vampires. &lt;br /&gt;Christian Wolfe is a no-nonsense hunter who believes the only good vampire is a dead one, but his code of honor keeps his hatred in check. When his integrity is questioned, he will do anything to defend it, including work with his enemy. &lt;br /&gt;Vampire and hunter unite to solve the case, although for very different reasons. Lorcán wants to prove he is worthy of his Regent title once and for all. Christian wants to uncover who is framing him for the vampire deaths. It sounds easy enough, but neither are prepared for the desire that arcs between them when their eyes meet for the first time. When longing glances give way to passionate kisses and scorching touches, these powerful beings will learn that their bond goes beyond mere attraction. It is fate. &lt;br /&gt;Sparks and fangs fly in this second installment of the Genesis Circle, a paranormal romance series written by Nicholas Bella and Aimee Nicole Walker. This book contains explicit material and is intended for adults 18 and older. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>There isn’t a monster D’Angelo Kumar can’t destroy or a crisis he can’t manage until he meets Angel Bai. The insane attraction he feels toward the sexy waiter is unwelcome because D’Angelo doesn’t have room in his life for relationships. A solitary path is the only option for a man like him, but fighting his growing feelings for Angel may be the first battle he can’t win. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Angel’s abilities extend beyond memorizing the menu at D’Angelo’s favorite Italian restaurant, but he knows better than to trust anyone with his secret. When a vision reveals that D’Angelo’s life is in danger, he will risk everything to save him. The only thing scarier than monsters and demons to Angel is never knowing D’Angelo’s touch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To say the demon hunter is reluctant to form a partnership with the psychic is putting it mildly, but D’Angelo needs every advantage he can get when the world’s very existence is threatened. As darkness looms nearer, D’Angelo and Angel’s unexplainable connection grows stronger. For a chance at happiness, the two men will need to call upon unlikely allies for an epic showdown between good and evil. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sexy, witty, and action-packed, Circle of Darkness is the first book in the Genesis Circle paranormal romance series by Nicholas Bella and Aimee Nicole Walker. This book contains sexually explicit material and is intended for adults 18 and older. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Ryder Jameson and Lucien Clarke have a complicated past: Ryder conserves art; Lucien steals it. Their love-hate relationship spans six years and two continents and has endured multiple heists. Hoping to restore his tarnished reputation and heal his jilted heart, Ryder returns home to Cincinnati. When Lucien suddenly reappears in Ryder’s life, the ancient Shang Dynasty artifact isn’t the only prize he wants to claim. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something more sinister than stolen art is stirring. Ryder and Lucien must join forces to untangle a web of secrets, lies, and treachery bigger than either of them expected. Trust won’t come easy, but they’ll need to rely on each other because pulling the wrong thread could lead to their death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it fate that keeps bringing Ryder and Lucky together, or are they merely pawns in someone’s wicked games? Will they play for keeps this time or become collateral damage? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wicked Games is a second-chance romance filled with passion, humor, and intrigue. It’s the second book in the Queen City Rogues series but can be read on its own. Wicked Games contains mature sexual content intended for readers 18 and older.</description>

  <description>Medium and clairvoyant Simon Kincaide owns a Myrtle Beach boardwalk shop where he runs ghost tours, holds séances, and offers private psychic readings, making a fresh start after his abilities cost him his lover and his job as a folklore professor. Jaded cop Vic D’Amato saw something supernatural he couldn’t explain during a shootout several years ago in Pittsburgh and relocated to Myrtle Beach to leave the past behind, still skeptical about the paranormal. But when the search for a serial killer hits a dead end, Vic battles his skepticism to ask Simon for help. As the body count rises, Simon’s involvement makes him a target, and a suspect. But Simon can’t say no, even if it costs him his life and heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When the cards are stacked against you, the Kings will even the odds.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Ward “King” Kingston the role of protector, forged by fire and tragedy, is one he takes seriously. When King is asked to safeguard the son of a four-star general and friend, he is pulled back into the world of government black ops on a mission that raises painful memories from his past. The moment King meets Leo, amid the chaos of a lockdown at a secret black site, it’s clear he’s never faced a challenge like this—one that will test his unwavering sense of control. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Leopold de Loughrey is a misunderstood genius whose anxiety and insecurities are sent into overdrive when he is forcefully recruited to work on a top-secret project. Terrified of what his role as "invaluable asset" means, Leo’s stress leads to disappearances, arguments, and blowups that threaten the project and Leo’s future. King’s arrival is a calm in the storm for Leo and his frenetic thoughts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;King and Leo couldn’t be more different, yet as they navigate the dangers of a secret multi-agency operation and face unknown threats, their differences could be what saves them. Neither man believes a happily ever after is in the cards, but their hearts might just prove them wrong… if they can survive a deadly betrayal.</description>

  <description>Newly-minted Ghost Detective, Jude Byrne, finally has his life in order. He’s got a job he loves, friends he can count on, and a partner he actually likes. Jude’s only problem is the growing attraction between himself and his partner. He knows nothing will sink their partnership quicker than giving in to those urges. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Psychic, Copeland Forbes, is settling nicely into Salem, Massachusetts. He and Jude have formed the perfect partnership, with the former P.I. researching the history of the places they are hired to investigate, while it’s Cope’s job to communicate with the spirits they encounter to either move them on to the other side or work out an amicable arrangement with the people now living in their home. So far, the duo has a perfect record and completely satisfied customers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The detectives’ record is put to the test when teenager, Xavier Lewis, parks his bike outside West Side Magick and asks if Jude and Cope’s fee can be paid via weekly installments of his allowance money. When Jude tells the boy it all depends on the story he has to tell, neither detective is prepared for the tale that spills out of Xavier’s mouth. When the boy tells them about a ghostly woman in white that he thinks is trying to kill him, Jude and Copeland are all in. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The partners soon discover that not all ghosts can be reasoned with and that the risks of dealing with the paranormal are very real indeed. Will the Ghost Detectives be able to solve the mystery of the woman in white or will they become the next victims in her ghost story? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Since the death of his former partner, Tony Abruzzi, at the hands of mob boss, Vito “The Dragon” Dragonni, Cold Case Detective, Ronan O’Mara, has been a shell of his former self. Other than working his shifts at the police station, Ronan is going through the motions of life. The once vital and active cop is reduced to binge-watching trashy shows on Netflix to cope with his loss. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Psychic, Tennyson Grimm, has a secret he’s been forced by the FBI to keep: Tony Abruzzi is alive. Barely eating or sleeping as he tries to cope with the guilt of keeping the truth from Ronan, Tennyson knows it's only a matter of time before his friends stop buying the lies he’s telling to explain his restless nights. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Tony appears to testify at Vito Dragonni’s trial, all hell breaks loose. Accusations fly about who knew Abruzzi was alive and why it was kept a secret from Ronan, who's been struggling to come to terms with the "death" of a man he considered a brother. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Focusing on keeping their loved ones safe and bringing Dragonni to justice for his crimes once and for all, one question remains: Will Ronan be able to forgive Tennyson for lying about Tony’s death? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Bad Valentine Book 3. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accident-prone Ethan has a dating history that reads like a disaster movie script. Strong and silent Kel can’t seem to master the necessary small-talk on a proper date. When they both get signed up anonymously for a Valentines’s night event—"for those with an adventurous spirit but an open diary”—they never imagined they’d be matched. They never imagined the romantic sparks would fly. To be honest, they never imagined they’d survive the week. &lt;br /&gt;A catalogue of disasters dogs the footsteps of their blossoming romance, including a coffee date with food allergies as an added extra, an intimate dinner that strays too close for comfort to chopped chillies, and a sensual massage with hot wax candles that threatens to alert the local fire brigade. &lt;br /&gt;But if they can hold tight to their sweet, surprising, yet single-minded attraction – they might just survive this Valentine’s Day with something very special to look forward to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;******* &lt;br /&gt;This is a totally standalone romantic comedy of 17.5k words in the BAD VALENTINE series. These are lighthearted Valentine's Day shorts by four different authors, each story written with the same opening line: "Nothing good ever came of a Valentine." Check the series page for details of the other stories by Jordan Castillo Price, Dev Bentham and Jesi Lea Ryan. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The ABCs of Spellcraft, #1; Bad Valentine, #2. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What if the words you wrote came true?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellcraft isn’t exactly a respectable business, but it does pay the bills. At least, it &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt;. Unfortunately, Dixon Penn failed his Spellcraft initiation. Instead of working in his family’s shop, he’s stuck delivering takeout orders in his uncle’s beat-up Buick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winning a Valentine’s Day contest at the largest greeting card company in the tri-state area would be just the thing to get his life back on track—but something at Precious Greetings just doesn’t add up. And despite numerous warnings to quit pestering them about his contest entry, he just can’t stop himself from coming back again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t hurt that the head of security is such a hottie. If Dixon had any common sense, he’d be scared of the big, mysterious, tattooed Russian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, no one ever accused him of being too smart….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quill Me Now is part of the lighthearted Bad Valentine collection, along with Love Magic by Jesi Lea Ryan, Hidden Hearts by Clare London, and Temporary Dad by Dev Bentham.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

Unfortunately, magic and love together don’t always mix." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oliver met Derrick while busking in the park, and they hit it off from the start.

To make their family complete, he wants a baby. Despite the bliss, bad memories have come back to haunt him.

Due to Mateo’s emotional breakdown, he’s forced to take a leave of absence.

Can Lance find the zeal he once had to continue his life’s work? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Together, they must search for the answers to restore their faith in their commitment and each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Renewed Faith is book 10 in the second season of the multi-author series about Vale Valley, a small town open to everyone in need of love and a home.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It’s not crazy … it’s just love.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When James almost hits a homeless man on the side of the highway, drenching him in a spray of puddle water, he doesn’t know what to do so he just drives off. He feels guilty but figures the guy will be fine. Besides, he’ll never see him again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until the man shows up at the dining room table at the house where James is has been living after a bad breakup. James is embarrassed and annoyed, especially since his brother keeps comparing him to this guy who looks like a hobo. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bobby has been on a year-long journey to find himself after he lost his mate. He’s walked across the country, relying on the kindness of others, in order to reinforce some sense of good in the universe. &lt;br /&gt;When he is splashed and soaked by a man driving a Lexus he isn’t surprised. He’s never been much of a fan of rich people. But he starts to change his mind when he gets to know all the friendly and generous souls in Vale Valley. The only person in the town who doesn’t seem very friendly is James. The problem is, James is the only person Bobby can’t stop thinking about. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Cupid help these two men find the love they both deserve, or is he crazy for even trying?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or maybe Cupid really does know something about who we belong with after all.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cupid Must Be Crazy is the seventh book in the Vale Valley Valentine's series. If you're looking for a sweet and steamy small town open to everyone in need of love and a home, you've come to the right place. This book contains two hot men, a Valentine’s ball, and little help from Cupid—all leading to male pregnancy, a cuddly baby, and a very happy ever after ending.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Valentine's Inc Book 8. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Valentine’s Day blind date. A spark they didn’t expect. And a secret that might ruin it all. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Malcolm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends are tired of my moping after my ex packed his bags and took off a year ago. I thought I was in love, he obviously wasn’t. In order to get them off my back, I agree to one Valentine’s date that they’ll set up using the company Valentine’s Inc., which two of my friends run. What I don’t expect is the fun, flirty date with my wet dream—a young Johnny Depp lookalike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Levi&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make ends meet, I work for Valentine’s Inc doing what I did to survive on the streets… charm the pants off men. Except, with Valentine’s Inc, the clients have to keep their pants on, which means I only have to do the charming part. It’s an easy job until I find myself on a date where the tables are turned, and I’m charmed instead. Too bad it’s against company rules to get physical with a client. For once, I wouldn’t mind exploring this crazy spark between us for something more. Then again, there’s always tomorrow… when I’m off the clock. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when Levi thinks things might be perfect between them, a run-in with an old friend reveals his difficult past to Malcolm before Levi is ready. Will Malcolm accept it and fully ignite the spark between them? Or will their whirlwind relationship come to a crashing halt?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Kiss Me Tomorrow is a 68k MM romance and is Book 8 in the Valentine's Inc. Series. Ten Authors. One Dating Agency. A world of love possibilities.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Valentine's Inc. Book 6. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clark ~ I wouldn’t change anything about my life. Adopting the child my sister gave birth to is the best decision I ever made. For all of us. Choosing to work for myself so that I can be an active part of his life—a no brainer. After four years, though, my friends may be right. It’s time to at least date if my crush on the dad, the off-limits man wearing the wedding band, at my son’s preschool is any indication. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bailey ~ Life hasn’t gone exactly as planned with my fiancé dying before we ever had a chance to get married. My days are filled with client requests and spreadsheets, but I’ll never take for granted how fortunate I am to work from home and be here for my daughter. Pursuing the dream to have a child, even if alone, is more fulfilling than I’d ever dreamed possible. Our little life seemed like enough until recently when I witnessed my high school sweetheart, Vaughn, falling in love and finally getting his happily ever after. Maybe he’s right, maybe it’s time to take off the ring and date again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When two men take the plunge and sign up with Valentine’s Inc., is it possible they can find a love match on the first try? And if they do, can insta-love withstand the pressure of real life when two automatically means four? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Valentine’s Inc. &lt;br /&gt;Need a date? Want to impress your boss or maybe your ex? &lt;br /&gt;Looking for the love of your life? &lt;br /&gt;Give us a call for all your dating needs! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dakota~ &lt;br /&gt;Working for Valentine’s Inc. isn’t exactly my favorite job in the world, but it’s not bad either. I need the extra cash, anyway, so it’s kinda perfect. The real problem is that I never expected to meet someone I actually like, and now that I’m fake dating him for a whole weekend, it’s hard to separate the job from my feelings. Especially when Poe looks at me like he really cares. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Poe~ &lt;br /&gt;My sister’s getting married, and all of our friends are on my case about having a date for the wedding. Unfortunately, I think I have the not-dateable gene, so I come up empty. And when I find out my ex is going to be there, I contact Valentine’s Inc. in desperation. I had no idea they were going to send someone as perfect as Dakota. Too bad he’s only pretending to like me because I think I want to date him—for real. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dakota and Poe need to navigate through their feelings and figure out if they can find true love together or if everything they feel for one another is simply just for show. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A Valentine Romance&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Standalone MPreg Romance in the Vale Valley Series&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;One alpha dragon… &lt;br /&gt;Meets another alpha dragon… &lt;br /&gt;And can’t even see the omega who’s right by his side—the one who’s been loving him for years. &lt;br /&gt;Unless they realize they all three belong together—and always have. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Brent&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had found my calling at the Vale Valley Repertory Theater. Not as an actor—my plans aren’t that grand—but as a stagehand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve worshipped Aidan since I met him. When Tyson joins the cast, it’s all I can do to contain my lust. If only they’d realize I’m here, watching them. Waiting in the wings. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Aidan&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hooking up with another alpha dragon is playing with fire. As much as I adore Tyson, I’m afraid his passion for me could burn out overnight, leaving me heartbroken and alone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And if I stick with Tyson, I might never get the chance to pursue the quiet warlock stagehand, an omega I’ve had my eye on for months now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Tyson&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I took the role in the February play at the Vale Valley Repertory Theater, I never expected to meet not one, but two of my soulmates there. But what will we do when this play is over and our lives change again? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And what will we do if that pregnancy test Brent just took is positive? If we can figure out how to stay together, will our love take flight? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Waiting in the Wings&lt;/i&gt; is book 2 in the second season of the multi-author series about Vale Valley, a small town open to everyone in need of love and a home. It's a shifter MMM Mpreg romance featuring two gorgeous dragon alphas who know how to bring the knotty heat, a warlock omega who needs the magical love his alphas have to give, and a surprise gift that will warm your heart, all set in the mystical, magical, love-filled Vale Valley! Pull up a chair, grab a box of chocolates, and settle in for this sexy and sweet standalone Valentine’s Romance read!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Valentine's Inc. Book 4. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; I always bolt after a hookup, so why can’t I stop messaging Oliver for seconds…and thirds... &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Austin &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I should’ve thrown the invitation to my ex’s wedding straight into the trash. Who gets married on Valentine’s Day anyway? Gross. When my best friend does me a solid by getting me a date through Valentine’s Inc. dating service, the last person I expect to show up on my doorstep is the vibrant man with the lace panties and a belly button ring who I hooked up with and ghosted six months earlier. But the more time I spend with Oliver, the more I find myself craving his presence. Normally, I’d kiss and run, but I’m dying to see where things might go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Oliver &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I don’t like schedules or expectations. I live for the sheer experience of each day. And if there’s anyone who could use a good dose of my carefree philosophy, it’s Austin. I didn’t expect to see him again after he disappeared off the hookup app, but the chance to be his fake boyfriend for his ex-boyfriend’s wedding is way too much fun to pass up, especially since I’m getting paid for it. Neither of us are looking for serious, but that doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy a little fun before he bolts again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***This is a 30k low angst, high heat novella***</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A groundhog, a cupid, and a koala walk into a bar…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The worst part of bearing the &lt;i&gt;Cupid Curse&lt;/i&gt; is that alpha cupid Roberto spends his days and nights helping others find the kind of love he knows he’ll never experience himself. When he moves to Vale Valley, he assumes his life will continue unchanged—no matter what his private hopes might be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Daniel, an alpha groundhog shifter, recently scored a career-building job at the local human television station a few towns over, so he moved to Vale Valley to be near family. Little does he know that Vale Valley holds not only secrets but also his true mates. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Omega koala shifter Cam loves living in Vale Valley. As the late-shift bartender at The Bar, the local shifter hangout, he’s able to make ends meet while doing something he enjoys.

  <description>Valentine's Inc. Book 2. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rough and tumble biker, Harold Jackson, has no interests beyond making sure his grandmother, MiMi, has everything she needs, stepping into the boxing ring every once in a while, and working his life away in his automotive garage, Jackson’s Auto. When a sassy little number walks into his life through an open bay door, Jackson doesn’t know what to think. Westley is witty, adorable, and has no qualms about going head to head with him. Then Westley announces that he works for Valentine’s Inc. and has been hired to help Jackson jump back into the dating scene. Will he dig his heels in or open himself up to find out what he’s been missing? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Work, school, work, repeat. Westley’s life feels like it’s on a constant loop running from one job to the next trying to make ends meet and pay for his online classes. Being a dating specialist for Valentine’s Inc. isn’t the most steady work, but it’s always an adventure. Only he never imagined someone’s grandmother hiring him to woo her grandson out of his shell. Jackson isn’t like anyone he’s ever been on a date with, for work or pleasure, but he’s determined to help the rough man let out more of the tender side he keeps under wraps, even if Westley can’t keep him for himself. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description> Like your favorite Hallmark movie...only way more gay.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An omega too busy helping others to find his own happily ever after...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nathan Willis doesn't need an alpha. At least, that's what he keeps telling himself. He's content enough crafting magical clothing for the people of Vale Valley, thank you very much. When a spell backfires, he becomes part of his very own Cinderella story--now if only he could forget the handsome alpha who mistook him for someone else... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sweet-toothed alpha looking for a place to call home...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A wolf without a pack, Caius Valens longs for someone to treasure and take care of. It's hard to find someone to get close to when they don't know you're a shifter. His travels lead him to Vale Valley and the local Chocolatier's Gala, where he falls into his very own fairy tale. Right down to the mysterious beauty disappearing at the stroke of midnight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can they find their way back to one another before the spell breaks? And will both men find themselves along the way?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Welcome back to Vale Valley, where love is always in the air and magic lies around every corner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;That Magical Moment&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in the Vale Valley Valentine's series. If you're looking for a sweet and steamy small town open to everyone in need of love and a home, you've come to the right place. This book contains magical clothing, incredible edible sculptures, way more than a dozen roses, and a feel-good happily ever after. Grab a glass of wine, a box of chocolate, and curl up with this heartwarming holiday read. </description>

  <description>Valentine's Inc. Book 1. &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;"When he kisses me, I feel like I’m home. Like I’ve found something I’ve been looking for my entire life.”&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a huge investor says his company is interested in funding Clay's latest project he's thrilled. At least he is until he realizes the investor not only believes Clay is gay but wants him to bring his boyfriend along on a Valentine’s Day ski weekend to pitch the project to the rest of the board. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Trevor’s best friend Cassie tells him she can’t find anyone to go on a ski weekend with Valentine’s Inc.‘s newest client he agrees to go. After all, he owes Cassie big time and her job as the matchmaking services branch manager means a lot to her. Plus, it won’t hurt him to pretend to be a straight guys boyfriend for a weekend if it gets him a free ski trip, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trevor is the perfect boyfriend, and it isn’t long before the lines between pretend and real blur causing Clay to wonder if maybe he isn’t quite as straight as he always assumed he was. Neither man is sure what is real and what’s for show, but one thing Trevor knows is that when Clay kisses him it doesn’t feel pretend at all; when he kisses him it feels like he means it.</description>

  <description>Valentine's Inc. Book 7. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newspaper reporter, Granger Galloway, is in charge of the Valentine’s Bazaar, an annual fundraiser for the LGBTQ community of Salem, Massachusetts. This year, no one has volunteered to man the Bazaar’s hottest attraction: The Kissing Booth. After being turned down by every gay and straight man he knows, Granger does the unthinkable and hires the pros at Valentine’s Inc. to send him the perfect fake boyfriend to man the booth. The problem now is how to explain the gorgeous man kissing the mayor’s lips off is a Rent-A-Hunk! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lennox MacArthur looks like a model straight off the cover of a Highland romance novel, kilt and all. When he’s hired by Granger to be his Valentine's weekend boyfriend and man the kissing booth for charity, he figures it will be an easy gig. He never counted on losing his heart to the awkwardly adorable reporter. His conundrum is that he’s kissing every cop, fireman, witch, bored housewife, and granny in town except the one man who stole his heart on sight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Granger mistakes Lennox’s true feelings for part of their fake boyfriends act, will it ruin his one chance at true love or will Granger land the man of his dreams if he sets aside his pride and takes his turn in line at the kissing booth? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Best friends in high school, football hero and alpha Chris, voted most likely to succeed, and shy omega Tak made a promise to one another on prom night—a promise to marry each other if they were both single when they turned thirty. But they hadn’t planned on the twists and turns of life that took them entirely out of one another’s worlds. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Chris’s birthday has come and gone when an invitation catches up to him for a party for Tak’s thirtieth. Chris’s parents’ deaths forced him to quit college to take a job and pay their medical bills and other debts. Instead of a lawyer, he’s a truck driver. Quite a change from his original plans. What will his old friend think? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tak’s life has changed as well. He’s developed a great physique and become a successful antique store owner.

  <description>A Christmas Mpreg Romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When this alpha and omega meet, it’s love at frost sight! &lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;Omega Slade Webster has been on the run for years from his abusive ex. He and his young son found a home in Vale Valley and found happiness making sweet, delectable treats for the town. Seriously, you should try them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what’s not so sweet, is that Slade is lonely. He’d love to settle with an alpha who would treat him right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like he’ll have to spend another Christmas alone. That is until he caters his son’s Nutcracker performance at the Vale Valley Event Center and meets a cop who’s just as interested in him as he is about his donuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know what they say, the way to an alpha’s heart is through his stomach. Especially if that alpha is a cop and you make legendary donuts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except that Zach Beau isn’t a cop. He went to the police academy, sure, but after he moved to Vale Valley for his ailing mother, he took a job as a security guard for the event center. It’s not that exciting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is until he tries Slade’s donuts. And he can’t wait to taste more donuts and the omega. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he stays late to help Slade clean up after the performance, one thing leads to another, and suddenly Slade may be carrying a special gift of his own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But can their Christmas magic last? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;O Little Town of Vale Valley is the tenth book in a multi-author series about Vale Valley, a small town open to everyone in need of love and a home. Each installment can be read as a standalone.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s perfect for readers who love stories with second chances, beautiful dreams between two men, male pregnancy, cute babies, and amazing HEAs. It will leave you singing!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A Shifter MMM Mpreg Romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their love can save him from a cold life..&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An Omega on the Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All his life, bobcat-shifter omega Max Kimbrough knew his role: be bred to the domineering alpha who controlled the New York pack. But when the time came to fulfill that obligation, Max couldn’t stand the thought of a life without love. So he fled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now he’s on the run, and the entire New York pack is tracking him, all the way into Pennsylvania. Max knows they’ll catch him—and when they do, his punishment will be severe. But then he stumbles into a small town, and wonder of wonders, his old pack passes it by. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two Alphas in need of a Third&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alphas Kord Harmon and Elijah Baker love their life together—but they both agree that it could be even better with a third and with the chance to build a family. So when Max races into their lives, they jump at the chance to help him escape his old pack. With them, Max finally has a chance to come in from the cold of his unhappy life and to enjoy the warmth of real love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Max’s life until now has been traumatic, and Kord and Elijah aren’t at all sure they have what it takes to help him overcome his past. Together, they’ll all have to learn if the love of two good alphas—and the magic of one small town—can heal Max’s wounds…and if they’ll ever be able to build the family they all long for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Omega, It’s Cold Outside is part of a multi-author series about Vale Valley, a small town open to everyone in need of love and a home. Each installment can be read as a standalone.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a shifter MMM Mpreg romance featuring two gorgeous alphas who know how to bring the knotty heat, an omega who needs the love his alphas have to give, and a surprise gift that will warm your heart, all set in the mystical, magical, love-filled Vale Valley!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes the best things in life begin with a blizzard and a cup of hot chocolate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;World famous athlete River is not your typical alpha, which made finding a mate far from easy. As a professional skier he owns the slopes and wears a confidence not found among the social-normative omega. When an injury risks his career, he hobbles back to his family cabin to regroup and recuperate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bestselling mystery author Forrest has had romance troubles of his own. After yet another breakup for not being “alpha enough,” Forrest spontaneously decides to rent a cabin outside the small town of Mapleville where he will both get away from the city and complete an overdue novel, effectively getting his agent off his back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;River was expected to spend the week alone in his family cabin, unaware his cousin Maria had already rented out the place. When sexy novelist Forrest shows up, they instantly combust, first in anger and then in lust. One cup of hot cocoa as the snow begins to intensify becomes two, becomes a weekend trapped with each other, their own insecurities, and Forrest’s cat Snowflake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the snow lets up and they go their separate ways, neither of them know that River isn’t leaving alone—he is carrying Forrest’s baby. Can two stubborn men find their way back to each other and create their own happily ever after?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; Hot Cocoa with his Omega is a chocolatey sweet with knotty heat male pregnancy romance featuring a sexy skier, a smoldering author, and a fluffy white ball of fur who loves to steal hearts.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Fame isn’t always what it is cracked up to be.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alpha Lucas loves being a chef. It is his calling. Unfortunately, his calling comes with a side of being famous. Lucas can’t even go to a simple craft fair without having hordes of people swarming him, wanting an autograph, a recipe, a photo op. Professionally, he has the world by the balls, but personally, he never can be sure if someone wants him for him or for his fame and that makes for a very lonely existence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega Harrison was born in Mapleville and raised there by his grandfather after his mother died far too young and his father rejected him, choosing to search out fame over his own son. Harrison likes his life, even if, after the passing of his grandfather, it is an almost solitary existence. Handcrafting beautiful furniture from wood pays his bills, but his true love is creating beautiful art pieces from the random fallen branches and logs he finds in the woods behind his house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Harrison drops an empty box on the way to his truck after a successful unjuried craft show, Lucas can’t help but be intrigued. The sexy woodworker agrees to a date before they both leave town. The date goes better than expected, and Harrison leaves in the morning unknowingly pregnant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas immediately feels the loss of the omega he thinks of as his and when an opportunity arises to shoot a television show in Mapleville, the town Harrison had mentioned being from, Lucas jumps at the chance to reconnect. The only problem is, after Harrison’s father rejected him, he is pretty against having anything to do with fame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Tasting his Omega is a super sweet with some knotty heat non-shifter male pregnancy romance with a guaranteed happy ever after.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Whatever happens at Mardi Gras stays at Mardi Gras—unless you leave there pregnant.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;When omega Brent accepts his future stepfather’s all-expense paid trip to NOLA to meet his future half-brother, Jaxon, he anticipates they will hang out together, drink a little too much, and collect beads. What he doesn’t expect is for Jaxon to fly out of town as soon as he arrives, leaving him with an apartment full of mooching guests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alpha Joaquim is nomadic by nature, taking one traveling nursing job after another, never growing roots. After his last day working in NOLA, he decides to burn some of his restless energy and explore the town. The second he sees Brent on the balcony, he knows he needs to meet the sexy nerd who captured his attention. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After one steamy night, both are hooked. Unfortunately, fate has other plans—a fire at Jaxon’s apartment calls Brent away, and a misplaced note ruins all chances of them reconnecting—or does it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Mardis Gras with his Omega is a super sweet with some knotty heat non-shifter mpreg romance.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>An MM Shifter Mpreg Romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can a cheery reindeer omega help heal a grinchy snow leopard?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Max Drum&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max is a snow leopard alpha trying to forget a painful childhood. He left his hometown at 19, settled in Vale Valley, and never looked back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By day, he's a hard-working carpenter. By night, he's an aspiring novelist. He's happy living a solitary life. Or so he thinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, he meets Ren. The thought of relying on anyone emotionally sends Max into a panicky tailspin, but he can't resist Ren's scent, nor his delightfully delicious crepes, so they decide on a casual relationship full of heat and passion. When tragedy strikes, the blurred lines are tested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another complication arises when Max’s brother begs him to forgive their father for inflicting so much misery on them as children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does he have the faith and courage to take the leap into the unknown? And can Ren help him see the true meaning of Christmas? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Ren Svenson&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ren, a reindeer omega, is all about holiday cheer, at least at first glance. Rejected by his reindeer herd as a child, he settled in Vale Valley and is now on his way to realizing his dreams after opening his very own creperie, Sweet Bites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s been content to dabble in casual affairs, but something changes when he gets a taste of Max, a handsome and brooding snow leopard omega. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misfortune brings them closer than they intended, and when he finds out about their own special Christmas bundle of joy, he has to consider how to navigate their relationship going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can he learn to trust again and let Max into his heart? Or will his childhood rejection continue to cripple his ability to commit? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;His Christmas Lullaby is the sixth book in a multi-author series about Vale Valley, a small town open to everyone in need of love and a home. Each installment can be read as a standalone.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It features a sassy omega, a brooding alpha, delicious crepes, and enough holiday spirit to last you all year! Grab your hot cocoa, snuggle up on the couch, and settle in for a knotty, heartwarming holiday read!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Attending a Valentine’s Day wedding solo, when your “plus one” just dumped you, is about at romantic as a visit to the dentist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid hesitates to accept the invitation to his college roommate—and onetime lover’s midweek wedding, but at least he has an enviable date in a hotshot lawyer, Topher. Until, after Reid’s bought their plane tickets and made all the plans, Topher dumps him. Rather than stay home and mope, he chooses the possible lesser evil and heads for Mapleville. He’ll deal with his misery and the snowball of ways his life is falling apart when he gets home. One thing for sure, he’s not going to make important decisions based on the vagaries of an unreliable love life. Maybe the good things of life are just not meant for him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kayson lives a good life, by most accounts. He works with his aunt at her local florist shop creating beautiful arrangements and spreading sunshine through botanicals. He lives in a town he adores. He has the finances to live peacefully without financial stress. The only problem is, he is lonely. He longs for a mate, someone to spend his life with, raise a family with and in small-town Mapleville, there just wasn’t anyone who fit the bill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Knox and his future bride, Celeste, hired Vivian’s Roses to do their wedding flowers, it appeared to be just a typical gig and then bridezilla came out. Between switching orders and outbursts there was nothing more he wanted than to have the wedding be over and done with. Until a coffee shop encounter with Reid turned his world on its axis. Instant chemistry and a connection like none he’d experienced before had him wanting time to slow giving him the opportunity to convince Reid to stay in Mapleville and be his omega, his mate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Roses for His Omega is Valentine’s novella filled with enough sweetness to cause cavities, a touch of knotty heat, and enough love to go around.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A Mapleville Christmas Novella: MM Non Shifter Alpha/Omega Mpreg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All he wants for Christmas is a safe place to have his baby. Santa has other ideas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Pierce finds out the couple he is carrying a baby for is backing out of the arrangement, he has very mixed feelings. Ecstatic to be no longer legally obligated to give up the baby he has long since thought of as his, he’s also terrified he’ll be unable to provide for his new little treasure. Almost eight months pregnant, he sets off to find refuge at his grandmother's house, back in the town he called his own many years earlier, the town where he found and lost his one and only love, Rhone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rhone has a good life—an amazing career doing what he loves and a beautiful home. But even after the passage of many years, he still longs for the one thing he no longer has. Pierce, the omega who got away. After his family “moved” in the middle of the night to avoid his father’s gambling debts, Pierce never returned, leaving a vacant place in Rhone’s heart until one day when Pierce shows up at the diner where their love began. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All the feelings as well as the lust returned the moment they saw each other, only this time they weren’t two young men with no responsibilities. This time they had a third to think about, the sweet baby growing inside Pierce. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Christmas with His Omega is a holiday novella with sweetness, heat, and more than one Christmas Miracle. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>An M/M Non-Shifter Mpreg Romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nothing is simple when you’re dating a single father.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I told myself after my alpha passed away that I might not ever find another. I would raise my son Dane the best I knew how and, when, years later, our family and friends were still acting as if I should mourn forever, I decided to move from The Netherlands to start over in the United States. My little guy deserved a bright future where he wasn’t constantly being asked if he missed a dad he didn’t even remember. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t do it with the intent of finding another alpha. After all, most omegas were lucky to find one to fall in love with, and I’d had mine. But when I saw Link, I knew he was mine. My true mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The moment Gustav walked into the room, and I took in his scent, my heart knew he was mine and there would never be another for me. It was perfect. Except his son disliked me on sight. Now I have no idea how to move on with my mate when someone so important to him disapproves. But I’m not going to give up. I’ve found not only my omega, but my family, my future. One I hope we can all share. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Alpha’s Santa-Kissed Omega is a MM, Mpreg, non-shifter holiday romance with a strong, kind alpha, an intelligent loving omega, an adorable little boy who isn’t sure about his new situation, and a baby on the way. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When a reclusive psychic shows up looking for Jude Byrne in his adopted hometown of Salem, Massachusetts, the private investigator’s walls go up instantly. Psychic or not, this mysterious man knows secrets about Jude’s past that are better left buried in the New Mexico desert. Stranger still is the personality change that comes over the flirty P.I. after he meets the newcomer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Psychic Copeland Forbes is a man on the edge. The once popular and well-respected medium has lived in seclusion since an attack by a former student has shaken his confidence in his abilities. Sickened by an ailment no doctor can diagnose, he travels from his home in Louisiana to seek out the one man he believes he can help him, if the rumors are true. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Faced with an enemy possessing powers greater than either man has ever faced alone, will Jude and Copeland decide to work together to defeat this dark magick? Or will both men continue on as they are now, ghosts of themselves? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Rav Miller looked into the terrified, intelligent eyes of the chocolate Labrador on death row, and knew he’d do anything to save him. When the dog, Sammy, escapes and heads to Mad Creek, Rav follows. Mad Creek. The town had become legendary in Rav’s mind after he’d met that bizarre group last year. Rav dismissed his crazy suspicions back then, but when he arrives in Mad Creek, he knows it’s true. Dog shifters exist, and apparently they all live in the California mountains. It’s enough to blow a bad boy’s mind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sammy has something in common with Rav—neither one of them trusts people. After Sammy’s abuse as a dog, he particularly dislikes tough-looking men like Rav. But when Sammy gets a chance to work with rescued dogs at the new Mad Creek shelter, his deep compulsion to help others overcomes his fear. Rav and Sammy bond over saving strays. If they can each find the courage to let someone else in, they might find their way to love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sheriff Lance Beaufort doesn’t like humans moving into Mad Creek, especially not the tattooed and defiant Rav. When Rav starts a rescue shelter, the town thinks he’s wonderful! But Lance isn’t fooled. He doesn’t buy Rav’s innocent act for one second. How much does Rav know about the quickened? What is his game? And why did he have to show up now, when Lance and the other town leaders are overwhelmed by all the new quickened pouring in? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rav knows how to save a life. But can he save an entire town? Can he rescue Mad Creek? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is an 80,000 word novel, book #4 in the "Howl at the Moon" series. It features a new couple and can be read as a standalone, but we recommend reading the series in order.</description>

  <description>Dr. Jason Kunik is working on the most earth-shattering genetics project ever, DNA mapping of a new species, the quickened—dogs who can shift into human form. The problem is, no one knows the quickened exist and Jason can’t betray them by publishing his studies. When he moves to Mad Creek to continue his research in a town full of quickened, all he wants is peace, quiet, and to be allowed to bury himself in his work. Perhaps if he figures how out the mutation is activated, he can silence his own inner dog forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milo is a hospice comfort dog who has bonded with, and lost, many beloved patients in his life. He intuitively understands sickness and pain on a spiritual level most can’t see. When he gains the ability to become a man, he thinks he finally has everything he ever wanted. But being a man isn’t the same thing as being loved, and taking shelter in Mad Creek isn’t the same thing as finding a home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a mysterious illness hits Mad Creek and threatens all the quickened in town, it’s up to the scientist and the comfort dog to figure out what it is and how to stop it. Along the way they might discover that true love is possible—if you wish upon a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the third book in the “Howl at the Moon” series, but it can be read as a stand-alone.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An Alpha wolf and an omega swan can’t be fated mates… Right?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abandoned by his swan herd and lost in a snowstorm, Kellan has nowhere to go. When he’s near death, he’s discovered by a wolf shifter in the woods surrounding a mysterious town filled with magic and hope. Could there also be love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vic, the owner of Vale Valley Inn and Restaurant, has been alone since a virus claimed the lives of most of his pack. He’s found acceptance and built a good life for himself in the beautiful town that has become his home. Still, facing another Christmas without a mate is heartbreaking, even if he’s accepted that he’ll never find his true wolf omega.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Vic rescues Kellan, he plans to do anything he can to help the skittish man forge a new life in Vale Valley. He’s all too familiar with having to start over. But as they grow closer, something else starts happening that he’s not familiar with—the mating pull and a swan’s heat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Swan for Christmas is the fourth book in a multi-author series about Vale Valley, a small town open to everyone in need of love and a home. Each installment can be read as a standalone. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mpreg romance story features an omega virgin desperate for love, a lonely Alpha who is perplexed by the mechanics of nesting and a whole lot of hurt/comfort and smexy times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Deputy Roman Charsguard survived Afghanistan where he lost his best friend—his K-9 handler James. Roman was a military dog until two years ago when he developed the ability to shift into a human. It’s not easy to learn how to be a man. He found a place to live in Mad Creek, a haven for the secret world of dog shifters. Finding a reason to live has been harder. That is, until a certain human walks into the Mad Creek Sheriff’s office and starts making trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt Barclay has the worst luck. First he was shot in a SWAT drug raid, then he was sent as DEA investigator to Mad Creek, a little town in the California mountains. Matt’s job is to keep a lookout for illegal drug farms, but nobody in the town wants him there. And then there’s Roman, Matt’s erstwhile baby-sitter. He’s the hottest guy Matt’s ever seen, even if he is a bit peculiar. If the town doesn’t kill him, sexual frustration just might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The town is counting on Roman to prevent Matt from learning about dog shifters, Matt’s counting on Roman to be his work partner and tell him the truth, and Roman’s trying to navigate love, sex, and a whole lot of messy human emotions. Who knew it was so complicated to walk like a man?</description>

  <description>August 1939. Roger Miller and Jack O’Brien have been close since childhood. By the time they realize there’s more between them than friendship, Jack is leaving their sleepy Iowa town for college. But they console themselves knowing he’ll be home for Christmas. Right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is Christmas before they see each other again, but that Christmas comes six years and a world war later. Aged, beaten, and shaken by combat, they’re not the boys they were back then, but their feelings for each other are stronger than ever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Neither know the words to say everything they’ve carried since that peacetime summer kiss, though. Even as they stand in the same room, there’s a thousand miles between them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But maybe that’s some distance the little angel in Roger’s rucksack can cross. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This 24,000 word novella is part of the multi-author Christmas Angel series, and can be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>Sheriff Lance Beaufort is not going to let trouble into his town, no sir. Tucked away in the California mountains, Mad Creek has secrets to keep, like the fact that half the town consists of ‘quickened’—dogs who have gained the ability to become human. Descended on both sides from Border Collies, Lance is as alert a guardian as they come. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tim Weston is looking for a safe haven. After learning that his boss patented all of Tim’s work on vegetable hybrids in his own name, Tim quit his old job. A client offers him use of her cabin in Mad Creek, and Tim sees a chance for a new start. But the shy gardener has a way of fumbling and sounding like a liar around strangers, particularly gorgeous alpha men like Sheriff Beaufort. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lance’s hackles are definitely raised by the lanky young stranger. He’s concerned about marijuana growers moving into Mad Creek, and he’s not satisfied with the boy’s story. Lance decides a bit of undercover work is called for. When Tim hits a beautiful black collie with his car and adopts the dog, its love at first sight for both Tim and Lance’s inner dog. Pretending to be a pet is about to get Sheriff Beaufort in very hot water. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>After the hard winter of 1888 ended Alby Boyle’s work as a Nebraska ranch hand, he returned to New York City in search of his long-lost family. His mother and brothers are nowhere to be found, however, and after Alby’s years of absence, Five Corners no longer feels like home. His prospects seem as dim as the nighttime alleys. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Alby pauses to admire an angel ornament in a department store window’s Christmas display, he meets Xeno Varnham-Summerfield. Wealthy, handsome, and enthusiastic, Xeno brings Alby some temporary cheer. But for Alby to achieve his dreams of love and a real home, well, that may take a bit of holiday magic.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Being a fugitive in the old west shouldn’t be this much fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 1860. Robby Riverton is a rising star on the New York stage. But he witnesses a murder by a famous crime boss and is forced to go on the run--all the way to Santa Fe. When he still hasn't ditched his pursuers, he disguises himself as a mail order bride he meets on the wagon train. Caught between gangsters that want to kill him, and the crazy, uncouth family of his "intended", Robby's only ally is a lazy sheriff who sees exactly who Robby is -- and can't resist him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trace Crabtree took the job as sheriff of Flat Bottom because there was never a thing going on. And then Robby Riverton showed up. Disguised as a woman. And betrothed to Trace’s brother. If that wasn’t complication enough, Trace had to find the man as appealing as blueberry pie. He urges Robby to stay undercover until the danger has passed. But a few weeks of having Robby-Rowena at the ranch, and the Crabtree family will never be the same again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damn, what a kerfuffle. If only Trace can get rid of the fugitive while hanging on to his own stupid heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes the ones who got away never really did…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;Omega Bryce, stuck in a dead-end job that barely makes ends meet, doesn’t have time to act as executor for his dearly departed uncle’s estate—especially since it means going back to Vale Valley, home of many of his best (and long-past) memories. He’s even more unwilling to let his uncle down. But when Bryce arrives only to discover the lawyer he needs to meet with has closed up shop for the holidays, he decides to stay in his uncle’s cabin for a few days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alpha Houston had no intention of ever returning to Vale Valley after he joined the Coast Guard nearly a decade earlier. But the news that he’s been named Sal’s executor draws him back. He decides to stay at the cabin and is shocked when he returns with groceries to find Bryce, his old crush, looking and smelling every bit as delicious as Houston remembered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alpha Dante never left Vale Valley—not that it mattered, since both his hearts took off years ago. When Sal passes and names him executor of the estate, it’s like a door finally closing on that chapter of his life. After all, why would either Houston or Bryce ever return? When he sees them again, though, he feels his past has returned and is being dangled in front of him as a possible future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three men fall back into their old friendship with ease—and the lust they felt all those years ago is only magnified. This time, though, they don’t ignore it, allowing the magic of the season to thrust them into what they always truly wanted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with adult commitments looming and so much time lost, is it too late for their happily ever after?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; Twice as Joyful is part of a multi-author series about Vale Valley, a small town open to everyone in need of love and a home. Each installment can be read as a standalone.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nestle up with your cup of cocoa and enjoy this MMM non-shifter super sweet with knotty omegaverse second-chance romance featuring three reunited best friends, some mistletoe mischief, and a surprise gift that will warm your heart, all set in the mystical, magical, love-filled Vale Valley!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Like your favorite Hallmark Christmas movie...only way more gay.&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A Dragon In Denial...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sebastian Wallace spread his wings (literally) and left Vale Valley for business school in the city the moment he was able. Ambitious and full of big ideas, he wanted to find his own place in the world. With an MBA under his belt and a startup business venture in New York, things are looking up. Until he gets the call that his mother has passed away and left him The Dozing Dragon, her bed and breakfast, in the will. Sebastian returns to his hometown, hoping to make it a quick trip. But when he reconnects with a sweet omega in the Valley, everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A Haunted Omega...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Sterling can see things no one should. In a town full of shifters and other paranormals, you'd think seeing ghosts would be no biggie. Afraid of his own power, Will does his best to live a "normal" life and keeps himself busy at the local garden shop. But things are starting to change in Vale Valley. The yearly fireworks show ended five years ago when a stray rocket sent the place up in flames. And now The Dozing Dragon's sudden closure fills Will with dread for what might come next. When the owner's son returns to town, dare he hope for a better future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Sebastian's help, can they save the Dozing Dragon and bring back the fireworks in time for Christmas? And does Will's secret power hold the key to both?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Mated Under The Mistletoe is the first book in a multi-author series about Vale Valley, a small town open to everyone in need of love and a home. Each installment can be read as a standalone. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It contains way too many dirty jokes, plants with a mind of their own, mpreg, and more sweets than Willy Wonka's factory. Pull up a chair, grab your hot cocoa, and settle in for this heartwarming holiday read!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>When John Trent, a dedicated member of the new Bow Street Runners, finds an exquisite carved angel floating in the Thames, he can’t stop thinking about it. He tracks down its creator, a sad and quiet young sculptor. But neither the angel nor the sculptor is done with John just yet. The blasted angel refuses to leave him be, behaving not at all like an inanimate object should. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alec Allston is resigned to the fact that his love will ever be a river that flows out and never flows in. All he wanted to do was create a special gift so that a small part of himself could be with his unattainable and noble beloved, always. But when the gift keeps showing back up at his shop in the hands of a windblown and rugged thief-taker, Alec will need to reconsider his conviction that love is destined to remain an ethereal ideal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This book is one of seven stories which can all be read and enjoyed in any order. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* * * * * &lt;br /&gt;The Christmas Angel Series: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In 1750, a master woodcarver poured all his unrequited love, passion, and longing into his masterpiece—a gorgeous Christmas angel for his beloved’s tree. When the man he loved tossed the angel away without a second thought, a miracle happened. The angel was found by another who brought the woodcarver True Love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since then, the angel has been passed down, sold, lost and found, but its magic remains. Read the romances inspired by (and perhaps nudged along by) the Christmas angel through the years. Whether it’s the 1880’s New York (Kim Fielding’s Summerfield’s Angel), the turn-of-the-century (Jordan L. Hawk’s Magician’s Angel), World War II (L.A. Witt’s Christmas Homecoming), Vietnam-era (N.R. Walker’s Soldier’s Wish), the 1990’s (Anyta Sunday’s Shrewd Angel), or 2018 (RJ Scott’s Christmas Prince), the Christmas angel has a way of landing on the trees of lonely men who need its blessing for a very Merry Christmas and forever HEA.</description>

  <description>A new life in New Orleans is all Jason Thorpe had hoped: his quaint little store attracts a devoted staff and his warm, loving heart grants him a loyal circle of friends. He's perfectly content, having left behind the chill of a confusing and danger-filled night in Washington, until he discovers something unbelievable lurking in the steamy darkness of the shadowy streets of the Vieux Carré, something that turns out to be terrifying... and utterly mesmerizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prince of the vampyrs, Varic Maedoc, is visiting New Orleans when he finds out the man who once helped his counselor is there in the Quarter. He thinks to simply meet and thank Jason—until he lays eyes on him. Varic’s devoted himself to protect the honor of his race, and he's never wanted a mate before... but he immediately knows he must have this man, and no one else will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Varic may want to bring Jason safely into his world, but someone who doesn’t like the human's soothing influence on vampyrs has deadly plans that would disrupt Varic's dreams. Now, unable to tell friend from foe, Jason finds himself wondering how to hold on to the prince’s heart when he’s fighting for his life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Frosty former friends get a steamy second chance in this Christmas gay romance! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can true love warm his frozen heart?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Casey Stevens went away to college four years ago, he ghosted on his straight best friend, Joel Vreeland. He hoped time and distance would lessen the unrequited affection he felt, but all it did was make him miss Joel more. Home for the holidays, Casey hopes they might find a way to be friends again. But Joel’s frosty reception reminds Casey of just how hard he had to fight to be Joel’s friend in the first place. It’s going to take a Christmas miracle to get past that cool façade again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Joel isn’t as straight as Casey believes, and his years of pining for Casey have left him hurting and alone, caring for his abusive father and struggling to get by. Unable to trust anyone except his rescue dog—and with no reason to believe Casey is interested in him for more than a holiday fling—Joel’s icy heart might shatter before it can thaw. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Casey and Joel’s love overcome mistrust, parental rejection, class differences, and four long years apart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mr. Frosty Pants&lt;/i&gt; is a stand-alone, Christmas gay romance by Leta Blake featuring a virgin hero, childhood friends-to-lovers, second chance romance, and romantically steamy scenes.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Dillon:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don’t do relationships. I’ve been abandoned all my life, and I don’t trust a soul except my own damn self. But there’s something different about Jack Chance. From his lithe, gymnast’s body to his soulful hazel eyes, he’s everything I never knew I wanted. When he’s wrapped up in my arms, begging for more, everything seems right about the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m not boyfriend material—everyone in Abingdon knows that. I’ve got a moonshine-making hillbilly family, a heart hardened by war, and I walk into burning buildings for a living. Oh, and I’m still in love with my best friend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jack shouldn’t want anything to do with me. He shouldn’t keep coming back each time I make a total a$$ of myself, and he shouldn’t forgive me when I keep refusing to tell him how I feel. And he should &lt;i&gt;definitely&lt;/i&gt; run for the hills when I’m slapped with custody of my sister’s three kids. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But he doesn’t run. Instead, he’s making pancakes the morning after they move in. He’s up with Joey, soothing him through nightmares. He’s taking Chrissy to ballet. And he’s making sure Jordan knows how smart he is. No one has ever done that for those kids. No one has ever done that for &lt;i&gt;me.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That’s the kind of man Jack Chance is. He’s a man who stays. It’s only when the court orders him away that I realize I was never done with love. I was just waiting for Jack. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jack:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like a good project—maybe that’s why I’m madly, ridiculously, over-the-moon in love with Dillon Manning. I want him to see what I see when I look at him—a hero, a whole, real man. I’m addicted to his touch, his body, the way he kisses me so deeply and so tenderly. There’s more to Dillon than he lets on. I just want him to realize it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Dillon is just about on my last nerve, and I’m ready to be done. That’s when the unthinkable happens. Dillon’s sister is caught up in a meth lab bust, and her kids have been breathing all of it in for &lt;i&gt;months&lt;/i&gt;. It’ll take a village to get these kids healthy. And I’m Dillon’s village, whether he knows it or not. Every day, I’m falling more and more in love with him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I might be gentle, and loyal, and kind. But when our family is threatened, I’ll do everything in my power to keep us together—even if that means putting my own life at risk. Dillon Manning is worth it. I’ve always known that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And I’ll move heaven and earth to make sure that he knows &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; how I feel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Fighting Chance is the second novel in the Bridge to Abingdon series. Each book focuses on one adorable couple, and each can be read as a super-awesome standalone read. A Fighting Chance steamy scenes, a dollop of suspense, some amazing kids, a hillbilly reunion, and a family vacation that gives everyone a surprise. There are mentions of abuse and a couple of edge-of-your-seat scenes with an end-days preacher you’ll love to hate. Jack and Dillon are the heart of Abingdon, and the second chance we all wish we had. Enjoy!&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Oliver Knight’s past is shrouded by sorrow and tragedy, but instead of hiding from it, Ollie owns his truth and uses his experiences to uplift others. As an out and proud pastor, he provides a safe place for LGBTQ Christians to gather and worship, and as a recovering addict, he counsels those pursuing sobriety. Ollie’s life is fulfilling but also a little lonely. He may not have a hard time meeting men, but he does have a hard time getting them to stick around once they discover his vocation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Archie White is a former drag queen who hung up his stilettos to start an HIV transition home in the memory of someone he held near and dear to his heart. All work and no play has made Archie a very dull man, but he thinks his luck is about to change when a friend introduces him to a dark-eyed stranger. That is until he learns the man is a pastor. Archie detests anything to do with religion, and for very good reasons. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Archie’s gut tells him to run, and Ollie’s heart tells him to pursue. What can a pastor and a sometimes-queen possibly have in common? A desire to find unconditional love with someone who truly sees them. What happens next is the poignant, sweet, and sexy journey for two resilient hearts. Ollie and Archie’s halos might be battered and a little tarnished, but they’re definitely not broken. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Broken Halos is a charming story with heart, heat, and humor. Warning: these characters and their quirky sidekicks may take up permanent residence in your heart, so proceed with caution. Each book in the Queen City Rogues series can be read as part of the series or as a standalone novel. This book contains sexually explicit material and colorful language intended for adults 18 and older. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Cold Case Detective, Ronan O’Mara is stunned to see the breaking news that a well-known mobster he helped to put behind bars, Vito “The Dragon” Dragonni, has been released from prison after his life sentence is overturned on a technicality. When prominent members involved in the original case against The Dragon start turning up dead, Ronan starts to wonder if he’s next. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Psychic, Tennyson Grimm starts having visions of dead men with The Dragon’s signature kill shot: two bullet holes to the forehead. The men in the visions are strangers, but when he learns from an undercover agent that Dragonni has compiled a hit list with Ronan and his ex-partner, Tony, at the top, he fears a day will come when he recognizes the murder victim in his vision. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tony Abruzzi has been a broken man since the tragic death of his adopted son, Mark. Refusing the offer of protective custody until Dragonni and his hit squad are off the streets, he seems to be daring the mobster to come after him. Despite the fact that they’ve been estranged since the case that cost Tony’s son his life, Ronan decides to stick to his former partner’s side as his personal bodyguard, whether Tony wants his help or not. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Ronan and Tony find a way to work together to stop The Dragon before he can cross more names off his hit list or are both detectives dead men walking? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Coming home should be the easiest thing in the world, but I've never felt more lost...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his stellar military career comes to an abrupt and terrible end, thirty-two-year-old Maddox Kent returns to the town he never planned to step foot into again, hoping to mend the rift he himself caused with the brother he left behind. But coming home means facing some hard truths about himself and his actions. When he has the chance to start making amends by helping his brother with the wildlife sanctuary he runs, Maddox is thrown another curveball when a stranger appears...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;As long as we keep moving, everything will be okay. That's what I keep telling myself, anyway...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For twenty-one-year-old Isaac, Pelican Bay is only supposed to be a stopping point on the trek from San Francisco to New York. With his little brother, Newt, in tow, Isaac is just looking to make things right by returning something of value to a person he wronged. But "getting lost" in the next big city proves to be a problem when the brutal Minnesota winter claims Isaac's car and strands him and Newt at the animal sanctuary. When the owners of the place offer him a job, a desperate Isaac agrees, despite the presence of a man Isaac instinctively knows could be his downfall...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;It should be so easy to let him go, but I can't. And not just because I want to protect him...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing about Isaac makes sense to Maddox. Not his piercings or makeup or flashy clothes. And most certainly not the snarky mouth that doesn't match the vulnerability Maddox sees in the younger man's eyes. But one thing does make sense to the hardened former soldier. Isaac is running from something, and Maddox's gut is telling him not to let Isaac and little Newt go until he can ferret out the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But having Isaac around means trying to make sense of something else Maddox isn't expecting... his own body's response to the beautiful younger man. Aside from their explosive chemistry, nothing about the straitlaced soldier and the secretive misfit works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But maybe that's exactly why it does...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Can be read as a standalone (no cliffhangers) but more enjoyment may be had by reading book 1, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36241872" rel="nofollow"&gt;Locked in Silence&lt;/a&gt;, first.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I swore I'd never set foot in this town again. But Abingdon needs me. And Kendall Vincent might just get me to stay for good.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gil:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tired of working the police beat in Northern Cali. Exhausted--my whole body was yearning for a place I hadn't been in years, my old home. When my mama died, I knew I had to come back, and my new job as police chief sealed the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got away from heartbreak. From being so tired. From the constant, never-ending world of crime I'd come to know.&lt;br /&gt;In Abingdon, I can relax, see all my old friends from Jackson Academy. Maybe I can even change this place and make it better for all the kids like me. The ones who were different, who needed a place a little bigger and broader than a small mountain town could provide.&lt;br /&gt;I always promised myself I wouldn't come back.&lt;br /&gt;But Kendall Vincent--he might get me to stay for good. When I'm in his arms, I feel complete, whole again, like a man reborn to the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything seems perfect, right up until the moment that it's not.&lt;br /&gt;When two gay kids get hurt bad by a gang of thugs, I realize that Abingdon needs me far more than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;And I'm here to protect the town--and the man--that I'm growing to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kendall:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've survived everything this world has tossed my way--ignorant parents, falling for men who want to play straight, and running a food truck in a town that likes its men butch and its hot dogs bland as all hell.&lt;br /&gt;I even got through chemo and three bone marrow transplants when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;But nothing prepared me for meeting Gilman Steele.&lt;br /&gt;Six feet of pure muscle with eyes that shine like gold and a smile I'd like to see every morning for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;I know I'm crazy, but I swear to God almighty that I fell in love with that man of Steele from the first second I laid eyes on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a secret I know that could change my relationship with Gil, a lie I've been hiding for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;It could threaten Gil's life here, everything he's worked for. But justice is justice, and I believe in the Abingdon that Gil wants to create.&lt;br /&gt;When the drama gets worse than I ever imagined, I realize that Gil's not the only one in danger.&lt;br /&gt;I'm toppling off a bridge and getting sucked down into the murky water of Holston Lake when I know for sure--this isn't the day I meet my maker.&lt;br /&gt;I didn't survive everything I've been through just to die at the hands of an evil man with a secret far darker than my own.&lt;br /&gt;I'll make my way back to Gil. He's mine, now and forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;This town might not be ready for us, but I am. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And I plan to let the world know it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steele My Heart is the first book in the Bridge to Abingdon series. Each book focuses on one amazing couple, and each can be read as a total standalone. There's lots of steam, a heaping dose of mystery, a dash of insta-love, and a happy ending that's guaranteed to make your heart melt. There are a few chilling scenes and some ignorant jerks who meet justice in every sense of the word. Gil Steele and Kendall Vincent are the future of Abingdon, and the men who set up the story for the rest of our lovers. Enjoy! &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Soulmates across time. A sacrifice that could keep them apart forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In present day, near the village of Ornes, France, Devon works on his master's thesis in history as he fantasizes about meeting a WWI American Doughboy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In 1916, during the Battle of Ornes, Stanley is a young soldier facing the horrors of the battlefield. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mourning the death of his friends from enemy fire, Stanley volunteers to bring the message for retreat so he can save everyone else in his battalion. While on his mission, mustard gas surrounds Stanley and though he thinks he is dying, he finds himself in a peaceful green meadow where he literally trips over Devon. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Devon doesn't believe Stanley is who he says he is, a soldier from WWI. But a powerful attraction grows between them, and if Stanley is truly a visitor from the past, then he is Devon's dream come true. The problem is, Stanley's soul wants to finish his mission, and time keeps yanking him back to relive his fateful last morning over and over, even as his heart and body long to stay with Devon. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Stanley have to choose between Devon and saving his battalion? Will time betray their love, leaving each alone? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A male/male time travel romance, complete with hurt/comfort, French coffee, warm blankets, fireplace kisses, the angst of separation, and true love across time.</description>

  <description>Eduardo “Lucky” Morales is a fighter, from his childhood days in Cuba to his time as a Special Forces Green Beret. Scarred by the wars of his past, Lucky has learned nothing lasts forever. Guarding his heart is second nature, and getting emotionally involved is not an option. As co-owner of Four Kings Security, Lucky works hard alongside his former brothers-in-arms and fellow Kings, but he also plays hard. Flirting with sexy Texas cowboy and detective, Mason Cooper, is too much fun to resist, until Mason turns the tables on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mason Cooper may not be a soldier, but he’s fought his share of battles as an openly gay cop and now a detective for Major Crimes. Mason has no idea when things changed between him and Lucky, but the gorgeous, fiery Cuban has turned his world upside down. When a mistake leads to his suspension from the force, Mason turns to the least likely person for help: Ward Kingston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to keep Mason at arms’ length, Lucky is surprised to find the man at Four Kings Security. The Florida nights might be getting cooler, but the heat between Lucky and Mason burns hotter with every passing moment. Working private security can be dangerous and unpredictable, but so can falling in love.&lt;br /&gt;k.</description>

  <description>‘Twas the night before Christmas and all of your favorite characters from the Cold Case Psychic series are showing you how they’re getting ready for a visit from the big man himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ronan is testing out new family traditions. Let’s just say he’s “Nailed it!” Meanwhile, the Craig brothers are trying to put their broods down for a “long winter’s nap” with varying degrees of sugar-fueled success. Bertha and Erin are stopping by for visits, as Tobin and Niall are partying like it’s 1968. Jude’s saying a little prayer, and Jace and Fitz are the ones getting down for a change. Kaye’s back in town and making so much fruitcake, Salem might just be overrun with it. Greeley drops food off at a local homeless shelter, while Hunter feeds the entire ER staff at the hospital. Tennyson and Ronan are back for a discussion about what next Christmas will be like with their bundle of joy. Last, but not least, is a special guest you won’t see coming and you won’t want to miss. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Join in the fun as The Witch City becomes Christmas Towne. All of these tales are guaranteed to make you feel merry and bright. Dreaming of a white Christmas is optional. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>1418, Wales: Hunter Conroy, the youngest in a family of powerful demon slayers, is captured by the evil warlock Osian. Young Hunter is given a choice: join forces with his enemy and kill his own family, or be cursed to live through the ages as a stone gargoyle. Once a century, Hunter is released from his prison, and tempted with the chance to build a life for himself. At the end of a decade of freedom, if Hunter does not choose to become one of Osian’s minions, he is again remanded to the cold, lonely rock. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fast forward six hundred years, and Hunter finds himself in Salem, Massachusetts. He has forged a quiet life, knowing that at the end of this latest cycle, Osian will once again return, and Hunter will decline his offer. He is content to live out the last few months of this round alone, until he meets Walker Harmon. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ER Doctor Walker Harmon had expected to be married with children by now, but so far has been unable to find the man of his dreams. Hunter Conroy sparks his interest until he sees the handsome tow truck driver throw a man across the room without even touching him. When Hunter reveals the source of his powers, telling Walker that his days in Salem are numbered, it’s a story beyond belief. Realizing he’s in love with this cursed man, Walker is willing to risk everything to fight for Hunter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With time running out, Hunter amasses a dream team of witches, psychics, and a mysterious wizard to help him break the warlock’s curse. Will their combined powers be enough to free Hunter, or will the gargoyle reclaim him for another century? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I’ve spent years hoping someone would finally hear me. It’s easier not to try anymore…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years after leaving his small Minnesota hometown in his rearview mirror for what Nolan Grainger was sure would be the last time, life has decided to throw the talented musician a curveball and send him back to the town he lived in but was never really home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At twenty-eight, Nolan has traveled the world as a successful concert violinist with some of the best symphonies in the country. But success breeds envy, and when Nolan’s benefactor and lover decides Nolan has flown high enough, he cruelly clips Nolan’s wings. The betrayal and ensuing scandal leaves the violinist’s career in shambles and with barely enough money to start fresh somewhere beyond his vindictive ex’s powerful reach. But just as he’s ready to get his life back on track, Nolan gets the call he’s been dreading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a stroke leaves his father a partial invalid, duty-bound Nolan returns to Pelican Bay and a life he’s spent years trying to forget. When he’s forced to use the last of his own money to keep from losing the family home, desperation has him turning to the one man he’d hoped never to see again…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if I could speak, there wouldn’t be anyone there to listen…&lt;br /&gt;Pelican Bay’s golden boy, Dallas Kent, had the quintessential perfect life. Smart, gorgeous, and popular, the baseball phenom was well on his way to a life filled with fame and fortune. But more importantly, he had a one-way ticket out of Pelican Bay and far away from the family who used love as currency and whose high expectations were the law of the land. But a stormy night, sharp highway curve and one bad decision changed everything, leaving Dallas with nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the accident that took his parents, his future and his crown as the boy who could do no wrong, also stole his voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despised for the horrific wreck that ended the lives of two of Pelican Bay’s most respected residents, Dallas has retreated to a secluded stretch of land where he’s found refuge in a menagerie of unwanted animals that don’t care that he once had the world at his feet or that he’ll never speak again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the quiet, bookish boy he wasn’t allowed to notice in school suddenly reappears ten years later at Dallas’s wildlife rehab center in desperate need of a job, Dallas is thrust back into a world he’s worked hard to escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dallas’s silence was supposed to send Nolan scurrying, but what if Nolan ends up being the one person who finally hears him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will two men who’ve been fleeing from the past finally come home to Pelican Bay for good or will the silence drive them apart forever?</description>

  <description>Sasha Michaels is a psychic with an affinity for houses. And he’s homeless. Go figure. After months of sleeping rough, he stumbles upon an abandoned house, and the lonely place beckons him inside. He’s finally safe . . . until someone comes blundering in to his hideaway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;House-flipper Nick Cooper lost everything in the recession. Desperate to revive his business, he turns to a loan shark to fund his comeback project: flipping an abandoned house full of potential. But it turns out the house has an unexpected occupant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick and Sasha make a deal: Sasha can stay in exchange for helping with the renovation. To both of their surprise, the closer they get to the loan shark’s due date, the stronger their feelings for each other grow. Problem is, Nick isn’t the only one with feelings for Sasha, and now the house doesn’t want to let Sasha go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reader discretion advised. This title contains the following sensitive themes:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Drug use, explicit violence, non-consensual touching.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He'll love him in any lifetime.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neil isn’t a ghost, but he feels like one. Reincarnated with all his memories from his prior life, he spent twenty years trapped in a child’s body, wanting nothing more than to grow up and reclaim the love of his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an adult, Neil finds there's more than lost time separating them. Joshua has built a beautiful life since Neil’s death, and how exactly is Neil supposed to introduce himself? As Joshua's long-dead lover in a new body? Heartbroken and hopeless, Neil takes refuge in his work, developing microscopic robots called nanites that can produce medical miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Joshua meets a young scientist working on a medical project, his soul senses something his rational mind can't believe. Has Neil truly come back to him after twenty years? And if the impossible is real, can they be together at long last?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Any Given Lifetime&lt;/i&gt; is a gay romance by Leta Blake featuring reincarnation and true love. This story includes some angst, some steam, and, of course, a happy ending.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Augie:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't need anyone's protection. I'm fine. But to appease my sister after a home invasion, I agree to take self-defense lessons. They just so happen to be with a big, muscled former navy SEAL who may or may not be everything I've always daydreamed about but never thought I could have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he's dead-set on looking out for me even when things in my life suddenly get complicated. Between the increasing threats against me and pressure from my wealthy family to be someone I'm not, I'm having a hard time keeping it together. As I begin to fall apart, I lose faith I'll ever meet anyone who'll want a mess like me--much less meeting someone strong and capable like Saint Wilde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more time I spend with him, however, the more I realize he's not as put together as he seems. And I begin to wonder... while Saint's busy looking after everyone else, who's looking after him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saint:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my big fat mouth gets me in trouble with a high-profile client, my boss takes away the bodyguard gig and sends me back to my hometown to give one of society's elites a few lessons at a local gym. Babysitting an antiques nerd is hardly my idea of a good time, but as soon the attractive, petite man walks into the workout center, I nearly trip over my own feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's effing adorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And absolutely scared to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He won't tell me what's spooked him, but I won't rest until I find a way to take the fear out of his gorgeous eyes. Even if defending Augie means I have to stop protecting my own heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;His Saint is the fifth book in the Forever Wilde series but can be read out of order. Beware it includes 90k words of delicious man parts touching, grandfathers meddling, sassy siblings, cats mrrp-ing... and one Stevie.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Felix and Lane are trying out their new normal. Normal means no more car chases, no more drug lords, and definitely no more kidnapping bad guys. All of that is a thing of the past in this new, normal(ish) life style filled with family get-togethers, torturous jogs through the park, and the occasional romp in the parking lot. Felix is done stealing (all but for the cat). He is actually enjoying the boring side of life, especially with Lane by his side doing what he does best: looking handsome. But when Felix’s brother wants to repair their relationship, he brings with him a secret that could cost all of them their lives. Lane isn’t complaining because the thrills of life-threatening situations are right up his alley. They may think they have a handle on the situation, but what they do not know is that someone has been working them from the shadows. Forcing them to do exactly what he wants as he drives them closer to his sick game of life and death.&lt;br /&gt;Join Felix and Lane in a race against time, their only weapons being their humor and their wit.</description>

  <description>When Felix lands a job taking care of a man recovering from severe injuries, he thinks his life may have just turned around. Anything has to be better than the place he’s leaving. There’s something about Lane that draws Felix to him and makes him question if this place could finally become a home for him.&lt;p&gt; But when someone begins stalking Felix, he is left to question who Lane is and what actually happened to him. Together, Felix and Lane will be forced to see just how far they will go to protect each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Being chased by cops, kidnapping a man, and breaking into a drug operation seems to be his normal since arriving in Lane’s life. Felix may be out of his element, but one thing he is sure about is that he doesn’t want to leave, even if it costs him his life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>No one is more surprised than Cold Case Detective, Ronan O’Mara when he answers his doorbell one night to see members of Salem’s Wiccan community standing on his doorstep with an unbelievable story to tell. According to them, members of their coven are being murdered in a modern-day witch hunt and they want Ronan to look into the matter for them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Psychic, Tennyson Grimm is skeptical of the witches’ claims. After the initial investigation turns up ordinary deaths in car accidents, house fires, and by suicide, Ten feels that the witches’ suspicions, are just that: suspicions. His sixth sense is not giving him any clues that these are anything but untimely and tragic deaths. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When another witch dies mysteriously, Ronan turns up the heat on the Salem Police Department to investigate and finds himself in an unusual position: in hot water with Fitzgibbon and his husband. Suspended from the Boston Police Department and abandoned by his family and friends, Ronan goes rogue, conducting the investigation on his own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Uncovering an insidious plot with roots reaching back to the Salem Witch Trials, Ronan must battle a force so evil, it has managed to stay hidden for centuries. Without the power of his badge or the backing of Tennyson, does Ronan have the strength to survive something that hunts in the dead of night? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>*FIVE JOBS. FIVE CHANCES FOR REDEMPTION. One thing’s for sure: these men are no angels.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s nothing like being blackmailed by a dead man to really bring a group of cons together. And what a group we are: a hacker, a thief, a con artist, a thug, and a Federal agent with an axe to grind. The deal is simple, we do the jobs and Charlie’s lawyer wipes the slate clean for each of us, one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since job number one calls for some muscle, it looks like I’m up first. I’m Steele Alvarez, ex-Special Forces Close Protection Specialist (aka, a bodyguard for some not so nice guys).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After learning what the job is — taking down a seemingly untouchable senator with a penchant for beating up young male prostitutes — I’m in. No questions. A bullet ought to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I met Senator Harlan’s latest victim: Breck Pfeiffer, the gorgeous hooker with a heart of gold and the soul of a fighter. One look at him and I’m gone. That kid laid me out harder than any punch ever did. I’ll do anything to protect Breck, even kill for him. But Breck doesn’t want the senator dead, he wants vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we’re going to find a way bring down the slimebag and get the blackest mark on my record erased, I’m going to need all the help I can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like it or not, we’re all in this together.</description>

  <description>“I was in free fall the moment we met, and I just keep falling.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Small town police officer Silas Sloane knows every resident of O’Leary, New York. He’s earned the love and respect of its citizens, though living under the small-town microscope grates on him. But though he’s good at his job, there’s one thing he’s not good at: commitments… Until Everett. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Widower Everett Maior, O’Leary’s newest citizen, came to the small town kicking and screaming. He never wanted to become primary caretaker for his grandfather and has no interest in living the provincial life. Snarky and superstitious, he’s proficient at keeping people at a distance... Until he lays eyes on Silas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Strange disappearances are plaguing O’Leary, though, even as Silas and Everett find their growing attraction undeniable. Can they find their way to a future together, even as ghosts from the past threaten to tear them apart?</description>

  <description>Gabe and Josh Roman-Wyatt have been living life in the fast lane. Demanding jobs, precocious twin toddlers, an ever-growing circle of friends, and a menagerie of pets means their home is filled with love and laughter but very few quiet moments for the happy couple. Gabe’s solution is to plan a surprise vacation at a perfect hideaway where the two of them can slow things down and reconnect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tarlington House, a historic home located on Edisto Island in South Carolina, hosts an annual murder-mystery event which will allow Josh to use the skills he learned from his all-time favorite television detective to solve the case. The serene setting is perfect for fun days in the sun, passionate lovemaking under the stars, and a healthy wager between husbands to see who can plan the best date. But when the other guests arrive, the guys find themselves surrounded by liars and cheaters who will say or do anything to win, reminding them there’s no place like Blissville. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a guest is killed during a vicious storm that knocks out the power and phone lines, Josh and Gabe’s murder mystery role-playing becomes a real-life whodunnit. Serve and protect will take on a deeper meaning for Gabe when he’s torn between upholding the law and protecting his husband from a ruthless killer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ride or Dye includes sexy sunrises, snarky banter, and swoon-worthy romance. It is the sixth and final book in the Curl Up and Dye Mysteries, which must be read in order. Ride or Dye contains sexually explicit material intended for adults 18 and older. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

    &lt;i&gt;A THIRDS Universe Novel &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austen Payne, THIRDS Squadron Specialist Agent (SSA) for Destructive Delta and TIN operative, has seen the worst the world has to offer, faced lethal killers, and helped bring down dangerous organizations. But nothing terrifies him more than falling in love. After years of undercover work, Austen is a master at defending himself and protecting his heart… until he meets Osmond Zachary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THIRDS Defense Agent Osmond Zachary has a huge, doting family, yet something is missing in his life. After meeting grumpy, foul-mouthed, jittery cheetah Therian Austen Payne, Zach knows exactly what that something—or someone—is. Unfortunately Austen seems determined to avoid Zach at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Zach foils an assassination attempt, he ends up in the killer’s crosshairs, and Austen is Zach’s best chance at staying alive. Zach hopes the crisis will bring them closer, but Austen has every intention of walking away as soon as the danger is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happily ever after isn’t for guys like Austen, but Zach is determined to show him it can be ...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; What happens when a group of tough vigilantes meets up with a big-hearted family with boundary issues?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reese:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's supposed to be an easy job. You know, the kind you get after you've been gone a while and the boss is unsure of how capable you still are? But then there's a mugging, an abduction, two thugs, and a blackmail scheme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And smack-dab in the middle of it is a beautiful lost soul who needs me. The scared, young gamer-geek pushes all my protective buttons and awakens something inside me that's ready to dive right in and inhale the man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how could I have anything to offer someone like Ben? I'm a mess. Injured, scarred, practically closeted, the recognizable son of a famous man... There's no way I can ask him to give me a shot at forever. Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ben:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like I've been looking out for myself my entire life. Heck, I was even given away the day I was born. And, yeah, maybe if my adoptive parents had survived, I would have had a nice life. But they didn't. And I don't. Instead, I'm forced to put up with a hateful, scheming foster parent for the sake of sticking around to care for my little sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only, when a blackmail plan lands little Georgie in the hands of thugs, it's clear I'm her only hope. At least... until I meet the big, strong bodyguard someone sends to watch over me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reese is everything I've ever daydreamed about: protective, attentive, affectionate, and dedicated. But he's hiding something, and I don't have the time or energy to figure out what. Because time is running out, and Georgie is the only family I have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the biological brother who never wanted me shows up and turns everything on its head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having finally accepted it's just Georgie and me, suddenly falling for my protector and being surrounded by Griff and the Marian clan makes me question everything I've ever known about myself and what defines a family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can a guy with a broken past ever build a family with someone who seems too good to be true?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Reading Order Note***&lt;br /&gt;CAN BE READ AS A STAND-ALONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the authors recommend reading both the Made Marian series by Lucy Lennox and the Protectors series by Sloane Kennedy, it isn't required in order to understand the story. At the least, you may want to consider Grounding Griffin (Book 4, Made Marian series by Lucy Lennox) and Unexpected (Book 10, The from the Protectors series by Sloane Kennedy) to get a little bit of background. However, this novel, despite being a crossover, has been written in a way that it can be read on its own.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A stolen child, an omega who never gave up, and an Alpha who will stop at nothing to bring them together again…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Detective Dean Garza has almost everything an Alpha could ask for: a challenging career, a big, wonderful, wacky family and a comfortable place to come home to at the end of a long day. What he doesn’t have is the omega he always imagined he’d be able to share it all with at this point in his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a troubled kid gets dropped off at the station on Thanksgiving eve with nowhere to go, taking him in for the holidays is a given. When the young Alpha makes it clear that all he wants for Christmas is a reunion with the birth parents he’s never given up hope of finding, Dean sets out on a mission to get him the closure he needs to move on with his new adoptive family. He never counted on getting so attached, much less imprinting on Gavin’s birth father. Dean tells himself that love and good intentions alone can’t make a single Alpha and an omega with a dark past a suitable family, but his heart has other ideas the moment he meets Max. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;~ &lt;br /&gt;Max has spent 12 years searching tirelessly for the infant son who was taken from him by an Alpha who refuses to stay in the shadows of the past. The omega does what it takes to get by, even if that means selling pieces of himself another took long ago. He’s worked with an string of private investigators, but now that he’s met one who’s finally closing in on the truth of what happened to Max’s son, the omega knows something has to change if he’s going to be the father he always wanted to be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Detective Garza shows up unannounced, Max is sure he’s just another henchman from his ex sent to keep him quiet. Instead, the handsome Alpha proves to be a threat of a whole different kind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a steamy holiday M/M MPREG romance meant to be read as a standalone, set in the same non-shifter omegaverse as the Undercover Alphas series. Get ready to unwrap some sizzling scenes, heartwarming moments and a guaranteed Happily Ever After. Approximately 43,000 words. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The happily ever after Angel never expected was interrupted in a way he never could have imagined.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s been years since the death of the only Alpha he’s ever loved, and while he takes solace in his family, his heart has never quite healed the way it should have. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, the Futurus Initiative is intent on using Mitchell’s good name to promote its agenda to raise the dead via its most audacious science project yet. Once someone is gone, they don’t come back. Angel knows this better than anyone. He also knows the danger of hope. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a mistake of epic proportions leads a man with Mitchell’s memories to his door, Angel is forced to put his personal feelings aside in order to help the wayward Alpha come to terms with his strange existence. No one could ever replace Mitchell, including the man who was created for that very purpose, but Angel’s heart begins to respond to Clay in ways that just shouldn’t be possible. He’s left to wonder whether he’s falling for Futurus’ latest scheme, or if fate simply isn’t done with their love story. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the final installment in The Mountain Shifters series and is not meant to be read as a standalone. Audiences 18+ only. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An MPREG Shifter Romance.</description>

  <description>A Cold Case Psychic Spin off Novella&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Museum curator, Harrison Kirkpatrick, has been fascinated by the American Revolution since childhood, but never in his wildest dreams did he ever imagine falling in love from afar with a soldier who fought for America’s freedom. Through a series of events too wild to be believed, Harrison is thrown back in time to 1775, mere days before the Battle of Bunker Hill, finding himself at the business end of a musket held by the very man he has been pining for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Massachusetts Militiaman, Gannon Chalmers, does not know what to make of the strange man he finds wandering around Bunker Hill days before his unit is to engage the British Redcoats. Is this man friend or foe? What he does know is that there is an undeniable attraction growing between them that he must resist at all costs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the battle draws closer, so do Gannon and Harrison. Can they deny the passion threatening to explode between them like a powder keg? Or will Gannon’s abundance of caution keep him from giving in to the one man who could lay claim to his heart? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the brink of a war that will change the history of the world, the pair must decide what price they are willing to pay for freedom, and how much they are willing to sacrifice for love. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Cold Case Detective, Ronan O’Mara, has set sail on the honeymoon of his dreams to sunny Bermuda. He’s looking forward to a week of fun in the sun with his husband, Tennyson, but nothing is going as planned. From a fight between Truman and Carson that’s threatening to break up their marriage, to Captain Fitzgibbon’s on-again, off-again lover not showing up to meet the ship, to dealing with his always challenging mother-in-law, to frenemy, Jude Byrne, showing up with a suitcase loaded with sex toys and lube, Ronan has all he can do to stay sane. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Psychic, Tennyson Grimm, is on the ship to work as well as honeymoon. The cruise ship line has hired him to be the “celebrity” on their celebrity cruise. In between private and group readings reuniting family members with those who have crossed over, Ten is running himself ragged attempting to put the pieces of Truman and Carson’s marriage back together and trying to keep Jude from horn-dogging after the ship’s captain, all while trying to squeeze in a few stolen, passionate moments with his husband. He isn’t having much luck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;During the return trip to Boston, Ronan and Tennyson are enjoying a performance of Murder Mystery Night staged by the ship’s crew. When the crewmember playing the murder victim turns up dead for real, Ronan and Tennyson must set “fun in the sun” aside when the ship’s captain allows them to investigate the crime. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Putting the clues together, the Boston detectives corner the cagey killer who takes someone close to them hostage. Can Tennyson and Ronan save the day before they end up dead in the water? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Still waters run deadly.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Paretski, plumber with a talent for finding hidden things, and his private investigator fiancé Phil Morrison have been hired to locate a runaway husband, Jonathan Parrot. The job seems simple enough—until their quarry turns up dead in a canal, and a photofit of Tom’s face is splashed all over the news, making him chief suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The widow, petite ex–porn star Lilah Lovett, is convinced her husband was killed by his gay lover, but Tom and Phil aren’t so sure. Worried they may have precipitated Jonathan’s death, they’re determined to find the real killer. But with a web of incestuous ties linking the suspects, it’s hard to know who to trust. Especially when a second victim dies a gruesome death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, with their wedding looming and them sharing a house now, Tom’s worried it may all be too much, too fast. The last thing he needs are the mixed messages Phil seems to be sending out. They’ll need to get back on the same track if they want to make it to their honeymoon together—and alive.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Death is what happens while you’re making other plans . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing newly engaged plumber Tom Paretski needs is to stumble over another dead body. He’s got enough on his mind already as the reality of his impending marriage sinks in. Not only is his family situation complicated, but his heroism at a pub fire has made him a local celebrity, and now everyone knows about his psychic talents—and wants a piece of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hired to recover a missing necklace, Tom and his fiancé, private investigator Phil Morrison, find themselves trying to unmask a killer. And there’s no shortage of suspects, including the local bishop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Tom and Phil try to uncover the truth, they’re pulled in all directions by the conflicting pressures of their families and their own desires. But the murderer they’re up against is a ruthless schemer who won’t baulk at killing again. If Tom and Phil don’t watch out, their love—and all their plans for the future—could be blown down like a house of straw.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;If you dig up the past, be prepared for some dirt to stick.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The relationship between Tom Paretski, a cheeky plumber with a gift for finding hidden things, and PI Phil Morrison may only be a few weeks old, but already it’s under attack. Tom’s friends and family are convinced the former bully isn’t good enough for him, and they’re not shy about saying so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Tom’s prickly older sister, Cherry, is poisoned at her own engagement party. Tom’s left reeling and not knowing who to suspect. Could it be her new fiancé, Gregory, a cathedral canon with an unfortunate manner and a taste for taxidermy? Or someone from her old writers’ circle, which she left after a row? Or could the attack be connected to her work as a barrister? Meanwhile, Tom’s honorary auntie’s left him a gag gift from beyond the grave that could be more significant than anyone knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phil’s fighting against the clock to solve the case before somebody ends up dead. And with the poisoner hiding a dark secret, Phil’s terrified Tom could have been the target all along.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Some secrets are better left hidden.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To most of the world, Tom Paretski is just a plumber with a cheeky attitude and a dodgy hip, souvenir of a schoolboy accident. The local police keep his number on file for a different reason—his sixth sense for finding hidden things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he’s called in to help locate the body of a missing woman up on Nomansland Common, he unexpectedly encounters someone who resurrects a host of complicated emotions. Phil Morrison, Tom’s old school crush, now a private investigator working the same case. And the former bully partly responsible for Tom’s injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shocks keep coming. Phil is now openly gay, and shows unmistakable signs of interest. Tom’s attraction to the big, blond investigator hasn’t changed—in fact, he’s even more desirable all grown up. But is Phil’s interest genuine, or does he only want to use Tom’s talent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the pile of complicated evidence surrounding the woman’s murder grows higher, so does the heat between Tom and Phil. But opening himself to this degree exposes Tom’s heart in a way he’s not sure he’s ready for…while the murderer’s trigger finger is getting increasingly twitchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; Contains a flirtatious plumber with hidden talents, a cashmere-clad private investigator with hidden depths, and an English village chock full of colourful characters with plenty to hide.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Hudson:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't ever accidentally propose to your girlfriend. In front of her family. Especially if her dad is your boss. Because when you make it clear you've made a mistake, he's likely to send you out of the country to get you as far away from his broken-hearted daughter as possible. It happened to me. Now I'm stuck in Ireland trying to redeem myself so I can get promoted and have the life I've planned for: successful career, loving wife and kids, a comfortable, financially-secure home life in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all of that seems to evaporate the moment I walk into the historic pub and see the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. Only, he's not a woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlie Murray is most definitely a man—the kind of man who causes me to take a second look for the first time in my life. And a third look, and fourth. I can't help but want to get to know him better... to get close to him, touch him, maybe even kiss him. But I'm straight. Or so I've always thought. Even if I'm not, how in the world could a feisty Irishman ever fit into the safe, predictable life I've always planned for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Charlie:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't ever accidentally fall for the straight guy. Especially when he's trying to pry your family's business right out from under you. I should know. Because when Hudson Wilde walks into my family's pub and begins babbling so adorably, I can't help but fall just a little bit in love. But I'm looking for Forever Man, and the sexy American is certainly not him. He's so confused about what he wants, even choosing something from the dinner menu throws him into a fuddle. But those eyes... how can I resist?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So maybe I’ll give in. One steamy night before he heads home and I go back to life at the pub. We'll never see each other again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until, of course, his business deal sends me to Hobie, Texas, right into the middle of Hudson's steady life, more gay Wildes than can fit on a dance floor, and an ex-girlfriend who may or may not be content remaining an ex. But the more time I spend with Hudson, the more I think he might be my Forever Man after all. And I may be his. Is it possible we could both be so lucky?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Hudson's Luck is the fourth book in the Forever Wilde series but can be read on its own. Beware it includes 93k words of delicious man parts touching, grandfathers meddling, neighbors nosy-ing, dogs fornicating, cats being cats, horses... ah, crunching apples? or something... and one very flirty Stevie.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When the cards are stacked against you, the Kings will even the odds.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Former Special Forces medical sergeant Russell “Red” McKinley knows a thing or two about wounds, like the fact some can take a lifetime to heal, if they heal at all. The scars Red carries run deep, and living with PTSD often means battling the memories of his past. Injuries he received while working an executive protection case with fellow Kings and co-owners of Four Kings Security, have once again forced past heartaches to the surface, but Red is determined not to let it derail his blossoming romance with sweet and sexy fashion photographer Lazarus Galanos. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Laz can’t deny there’s something special developing between him and Red, but Laz has wounds of his own. He’s hesitant to jump into a new relationship after his recent explosive breakup. Experience has taught Laz to doubt his judgement when it comes to men. Guys who seem too good to be true, usually are, and no one appears more perfect than Red. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When an attempt is made on Laz’s life, Red is determined to keep him safe. Laz may not be a client, and Red is still off duty, but Laz is one of their own, and nothing means more to the Kings than family. While an investigation is underway, Red and Laz are growing closer, but can they find a way to help each other heal and take a chance on love, or will their fears and insecurities cost them more than their future together? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Cold Case Detective and newlywed, Ronan O’Mara, is sitting on top of the world. When he returns to work after his honeymoon, he finds more waiting for him than a stack of dusty cold case files. Hidden in the mail on Ronan’s desk is a letter from Tank Hutchins, aka The Riverside Ripper. Convicted of murdering a woman three years ago, Tank claims he is innocent and asks Ronan and Tennyson for their help in proving who really committed the crime: his twin brother, Tim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Psychic, Tennyson Grimm, is reluctant to meet with the convicted murderer who’s placed his faith in Ten’s gift. When Tennyson realizes Tank is innocent of the crime for which he’s serving twenty-five to life, he knows that he and Ronan have to do whatever it takes to set things right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together with Tank’s private investigator, the mysterious Jude Byrne, Ronan and Tennyson retrace the steps of the original investigation hoping to find the one piece of evidence that will get Tank’s conviction overturned and bring the real killer to light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When new evidence leads them to believe there’s a larger conspiracy at play, will Tennyson and Ronan be able to find the killer before he returns to complete his diabolical plan?</description>

  <description>Memphis Sullivan thought he was coming to Blissville to help his cousin out, but instead, he gained three meddlesome females, a tribe, and a permanent home. More than a year later, he owns a popular comic book and vinyl record store and doesn’t think his life could get any better. That all changes when the star of his favorite television show and bad-boy fantasies rides into town and spices up his vanilla world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lyric Willows’ decision to visit an old friend in Blissville will change his life in ways he never dreamed possible. The paranormal investigator is immediately drawn to the mysterious disappearance of the town’s founder in 1850 and rumors that his former home is haunted. More alluring to Lyric than the history of Bliss House is the immediate connection he feels to the adorably geeky owner of Vinyl and Villains, who also happens to be his friend’s cousin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lyric becomes Memphis’s houseguest when he decides to stay in town to conduct a paranormal investigation. Tight spaces lead to sexy encounters, and before long, ghosts aren’t the only things that go bump in the night. The more they unravel about Anthony Bliss’s disappearance, the more tangled in one another they become. How is it possible for two virtual strangers to feel like they’ve known each other for their entire lives? Was their love written in the stars, or is it nothing more than an illusion? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Smoke in the Mirror is the fifth book in the Road to Blissville series. Each book can be read as a standalone book or part of the series. This book contains sexually explicit material and is intended for adults 18 and older. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>At the café Milo Miracle co-owns with his twin sister, coffee and pastries are served up along with his unique blend of sass and snark. Milo knows that small-town life often means that every day is the same as the one before, and excitement can only be found in the gossip that travels faster than the speed of light. When the dark-haired Adonis who broke his heart returns home after a twelve-year absence, Milo unhappily finds himself at the center of Blissville’s favorite pastime. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy Mason was practically a kid when he left home to pursue big-league ambitions, but the man who returns to Blissville is humbled by shattered dreams and secrets he’s not ready to share with Milo. Andy’s no stranger to grit and determination, and he’ll need both to win back Milo’s cynical heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strong wills clash with stubborn hearts, triggering combustible passion once Andy starts renovations at the café. Milo would like to keep Andy’s hands busy doing something other than construction. Andy would like to suggest what Milo can do with his wicked tongue besides trade barbs with him. Neither man is willing to budge until they get a little shove from an outside force. Will Andy and Milo learn that trust is a two-way street, or will this time around end as disastrous as the first?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time around is a witty, sexy, and endearing love story about two men who learn how to balance push and pull, both in and out of the bedroom. It is the fourth book in the Road to Blissville series but can be read as a standalone book. This book contains sexually explicit material and is intended for adults eighteen and over.</description>

  <description>Fire and ice. Oil and water. Vodka and decisions. That’s what Darren McCoy and Wren Davison are: two opposites that shouldn’t mix well. Dare believes in fairy tales, true love, and happily ever after. Wren believes in fast cars, freedom, and no-strings sex. What can these two men possibly have in common? A magnetic pull strong enough to obliterate logic and reason.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For more than a year, Dare and Wren have worked together at the Curl Up and Dye Salon. Dare has pursued the mysterious, brooding man, and Wren has resisted his provocative charm. Then one day, something happens that allows the men to see each other in a new light. Wren learns that Dare hides a heavy heart behind his brilliant smile. Dare realizes that beneath Wren’s gruff exterior beats the heart of a prince.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Passions ignite once the men stop fighting their attraction, but will it be enough to overcome their differences? Is Wren the prince that Dare is looking for? Can Dare teach Wren that true love does exist?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nobody’s Prince charming is a modern-day fairy tale where some princes ride Harleys, and castle walls are built to scale. It is the third book in the Road to Blissville series but can be read as a standalone book. This book contains sexually explicit material and is intended for adults eighteen and over.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Psychic Emory Jackson and former black ops specialist Jonathon Silver are men from two completely different worlds with one thing in common: heartbreak. Emory still mourns the loss of his husband five years prior, and Jon is reeling with grief from the recent death of his twin brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sparks fly when mutual friends introduce them, but it’s so much more than basic attraction. There’s an undeniable awareness and a sense of belonging that neither man can deny. Despite Emory’s premonition of a future with Jon, he has vowed never to love again. Jon is convinced that his tainted soul is the reason he will never have someone to call his own. What if they’re both wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe these broken men with their jagged edges could somehow align perfectly to form something whole and beautiful. But will that realization come too late for them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone to Call My Own is the second book in the Road to Blissville series. These books can be read as standalone or as part of the series. The author first introduced these characters in the Curl Up and Dye Mysteries, but it isn’t necessary to read that series first. This book contains sexually explicit material and is intended for adults 18 and older</description>

  <description>Kyle Vaughn had three goals in life: become a vet, find the man of his dreams, and start a family. He easily checked off the first item on the list when he took over his grandfather’s veterinary practice. Too bad he wasn’t as lucky in love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chaz Hamilton took a leap of faith when he decided to pursue a career in writing, but one best seller didn’t mean he could quit his day job. All work and no play threatened to make Chaz a very dull man when the only romantic action he saw was in the pages of his manuscript. Too bad he couldn’t write his own happily every after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Circumstances pushed the two men together, and one magical kiss beneath fireworks and stars changed everything. Kyle knew his luck had finally turned around and Chaz found a man far better than any book boyfriend ever written. There was just one problem. Chaz has kept a secret from Kyle that could ruin their chance at a beautiful life together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyle and Chaz learn that the best-laid plans often go awry, the heart has a mind of its own, and the greatest love is unscripted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The books in the Road to Blissville series can be read either as standalone books or as part of the series. This book contains sexually explicit material and is intended for mature adults 18 and older.</description>

  <description>It’s supposed to be the most wonderful time of year for Gabe and Josh Roman-Wyatt as they celebrate their first holidays as fathers, but someone’s war on St. Nick threatens to ruin their holly jolly Christmas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Norman Rockwell holiday they had envisioned implodes and shenanigans ensue in true Josh and Gabe style, but that only makes the couple more determined to rejoice in the love and joy they have found in one another. A Black Friday showdown, two foul-mouthed birds, one lumbersexual, ugly Christmas sweaters aplenty, four invading grandparents, and a sexy twist on an advent calendar lead up to oh, holy nights. Catch up with your favorite characters and meet some new faces in a tale that is sure to make you feel as warm as Josh’s creamy, hot-buttered rum concoction. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A Dye Hard Holiday is a funny story about two fathers trying to hold it all together as they juggle busy careers and family life while planning the perfect holiday season. Will they be rocking around the Christmas tree or will it be a blue Christmas? The book is approximately 50,000 words long and is not intended as a standalone book. This supplements the Curl Up and Dye Mysteries series, which should be read in order. This book contains sexually explicit material and is intended for adults 18 and over. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A phone call in the middle of the night forces Detective Gabriel Wyatt out of his warm bed and into the frigid night to identify the body of a murdered man whose wallet contains Gabe’s business card instead of an ID. That night sets off a chain of events that chills Gabe to his bones when it appears that the killer has set his eyes on a new target – Josh Roman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh comes face-to-face with a painful reminder of his past just when he’s ready to acknowledge that his feelings for Gabe go way beyond liking the man. How can he trust that his feelings for Gabe are right when before he’d always been so wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Josh and Gabe finally acknowledge that what they have is something to live for or will they allow danger and doubts to destroy their chance at something amazing? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to Dye For is book 2 in the Curl Up and Dye Mysteries series. These books are written to be read in order. They contain sexually explicit material and are intended for adults 18 and older.</description>

He expects a peaceful existence once he moves from Miami, Florida, but that’s the last thing he finds. Instead, Gabe discovers murder, mayhem, and one smart-mouthed stylist he can’t get out of his head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh “Jazz” Roman is a small-town business owner with big dreams and an attitude to match. He finds himself in the middle of a case that brings the dreamy detective to the front door of his Curl Up and Dye salon.

Can Gabe convince Josh to let down his guard or will Josh let past hurts destroy his chance at a happy future?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dyeing to be Loved is the first book in the Curl Up and Dye Mystery series. These books are written to be read in order. They contain sexually explicit material and are intended for adults 18 and older.</description>

  <description>Forty-five-year-old English professor Nathan Qells is very good at making people feel important. What he’s not very good at is sticking around afterward. He’s a nice guy; he just doesn’t feel things the way other people do. So even after all the time he’s spent taking care of Michael, the kid across the hall, he doesn’t realize that Michael’s mob muscle uncle and guardian, Andreo Fiore, has slowly been falling in love with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dreo has bigger problems than getting Nate to see him as a potential partner. He’s raising his nephew, trying to leave his unsavory job, and starting his own business, a process made infinitely more difficult when a series of hits takes out some key underworld players. Still, Dreo is determined to build a life he can be proud of—a life with Nate as a cornerstone. A life that is starting to look like exactly what Nate has been seeking. Unfortunately for Dreo—and for Nate—the last hits were just part of a major reorganization, and Dreo’s obvious love for Nate has made him a target too.</description>

  <description>Trevan Bean has a job that’s going from illegal to frightening, a boyfriend who may not be in his right mind, and a guardian angel who might actually be evil incarnate. Add to that the reappearance of his boyfriend’s estranged family, death threats, kidnapping, and the struggle of saving money to realize a dream, and Trevan has a lot on his plate. But Trevan is up to the challenge: he promised Landry a happily ever after, and Landry’s going to have it if it kills him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Landry Carter was a broken doll when they met two years ago but has grown into a partner who can stand at Trevan’s side… most of the time. Now that Trevan’s life just got scary—and Landry just got himself kidnapped—Trevan has to hope Landry’s love stays strong through this newest challenge, because the happily ever after won’t happen if Trevan has to go it alone.</description>

  <description>Second from The Vault &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Terrence Moss. Conrad Harris. Gold Team Leader. Darius Hawthorne. The Vault. Juggling all these names would bother some, but for Darius, it’s business as usual. When he closes a chapter in his life, he leaves a name—and the people associated with it—behind. He’s managed to keep a few colleagues, even fewer friends, and no companionship through his forty-plus years… but that’s now changing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The newest chapter of his life is bringing serious change: a stable home, a recovered identity, an unlikely family, and now a chance encounter with the one man Darius ever loved: Efrem Lahm. The reasons they parted are still valid, and there’s no way they can trust each other. But Efrem has already decided he won’t let Darius go… and Darius will have to decide if he wants to take a chance with his heart this late in the day.</description>

  <description>Mob enforcer Ceaton Mercer has killed a lot of people in a lot of different ways - he stashed the last two bodies in a toolshed belonging to a sweetheart marine researcher in an idyllic island community - but he's really not such a bad guy. Over time he's found a home of sorts, and he even learns he's found a place in the hearts of the people he works with...at least enough so that they won't put a bullet in his head because he's outlived his usefulness to the boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he never thought he'd find one day could change his life, and he's about to discover how wrong he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because in a single day, he meets the man who looks to be &lt;i&gt;the one,&lt;/i&gt; the love of his life. It's an improbable idea - a man who deals in death finding love - but it's like it's meant to be. That single day gets weirder and troubles pile up, forcing Ceaton to take a hard look at his dreary life and accept that one day &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; change everything, especially himself. His future might be brighter than he expects - if he can stay alive long enough to find out.</description>

  <description>Noel Chandler had a good reason for leaving the L.A.P.D. for New Orleans, but when he walks into a burned out Garden District mansion, he discovers there are some things he can’t outrun. The spooks can find him anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the resident historian for the cable show &lt;i&gt;Haunts and Hoaxes&lt;/i&gt;, Professor Adam Morales keeps an open mind about the supernatural. Or that’s what he tells himself, until he meets a man who puts that principle to the test. Noel’s smart, sexy, and has killer cop instincts. One glance from his bedroom eyes has Adam ready to believe anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is Noel haunted, crazy, or just another hoax?</description>

  <description>⚜&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;It's Mardi Gras, cher, but this year le bon temps kick off with murder...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For generations, the White Monks have treated the vampire Thaddeus Dupont as a weapon in their battle against demons. However, when a prominent matron drops dead at a party, Thaddeus and his lover Sarasija are asked to find her killer. Their investigation leads them to an old southern family with connections everywhere: Louisiana politics, big business, the Church, and an organization just as secret as the White Monks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, an esoteric text containing spells for demon-summoning has disappeared, Thaddeus is losing control of &lt;i&gt;le monstre&lt;/i&gt;, and Sara is troubled by disturbing dreams. These nightmares could be a side-effect of dating a vampire, or they could be a remnant of his brush with evil. As the nights wear on, Sara fears they are a manifestation of something darker - a secret that could destroy his relationship with Thaddeus.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Silent night, holy hell.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thaddeus and Sarasija are spending the holidays on the bayou, and while the vampire's idea of Christmas cheer doesn't quite match his assistant's, they're working on a compromise. Before they can get the tree trimmed, they're interrupted by the appearance of the feu follet. The ghostly lights appear in the swamp at random and lead even the locals astray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the townsfolk link the phenomenon to the return of their most reclusive neighbor, suspicion falls on Thaddeus. These lights aren't bringing glad tidings, and if Thad and Sara can't find their source, the feu follet might herald a holiday tragedy for the whole town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This holiday novella can be enjoyed alone or as book 1.5 of the Hours of the Night Series. &lt;b&gt;Bonfire &lt;/b&gt;takes place the December after the events in &lt;b&gt;Vespers&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Thaddeus Dupont has had over eighty years to forget...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vampire spends his nights chanting the Liturgy of the Hours and ruthlessly disciplines those unnatural urges he's vowed never again to indulge. He is at the command of the White Monks, who summon him at will to destroy demons. In return, the monks provide for his sustenance and promise the return of his immortal soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Sarasija Mishra's most compelling job qualification might be his type O blood...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 22-year-old college grad just moved across the country to work for some recluse he can't even find on the internet. Sounds sketchy, but the salary is awesome and he can't afford to be picky. On arrival he discovers a few details his contract neglected to mention, like the alligator-infested swamp, the demon attacks, and the nature of his employer's "special diet". A smart guy would leave, but after one look into Dupont's mesmerizing eyes, Sarasija can't seem to walk away. Too bad his boss expected "Sara" to be a girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Falling in love is hard at any age...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vampire can't fight his hungers forever, especially since Sara's brought him light, laughter and a very masculine heat. After yielding to temptation, Thaddeus must make a choice. Killing demons may save his soul, but keeping the faith will cost him his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vespers is a complete novel with no cliffhanger. It can be enjoyed as a standalone or read as the first book in the Hours of the Night series.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Psychic medium Vincent Night and his lover Henry Strauss have spent months striving to uncover the dark secret harbored by Vincent’s dead mentor, James Dunne. Their only clue comes from a journal: Dunne was seeking to restore the Grand Harmonium, an artifact meant to breach the walls between life and death. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fate seems to intervene when Henry and Vincent are offered a job investigating the haunted orphanage where Dunne lived as a youth. But the ghosts of the orphanage don’t rest easily, and the lovers soon find themselves in a battle to locate the Grand Harmonium before it falls into the wrong hands—and unleashes evil upon the world.</description>

  <description>Nothing up his sleeves. Nothing but murder… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jason West, hot-shot special agent with the FBI’s Art Crime Team, is at the Wyoming home of Behavioral Analysis Unit Chief Sam Kennedy, recuperating from a recent hit-and-run accident, when he’s asked to consult on the theft of a priceless collection of vintage magic posters. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But before Jason can say “presto change-o,” the owner of the art collection turns up murdered in a National Forest. &lt;br /&gt;When the dead man is revealed to be the Kubla Khanjurer, a much-hated part-time magician accused of revealing the highly guarded secrets of professional illusionists, it seems clear this is a simple revenge killing—until Jason realizes an earlier suspicious death at the trendy magic club Top Hat White Rabbit might be part of the same larger and more sinister pattern. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;All those late night conversations when Sam had maybe a drink too many or Jason was half falling asleep. All those playful, provocative comments about what they’d do when they finally met up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, here they were.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing Jason West, an ambitious young FBI Special Agent with the Art Crimes Team, wants--or needs--is his uncertain and unacknowledged romantic relationship with irascible legendary Behavioral Analysis Unit Chief Sam Kennedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it’s starting to feel like Sam is not thrilled with the idea either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But personal feelings must be put aside when Sam requests Jason’s help to catch a deranged killer targeting wealthy, upscale art collectors. A killer whose calling card is a series of grotesque paintings depicting the murders.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An omega who wants nothing to do with Alphas meets an Alpha who feels he’ll never measure up.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Myron has never fit the mold of a typical omega. For one thing, he has no interest in settling down with anyone other than another omega. When the woman he loves leaves him for a far more conventional mate, he takes a job he’s hardly qualified for just to get out of the country. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The last thing he’s expecting to find in London is a mate. Especially not the eccentric Alpha CEO of the infamous Futurus Initiative. Charles proves to be an equally unconventional Alpha, and the need he stirs in Myron is both unexpected and impossible to ignore. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;~ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charles has given his life to his controversial research at the Futurus Initiative, and his promotion to CEO has been one nightmare after another. Myron is far from the ideal of a typical omega spokesman, but he proves to be the breath of fresh air the company—and Charles—needs so desperately. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One night makes Charles question everything. His choices, the voice that tells him he’ll always be alone, and his very identity as an Alpha. Meeting his destined mate leads to the revelation that he may not be a defective Alpha at all, but rather something else entirely. Now if only Myron felt the same way… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is an approximately ~68k-word story featuring a most unusual Alpha-omega pairing. Contains steamy scenes meant for adult audiences only.</description>

  <description>Psychic Tennyson Grimm was kicked out of his house and disowned by his religious parents when he came out to them as gay and psychic. The last thing Tennyson’s father said before the teenager boarded a Greyhound bus to Boston was that his son was dead to him. Flash forward thirteen years later, Tennyson couldn’t have been more surprised when he woke to find the newly dead spirit of his father sitting on the end of his bed. David Grimm had one request of his estranged son. Go to Kansas and reunite with his mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cold Case Detective Ronan O’Mara was all for this family reunion. Still recovering from injuries suffered during his last criminal investigation, he figures they’ll fly to Kansas, bury Tennyson’s father, and the hatchet with Kaye Grimm, then come back to Boston in time to plan their upcoming wedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Union Chapel Sheriff comes to Tennyson and Ronan with a years-old cold case he’d like them to look into, the Boston-based duo can’t turn down taking a peek at the case file. Tennyson is easily able to figure out whodunit, but the sheriff is leery to believe in his gift, bringing old prejudices back to life, and leaving Ronan to hunt for physical evidence the killer left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Ronan be able to solve the cold case and help Tennyson resolve the decade-old feud with his mother? Or will the tornado, with its sights set on the tiny town of Union Chapel, Kansas, make the other questions moot?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Nicholas wants nothing to do with omegas, and Avery has already signed a contract binding him to another Alpha. Fate has other plans for them both.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the omega spokesman for the infamous Futurus Initiative, Avery is a controversial figure who’s used to being envied, occasionally despised and always the center of attention. His kidnapping at the hands of the twisted omega at the helm of the radical anti-Futurus group known as Epsilon shook his perfect world to the core, and his abnormally conventional parents no longer know what to do with him. In a last-ditch effort to save their son’s reputation—and his engagement to a prestigious politician—Avery's desperate family sends him to the small, quaint pack of Southbend for some much-needed rest and recovery. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Avery arrives in Southbend, he finds the Meyer household anything but welcoming and he immediately clashes with the rakishly reluctant head of the household. Nicholas might be a brilliant lawyer with good looks and charm in abundance, but he makes no secret of the fact that Avery is persona non grata in his pack. How is Avery supposed to heal his own wounds when an Alpha who looks at every omega with disdain makes him question everything, including his participation in the breeding program he’s devoted his life to promoting? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;~ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nicholas has it all on the surface—rising-star status as an attorney with his own practice, a sizable inheritance and the option of going home with any omega he chooses at the end of the night—but beneath the mask of his status, he hides a secret that makes him feel unworthy of the title of Alpha. Past abuse has left him with a deep-seated revulsion towards omegas, the very class of shifter he’s supposed to crave. He uses work and meaningless flings with other Alphas and betas to distract himself from the family life he doesn’t believe he deserves, but in the wake of his estranged father’s death, Nicholas is called home to take on a role he never wanted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forced to give up his high-profile career and take the reins of his family’s pack, Nicholas finds himself wholly unprepared to fill the shoes of the man he hated. Because fate isn’t cruel enough, the Spirits choose this moment to send him his destined mate—a charming yet infuriatingly stubborn omega he can never love or even claim. At least, that’s what he thinks until he realizes that the very traits that repel him from other omegas draw him to Avery in a way he finds as bewildering as it is intoxicating.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When the cards are stacked against you, the Kings will even the odds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ex-Special Forces soldier Anston “Ace” Sharpe is fighting a different battle these days—one involving the world of private security across the state of Florida. As part owner of Four Kings Security, Ace and his fellow Kings tackle everything from armed transport and investigations to cyber intelligence and executive protection. Cocky, fearless, and brash, Ace isn’t afraid to take risks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of working alongside his father, Colton Connolly is ready to take the helm at Connolly Maritime, but his father’s retirement is put on hold when Colton begins receiving death threats. If that isn’t bad enough, his father signs a contract with Four Kings Security to provide Colton with round-the-clock protection, despite his adamant refusal. Colton’s life has been turned upside down, the last thing he needs is a shadow, especially in the form of infuriating, sexy-as-sin Ace Sharpe, who seems to be on a mission to drive Colton mad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sparks fly the moment Colton and Ace meet on a sultry night club dance floor. But getting involved with a client, even one as fiery and beautiful as Colton Connolly, is a line Ace is unwilling to cross. Colton might be attracted to Ace, but he’d been burned before. He might be willing to put his life in Ace’s hands, but not his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Florida nights heat up, so does their passion, and Ace and Colton are faced with a difficult choice—take the plunge and risk it all, or play it safe and walk away?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Ace can keep a deadly threat from robbing Colton of a future….</description>

  <description>"The right way is the one where we end up together...And to do that, we need to survive this." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A brilliant, obsessive mind is the heart of Sebastian Seaver’s genius. It might also be the thing that costs him everything he’s created and everyone he’s ever loved. Consumed with the need to destroy Alexei Stornovich, the Russian mob boss who murdered his fiancée and parents, nothing can turn Bas from his plans of revenge until he’s eradicated every last one of them. By any means necessary, and at any cost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Drew McMann learned early that the key to success is control. Control carried him through law school and helped him keep Seaver Tech together through tragedy. It helped him survive the brutal murder of his sister Amy, his parents’ divorce, and the revelation that the seeds of their destruction had been planted by someone he had considered family. It’s how he’s hidden his love from his best friend Bas for more than half their lives. And now it’s how he’s going save Bas from himself and finally get his family of friends free from Alexei’s clutches. Drew has a plan for everything… Until the kiss. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Drew loses control one reckless, drunken evening and his true feelings for Bas are revealed, he tries desperately to contain the damage and keep their friendship on track, even as decades of lies and half-truths seek to tear them apart. With Alexei targeting them and their friends, Drew and Bas are forced to rely on each other more than ever. But as danger closes in on them, can they sacrifice their needs for logic and control, and recognize that the only &lt;i&gt; right &lt;/i&gt; way to move forward is the one in which they’re together? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>It’s been four years since the tragedy that claimed the Mountain Ridge Alpha and Mel, the mutual mate of Alpha Hassan Amari and the beta Toval. As a mated Alpha-beta pair, Toval and Hassan have managed to defy the odds and come through tragedy stronger than ever, despite the shroud of secrecy that surrounds Mel’s death. Strange letters from an impossible sender throw the fragile balance of their healing into question. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alphas are dying in Europe, and a group of omegas with a deadly mission has taken credit. They call themselves Epsilon, and they’re hell-bent on overthrowing the hierarchical system that has ruled the shifter world for as long as anyone can remember. Meanwhile, the success of the European Council breeding program, known colloquially as the Futurus Initiative, has increased pressure on stateside Alphas to conform in order to save their dwindling population. Hassan and Toval’s joint effort to fight the Initiative seems to have failed, but Epsilon has less peaceful methods in mind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One letter changes everything. The leader of Epsilon chooses Hassan and Toval to deliver his ultimatum: Abandon the initiative, or every pack Alpha in the Council will die. Toval and Hassan find themselves the unwitting messengers of this twisted message, pitted against a corrupt Council and a ghost of the past who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Time will tell if their love can withstand this dangerous new alliance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is book 10 of the Mountain Shifters Series and contains story elements that are meant to be read in the context of the events in the rest of the series. This work is meant for mature audiences only. HEA, no cliffhanger.</description>

  <description>Sometimes the shortest distance between ruin and restoration, between lies and truth, is the long way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Damon Fitzpatrick’s life is in ruins. Vilified as the pilot responsible for the plane crash that killed Levi and Charlotte Seaver, Damon lost everything – his reputation, his livelihood, his family, and his future. And Damon knows exactly who to blame - none other than powerful Senator Emmett Shaw, the criminal mastermind behind the crash. No matter how long it takes, Damon is determined to get justice, and to get his life back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cain Shaw is the poster child for success. As the young, rich, handsome son of a picture-perfect family and the face of his father’s conservative political campaign, he has a bright future ahead of him. But the senator has been hiding secrets that threaten to crack that flawless facade - secrets he’s killed to protect. Cain is determined to make sure no one else gets hurt, even if it means keeping his own long-held secret. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Damon’s quest for justice goes awry, Cain becomes the older man's unlikely savior, and the two are thrown together in a hunt for evidence that will free them both. But as the road gets longer, the stakes get higher, and the danger that stalks them draws closer, they must find the strength to trust one another... because the one complication they can’t outrun is each other.</description>
