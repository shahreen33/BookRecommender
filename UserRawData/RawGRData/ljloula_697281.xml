  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Movie star 101: A smile hides all pain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quellcrist King has been playing a part his entire life. The more famous he becomes, the more he hides. The only person he ever let see the real him rose with him from nothing to the very top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were the king and queen of Hollywood— and then she wanted a divorce. The only way to survive his depression is to bury himself in work. If he can be a character, maybe he won’t have to remember himself. A gay role can’t be any different than playing a straight one, can it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But instead of finding solace in the character, he finds it in his costar. Hale becomes his best friend, his lifeline, the light in his darkness. Quell is forced to examine everything he thought he knew about himself while filming intimate scenes with Hale that feel more real than anything ever has before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s lived his entire life following the script. What would life be like unscripted?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A daughter’s tale of living in the thrall of her magnetic, complicated mother, and the chilling consequences of her complicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On a hot July night on Cape Cod when Adrienne was fourteen, her mother, Malabar, woke her at midnight with five simple words that would set the course of both of their lives for years to come: &lt;i&gt;Ben Souther just kissed me.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Adrienne instantly became her mother’s confidante and helpmate, blossoming in the sudden light of her attention, and from then on, Malabar came to rely on her daughter to help orchestrate what would become an epic affair with her husband’s closest friend. The affair would have calamitous consequences for everyone involved, impacting Adrienne’s life in profound ways, driving her into a precarious marriage of her own, and then into a deep depression. Only years later will she find the strength to embrace her life—and her mother—on her own terms.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wild Game&lt;/i&gt; is a brilliant, timeless memoir about how the people close to us can break our hearts simply because they have access to them, and the lies we tell in order to justify the choices we make. It’s a remarkable story of resilience, a reminder that we need not be the parents our parents were to us.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Cixin Liu, the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling and Hugo award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Three Body Problem, &lt;/i&gt; comes a new science fiction masterpiece. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In those days, Earth was a planet in space.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In those days, Beijing was a city on Earth.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On this night, history as known to humanity came to an end.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight light years away, a star has died, creating a supernova event that showers Earth in deadly levels of radiation. Within a year, everyone over the age of thirteen will die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so the countdown begins. Parents apprentice their children and try to pass on the knowledge they'll need to keep the world running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the last generation may not want to carry the legacy of their parents' world. And though they imagine a better, brighter world, they may bring about a future so dark humanity won't survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the first book in a brilliant new fantasy series, books that aren't finished by their authors reside in the Library of the Unwritten in Hell, and it is up to the Librarian to track down any restless characters who emerge from those unfinished stories.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many years ago, Claire was named Head Librarian of the Unwritten Wing—a neutral space in Hell where all the stories unfinished by their authors reside. Her job consists mainly of repairing and organizing books, but also of keeping an eye on restless stories that risk materializing as characters and escaping the library. When a Hero escapes from his book and goes in search of his author, Claire must track and capture him with the help of former muse and current assistant Brevity and nervous demon courier Leto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what should have been a simple retrieval goes horrifyingly wrong when the terrifyingly angelic Ramiel attacks them, convinced that they hold the Devil's Bible. The text of the Devil's Bible is a powerful weapon in the power struggle between Heaven and Hell, so it falls to the librarians to find a book with the power to reshape the boundaries between Heaven, Hell ... and Earth.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;An Air Force loadmaster in the Vietnam War is shot out of the sky, then saved by falling into a banyan. An artist inherits a hundred years of photographic portraits, all of the same doomed American chestnut. A hard-partying undergraduate in the late 1980s electrocutes herself, dies, and is sent back into life by creatures of air and light. A hearing- and speech-impaired scientist discovers that trees are communicating with one another. These four, and five other strangers—each summoned in different ways by trees—are brought together in a last and violent stand to save the continent’s few remaining acres of virgin forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his twelfth novel, National Book Award winner Richard Powers delivers a sweeping, impassioned novel of activism and resistance that is also a stunning evocation of—and paean to—the natural world. From the roots to the crown and back to the seeds, &lt;em&gt;The Overstory&lt;/em&gt; unfolds in concentric rings of interlocking fables that range from antebellum New York to the late twentieth-century Timber Wars of the Pacific Northwest and beyond, exploring the essential conflict on this planet: the one taking place between humans and nonhumans. There is a world alongside ours—vast, slow, interconnected, resourceful, magnificently inventive, and almost invisible to us. This is the story of a handful of people who learn how to see that world and who are drawn up into its unfolding catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Overstory&lt;/em&gt; is a book for all readers who despair of humanity’s self-imposed separation from the rest of creation and who hope for the transformative, regenerating possibility of a homecoming. If the trees of this earth could speak, what would they tell us? &lt;em&gt;"Listen. There’s something you need to hear."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Amaryllis Fox's riveting memoir tells the story of her ten years in the most elite clandestine ops unit of the CIA, hunting the world's most dangerous terrorists in sixteen countries while marrying and giving birth to a daughter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amaryllis Fox was in her last year as an undergraduate at Oxford studying theology and international law when her writing mentor Daniel Pearl was captured and beheaded. Galvanized by this brutality, Fox applied to a master's program in conflict and terrorism at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service, where she created an algorithm that predicted, with uncanny certainty, the likelihood of a terrorist cell arising in any village around the world. At twenty-one, she was recruited by the CIA. Her first assignment was reading and analyzing hundreds of classified cables a day from foreign governments and synthesizing them into daily briefs for the president. Her next assignment was at the Iraq desk in the Counterterrorism center. At twenty-two, she was fast-tracked into advanced operations training, sent from Langley to "the Farm," where she lived for six months in a simulated world learning how to use a Glock, how to get out of flexicuffs while locked in the trunk of a car, how to withstand torture, and the best ways to commit suicide in case of captivity. At the end of this training she was deployed as a spy under non-official cover--the most difficult and coveted job in the field as an art dealer specializing in tribal and indigenous art and sent to infiltrate terrorist networks in remote areas of the Middle East and Asia. &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Life Undercover&lt;/i&gt; is exhilarating, intimate, fiercely intelligent--an impossible to put down record of an extraordinary life, and of Amaryllis Fox's astonishing courage and passion.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;At the heart of a mystery unfolding in space, the opposing forces make a treacherous journey between Earth and Mars.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In space, mutiny means death—that’s why Inspector General Park Yerim is taking her investigation so seriously. The alleged mutineer is Captain Nicolau Aames, whose command of the massive Earth-Mars vessel &lt;i&gt;Aldrin&lt;/i&gt; has come under fire. The vast System Initiative says he disobeyed orders, but his crew swears he’s in the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;En route to Mars, Park gathers testimony from the &lt;i&gt;Aldrin&lt;/i&gt;’s diverse crew, painting a complex picture of Aames’s character: his heroism, his failures, even his personal passions. As the investigation unfolds, Park finds herself in the thrall of powerful interests, each pushing and pulling her in a fiery cosmic dance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corruption, conflicting loyalties, and clashing accounts make it nearly impossible to see the truth in fifty million miles of darkness, and Park faces danger from every direction. All eyes are on her: one way or another, her findings will have astronomical implications for the &lt;i&gt;Aldrin&lt;/i&gt; and the future of space travel.</description>

  <description>The story is supposed to be over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simon Snow did everything he was supposed to do. He beat the villain. He won the war. He even fell in love. Now comes the good part, right? Now comes the happily ever after… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;So why can’t Simon Snow get off the couch?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What he needs, according to his best friend, is a change of scenery. He just needs to see himself in a new light…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s how Simon and Penny and Baz end up in a vintage convertible, tearing across the American West.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They find trouble, of course. (Dragons, vampires, skunk-headed things with shotguns.) And they get lost. They get so lost, they start to wonder whether they ever knew where they were headed in the first place… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Wayward Son&lt;/i&gt;, Rainbow Rowell has written a book for everyone who ever wondered what happened to the Chosen One after he saved the day. And a book for everyone who was ever more curious about the second kiss than the first. It’s another helping of sour cherry scones with an absolutely decadent amount of butter.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on, Simon Snow. Your hero’s journey might be over – but your life has just begun.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Westworld&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/i&gt; in this stunning fantasy adventure from debut author Charlotte Nicole Davis.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aster, the protector&lt;br /&gt;Violet, the favorite&lt;br /&gt;Tansy, the medic&lt;br /&gt;Mallow, the fighter&lt;br /&gt;Clementine, the catalyst&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD LUCK GIRLS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The country of Arketta calls them Good Luck Girls--they know their luck is anything but. Sold to a "welcome house" as children and branded with cursed markings. Trapped in a life they would never have chosen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Clementine accidentally murders a man, the girls risk a dangerous escape and harrowing journey to find freedom, justice, and revenge in a country that wants them to have none of those things. Pursued by Arketta's most vicious and powerful forces, both human and inhuman, their only hope lies in a bedtime story passed from one Good Luck Girl to another, a story that only the youngest or most desperate would ever believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's going to take more than luck for them all to survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Wilson’s best book yet—a moving and uproarious novel about a woman who finds meaning in her life when she begins caring for two children with remarkable and disturbing abilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lillian and Madison were unlikely roommates and yet inseparable friends at their elite boarding school. But then Lillian had to leave the school unexpectedly in the wake of a scandal and they’ve barely spoken since. Until now, when Lillian gets a letter from Madison pleading for her help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madison’s twin stepkids are moving in with her family and she wants Lillian to be their caretaker. However, there’s a catch: the twins spontaneously combust when they get agitated, flames igniting from their skin in a startling but beautiful way. Lillian is convinced Madison is pulling her leg, but it’s the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking of her dead-end life at home, the life that has consistently disappointed her, Lillian figures she has nothing to lose. Over the course of one humid, demanding summer, Lillian and the twins learn to trust each other—and stay cool—while also staying out of the way of Madison’s buttoned-up politician husband. Surprised by her own ingenuity yet unused to the intense feelings of protectiveness she feels for them, Lillian ultimately begins to accept that she needs these strange children as much as they need her—urgently and fiercely. Couldn’t this be the start of the amazing life she’d always hoped for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With white-hot wit and a big, tender heart, Kevin Wilson has written his best book yet—a most unusual story of parental love.</description>

  <description>In the middle of the night, in a house on a quiet street in suburban Minneapolis, intruders silently murder Luke Ellis’s parents and load him into a black SUV. The operation takes less than two minutes. Luke will wake up at The Institute, in a room that looks just like his own, except there’s no window. And outside his door are other doors, behind which are other kids with special talents—telekinesis and telepathy—who got to this place the same way Luke did: Kalisha, Nick, George, Iris, and ten-year-old Avery Dixon. They are all in Front Half. Others, Luke learns, graduated to Back Half, “like the roach motel,” Kalisha says. “You check in, but you don’t check out.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this most sinister of institutions, the director, Mrs. Sigsby, and her staff are ruthlessly dedicated to extracting from these children the force of their extranormal gifts. There are no scruples here. If you go along, you get tokens for the vending machines. If you don’t, punishment is brutal. As each new victim disappears to Back Half, Luke becomes more and more desperate to get out and get help. But no one has ever escaped from the Institute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As psychically terrifying as Firestarter, and with the spectacular kid power of It, The Institute is Stephen King’s gut-wrenchingly dramatic story of good vs. evil in a world where the good guys don’t always win.</description>

  <description>In this brilliant sequel to &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale, &lt;/i&gt;acclaimed author Margaret Atwood answers the questions that have tantalized readers for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the van door slammed on Offred's future at the end of &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/i&gt;, readers had no way of telling what lay ahead for her--freedom, prison or death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;i&gt;The Testaments&lt;/i&gt;, the wait is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margaret Atwood's sequel picks up the story more than fifteen years after Offred stepped into the unknown, with the explosive testaments of three female narrators from Gilead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in." --Margaret Atwood</description>

  <description>The unforgettable story of two young women—one living, one dead—dealing with loss, desire, and the fragility of the American dream during WWII.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Frankie’s mother died and her father left her and her siblings at an orphanage in Chicago, it was supposed to be only temporary—just long enough for him to get back on his feet and be able to provide for them once again. That’s why Frankie's not prepared for the day that he arrives for his weekend visit with a new woman on his arm and out-of-state train tickets in his pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Frankie and her sister, Toni, are abandoned alongside so many other orphans—two young, unwanted women doing everything they can to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as the embers of the Great Depression are kindled into the fires of World War II, and the shadows of injustice, poverty, and death walk the streets in broad daylight, it will be up to Frankie to find something worth holding on to in the ruins of this shattered America—every minute of every day spent wondering if the life she's able to carve out will be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;I will admit I do not know the answer. But I will be watching, waiting to find out.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;That’s what ghosts do.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>Ben Folds is a celebrated American singer-songwriter, beloved for songs such as "Brick," "You Don't Know Me," "Rockin' the Suburbs," and "The Luckiest," and is the former frontman of the alternative rock band Ben Folds Five. But Folds will be the first to tell you he's an unconventional icon, more normcore than hardcore. Now, in his first book, Folds looks back at his life so far in a charming and wise chronicle of his artistic coming of age, infused with the wry observations of a natural storyteller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the title chapter, "A Dream About Lightning Bugs," Folds recalls his earliest childhood dream--and realizes how much it influenced his understanding of what it means to be an artist. In "Measure Twice, Cut Once" he learns to resist the urge to skip steps during the creative process. In "Hall Pass" he recounts his 1970s North Carolina working-class childhood, and in "Cheap Lessons" he returns to the painful life lessons he learned the hard way--but that luckily didn't kill him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his inimitable voice, both relatable and thought-provoking, Folds digs deep into the life experiences that shaped him, imparting hard-earned wisdom about both art and life. Collectively, these stories embody the message Folds has been singing about for years: Smile like you've got nothing to prove, because it hurts to grow up, and life flies by in seconds.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this sequel to &lt;i&gt;The Line Between&lt;/i&gt;, cult escapee Wynter Roth and ex-soldier Chase Miller emerge from their bunker to find a country ravaged by disease, and Wynter is the only one who can save it. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six months after vanishing into an underground silo with sixty others, Wynter and Chase emerge to find the area abandoned. There is no sign of Noah and the rest of the group that was supposed to greet them when they emerged—the same people Wynter was counting on to help her locate the IV antibiotics her gravely ill friend, Julie, needs in order to live.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As the clock ticks down on Julie’s life, Wynter and Chase embark on a desperate search for medicine and answers. But what they find is not a nation on the cusp of recovery thanks to the promising new vaccine Wynter herself had a hand in creating, but one decimated by disease. What happened while they were underground?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; With food and water in limited supply and their own survival in question, Chase and Wynter must venture further and further from the silo. Aided by an enigmatic mute named Otto, they come face-to-face with a society radically changed by global pandemic, where communities scrabble to survive under rogue leaders and cities are war zones. As hope fades by the hour and Wynter learns the terrible truth of the last six months, she is called upon once again to help save the nation she no longer recognizes—a place so dark she’s no longer sure it can even survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I didn’t mean to kidnap the groom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was an accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least I didn't take much time to plan it. It was more of a spur of the moment kidnapping. Does that count?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minute, the town’s bad boy is standing at the altar about to marry the world’s most evil kindergarten teacher. The next, he’s passed out in my Vespa sidecar with his bride hot on our tail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I didn't have a choice! I couldn't stand by and watch Jace O’Dell be blackmailed into a loveless marriage. And besides, what’s a little kidnapping between friends? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so maybe we’re not just friends...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And maybe I can’t quit thinking about that night at his bar when he closed up early and had me on the rocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And maybe this crazy stunt is going to blow up in both of our faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it does, I’m blaming the moonshine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the only thing I’m hammered on when it comes to Jace is love—straight up, no chaser.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An extinct disease re-emerges from the melting Alaskan permafrost to cause madness in its victims. For recent apocalyptic cult escapee Wynter Roth, it’s the end she’d always been told was coming.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Wynter Roth is turned out of New Earth, a self-contained doomsday cult on the American prairie, she emerges into a world poised on the brink of madness as a mysterious outbreak of rapid early onset dementia spreads across the nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Wynter struggles to start over in a world she’s been taught to regard as evil, she finds herself face-to-face with the apocalypse she’s feared all her life—until the night her sister shows up at her doorstep with a set of medical samples. That night, Wynter learns there’s something far more sinister at play and that these samples are key to understanding the disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as the power grid fails and the nation descends into chaos, Wynter must find a way to get the samples to a lab in Colorado. Uncertain who to trust, she takes up with former military man Chase Miller, who has his own reasons for wanting to get close to the samples in her possession, and to Wynter herself.</description>

  <description>If anyone ever said being an adult was easy, they hadn't been one long enough. Diana Casillas can admit it: she doesn't know what the hell she's doing half the time. How she's made it through the last two years of her life without killing anyone is nothing short of a miracle. Being a grown-up wasn't supposed to be so hard. With a new house, two little boys she inherited the most painful possible way, a giant dog, a job she usually loves, more than enough family, and friends, she has almost everything she could ever ask for. Except for a boyfriend. Or a husband. But who needs either one of those?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/em&gt; and the Wayward Pines trilogy comes a relentless thriller about time, identity, and memory—his most ambitious, mind-boggling, irresistible work to date.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“An action-packed, brilliantly unique ride that had me up late and shirking responsibilities until I had devoured the last page . . . a fantastic read.”—Andy Weir, #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Memory makes reality. &lt;/em&gt;That’s what New York City cop Barry Sutton is learning as he investigates the devastating phenomenon the media has dubbed False Memory Syndrome—a mysterious affliction that drives its victims mad with memories of a life they never lived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neuroscientist Helena Smith already understands the power of memory. It’s why she’s dedicated her life to creating a technology that will let us preserve our most precious moments of our pasts. If she succeeds, anyone will be able to re-experience a first kiss, the birth of a child, the final moment with a dying parent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Barry searches for the truth, he comes face-to-face with an opponent more terrifying than any disease—a force that attacks not just our minds but the very fabric of the past. And as its effects begin to unmake the world as we know it, only he and Helena, working together, will stand a chance at defeating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how can they make a stand when reality itself is shifting and crumbling all around them? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A pioneering and groundbreaking work of narrative nonfiction that offers a dramatic new perspective on the history of humankind, showing how through millennia, the mosquito has been the single most powerful force in determining humanity's fate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why was gin and tonic the cocktail of choice for British colonists in India and Africa? What does Starbucks have to thank for its global domination? What has protected the lives of popes for millennia? Why did Scotland surrender its sovereignty to England? What was George Washington's secret weapon during the American Revolution?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer to all these questions, and many more, is the mosquito.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across our planet since the dawn of humankind, this nefarious pest, roughly the size and weight of a grape seed, has been at the frontlines of history as the grim reaper, the harvester of human populations, and the ultimate agent of historical change. As the mosquito transformed the landscapes of civilization, humans were unwittingly required to respond to its piercing impact and universal projection of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mosquito has determined the fates of empires and nations, razed and crippled economies, and decided the outcome of pivotal wars, killing nearly half of humanity along the way. She (only females bite) has dispatched an estimated 52 billion people from a total of 108 billion throughout our relatively brief existence. As the greatest purveyor of extermination we have ever known, she has played a greater role in shaping our human story than any other living thing with which we share our global village.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine for a moment a world without deadly mosquitoes, or any mosquitoes, for that matter? Our history and the world we know, or think we know, would be completely unrecognizable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driven by surprising insights and fast-paced storytelling, &lt;i&gt;The Mosquito&lt;/i&gt; is the extraordinary untold story of the mosquito's reign through human history and her indelible impact on our modern world order.</description>

  <description>“One of the best story collections of the past few years.” —&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;, starred review&lt;br /&gt;“16 hard-edged pieces that gleam like gems in a mosaic.” —&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, starred review&lt;br /&gt;“Kameron Hurley is a badass.” —Annalee Newitz, author of &lt;i&gt;Autonomous&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When renegade author Kameron Hurley (&lt;em&gt;The Light Brigade&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;The Stars Are Legion&lt;/em&gt;) takes you to the future, be prepared for the unexpected. Yes, it will be dangerous, frequently brutal, and often devastating. But it’s also savagely funny, deliriously strange, and absolutely brimming with adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In these edgy, unexpected tales, a body-hopping mercenary avenges his pet elephant, and an orphan falls in love with a sentient starship. Fighters ally to power a reality-bending engine, and a swamp-dwelling introvert tries to save the world—from her plague-casting former wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come meet Kameron Hurley in the future. The version she's created here is weirder—and far more hopeful—than you could ever imagine.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A REESE'S BOOK CLUB PICK &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set in Depression-era America, a breathtaking story of five extraordinary women and their remarkable journey through the mountains of Kentucky and beyond, from the author of &lt;i&gt;Me Before You&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice Wright marries handsome American Bennett Van Cleve hoping to escape her stifling life in England. But small-town Kentucky quickly proves equally claustrophobic, especially living alongside her overbearing father-in-law. So when a call goes out for a team of women to deliver books as part of Eleanor Roosevelt’s new traveling library, Alice signs on enthusiastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader, and soon Alice's greatest ally, is Margery, a smart-talking, self-sufficient woman who's never asked a man's permission for anything. They will be joined by three other singular women who become known as the Packhorse Librarians of Kentucky. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens to them--and to the men they love--becomes an unforgettable drama of loyalty, justice, humanity and passion. These heroic women refuse to be cowed by men or by convention. And though they face all kinds of dangers in a landscape that is at times breathtakingly beautiful, at others brutal, they’re committed to their job: bringing books to people who have never had any, arming them with facts that will change their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on a true story rooted in America’s past, &lt;i&gt;The Giver of Stars&lt;/i&gt; is unparalleled in its scope and epic in its storytelling. Funny, heartbreaking, enthralling, it is destined to become a modern classic--a richly rewarding novel of women’s friendship, of true love, and of what happens when we reach beyond our grasp for the great beyond.</description>

  <description>Cassie Hanwell was born for emergencies. As one of the only female firefighters in her Texas firehouse, she's seen her fair share of them, and she's excellent at dealing with other people's tragedies. But when her estranged and ailing mother asks her to uproot her life and move to Boston, it's an emergency of a kind Cassie never anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tough, old-school Boston firehouse is as different from Cassie's old job as it could possibly be. Hazing, a lack of funding, and poor facilities mean that the firemen aren't exactly thrilled to have a "lady" on the crew, even one as competent and smart as Cassie. Except for the handsome rookie, who doesn't seem to mind having Cassie around. But she can't think about that. Because she doesn't fall in love. And because of the advice her old captain gave her: &lt;i&gt;don't date firefighters. &lt;/i&gt;Cassie can feel her resolve slipping...but will she jeopardize her place in a career where she's worked so hard to be taken seriously?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katherine Center's &lt;i&gt;Things You Save in a Fire&lt;/i&gt; is a heartfelt, affecting novel about life, love, and the true meaning of courage.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A bounty hunter in over his head.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xin knows how to look out for himself, and he knows when something sounds too good to be true. But a forgotten planet filled with riches is too tempting to pass up. Fortunately Xin also knows someone who can back him up - if he doesn't arrest Xin first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; A government agent who's lost hope.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan Gray used to believe in a better future. Now he's not so sure. Then Xin walks in, with his dark eyes and maddening smirk, and Jonathan feels like he's waking up for the first time in months. Well, parts of him at least. He knows Xin is trouble, but when trouble looks this good it's impossible to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two men. One dangerous planet. To survive they need to trust each other - too bad neither of them does trust.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; Spaceships, daring heists, and interstellar intrigue!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since murderous AIs drove humanity from Earth more than a century before, people have been rebuilding civilization. That doesn't mean the galaxy is anywhere close to being civilized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A liar and a scoundrel - and he's the good guy.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that Captain Sebastian Garcia values most of all is his ship, &lt;i&gt;The Wayward Prince&lt;/i&gt;, and like most of his possessions, it's something that he stole. Now the ship's original owner has found Sebastian and he's looking to collect what he's owed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;When you want something stolen, call a professional.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ren is someone Sebastian never expected to see again, and the one he never could forget. But Ren's not offering forgiveness. Unless Sebastian can pull off an impossible heist on a distant planet he'll lose everything - including a second chance with the man he once betrayed and still cares for.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The galaxy’s a dangerous place. Best not to travel it alone. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s been over a century since the AIs rose up and attacked, driving humans from Earth and leaving them scattered across the galaxy. Humanity survives, but always fearful of the technology that allows them travel among the stars, never knowing when it may turn against them once more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;An interstellar fugitive.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Jaime Bashir, born with the ability to communicate telepathically with computers, his gifts are more of a curse. They also make him a target. On the run, he finds himself among a starship crew, one transporting a mysterious cargo. Even more intriguing is Rylan, the muscled guard watching his every move. Jaime has no reason to trust him, but nowhere else to turn. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A disgraced ex-soldier.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rylan Slate is looking to leave his past behind. Joining a crew of smugglers is one way to do it. But capturing Jaime is both an opportunity and a danger. He starts out as a prisoner, but then becomes something more, testing loyalties in ways Rylan never expected. Will regaining his honor mean betraying Jaime? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Through Jim Burden's endearing, smitten voice, we revisit the remarkable vicissitudes of immigrant life in the Nebraska heartland, with all its insistent bonds. Guiding the way are some of literature's most beguiling characters: the Russian brothers plagued by memories of a fateful sleigh ride, Antonia's desperately homesick father and self-indulgent mother, and the coy Lena Lingard. Holding the pastoral society's heart, of course, is the bewitching, free-spirited Antonia.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the Pulitzer Prize-winning Richard Russo--in his first stand-alone novel in a decade--comes a new revelation: a gripping story about the abiding yet complex power of friendship&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One beautiful September day, three sixty-six-year-old men convene on Martha's Vineyard, friends ever since meeting in college circa the sixties. They couldn't have been more different then, or even today--Lincoln's a commercial real estate broker, Teddy a tiny-press publisher, and Mickey a musician beyond his rockin' age. But each man holds his own secrets, in addition to the monumental mystery that none of them has ever stopped puzzling over since a Memorial Day weekend right here on the Vineyard in 1971. Now, forty-four years later, as this new weekend unfolds, three lives and that of a significant other are displayed in their entirety while the distant past confounds the present like a relentless squall of surprise and discovery. Shot through with Russo's trademark comedy and humanity, &lt;i&gt;Chances Are . . .&lt;/i&gt; also introduces a new level of suspense and menace that will quicken the reader's heartbeat throughout this absorbing saga of how friendship's bonds are every bit as constricting and rewarding as those of family or any other community.&lt;br /&gt; For both longtime fans and lucky newcomers, &lt;i&gt;Chances Are . . .&lt;/i&gt; is a stunning demonstration of a highly acclaimed author deepening and expanding his remarkable achievement.</description>

  <description>Ruby Santos knew exactly what she was getting herself into when she signed up to write a soldier overseas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The guidelines were simple: one letter or email a week for the length of his or her deployment. Care packages were optional. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Been there, done that. She thought she knew what to expect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What she didn’t count on was falling in love with the guy.</description>

  <description>O Pioneers! is a 1913 novel by American author Willa Cather. It was written in part when Cather was living in Cherry Valley, New York, with Isabelle McClung and was completed at the McClungs' home in Pittsburgh. The book is number 83 on the American Library Association's list of most frequently banned or challenged books. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;O Pioneers! tells the story of the Bergsons, a family of Swedish immigrants in the farm country near the fictional town of Hanover, Nebraska, at the turn of the 20th century. The main character, Alexandra Bergson, inherits the family farmland when her father dies, and she devotes her life to making the farm a viable enterprise at a time when other immigrant families are giving up and leaving the prairie. The novel is also concerned with two romantic relationships, one between Alexandra and family friend Carl Linstrum and another between Alexandra's brother Emil and the married Marie Shabata. - from Wikipedia</description>

  <description>In this second installment of the Family Spies series, set in the bestselling world of Valdemar, the children of Heralds Mags and Amily must follow in their parents' footsteps to protect the realm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mags, Herald Spy of Valdemar, and his wife, Amily, the King’s Own Herald, are happily married with three kids. Their daughter, Abidela, dreams of building upon her parents’ legacy by joining the Artificers, hoping to offset her seeming lack of a Gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Abi senses the imminent collapse of a bridge only moments before it happens, she saves countless lives, including that of her best friend, Princess Katiana. The experience, though harrowing, uncovers her unique Gift—an ability to sense the physical strains in objects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intrigued by the potential of her Gift, the Artificers seek to claim her as their own—but so do the Healers. Through training with both of them, Abi discovers unique facets of her Gift, including a synesthetic connection to objects that allows her to “see” as well as feel the strains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her Gift may also grant her a distinct advantage as a spy—there won’t be a building in the entire kingdom of Valdemar with a secret room that she doesn’t know about. With the help of her mentors, she must hone her gift to uncover the hidden secrets in the depths of Valdemar.</description>

  <description>At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Quiet&lt;/i&gt;, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, &lt;i&gt;Quiet&lt;/i&gt; has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Boyhood&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Sun Is Also a Star&lt;/i&gt; in this unconventional love story by award-winning author Meredith Russo!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two kids, Morgan and Eric, are bonded for life after being born on the same day at the same time. We meet them once a year on their shared birthday as they grow and change: as Eric figures out who he is and how he fits into the world, and as Morgan makes the difficult choice to live as her true self. Over the years, they will drift apart, come together, fight, make up, and break up—and ultimately, realize how inextricably they are a part of each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A searching examination of all the dimensions of love, marriage, mourning, and kinship from two-time Booker Prize finalist Deborah Levy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;To strip the wallpaper off the fairy tale of The Family House in which the comfort and happiness of men and children has been the priority is to find behind it an unthanked, unloved, neglected, exhausted woman.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cost of Living &lt;/i&gt;explores the subtle erasure of women's names, spaces, and stories in the modern everyday. In this "living autobiography†? infused with warmth and humor, Deborah Levy critiques the roles that society assigns to us, and reflects on the politics of breaking with the usual gendered rituals. What does it cost a woman to unsettle old boundaries and collapse the social hierarchies that make her a minor character in a world not arranged to her advantage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Levy draws on her own experience of attempting to live with pleasure, value, and meaning--the making of a new kind of family home, the challenges of her mother's death--and those of women she meets in everyday life, from a young female traveler reading in a bar who suppresses her own words while she deflects an older man's advances, to a particularly brilliant student, to a kindly and ruthless octogenarian bookseller who offers the author a place to write at a difficult time in her life. &lt;i&gt;The Cost of Living&lt;/i&gt; is urgent, essential reading, a crystalline manifesto for turbulent times.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;You want to know what the worst thing is? It’s not the embarrassment, or the looks on people’s faces when I tell them what happened. It isn’t the pain of him not being there—loneliness is manageable. The worst thing is not knowing why.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Justin walks out on Alice on their honeymoon, with no explanation apart from a cryptic note, Alice is left alone and bewildered, her life in pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she meets Evelyn, a visitor to the gallery where she works. It’s a seemingly chance encounter, but Alice gradually learns that Evelyn has motives, and a heartbreaking story, of her own. And that story has haunting parallels with Alice’s life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Alice delves into the mystery of why Justin left her, the questions are obvious. But the answers may lie in the most unlikely of places…</description>

  <description>This morning, Kady thought breaking up with Ezra was the hardest thing she’d have to do. This afternoon, her planet was invaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 2575, and two rival megacorporations are at war over a planet that’s little more than an ice-covered speck at the edge of the universe. Too bad nobody thought to warn the people living on it. With enemy fire raining down on them, Kady and Ezra—who are barely even talking to each other—are forced to fight their way onto an evacuating fleet, with an enemy warship in hot pursuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But their problems are just getting started. A deadly plague has broken out and is mutating, with terrifying results; the fleet's AI, which should be protecting them, may actually be their enemy; and nobody in charge will say what’s really going on. As Kady hacks into a tangled web of data to find the truth, it's clear only one person can help her bring it all to light: the ex-boyfriend she &lt;i&gt;swore&lt;/i&gt; she'd never speak to again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BRIEFING NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; Told through a fascinating dossier of hacked documents—including emails, schematics, military files, IMs, medical reports, interviews, and more—&lt;i&gt;Illuminae&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in a heart-stopping, high-octane trilogy about lives interrupted, the price of truth, and the courage of everyday heroes.</description>

  <description>Child of two species, but part of neither, a new being must find his way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Human and Oankali have been mating since the aliens first came to Earth to rescue the few survivors of an annihilating nuclear war. The Oankali began a massive breeding project, guided by the ooloi, a sexless subspecies capable of manipulating DNA, in the hope of eventually creating a perfect starfaring race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jodahs is supposed to be just another hybrid of human and Oankali, but as he begins his transformation to adulthood he finds himself becoming ooloi—the first ever born to a human mother. As his body changes, Jodahs develops the ability to shapeshift, manipulate matter, and cure or create disease at will. If this frightened young man is able to master his new identity, Jodahs could prove the savior of what’s left of mankind. Or, if he is not careful, he could become a plague that will destroy this new race once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ebook features an illustrated biography of Octavia E. Butler including rare images from the author’s estate.</description>

  <description>In these pages, Laila Lalami brings us the imagined memoirs of the first black explorer of America: Mustafa al-Zamori, called Estebanico. The slave of a Spanish conquistador, Estebanico sails for the Americas with his master, Dorantes, as part of a danger-laden expedition to Florida. Within a year, Estebanico is one of only four crew members to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he journeys across America with his Spanish companions, the Old World roles of slave and master fall away, and Estebanico remakes himself as an equal, a healer, and a remarkable storyteller. His tale illuminates the ways in which our narratives can transmigrate into history—and how storytelling can offer a chance at redemption and survival.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A candid memoir of denial, stolen identities, betrayal, faking it, and coming out.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you know me?&lt;/i&gt;, the email began, sparking tremors of fear that turned into a full quake of panic when William Dameron discovered that his selfie had been stolen by strangers. On social networks and dating sites, his image and identity—a forty-year-old straight white male—had been used to hook countless women into believing in lies of love and romance. Was it all an ironic cosmic joke? Almost a decade prior, William himself had been living a lie that had lasted for more than twenty years. His secret? He was a gay man, a fact he hid from his wife and two daughters for almost as long as he had hidden it from himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this emotional and unflinchingly honest memoir of coming out of the closet late in life, owning up to the past, and facing the future, William Dameron confronts steroid addiction, the shame and homophobia of his childhood, the sledgehammer of secrets that slowly tore his marriage apart, and his love for a gay father of three that would once again challenge the boundaries of trust. At the true heart of &lt;i&gt;The Lie&lt;/i&gt; is a universal story about turning self-doubt into self-acceptance and about pain, anger, and the long journey of both seeking and giving forgiveness.</description>

  <description>In this sequel to Dawn, Lilith Iyapo has given birth to what looks like a normal human boy named Akin. But Akin actually has five parents: a male and female human, a male and female Oankali, and a sexless Ooloi. The Oankali and Ooloi are part of an alien race that rescued humanity from a devastating nuclear war, but the price they exact is a high one the aliens are compelled to genetically merge their species with other races, drastically altering both in the process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a rehabilitated Earth, this "new" race is emerging through human/Oankali/Ooloi mating, but there are also "pure" humans who choose to resist the aliens and the salvation they offer.These resisters are sterilized by the Ooloi so that they cannot reproduce the genetic defect that drives humanity to destroy itself, but otherwise they are left alone (unless they become violent). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the resisters kidnap young Akin, the Oankali choose to leave the child with his captors, for he the most "human" of the Oankali children will decide whether the resisters should be given back their fertility and freedom, even though they will only destroy themselves again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second volume in Octavia Butler's Xenogenesis series, a powerful tale of alien existence.</description>

  <description>Lilith Iyapo has just lost her husband and son when atomic fire consumes Earth—the last stage of the planet’s final war. Hundreds of years later Lilith awakes, deep in the hold of a massive alien spacecraft piloted by the Oankali—who arrived just in time to save humanity from extinction. They have kept Lilith and other survivors asleep for centuries, as they learned whatever they could about Earth. Now it is time for Lilith to lead them back to her home world, but life among the Oankali on the newly resettled planet will be nothing like it was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oankali survive by genetically merging with primitive civilizations—whether their new hosts like it or not. For the first time since the nuclear holocaust, Earth will be inhabited. Grass will grow, animals will run, and people will learn to survive the planet’s untamed wilderness. But their children will not be human. Not exactly.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I am as brown as brown can be,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And my eyes as black as sloe;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I am as brisk as brisk can be,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And wild as forest doe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (The Child Ballads, 295)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins a beautiful tale of love, loss and revenge. Following the seasons, &lt;i&gt;A Pocketful of Crows&lt;/i&gt; balances youth and age, wisdom and passion and draws on nature and folklore to weave a stunning modern mythology around a nameless wild girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only love could draw her into the world of named, tamed things. And it seems only revenge will be powerful enough to let her escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully illustrated by Bonnie Helen Hawkins, this is a stunning and original modern fairytale.</description>

  <description>This hilarious part-memoir, part-manifesto reveals what sets apart the latest generation of young people coming of age in an all-wired, overeducated, and underemployed world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People are obsessed with Ryan O'Connell's blogs. With tens of thousands reading his pieces on &lt;i&gt;Thought Catalog &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Vice,&lt;/i&gt; watching his videos on YouTube, and hanging on to each and every #dark tweet, Ryan has established himself as a unique young voice who's not afraid to dole out some real talk. He's that candid, snarky friend you consult when you fear you're spending too much time falling down virtual k-holes stalking your ex on Facebook or when you've made the all-too-common mistake of befriending a psycho while wasted at last night's party and need to find a way to get rid of them the next morning. But Ryan didn't always have the answers to these modern day dilemmas. Growing up gay and disabled with cerebral palsy, he constantly felt like he was one step behind everybody else. Then the rude curveball known as your twenties happened and things got even more confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryan spent years as a Millennial cliche: he had dead-end internships; dabbled in unemployment; worked in his pajamas as a blogger; communicated mostly via text; looked for love online; spent hundreds on "necessary" items, like candles, while claiming to have no money; and even descended into aimless pill-popping. But through extensive trial and error, Ryan eventually figured out how to take his life from bleak to chic and began limping towards adulthood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharp and entertaining, &lt;i&gt;I'm Special &lt;/i&gt;will educate twentysomethings (or other adolescents-at-heart) on what NOT to do if they ever want to become happy fully functioning grown ups with a 401k and a dog.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Snowed in rocker makes unplanned baby with saucy waitress. News at 11.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see the tabloids now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I play guitar and sing occasionally. But my main role is as a producer for other musicians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's why I came to Crescent Cove—to help rockstar Kellan McGuire with his first solo project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to get stuck in a surprise snowstorm with a smart, funny lass with big brown eyes and a very flexible...body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next night, I was on a flight back to LA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned to town months later. To help Kellan. Right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to lose myself in Ivy again and again, even when the cops tried to thwart us. (They only temporarily succeeded.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I come back, ready to fight for my woman, Ivy has a swollen belly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve spent my life running, and second chances come at a price. But I won’t give up until I’ve made her mine. Forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her and our baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author's Note: Surprise! Producer Rory Ferguson is the first character to cross over from our &lt;i&gt;Oblivion World&lt;/i&gt;... but he isn't the last! He doesn't start out as a daddy, but his unexpected baby with Ivy will be his biggest production yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author's note part deux: Rockstar Baby is a romantic comedy with a HEA and no cliffhanger.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Tracy Duval has spent her life proving women can play hockey. From leading her college team to coaching little girls, she’s been a champion of the sport. But when a sexist ad for the Barracuda Fantasy Hockey Camp seems to exclude women, she signs up to teach the boys a lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retired NHL player Flynn Hammerstrom meets Tracy at the local ice rink and is immediately intrigued. She’s mature, confident, sexy—and hello, she plays hockey. He’s ready to settle down again and, after his tumultuous marriage, he’s looking for a woman who is high on fun and low on drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, even though he’s nuts about her, the drama he desperately wants to avoid flares up at the fantasy camp. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Tracy is smack dab in the middle of the fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: If you purchased this book from a non-Amazon vendor, you may have received a rough draft by mistake. In the rough draft, the heroine's name is Marcy Robles, not Tracy Duval. If you send the author proof of purchase, she will send you the real book.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Mary Miller seizes the mantle of southern literature with this wry tale of middle age and the unexpected turns a life can take.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like her predecessors Ann Beattie and Raymond Carver, Mary Miller brings an essential voice to her generation. Building on her critically acclaimed novel, &lt;em&gt;The Last Days of California&lt;/em&gt;, and her biting collection, &lt;em&gt;Always Happy Hour&lt;/em&gt;, Miller slyly transports readers to her unapologetic corner of the South—this time, Biloxi, Mississippi, home to sixty-three-year-old Louis McDonald Jr. His wife of thirty-seven years left him, his father has passed—and he has impulsively retired from his job in anticipation of an inheritance check that may not come. In the meantime, he watches reality television, sips beer, and avoids his ex-wife and daughter. One day, he stops at a house advertising free dogs and meets overweight mixed-breed Layla. Unexpectedly, Louis takes her, and, newly invigorated, begins investigating local dog parks and buying extra bologna. Mining the absurdities of life with her signature “droll minimalist’s-eye view of America” (Joyce Carol Oates), Mary Miller’s &lt;em&gt;Biloxi&lt;/em&gt; affirms her place in contemporary literature.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;An unforgettable story of four women who came to California to try to make it in a world stacked against them. Through grit and ingenuity, the women became stars in cutthroat, high-stakes, male dominated Silicon Valley and helped build some of the most important companies of our day. They were written out of history - until now&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Alpha Girls&lt;/i&gt;, award-winning journalist Julian Guthrie takes readers behind the closed doors of venture capital, an industry that transforms economies and shapes how we live. We follow the lives and careers of Magdalena Yesil, a fiercely focused émigré from Turkey who, after getting her electrical engineering degree from Stanford, endured tech conferences that featured naked women as entertainment; Mary Jane Hanna, who made her way from the corn fields of Terre Haute to the storied venture capital firm IVP on Sand Hill Road, only to be pulled back from the glass ceiling by expectations at home; Theresia Gouw, a first generation Asian American from a working class town who was so determined to integrate into American life that she refused to eat ethnic food, and who competed with the venture capital guys even on the football field; and Sonja Hoel, a cheerful blue-eyed Southerner who moved to Silicon Valley to join Menlo Ventures after getting her MBA from Harvard, landed hot Internet deals, and was transformed by a personal crisis. All had to navigate a world run by men, push for equal pay, and deflect sexist attitudes and clients who made passes or mistook them for secretaries. They won and lost startup deals ranging from Google and Facebook to Salesforce and Skype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted unparalleled access to the secretive VC universe, Guthrie intimately details the women's victories and defeats, their struggles to juggle work and family, and the broadsides they suffered when they least expected it. Despite the setbacks, they would rise again to rewrite the rules for an industry they love. In Alpha Girls, Guthrie reveals their untold stories.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;International bestselling author Guy Gavriel Kay's latest work is set in a world evoking early Renaissance Italy and offers an extraordinary cast of characters whose lives come together through destiny, love, and ambition.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a chamber overlooking the nighttime waterways of a maritime city, a man looks back on his youth and the people who shaped his life. Danio Cerra's intelligence won him entry to a renowned school even though he was only the son of a tailor. He took service at the court of a ruling count--and soon learned why that man was known  as the Beast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danio's fate changed the moment he saw and recognized Adria Ripoli as she entered the count's chambers one autumn night--intending to kill. Born to power, Adria had chosen, instead of a life of comfort, one of danger--and freedom. Which is how she encounters Danio in a perilous time and place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivid figures share the unfolding story. Among them: a healer determined to defy her expected lot; a charming, frivolous son of immense wealth; a powerful religious leader more decadent than devout; and, affecting all these lives and many more,  two larger-than-life mercenary commanders, lifelong adversaries, whose rivalry puts a world in the balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Brightness Long Ago offers both compelling drama and deeply moving reflections on the nature of memory, the choices we make in life, and the role played by the turning of Fortune's wheel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The prize-winning, bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Boy, Snow, Bird&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; returns with a bewitching and inventive novel&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Influenced by the mysterious place gingerbread holds in classic children's stories--equal parts wholesome and uncanny, from the tantalizing witch's house in "Hansel and Gretel" to the man-shaped confection who one day decides to run as fast as he can--beloved novelist Helen Oyeyemi invites readers into a delightful tale of a surprising family legacy, in which the inheritance is a recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perdita Lee may appear to be your average British schoolgirl; Harriet Lee may seem just a working mother trying to penetrate the school social hierarchy; but there are signs that they might not be as normal as they think they are. For one thing, they share a gold-painted, seventh-floor walk-up apartment with some surprisingly verbal vegetation. And then there's the gingerbread they make. Londoners may find themselves able to take or leave it, but it's very popular in Druhástrana, the far-away (and, according to Wikipedia, non-existent) land of Harriet Lee's early youth. In fact, the world's truest lover of the Lee family gingerbread is Harriet's charismatic childhood friend, Gretel Kercheval--a figure who seems to have had a hand in everything (good or bad) that has happened to Harriet since they met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decades later, when teenaged Perdita sets out to find her mother's long-lost friend, it prompts a new telling of Harriet's story. As the book follows the Lees through encounters with jealousy, ambition, family grudges, work, wealth, and real estate, gingerbread seems to be the one thing that reliably holds a constant value. Endlessly surprising and satisfying, written with Helen Oyeyemi's inimitable style and imagination, it is a true feast for the reader.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A memoir by the celebrated singer-songwriter and social activist Ani DiFranco&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her new memoir, &lt;i&gt;No Walls and the Recurring Dream&lt;/i&gt;, Ani DiFranco recounts her early life from a place of hard-won wisdom, combining personal expression, the power of music, feminism, political activism, storytelling, philanthropy, entrepreneurship, and much more into an inspiring whole. In these frank, honest, passionate, and often funny pages is the tale of one woman's eventful and radical journey to the age of thirty. Ani's coming of age story is defined by her ethos of fierce independence--from being an emancipated minor sleeping in a Buffalo bus station, to unwaveringly building a career through appearances at small clubs and festivals, to releasing her first album at the age of 18, to consciously rejecting the mainstream recording industry and creating her own label, Righteous Babe Records. In these pages, as in life, she never hesitates to challenge established rules and expectations, maintaining a level of artistic integrity that has impressed many and antagonized more than a few. Ani continues to be a major touring and recording artist as well as a celebrated activist and feminist, standing as living proof that you can overcome all personal and societal obstacles to be who you are and to follow your dreams.</description>

  <description>The Edgar Award–winning novel &lt;i&gt;A Conspiracy of Paper&lt;/i&gt; was one of the most acclaimed debuts of 2000. In his richly suspenseful second novel, author David Liss once again travels back in time to a crucial moment in cultural and financial history. His destination: Amsterdam, 1659 — a mysterious world of trade populated by schemers and rogues, where deception rules the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the world’s first commodities exchange, fortunes are won and lost in an instant. Miguel Lienzo, a sharp-witted trader in the city's close-knit community of Portuguese Jews, knows this only too well. Once among the city’s most envied merchants, Miguel has lost everything in a sudden shift in the sugar markets. Now, impoverished and humiliated, living on the charity of his petty younger brother, Miguel must find a way to restore his wealth and reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miguel enters into a partnership with a seductive Dutchwoman who offers him one last chance at success — a daring plot to corner the market of an astonishing new commodity called "coffee." To succeed, Miguel must risk everything he values and test the limits of his commercial guile, facing not only the chaos of the markets and the greed of his competitors, but also a powerful enemy who will stop at nothing to see him ruined. Miguel will learn that among Amsterdam’s ruthless businessmen, betrayal lurks everywhere, and even friends hide secret agendas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With humor, imagination, and mystery, David Liss depicts a world of subterfuge, danger, and repressed longing, where religious and cultural traditions clash with the demands of a new and exciting way of doing business. Readers of historical suspense and lovers of coffee (even decaf) will be up all night with this beguiling novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The inspiring true story of an indomitable librarian’s journey from Nazi Germany to Seattle to Vietnam—all for the love of books.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up under Fascist censorship in Nazi Germany, Ruth Rappaport absorbed a forbidden community of ideas in banned books. After fleeing her home in Leipzig at fifteen and losing both parents to the Holocaust, Ruth drifted between vocations, relationships, and countries, searching for belonging and purpose. When she found her calling in librarianship, Ruth became not only a witness to history but an agent for change as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Culled from decades of diaries, letters, and photographs, this epic true story reveals a driven woman who survived persecution, political unrest, and personal trauma through a love of books. It traces her activism from the Zionist movement to the Red Scare to bibliotherapy in Vietnam and finally to the Library of Congress, where Ruth made an indelible mark and found a home. Connecting it all, one constant thread: Ruth’s passion for the printed word, and the haven it provides—a haven that, as this singularly compelling biography proves, Ruth would spend her life making accessible to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wasn’t just a career for Ruth Rappaport. It was her purpose.</description>

  <description>Rion Kwirk comes from a rather odd family. His mother named him and his sisters after her favorite constellations, and his father makes funky-flavored jelly beans for a living. One sister acts as if she’s always onstage and the other is a walking dictionary. But no one in the family is more odd than Rion’s grandfather, Papa Kwirk. He’s the kind of guy who shows up on his motorcycle only on holidays, handing out crossbows and stuffed squirrels as presents. Rion has always been fascinated by Papa Kwirk, especially since his son—Rion’s father—is the complete opposite. Where Dad is predictable, nerdy, and reassuringly boring, Papa Kwirk is mysterious, dangerous, and cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why, when Rion and his family learn of Papa Kwirk’s death and pile into the car to attend his funeral and pay their respects, Rion can’t help but feel that that’s not the end of his story. That there’s so much more to Papa Kwirk to discover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t know how right he is.</description>

  <description>Special Forces Sergeant Dax Holloway crawled out of the Taliban's clutches barely alive. His captors took more than his sight. They took his humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six years later, he’s carved out an existence back in Boston. One dependent on routines. On walking the same path. Day after day. Through darkness and pain. Always alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Sight is his only refuge. The most elite investigative firm in the country—built from the rubble of his former life—gives him purpose in a world he can no longer see. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evianna Archer’s life makes sense. A brilliant coder, she’s poised to be the next darling of the tech world—heading up a project that will redefine home security. Until one moment changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her life in chaos, she turns to Dax for protection. He's everything she shouldn’t want, shouldn’t need, shouldn’t trust. But she’s drawn to him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they uncover a shocking secret, Dax must make a choice. Stay broken? Or risk his heart—and his life—for the woman who chases all his dark shadows away?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Second Sight&lt;/i&gt; is a slow burn military romantic thriller. All books in the &lt;i&gt;Away From Keyboard&lt;/i&gt; series are standalone romances featuring a different couple, but past couples and characters play active roles in future books.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The global fiction sensation—publishing in 32 countries around the world—that follows 96-year-old Doris, who writes down the memories of her eventful life as she pages through her decades-old address book. But the most profound moment of her life is still to come...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Doris, a 96-year-old woman living alone in her Stockholm apartment. She has few visitors, but her weekly Skype calls with Jenny—her American grandniece, and her only relative—give her great joy and remind her of her own youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Doris was a girl, she was given an address book by her father, and ever since she has carefully documented everyone she met and loved throughout the years. Looking through the little book now, Doris sees the many crossed-out names of people long gone and is struck by the urge to put pen to paper. In writing down the stories of her colorful past—working as a maid in Sweden, modelling in Paris during the 30s, fleeing to Manhattan at the dawn of the Second World War—can she help Jenny, haunted by a difficult childhood, unlock the secrets of their family and finally look to the future? And whatever became of Allan, the love of Doris’s life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A charming novel that prompts reflection on the stories we all should carry to the next generation, and the surprises in life that can await even the oldest among us, The Red Address Book introduces Sofia Lundberg as a wise—and irresistible—storyteller.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bookish and proper Percival Tunstell finds himself out of his depth when floating cities, spirited plumbing, and soggy biscuits collide in this delightful conclusion to NYT bestselling author Gail Carriger's The Custard Protocol series&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Percival Tunstell loves that his sister and her best friend are building themselves a family of misfits aboard their airship, &lt;em&gt;The Spotted Custard&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, he'd never admit that he belongs among them. He's always been on the outside — dispassionate, aloof, and hatless. But accidental spies, a trip to Japan, and one smart and beautiful doctor may have him renegotiating his whole philosophy on life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except hats. He's done with hats. Thank you very much.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Gail Carriger comes the delightful sequel to &lt;i&gt;Imprudence&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accidentally abandoned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All alone in Singapore, proper Miss Primrose Tunstell must steal helium to save her airship, the &lt;i&gt;Spotted Custard&lt;/i&gt;, in a scheme involving a lovesick werecat and a fake fish tail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she uncovers rumors of a new kind of vampire, Prim and the Custard crew embark on a mission to Peru. There, they encounter airship pirates and strange atmospheric phenomena, and are mistaken for representatives of the Spanish Inquisition. Forced into extreme subterfuge (and some rather ridiculous outfits) Prim must also answer three of life's most challenging questions:&lt;br /&gt;Can the perfect book club give a man back his soul?&lt;br /&gt;Will her brother ever stop wearing his idiotic velvet fez?&lt;br /&gt;And can the amount of lard in Christmas pudding save an entire species?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A debut from &lt;i&gt;Forbes'&lt;/i&gt; third most powerful woman in the world, Melinda Gates, a timely and necessary call to action for women's empowerment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last twenty years, Melinda Gates has been on a mission. Her goal, as co-chair of the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, has been to find solutions for people with the most urgent needs, wherever they live. Throughout this journey, one thing has become increasingly clear to her: If you want to lift a society up, invest in women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this candid and inspiring book, Gates traces her awakening to the link between women's empowerment and the health of societies. She shows some of the tremendous opportunities that exist right now to “turbo-charge" change. And she provides simple and effective ways each one of us can make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced that all women should be free to decide whether and when to have children, Gates took her first step onto the global stage to make a stand for family planning. That step launched her into further efforts: to ensure women everywhere have access to every kind of job; to encourage men around the globe to share equally in the burdens of household work; to advocate for paid family leave for everyone; to eliminate gender bias in all its forms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout, Gates introduces us to her heroes in the movement towards equality, offers startling data, shares moving conversations she's had with women from all over the world—and shows how we can all get involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A personal statement of passionate conviction, this book tells of Gates' journey from a partner working behind the scenes to one of the world's foremost advocates for women, driven by the belief that no one should be excluded, all lives have equal value, and gender equity is the lever that lifts everything.</description>

  <description>When Rin aced the Keju—the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies—it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn’t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin’s guardians, who believed they’d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegard—the most elite military school in Nikan—was even more surprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But surprises aren’t always good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power—an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive—and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rin’s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late.</description>

  <description>Rue and the crew of the Spotted Custard return from India with revelations that shake the foundations of England's scientific community. Queen Victoria is not amused, the vampires are tetchy, and something is wrong with the local werewolf pack. To top it all off, Rue's best friend Primrose keeps getting engaged to the most unacceptable military types. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rue has family problems as well. Her vampire father is angry, her werewolf father is crazy, and her obstreperous mother is both. Worst of all, Rue's beginning to suspect what they really are... is frightened.</description>

  <description>A love story that survives the test of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keith McKallister is the king of the stoners. You know the type. Every school has one – the hot, fun, dopey guy beloved by the student body but despised by, well, just about everyone else. He spends his early mornings in the ocean and his days trying to get to class on time. Life is as easy as it gets until one poor choice too many catches up with him and he’s forced to reevaluate his path. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samantha Anderson sits in the front row. You know the type. Every school has one – the quiet, faceless, studious girl who fears the taunts of her peers and fades into the background. Life has never been simple for Samantha, and it’s about to get a little more complicated when Keith slides into the seat beside her with a partnership plan designed for his benefit only. But what Keith brings to the table is more than either of them could imagine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the person you least expect to make a difference will change your life forever. Sometimes the person you love the most might be better off without you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Although a part of the Cake Series, this book can be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From New York Times bestselling author Gail Carriger comes a new novel in the world of the Parasol Protectorate starring Prudence, the daughter of Alexia Tarabotti.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Prudence Alessandra Maccon Akeldama (Rue to her friends) is given an unexpected dirigible, she does what any sensible female would under similar circumstances - names it the Spotted Custard and floats to India in pursuit of the perfect cup of tea. But India has more than just tea on offer. Rue stumbles upon a plot involving local dissidents, a kidnapped brigadier's wife, and some awfully familiar Scottish werewolves. Faced with a dire crisis and an embarrassing lack of bloomers, what else is a young lady of good breeding to do but turn metanatural and find out everyone's secrets, even thousand-year-old fuzzy ones?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Remember that time you accidentally sexted your in-laws?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. I just did that. Except worse. Now my million social media followers are reading and sharing the rude, smartass message I meant to send privately to my little sister...and I’m officially public enemy number one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m Beck Ryder. Former boy bander. Underwear model. Fashion mogul. And I just buried my entire leg in my mouth—not just my foot—modern internet style, and publicly insulted my sister’s neighbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Dempsey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also known as the woman of my dreams, who loves geeky TV shows, baseball, and giraffes, who’s just as turned on by food as I am, and who has a huge secret that I didn’t see coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it's time to grovel and apologize publicly on social media and hope that those same followers who helped start the raging shitstorm will help calm the waters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Sarah doesn’t want the spotlight. For very good reasons that I can’t tell you right now and trying to convince her to be my fake girlfriend to fix this mess and make me look like less of a jackass is worse than taking a kick to the nuts by Jackie Chan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I thought modeling underwear made me feel naked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to start a relationship in the era of the twitterazzi isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;America’s Geekheart is a rockin’ fun romantic comedy featuring a billionaire fashion mogul who got his start modeling underwear, the geeky girl next door with a secret the size of California, and more superstitions and secrets than you can shake a baseball bat at. It stands alone with no cheating or cliffhangers.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Nice guys always finish last, and Coby Epstein is sick and tired of being last. After his boyfriend dumps him, Coby vows to take it slow and not jump into another relationship, no matter what his ninety-five-year-old great aunt says. When Coby sees his ex has moved on, he goes on a series of disastrous first dates and swears off men, determined to be alone. His best friend disagrees and finds the “perfect man” for him online and arranges a date. The only problem? Coby has no idea what she’s done. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since childhood, Eli Kaplan has been his father’s greatest disappointment, a fact he’s reminded of at every opportunity. For years, he’s struggled with the knowledge that dating women doesn’t work for him. A late-night confession to his brother changes everything and Eli realizes, maybe, just maybe, he can come out, find himself, and find love. Eli takes the plunge and creates a profile on a dating website, not knowing what to expect. One night he chats with an intriguing man, and despite his nervousness, they arrange to meet for coffee. No big deal. They’ll probably never see each other again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the day of their first date, nothing could surprise Coby and Eli more than to discover that they live in the same apartment building, on the same floor. In a city of eight million people, coincidences don’t get crazier than that. But as the two men begin to weave their lives together with cautious optimism and hope for a future, they find an even greater thread holding their families together—one born from the ashes of a final solution that couldn’t destroy their ancestors’ courage, leaving scars that remain almost a century later. Past lives torn apart can be pieced together by a future no one could have ever imagined, where love is more than fate or coincidence. It’s meant to be.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From National Book Award finalist Megan K. Stack, a stunning memoir of raising her children abroad with the help of Chinese and Indian women who are also working mothers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Megan Stack was living in Beijing, she left her prestigious job as a foreign correspondent to have her first child and work from home writing a book. She quickly realized that caring for a baby and keeping up with the housework while her husband went to the office each day was consuming the time she needed to write. This dilemma was resolved in the manner of many upper-class families and large corporations: she availed herself of cheap Chinese labor. The housekeeper Stack hired was a migrant from the countryside, a mother who had left her daughter in a precarious situation to earn desperately needed cash in the capital. As Stack's family grew and her husband's job took them to Delhi, a series of Chinese and Indian women cooked, cleaned, and babysat in her home. Stack grew increasingly aware of the brutal realities of their lives: domestic abuse, alcoholism, unplanned pregnancies. Hiring poor women had given her the ability to work while raising her children, but what ethical compromise had she made?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to confront the truth, Stack traveled to her employees' homes, met their parents and children, and turned a journalistic eye on the tradeoffs they'd been forced to make as working mothers seeking upward mobility&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;and on the cost to the children who were left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Women's Work&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable story of four women as well as an electrifying meditation on the evasions of marriage, motherhood, feminism, and privilege.</description>

  <description>Here are four urgent stories from author and activist Cory Doctorow, four social, technological and economic visions of the world today and its near—all too near—future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Unauthorized Bread' is a tale of immigration, toxic economic stratification and a young woman's perilously illegal quest to fix a broken toaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 'Model Minority' a superhero finds himself way out his depth when he confronts the corruption of the police and justice system.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'Radicalized' is the story of a desperate husband, a darknet forum and the birth of a violent uprising against the US health care system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final story, 'The Masque of the Red Death', tracks an uber-wealthy survivalist and his followers as they hole up and attempt to ride out the collapse of society.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When a beloved family dog is stolen, her owner sets out on a life-changing journey through the ruins of our world to bring her back in this fiercely compelling tale of survival, courage, and hope. Perfect for readers of Station Eleven and The Girl With All the Gifts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My name's Griz. My childhood wasn't like yours. I've never had friends, and in my whole life I've not met enough people to play a game of football.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My parents told me how crowded the world used to be, but we were never lonely on our remote island. We had each other, and our dogs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then the thief came.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There may be no law left except what you make of it. But if you steal my dog, you can at least expect me to come after you.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because if we aren't loyal to the things we love, what's the point?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the #1 New York Times bestselling author, Jojo Moyes, the story of a young woman who finds new meaning in life after opening an eclectic shop and comes to terms with the secrets of her past&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the sixties, Athene Forster was the most glamorous girl of her generation. Nicknamed the Last Deb, she was also beautiful, spoiled, and out of control. When she agreed to marry the gorgeous young heir Douglas Fairley-Hulme, her parents breathed a sigh of relief. But within two years, rumors had begun to circulate about Athene's affair with a young salesman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty-five years later, Suzanna Peacock is struggling with her notorious mother's legacy. The only place Suzanna finds comfort is in The Peacock Emporium, the beautiful coffee bar and shop she opens that soon enchants her little town. There she makes perhaps the first real friends of her life, including Alejandro, a male midwife, escaping his own ghosts in Argentina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The specter of her mother still haunts Suzanna. But only by confronting both her family and her innermost self will she finally reckon with the past--and discover that the key to her history, and her happiness, may have been in front of her all along.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Seveneves, Anathem, Reamde&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/em&gt; returns with a wildly inventive and entertaining science fiction thriller—&lt;em&gt;Paradise Lost&lt;/em&gt; by way of Phillip K. Dick—that unfolds in the near future, in parallel worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his youth, Richard “Dodge” Forthrast founded Corporation 9592, a gaming company that made him a multibillionaire. Now in his middle years, Dodge appreciates his comfortable, unencumbered life, managing his myriad business interests, and spending time with his beloved niece Zula and her young daughter, Sophia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One beautiful autumn day, while he undergoes a routine medical procedure, something goes irrevocably wrong. Dodge is pronounced brain dead and put on life support, leaving his stunned family and close friends with difficult decisions. Long ago, when a much younger Dodge drew up his will, he directed that his body be given to a cryonics company now owned by enigmatic tech entrepreneur Elmo Shepherd. Legally bound to follow the directive despite their misgivings, Dodge’s family has his brain scanned and its data structures uploaded and stored in the cloud, until it can eventually be revived. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the coming years, technology allows Dodge’s brain to be turned back on. It is an achievement that is nothing less than the disruption of death itself. An eternal afterlife—the Bitworld—is created, in which humans continue to exist as digital souls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this brave new immortal world is not the Utopia it might first seem . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall, or Dodge in Hell&lt;/em&gt; is pure, unadulterated fun: a grand drama of analog and digital, man and machine, angels and demons, gods and followers, the finite and the eternal. In this exhilarating epic, Neal Stephenson raises profound existential questions and touches on the revolutionary breakthroughs that are transforming our future. Combining the technological, philosophical, and spiritual in one grand myth, he delivers a mind-blowing speculative literary saga for the modern age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Mimi is a 'waste girl',&lt;/b&gt; a member of the lowest caste on Silicon Isle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Located off China's southeastern coast, Silicon Isle is the global capital for electronic waste recycling, where thousands like Mimi toil day and night, hoping one day they too will enjoy the wealth they’ve created for their employers, the three clans who have ruled the isle for generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Luo Jincheng &lt;/b&gt;is the head of one of these clans, a role passed down from his father and grandfather before him. As the government enforces tighter restrictions, Luo in turn tightens the reins on the waste workers in his employ. Ruthlessness is his means of survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scott Brandle&lt;/b&gt; has come to Silicon Isle representing TerraGreen Recycling, an American corporation that stands to earn ungodly sums if they can reach a deal to modernize the island’s recycling process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chen Kaizong&lt;/b&gt;, a Chinese American, travels to Silicon Isle as Scott’s interpreter. There, Kaizong is hoping to find his heritage, but finds more questions instead. The home he longs for may not exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;As these forces collide, a dark futuristic virus is unleashed on the island, and war erupts between the rich and the poor; between Chinese tradition and American ambition; between humanity’s past and its future.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rights Catalog Text&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0&lt;br /&gt;0</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Every story has a hero. &lt;br /&gt;Devin O'Leary was mine.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody has a dream,&lt;br /&gt;And mine could take me far.&lt;br /&gt;Just me, and my voice,&lt;br /&gt;A stage, and this guitar.&lt;br /&gt;With patience and some luck,&lt;br /&gt;I could see me, standing there.&lt;br /&gt;But, that was before I met her-&lt;br /&gt;The girl with the purple hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enchanted by her beauty,&lt;br /&gt;By her soul, and then, her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I saw the broken girl within,&lt;br /&gt;And my dream became her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I found myself on a journey,&lt;br /&gt;Of tragedy and letting go,&lt;br /&gt;Of happiness and daisies,&lt;br /&gt;Of serenades and Poe.&lt;br /&gt;But no one taught us how to cope,&lt;br /&gt;With life's unpredictable scheme.&lt;br /&gt;Still, I'm the hero in her story,&lt;br /&gt;And she's my only dream.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;"You have too many rules."&lt;br /&gt;"And you don't have enough."&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian Moore thought he had it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A drumming gig with one of the world’s biggest up-and-coming stars. The looks and charm to get him any woman he laid his eyes on. All the friends he could ever ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But something was always missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until he receives a letter, telling him that he’s a father to a fifteen-year-old boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with the addition of his son, a love interest he never expected, and a whole new set of responsibilities, Sebastian finds himself happier than he’s ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But old habits die hard, and when life finally gives him everything he wanted, he’ll have to find a way to keep his past from ruining the present.</description>

      <![CDATA[I really enjoyed this. Although there is a romance in this, to me, it was more about family. The true experience of having mixed feelings about people you love and their choices. About building a family, about finding yourself. Thoughtfully written interesting characters.]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;At night, Las Mal Criadas own these streets.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nalah leads the fiercest all-girl crew in Mega City. That roles brings with it violent throw downs and access to the hottest boydega clubs, but the sixteen-year-old grows weary of the life. Her dream is to get off the streets and make a home in the exclusive Mega Towers, in which only a chosen few get to live. To make it to the Mega towers, Nalah must prove her loyalty to the city's benevolent founder and cross the border in a search for a mysterious gang the Ashé Ryders. Led by a reluctant guide, Nalah battles other crews and her own doubts, but the closer she gets to her goal, the more she loses sight of everything—and everyone— she cares about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nalah must do the unspeakable to get what she wants—a place to call home. But is a home just where you live? Or who you choose to protect?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Mission: &lt;/b&gt;Survive my best friend's wedding, where I must play nice with my ex and his perfect new girlfriend.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strategy: &lt;/b&gt;Bring the hottest fake boyfriend on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Target: &lt;/b&gt;Grady Rock. Master Baker. Dimples. Muscles. The unicorn of fake boyfriends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Complication: &lt;/b&gt;Wyatt Morgan. My brother's best friend. My sworn enemy. Military man. Sexy as hell single dad. The man I let into my panties for one night of hot hate sex after my ex dumped me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the man who just scared off that perfect fake boyfriend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By pretending to be my real boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can roll with this though. What’s the harm in Flirting with the Frenemy if it helps me get the job done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete my mission and move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until Wyatt kisses me again and I start feeling things I shouldn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing about weddings...nothing ever goes as planned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Flirting with the Frenemy is a rollicking fun romantic comedy featuring a single dad military man, an irritatingly attractive blast from his past, pirates, cursing parrots, and a wedding gone wild. It stands alone with no cheating or cliffhangers.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the Hugo Award­­–winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Stars Are Legion &lt;/i&gt;comes a brand-new science fiction thriller about a futuristic war during which soldiers are broken down into light in order to get them to the front lines on Mars.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;They said the war would turn us into light. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;I wanted to be counted among the heroes who gave us this better world. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Light Brigade: it’s what soldiers fighting the war against Mars call the ones who come back…different. Grunts in the corporate corps get busted down into light to travel to and from interplanetary battlefronts. Everyone is changed by what the corps must do in order to break them down into light. Those who survive learn to stick to the mission brief—no matter what actually happens during combat.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dietz, a fresh recruit in the infantry, begins to experience combat drops that don’t sync up with the platoon’s. And Dietz’s bad drops tell a story of the war that’s not at all what the corporate brass want the soldiers to think is going on.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is Dietz really experiencing the war differently, or is it combat madness? Trying to untangle memory from mission brief and survive with sanity intact, Dietz is ready to become a hero—or maybe a villain; in war it’s hard to tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A worthy successor to classic stories like &lt;i&gt;Downbelow Station&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/i&gt;, and&lt;i&gt; The Forever War&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; The Light Brigade&lt;/i&gt; is award-winning author Kameron Hurley’s gritty time-bending take on the future of war.</description>

  <description>A Post Apocalyptic Thriller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blindness was just the beginning. &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It was only when the virus progressed to Stage 2 that the true horror emerged. Ordinary people were being turned into mindless predators, and it didn't take Mason long to figure out their prey of choice. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He thought he'd had nothing left to lose, but now he is all that stands between a young girl and a gruesome fate, and he's sworn to protect her with his very life. They'll have to be smart, they'll have to be strong, and they'll have to be every bit as ruthless as the swarm, but even as Mason and Mackenzie battle their way from one horror to the next in a desperate flight through a world gone mad, they both know that their time is running out. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The virus isn't done yet. Stage 3 is coming, and things are about to get a whole lot worse. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>Four decades ago, Richard Forthrast, the black sheep of an Iowa family, fled to a wild and lonely mountainous corner of British Columbia to avoid the draft. Smuggling backpack loads of high-grade marijuana across the border into Northern Idaho, he quickly amassed an enormous and illegal fortune. With plenty of time and money to burn, he became addicted to an online fantasy game in which opposing factions battle for power and treasure in a vast cyber realm. Like many serious gamers, he began routinely purchasing virtual gold pieces and other desirables from Chinese gold farmers—young professional players in Asia who accumulated virtual weapons and armor to sell to busy American and European buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Richard, the game was the perfect opportunity to launder his aging hundred dollar bills and begin his own high-tech start up—a venture that has morphed into a Fortune 500 computer gaming group, Corporation 9592, with its own super successful online role-playing game, T’Rain. But the line between fantasy and reality becomes dangerously blurred when a young gold farmer accidently triggers a virtual war for dominance—and Richard is caught at the center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this edgy, 21st century tale, Neal Stephenson, one of the most ambitious and prophetic writers of our time, returns to the terrain of his cyberpunk masterpieces &lt;i&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/i&gt;, leading readers through the looking glass and into the dark heart of imagination.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternative cover edition for this ASIN can be found &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25392545-carry-on" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simon Snow is the worst Chosen One who's ever been chosen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's what his roommate, Baz, says. And Baz might be evil and a vampire and a complete git, but he's probably right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half the time, Simon can't even make his wand work, and the other half, he starts something on fire. His mentor's avoiding him, his girlfriend broke up with him, and there's a magic-eating monster running around, wearing Simon's face. Baz would be having a field day with all this, if he were here -- it's their last year at the Watford School of Magicks, and Simon's infuriating nemesis didn't even bother to show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carry On - The Rise and Fall of Simon Snow&lt;/em&gt; is a ghost story, a love story and a mystery. It has just as much kissing and talking as you'd expect from a Rainbow Rowell story - but far, far more monsters.</description>

  <description>From the novelist dubbed "the Korean Henning Mankell" (&lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;) comes a fantastical crime novel set in an alternate Seoul where assassination guilds compete for market dominance. Perfect for fans of Han Kang and Patrick deWitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind every assassination, there is an anonymous mastermind--a plotter--working in the shadows. Plotters quietly dictate the moves of the city's most dangerous criminals, but their existence is little more than legend. Just who are the plotters? And more important, what do they want?&lt;br /&gt; Reseng is an assassin. Raised by a cantankerous killer named Old Raccoon in the crime headquarters "The Library," Reseng never questioned anything: where to go, who to kill, or why his home was filled with books that no one ever read. But one day, Reseng steps out of line on a job, toppling a set of carefully calibrated plans. And when he uncovers an extraordinary scheme set into motion by an eccentric trio of young women--a convenience store clerk, her wheelchair-bound sister, and a cross-eyed librarian--Reseng will have to decide if he will remain a pawn or finally take control of the plot. &lt;br /&gt; Crackling with action and filled with unforgettable characters, &lt;i&gt;The Plotters&lt;/i&gt; is a deeply entertaining thriller that soars with the soul, wit, and lyricism of real literary craft.</description>

  <description>It's been twenty years and two election cycles since Information, a powerful search engine monopoly, pioneered the switch from warring nation-states to global micro-democracy. The corporate coalition party Heritage has won the last two elections. With another election on the horizon, the Supermajority is in tight contention, and everything's on the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With power comes corruption. For Ken, this is his chance to do right by the idealistic Policy1st party and get a steady job in the big leagues. For Domaine, the election represents another staging ground in his ongoing struggle against the &lt;i&gt;pax democratica&lt;/i&gt;. For Mishima, a dangerous Information operative, the whole situation is a puzzle: how do you keep the wheels running on the biggest political experiment of all time, when so many have so much to gain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Infomocracy&lt;/i&gt; is Malka Older's debut novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Following their adventures in &lt;i&gt;The Bear and the Nightingale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Girl in the Tower&lt;/i&gt;, Vasya and Morozko return in this stunning conclusion to the bestselling &lt;i&gt;Winternight Trilogy&lt;/i&gt;, battling enemies mortal and magical to save both Russias, the seen and the unseen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Moscow has been struck by disaster. Its people are searching for answers—and for someone to blame. Vasya finds herself alone, beset on all sides. The Grand Prince is in a rage, choosing allies that will lead him on a path to war and ruin. A wicked demon returns, stronger than ever and determined to spread chaos. Caught at the center of the conflict is Vasya, who finds the fate of two worlds resting on her shoulders. Her destiny uncertain, Vasya will uncover surprising truths about herself and her history as she desperately tries to save Russia, Morozko, and the magical world she treasures. But she may not be able to save them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advance praise for &lt;i&gt;The Winter of the Witch&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Katherine Arden’s Winternight Trilogy isn’t just good—it’s hug-to-your-chest, straight-to-the-favorites-shelf, reread-immediately good, and each book just gets better. The Winter of the Witch plunges us back to fourteenth-century Moscow, where old gods and new vie for the soul of Russia and fate rests on a witch girl’s slender shoulders. Prepare to have your heart ripped out, loaned back to you full of snow and magic, and ripped out some more.”—&lt;b&gt;Laini Taylor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

He’s convinced I’m his good luck charm, and he wants me back. But only for his game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll be strong. I will. I’ll resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asses don’t change their stripes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or do they?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This plan would be so easy if the man wasn't Charming as Puck...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Charming as Puck&lt;/i&gt; is a romping fun romance between a hockey player and his sister's best friend, complete with farm animals, epic birthday presents, and Berger Twin sightings.

  <description>For anyone who’s ever been on the receiving end of an unsolicited dick pic…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has the muscles of Adonis, an ego bigger than the sun, and a very clear desire to get back in my pants. Which would be fantastic if he weren’t a SEAL and I wasn’t a criminal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, I prefer the term avenger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a hacktivist, cleaning up the cesspool of cyberspace one scam artist and troll at a time, and I sometimes bend a few rules to get justice done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s a military man with abs of glory, sworn to uphold the letter of the law no matter its shortcomings. And if he’d known who—or what—I was, I doubt he would’ve banged me at my best friend’s wedding reception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or come back for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why he’s now the only thing standing between me and one very pissed off internet troll who’s figured out where I live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m pretty sure he’ll get me out of this alive—and quite satisfied, thank you very much—but I’m also pretty sure this mission will end with me in handcuffs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And not the good kind of handcuffs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hero and the Hacktivist is a romping fun romance between a SEAL and a twisted hacker by day, drummer by night, complete with epic klutziness, terrible leg warmers, and an even worse phone virus gone wrong. This romantic comedy stands alone with no cheating or cliffhangers and ends with a fabulously fun happily ever after.</description>

  <description>In the early years of the 20th century, a group of female factory workers in Newark, New Jersey slowly died of radiation poisoning. Around the same time, an Indian elephant was deliberately put to death by electricity in Coney Island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the facts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now these two tragedies are intertwined in a dark alternate history of rage, radioactivity, and injustice crying out to be righted. Prepare yourself for a wrenching journey that crosses eras, chronicling histories of cruelty both grand and petty in search of meaning and justice.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The dramatic real life stories of four young people caught up in the mass exodus of Shanghai in the wake of China's 1949 Communist revolution--a precursor to the struggles faced by emigrants today. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shanghai has historically been China's jewel, its richest, most modern and westernized city. The bustling metropolis was home to sophisticated intellectuals, entrepreneurs, and a thriving middle class when Mao's proletarian revolution emerged victorious from the long civil war. Terrified of the horrors the Communists would wreak upon their lives, citizens of Shanghai who could afford to fled in every direction. Seventy years later, members of the last generation to fully recall this massive exodus have revealed their stories to Chinese American journalist Helen Zia, who interviewed hundreds of exiles about their journey through one of the most tumultuous events of the twentieth century. From these moving accounts, Zia weaves together the stories of four young Shanghai residents who wrestled with the decision to abandon everything for an uncertain life as refugees in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benny, who as a teenager became the unwilling heir to his father's dark wartime legacy, must decide either to escape to Hong Kong or navigate the intricacies of a newly Communist China. The resolute Annuo, forced to flee her home with her father, a defeated Nationalist official, becomes an unwelcome exile in Taiwan. The financially strapped Ho fights deportation from the U.S. in order to continue his studies while his family struggles at home. And Bing, given away by her poor parents, faces the prospect of a new life among strangers in America. The lives of these men and women are marvelously portrayed, revealing the dignity and triumph of personal survival.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This taut, true thriller dives into a dark world that touches us all, as seen through the brilliant, breakneck career of an extraordinary hacker&lt;/b&gt;—&lt;b&gt;a woman known only as Alien.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When she arrived at MIT in the 1990s, Alien was quickly drawn to the school’s tradition of high‑risk physical trespassing: the original “hacking.” Within a year, one of her hallmates was dead and two others were arraigned. Alien’s adventures were only just beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After a stint at the storied, secretive Los Alamos National Laboratory, Alien was recruited by a top cybersecurity firm where she deployed her cache of virtual weapons—and the trespassing and social engineering talents she had developed while “hacking” at MIT. The company tested its clients’ security by every means possible—not just coding, but donning disguises and sneaking past guards and secretaries into the C‑suite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Alien now runs a boutique hacking outfit that caters to some of the world’s biggest and most vulnerable institutions—banks, retailers, government agencies. Her work combines devilish charm, old‑school deception, and next generation spycraft. In &lt;i&gt;Breaking and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Entering,&lt;/i&gt; cybersecurity finally gets the rich, character‑driven, fast-paced treatment it deserves. </description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;When you climb a tree, the first thing you do is to hold on tight…&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty-four-year-old Harry Crane works as an analyst for the US Forest Service. When his wife dies suddenly, he is unable to cope. Leaving his job and his old life behind, Harry makes his way to the remote woods of northeastern Pennsylvania’s Endless Mountains, determined to lose himself. But fate intervenes in the form of a fiercely determined young girl named Oriana. She and her mother, Amanda, are struggling to pick up the pieces from their own tragedy—Amanda stoically holding it together while Oriana roams the forest searching for answers. And in Oriana’s magical, willful mind, she believes that Harry is the key to righting her world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Now it’s time for Harry to let go…&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking up residence in the woods behind Amanda’s house, Harry reluctantly agrees to help Oriana in a ludicrous scheme to escape his tragic past. In so doing, the unlikeliest of elements—a wolf, a stash of gold coins, a fairy tale called The Grum’s Ledger and a wise old librarian named Olive—come together to create a golden adventure that will fulfill Oriana’s wildest dreams and open Harry’s heart to a whole new life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harry’s Trees&lt;/em&gt; is an uplifting story about the redeeming power of friendship and love and the magic to be found in life’s most surprising adventures.</description>

  <description>On the morning of April 29, 1986, a fire alarm sounded in the Los Angeles Public Library. As the moments passed, the patrons and staff who had been cleared out of the building realized this was not the usual fire alarm. As one fireman recounted, “Once that first stack got going, it was ‘Goodbye, Charlie.’” The fire was disastrous: it reached 2000 degrees and burned for more than seven hours. By the time it was extinguished, it had consumed four hundred thousand books and damaged seven hundred thousand more. Investigators descended on the scene, but more than thirty years later, the mystery remains: Did someone purposefully set fire to the library—and if so, who?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaving her lifelong love of books and reading into an investigation of the fire, award-winning &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; reporter and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Susan Orlean delivers a mesmerizing and uniquely compelling book that manages to tell the broader story of libraries and librarians in a way that has never been done before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Library Book&lt;/i&gt;, Orlean chronicles the LAPL fire and its aftermath to showcase the larger, crucial role that libraries play in our lives; delves into the evolution of libraries across the country and around the world, from their humble beginnings as a metropolitan charitable initiative to their current status as a cornerstone of national identity; brings each department of the library to vivid life through on-the-ground reporting; studies arson and attempts to burn a copy of a book herself; reflects on her own experiences in libraries; and reexamines the case of Harry Peak, the blond-haired actor long suspected of setting fire to the LAPL more than thirty years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, Orlean introduces us to an unforgettable cast of characters from libraries past and present—from Mary Foy, who in 1880 at eighteen years old was named the head of the Los Angeles Public Library at a time when men still dominated the role, to Dr. C.J.K. Jones, a pastor, citrus farmer, and polymath known as “The Human Encyclopedia” who roamed the library dispensing information; from Charles Lummis, a wildly eccentric journalist and adventurer who was determined to make the L.A. library one of the best in the world, to the current staff, who do heroic work every day to ensure that their institution remains a vital part of the city it serves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brimming with her signature wit, insight, compassion, and talent for deep research, &lt;i&gt;The Library Book&lt;/i&gt; is Susan Orlean’s thrilling journey through the stacks that reveals how these beloved institutions provide much more than just books—and why they remain an essential part of the heart, mind, and soul of our country. It is also a master journalist’s reminder that, perhaps especially in the digital era, they are more necessary than ever.</description>

  <description>The author of &lt;i&gt;Hourglass&lt;/i&gt; now gives us a new memoir about identity, paternity, and family secrets—a real-time In the spring of 2016, through a genealogy website to which she had whimsically submitted her DNA for analysis, Dani Shapiro received the stunning news that her father was not her biological father. She woke up one morning and her entire history—the life she had lived—crumbled beneath her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Inheritance&lt;/i&gt; is a book about secrets—secrets within families, kept out of shame or self-protectiveness; secrets we keep from one another in the name of love. It is the story of a woman’s urgent quest to unlock the story of her own identity, a story that has been scrupulously hidden from her for more than fifty years, years she had spent writing brilliantly, and compulsively, on themes of identity and family history. It is a book about the extraordinary moment we live in—a moment in which science and technology have outpaced not only medical ethics but also the capacities of the human heart to contend with the consequences of what we discover.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;She possessed a stunning beauty. She also possessed a stunning mind. Could the world handle both?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her beauty almost certainly saved her from the rising Nazi party and led to marriage with an Austrian arms dealer. Underestimated in everything else, she overheard the Third Reich's plans while at her husband's side, understanding more than anyone would guess. She devised a plan to flee in disguise from their castle, and the whirlwind escape landed her in Hollywood. She became Hedy Lamarr, screen star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she kept a secret more shocking than her heritage or her marriage: she was a scientist. And she knew a few secrets about the enemy. She had an idea that might help the country fight the Nazis...if anyone would listen to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A powerful novel based on the incredible true story of the glamour icon and scientist whose groundbreaking invention revolutionized modern communication, &lt;em&gt;The Only Woman in the Room&lt;/em&gt; is a masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The Borderlands aren’t like anywhere else. Don’t try to smuggle a phone or any other piece of technology over the wall that marks the Border — unless you enjoy a fireworks display in your backpack. (Ballpoint pens are okay.) There are elves, harpies, and — best of all as far as Elliot is concerned — mermaids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elliot? Who’s Elliot? Elliot is thirteen years old. He’s smart and just a tiny bit obnoxious. Sometimes more than a tiny bit. When his class goes on a field trip and he can see a wall that no one else can see, he is given the chance to go to school in the Borderlands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that on the other side of the wall, classes involve a lot more weaponry and fitness training and fewer mermaids than he expected. On the other hand, there’s Serene-Heart-in-the-Chaos-of-Battle, an elven warrior who is more beautiful than anyone Elliot has ever seen, and then there’s her human friend Luke: sunny, blond, and annoyingly likeable. There are lots of interesting books. There’s even the chance Elliot might be able to change the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Other Lands is the exhilarating new book from beloved and bestselling author Sarah Rees Brennan. It’s a novel about surviving four years in the most unusual of schools, about friendship, falling in love, diplomacy, and finding your own place in the world — even if it means giving up your phone.</description>

  <description>New from the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Alif the Unseen&lt;/i&gt; and writer of the Ms. Marvel series, G. Willow Wilson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in 1491 during the reign of the last sultanate in the Iberian peninsula, &lt;em&gt;The Bird King&lt;/em&gt; is the story of Fatima, the only remaining Circassian concubine to the sultan, and her dearest friend Hassan, the palace mapmaker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hassan has a secret--he can draw maps of places he's never seen and bend the shape of reality. When representatives of the newly formed Spanish monarchy arrive to negotiate the sultan's surrender, Fatima befriends one of the women, not realizing that she will see Hassan's gift as sorcery and a threat to Christian Spanish rule. With their freedoms at stake, what will Fatima risk to save Hassan and escape the palace walls?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Fatima and Hassan traverse Spain with the help of a clever jinn to find safety, &lt;i&gt;The Bird King&lt;/i&gt; asks us to consider what love is and the price of freedom at a time when the West and the Muslim world were not yet separate.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"If you control our sleep, then you can own our dreams... And from there, it's easy to control our entire lives."&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set on a planet that has fully definitive, never-changing zones of day and night, with ensuing extreme climates of endless, frigid darkness and blinding, relentless light, humankind has somehow continued apace -- though the perils outside the built cities are rife with danger as much as the streets below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in a world where time means only what the ruling government proclaims, and the levels of light available are artificially imposed to great consequence, lost souls and disappeared bodies are shadow-bound and savage, and as common as grains of sand. And one such pariah, sacrificed to the night, but borne up by time and a mysterious bond with an enigmatic beast, will rise to take on the entire planet--before it can crumble beneath the weight of human existence.</description>

  <description>Every Winter, the human population hibernates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During those bitterly cold four months, the nation is a snow-draped landscape of desolate loneliness, and devoid of human activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, not quite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your name is Charlie Worthing and it's your first season with the Winter Consuls, the committed but mildly unhinged group of misfits who are responsible for ensuring the hibernatory safe passage of the sleeping masses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are investigating an outbreak of viral dreams which you dismiss as nonsense; nothing more than a quirky artefact borne of the sleeping mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the dreams start to kill people, it's unsettling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you get the dreams too, it's weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they start to come true, you begin to doubt your sanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But teasing truth from Winter is never easy: You have to avoid the Villains and their penchant for murder, kidnapping and stamp collecting, ensure you aren't eaten by Nightwalkers whose thirst for human flesh can only be satisfied by comfort food, and sidestep the increasingly less-than-mythical WinterVolk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But so long as you remember to wrap up warmly, you'll be fine.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;In every one of our genomes we each carry the history of our species—births, deaths, disease, war, famine, migration, and a lot of sex. But those stories have always been locked away—until now, with the invention of genomics, a tool that lets scientists decode our DNA. The implications for our identity are enormous. As acclaimed science writer Adam Rutherford shows, before genomics, we never really knew much about ourselves at all. And so he rewrites all of human history—from 100,000 years ago to the present, and on topics as wide-ranging as Neanderthals and murder, redheads and race, dead kings and plague, evolution and epigenetics—using genetics to shatter deeply held beliefs about our heritage, and to replace them with new answers to some of the biggest questions of all: Who we are, and how we came to be.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;A Dragon is dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Corta Helio, one of the five family corporations that rule the Moon, has fallen. Its riches are divided up among its many enemies, its survivors scattered. Eighteen months have passed . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The remaining Helio children, Lucasinho and Luna, are under the protection of the powerful Asamoahs, while Robson, still reeling from witnessing his parent’s violent deaths, is now a ward--virtually a hostage-- of Mackenzie Metals. And the last appointed heir, Lucas, has vanished of the surface of the moon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Lady Sun, dowager of Taiyang, suspects that Lucas Corta is not dead, and more to the point—that he is still a major player in the game. After all, Lucas always was the Schemer, and even in death, he would go to any lengths to take back everything and build a new Corta Helio, more powerful than before. But Corta Helio needs allies, and to find them, the fleeing son undertakes an audacious, impossible journey--to Earth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an unstable lunar environment, the shifting loyalties and political machinations of each family reach the zenith of their most fertile plots as outright war erupts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Luna: Wolf Moon &lt;/i&gt;continues Ian McDonald's saga of the Five Dragons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>If I had to pick a bride of convenience, my first choice would NOT be Peach Maloney.&lt;p&gt;My fiftieth choice would NOT be Peach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top spot on my list of occupational hazards? Yes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal pain in the crumpets? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bride of convenience? No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I’ve unexpectedly gone from royal bodyguard to monarch, having inherited a crown that was stolen from my family long before my birth. The kicker of this unexpected royal gift? In order to take the throne I must find a wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have I mentioned Peach would NOT have been my hundredth choice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I’ve no other options, and she needs a favor that my new position can fulfill quite nicely. So we’ve agreed to play the doting newlyweds out in public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In private, though, our rules are simple: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No touching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And certainly no sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should have known better than to marry a rule-breaker.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Following their adventures in &lt;i&gt;The Bear and the Nightingale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Girl in the Tower&lt;/i&gt;, Vasya and Morozko return in this stunning conclusion to the bestselling Winternight Trilogy, battling enemies mortal and magical to save both Russias, the seen and the unseen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Winternight Trilogy introduced an unforgettable heroine, Vasilisa Petrovna, a girl determined to forge her own path in a world that would rather lock her away. Her gifts and her courage have drawn the attention of Morozko, the winter-king, but it is too soon to know if this connection will prove a blessing or a curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Moscow has been struck by disaster. Its people are searching for answers—and for someone to blame. Vasya finds herself alone, beset on all sides. The Grand Prince is in a rage, choosing allies that will lead him on a path to war and ruin. A wicked demon returns, stronger than ever and determined to spread chaos. Caught at the center of the conflict is Vasya, who finds the fate of two worlds resting on her shoulders. Her destiny uncertain, Vasya will uncover surprising truths about herself and her history as she desperately tries to save Russia, Morozko, and the magical world she treasures. But she may not be able to save them all.</description>

  <description>The Moon wants to kill you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it will kill you when the per diem for your allotted food, water, and air runs out, just before you hit paydirt. Maybe it will kill you when you are trapped between the reigning corporations-the Five Dragons-in a foolish gamble against a futuristic feudal society. On the Moon, you must fight for every inch you want to gain. And that is just what Adriana Corta did. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the leader of the Moon's newest "dragon," Adriana has wrested control of the Moon's Helium-3 industry from the Mackenzie Metal corporation and fought to earn her family's new status. Now, in the twilight of her life, Adriana finds her corporation-Corta Helio-confronted by the many enemies she made during her meteoric rise. If the Corta family is to survive, Adriana's five children must defend their mother's empire from her many enemies... and each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The author of &lt;i&gt;The Wedding Date &lt;/i&gt;serves up a novel about what happens when a public proposal doesn't turn into a happy ending, thanks to a woman who knows exactly how to make one on her own...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When someone asks you to spend your life with him, it shouldn't come as a surprise--or happen in front of 45,000 people.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When freelance writer Nikole Paterson goes to a Dodgers game with her actor boyfriend, his man bun, and his bros, the last thing she expects is a scoreboard proposal. Saying no isn't the hard part--they've only been dating for five months, and he can't even spell her name correctly. The hard part is having to face a stadium full of disappointed fans...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the game with his sister, Carlos Ibarra comes to Nik's rescue and rushes her away from a camera crew. He's even there for her when the video goes viral and Nik's social media blows up--in a bad way. Nik knows that in the wilds of LA, a handsome doctor like Carlos can't be looking for anything serious, so she embarks on an epic rebound with him, filled with food, fun, and fantastic sex. But when their glorified hookups start breaking the rules, one of them has to be smart enough to put on the brakes...</description>

  <description>Robert McCammon’s first contemporary novel in nearly two decades, &lt;i&gt;The Five&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of an eponymous rock band struggling to survive on the margins of the music business. As they move through the American Southwest on what might be their final tour together, the band members come to the attention of a damaged Iraq war veteran, and their lives are changed forever. This is a riveting account of violence, terror, and pursuit set against a credible, immensely detailed rock and roll backdrop. It is also a moving meditation on loyalty and friendship. Written with wit, elegance, and passionate conviction, &lt;i&gt;The Five&lt;/i&gt; reaffirms McCammon’s position as one of the finest, most unpredictable storytellers of our time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Named a Best Book of 2018 by &lt;i&gt;Fast Company&lt;/i&gt;, this is a "sharply written and brilliantly reported" (&lt;i&gt;Shelf Awareness&lt;/i&gt;) look inside Reddit, the wildly popular, often misunderstood website that has changed the culture of the Internet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Reddit hails itself as "the front page of the Internet." It's the third most-visited website in the United States--and yet, millions of Americans have no idea what it is. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;We Are the Nerds&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;is an engrossing look deep inside this captivating, maddening enterprise, whose army of obsessed users have been credited with everything from solving cold case crimes and spurring tens of millions of dollars in charitable donations to seeding alt-right fury and landing Donald Trump in the White House. &lt;i&gt;We Are the Nerds&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping start-up narrative: the story of how Reddit's founders, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, rose up from their suburban childhoods to become millionaires and create an icon of the digital age--before seeing the site engulfed in controversies and nearly losing control of it for good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Based on Christine Lagorio-Chafkin's exclusive access to founders Ohanian and Huffman,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;We Are the Nerds&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;is also a compelling exploration of the way we all communicate today--and how we got here. Reddit and its users have become a mirror of the Internet: it has dingy corners, shiny memes, malicious trolls, and a sometimes heart-melting ability to connect people across cultures, oceans, and ideological divides.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A Rock Star Kidnaps a Runaway Bride…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kidnapping the bride seemed like a good idea at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her fiancé stole my fortune, so I stole his woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tit for tat. Or tat for tit. However you want to look at it.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I didn’t expect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willow Honeycutt, preschool teacher, boy band super fan, is completely crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And somehow she’s turned the tables on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, she’s holding me hostage, and she won’t let me go until we hit every item on her sparkly new, completely insane bucket list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that last item?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That last item might cost me more than any fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It very well might cost me my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rockaway Bride&lt;/i&gt; is a romping fun romance between a down-on-his-luck rock star and a boy band-loving preschool teacher, complete with a road trip, handcuffs, and fun with nuns. This romantic comedy stands alone with no cheating or cliffhangers and ends with a rockin' awesome happily ever after.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She’s my sun and moon.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;My stars, my air, my sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s every heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are two kinds of women in the world – those I can bang, and those I can’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My teammate’s sister?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s a &lt;i&gt;can’t&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I moved in with her to protect her from a nasty ex, not to be the next guy in line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s the brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m the brawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s the fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m the sausage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She talks too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t talk at all, if I don’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should be easy to resist her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But every minute I spend with Felicity is another minute she gets under my skin. She makes me feel like something more than a dumb puckhead with a big Zamboni pony. And it’s getting harder to remember why I need to keep my hands to myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Beauty and the Beefcake is a vegan-friendly standalone romantic comedy featuring a hockey player whose vocabulary is the only thing smaller than a hockey puck, a book smart but aimless ventriloquist with too many voices in her head, a dilapidated old house that may or may not be haunted, and no cheating or cliffhangers.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A hockey-playing prince, a most improper lady, and one accidental pregnancy... &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you’re an heir so spare that getting attacked by a shark is more likely than you ever wearing the crown, you’re only allowed certain liberties. Yet still, those liberties can bite you in the ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good thing I’m such a charming devil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even then, I’ve been banished to America for a year under the pretense of playing professional hockey while my father cleans up my latest mess. But trouble follows me wherever I go. Generally trouble of the beautiful female variety, and Gracie Diamonte is no exception. Or possibly, she’s the best exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the dinosaur suit. The cookie incident. And the accidental pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I’ll do the right thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as soon as I solve that pesky problem of my royal betrothal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m about to be the biggest scandal to rock my country and there’s a good chance my father may throw me to the sharks after all. The funny thing is I’ve heard that raising children may not be so different from swimming with the sharks. So no matter how you look at things I am Royally Pucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Royally Pucked is a hilariously wrong romance between a spare heir and the lady least likely to ever wear a princess crown, complete with dirty cookies, an emotional support monkey, and lots of pucking around. This romantic comedy stands alone with no cheating, cliffhangers and ends happily with a family of…more than two.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He’s the biggest, baddest, most spider-fearing motherpucker on the ice…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you’re named after the king of the gods, the world expects certain things of you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tough? Damn right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Smart? Don’t let the hockey uniform fool you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Large and in charge? Honey, I’m the biggest, baddest, mother pucking-est machine to ever own the ice. I shoot. I score. In and out of the rink. I don’t come early, but I come often, if you know what I mean. And I always leave the ladies wanting more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Until that chick last night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I’m no one-thrust wonder, and you’re damn right I’m going to prove to her I can do better. But every time I think I’m finally on my way back into her pants, she one-ups and out-balls me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should cut my losses, lick my wounds, and walk away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Zeus Berger doesn’t walk away from anything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Especially when she's the only woman in the world who might be able to handle me.</description>

  <description>When it comes to women, I know what they want. And all day long, I give it to them. Dark, broody, and sexy? You got it. Need to laugh? I’m your guy. Desperate for something to put you in the mood? You’ve come to the right place, kitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning when my library opens, there’s a line around the block, the ladies flocking to me in need of their next book boyfriend. I’m that dude. The one who knows his way around the romance section. And if you think that hasn’t gotten me plenty of action over the years, you’d be wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I've made a few miscalculations, and now my reputation has my job in danger. If I can’t prove to my boss that I’m more than a playboy who recommends romance in the hopes of getting some hanky panky in the stacks, I can kiss my job goodbye.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;At last, the full story behind Megan Mullally and Nick Offerman's epic romance, including stories, portraits, and the occasional puzzle, all telling the smoldering tale that has fascinated Hollywood for over a decade.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year: 2000. The setting: Los Angeles. A gorgeous virtuoso of an actress had agreed to star in a random play, and a basement-dwelling scenic carpenter had said he would assay a supporting role in the selfsame pageant. At the first rehearsal, she surveyed her fellow cast members, as one does, determining if any of the men might qualify to provide her with a satisfying fling. Her gaze fell upon the carpenter, and like a bolt of lightning, the thought struck her: No dice. Moving on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, unbeknownst to our protagonists, Cupid had merely set down his bow and picked up a rocket launcher. Then fired a love rocket (not a euphemism). The players were Megan Mullally and Nick Offerman, and the resulting romance, once it ignited, was . . . epic. Beyond epic. It resulted in a coupling that has endured to this day; a sizzling, perpetual tryst that has captivated the world with its kindness, athleticism, astonishingly low-brow humor, and true (fire emoji) passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did they do it? They came from completely different families, endured a significant age difference, and were separated by the gulf of several social strata. Megan loved books and art history; Nick loved hammers. But much more than these seemingly unsurpassable obstacles were the values they held in common: respect, decency, the ability to mention genitalia in almost any context, and an abiding obsession with the songs of Tom Waits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eighteen years later, they're still very much in love, and have finally decided to reveal the philosophical mountains they have conquered, the lessons they've learned, and the myriad jigsaw puzzles they've completed, in a book. Featuring anecdotes, hijinks, interviews, photos, and a veritable grab bag of tomfoolery, this is not only the intoxicating book that Mullally's and Offerman's fans have been waiting for, it might just hold the solution to the greatest threat facing our modern world: the single life.</description>

  <description>What was once the western United States is now home to the Republic, a nation perpetually at war with its neighbors. Born into an elite family in one of the Republic's wealthiest districts, fifteen-year-old June is a prodigy being groomed for success in the Republic's highest military circles. Born into the slums, fifteen-year-old Day is the country's most wanted criminal. But his motives may not be as malicious as they seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From very different worlds, June and Day have no reason to cross paths—until the day June's brother, Metias, is murdered and Day becomes the prime suspect. Caught in the ultimate game of cat and mouse, Day is in a race for his family's survival, while June seeks to avenge Metias's death. But in a shocking turn of events, the two uncover the truth of what has really brought them together, and the sinister lengths their country will go to keep its secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternate Cover edition for ISBN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29863705-legend" rel="nofollow"&gt;9780399256752&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>For the first time, the final years of one of the world's most captivating rock showman are laid bare. Including interviews from Freddie Mercury's closest friends in the last years of his life, along with personal photographs, &lt;i&gt;Somebody to Love&lt;/i&gt; is an authoritative biography of the great man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are previously unknown and startling facts about the singer and his life, moving detail on his lifelong search for love and personal fulfilment, and of course his tragic contraction of a then killer disease in the mid-1980s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Woven throughout Freddie's life is the shocking story of how the HIV virus came to hold the world in its grip, was cruelly labelled 'The Gay Plague' and the unwitting few who indirectly infected thousands of men, women and children - Freddie Mercury himself being one of the most famous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The death of this vibrant and spectacularly talented rock star, shook the world of medicine as well as the world of music. &lt;i&gt;Somebody to Love&lt;/i&gt; finally puts the record straight and pays detailed tribute to the man himself.</description>

  <description>With winter looming, a small northern Anishinaabe community loses communication. Days later, it goes dark. Cut off from the urban realm of the south, many of its people become passive and confused. They eventually descend into panic as the food supply dwindles, with few hunters left in the First Nation. While the band council and a pocket of community members struggle to maintain order, an unexpected visitor arrives from a city in the south to escape a crumbling society. Soon after, others follow. The community leadership is faced with the dilemma of allowing the urban refugees to live with them on their territory. Tensions rise, and as the months pass, so does the death toll due to sickness and despair. Frustrated by the building chaos, a group of young friends and their families turn to the land and tradition in hopes of helping their community thrive again, while they grapple with a grave decision.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Trail of Broken Wings&lt;/i&gt; comes an epic story of the unrelenting force of love, the power of healing, and the invincible desire to dream.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing prepares Jaya, a New York journalist, for the heartbreak of her third miscarriage and the slow unraveling of her marriage in its wake. Desperate to assuage her deep anguish, she decides to go to India to uncover answers to her family’s past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intoxicated by the sights, smells, and sounds she experiences, Jaya becomes an eager student of the culture. But it is Ravi—her grandmother’s former servant and trusted confidant—who reveals the resilience, struggles, secret love, and tragic fall of Jaya’s pioneering grandmother during the British occupation. Through her courageous grandmother’s arrestingly romantic and heart-wrenching story, Jaya discovers the legacy bequeathed to her and a strength that, until now, she never knew was possible.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Could ten days at a health resort really change you forever? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These nine perfect strangers are about to find out...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nine people gather at a remote health resort. Some are here to lose weight, some are here to get a reboot on life, some are here for reasons they can’t even admit to themselves. Amidst all of the luxury and pampering, the mindfulness and meditation, they know these ten days might involve some real work. But none of them could imagine just how challenging the next ten days are going to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances Welty, the formerly best-selling romantic novelist, arrives at Tranquillum House nursing a bad back, a broken heart, and an exquisitely painful paper cut. She’s immediately intrigued by her fellow guests. Most of them don’t look to be in need of a health resort at all. But the person that intrigues her most is the strange and charismatic owner/director of Tranquillum House. Could this person really have the answers Frances didn’t even know she was seeking? Should Frances put aside her doubts and immerse herself in everything Tranquillum House has to offer—or should she run while she still can?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not long before every guest at Tranquillum House is asking exactly the same question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combining all of the hallmarks that have made Liane Moriarty's writing a go-to for anyone looking for wickedly smart, page-turning fiction that will make you laugh and gasp, &lt;i&gt;Nine Perfect Strangers&lt;/i&gt; once again shows why she is a master of her craft.</description>

  <description>The fourth and final part of the Murderbot Diaries series that began with &lt;i&gt;All Systems Red.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murderbot wasn’t programmed to care. So, its decision to help the only human who ever showed it respect must be a system glitch, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having traveled the width of the galaxy to unearth details of its own murderous transgressions, as well as those of the GrayCris Corporation, Murderbot is heading home to help Dr. Mensah—its former owner (protector? friend?)—submit evidence that could prevent GrayCris from destroying more colonists in its never-ending quest for profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But who’s going to believe a SecUnit gone rogue?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what will become of it when it’s caught?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In 1776, an elite group of soldiers were handpicked to serve as George Washington’s bodyguards. Washington trusted them; relied on them. But unbeknownst to Washington, some of them were part of a treasonous plan. In the months leading up to the Revolutionary War, these traitorous soldiers, along with the Governor of New York William Tryon and Mayor David Mathews, launched a deadly plot against the most important member of the military: George Washington himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of the secret plot and how it was revealed. It is a story of leaders, liars, counterfeiters, and jailhouse confessors. It also shows just how hard the battle was for George Washington—and how close America was to losing the Revolutionary War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking place during the most critical period of our nation’s birth, The First Conspiracy tells a remarkable and previously untold piece of American history that not only reveals George Washington’s character, but also illuminates the origins of America’s counterintelligence movement that led to the modern day CIA.</description>

  <description>The Consuming Fire―the sequel to the 2018 Hugo Award Best Novel finalist and 2018 Locus Award-winning The Collapsing Empire―an epic space-opera novel in the bestselling Interdependency series, from New York Times bestselling author John Scalzi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Interdependency―humanity’s interstellar empire―is on the verge of collapse. The extra-dimensional conduit that makes travel between the stars possible is disappearing, leaving entire systems and human civilizations stranded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emperox Grayland II of the Interdependency is ready to take desperate measures to help ensure the survival of billions. But arrayed before her are those who believe the collapse of the Flow is a myth―or at the very least an opportunity to an ascension to power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Grayland prepares for disaster, others are preparing for a civil war. A war that will take place in the halls of power, the markets of business and the altars of worship as much as it will between spaceships and battlefields.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emperox and her allies are smart and resourceful, as are her enemies. Nothing about this will be easy... and all of humanity will be caught in its consuming fire.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Beware of the woods and the dark, dank deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’ll follow you home, and he won’t let you sleep.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who are the Sawkill Girls?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marion: the new girl. Awkward and plain, steady and dependable. Weighed down by tragedy and hungry for love she’s sure she’ll never find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoey: the pariah. Luckless and lonely, hurting but hiding it. Aching with grief and dreaming of vanished girls. Maybe she’s broken—or maybe everyone else is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Val: the queen bee. Gorgeous and privileged, ruthless and regal. Words like silk and eyes like knives, a heart made of secrets and a mouth full of lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their stories come together on the island of Sawkill Rock, where gleaming horses graze in rolling pastures and cold waves crash against black cliffs. Where kids whisper the legend of an insidious monster at parties and around campfires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where girls have been disappearing for decades, stolen away by a ravenous evil no one has dared to fight… until now.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In their world, telling the truth has become the most dangerous crime of all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the near-future United States, a one-child policy is ruthlessly enforced. Everyone follows the Rule of One. But Ava Goodwin, daughter of the head of the Texas Family Planning Division, has a secret—one her mother died to keep and her father has helped to hide for her entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has an identical twin sister, Mira.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For eighteen years Ava and Mira have lived as one, trading places day after day, maintaining an interchangeable existence down to the most telling detail. But when their charade is exposed, their worst nightmare begins. Now they must leave behind the father they love and fight for their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Branded as traitors, hunted as fugitives, and pushed to discover just how far they’ll go in order to stay alive, Ava and Mira rush headlong into a terrifying unknown.</description>

  <description>At an exclusive school somewhere outside of Arlington, Virginia, students aren't taught history, geography, or mathematics--at least not in the usual ways. Instead, they are taught to persuade. Here the art of coercion has been raised to a science. Students harness the hidden power of language to manipulate the mind and learn to break down individuals by psychographic markers in order to take control of their thoughts. The very best will graduate as "poets", adept wielders of language who belong to a nameless organization that is as influential as it is secretive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whip-smart orphan Emily Ruff is making a living running a three-card Monte game on the streets of San Francisco when she attracts the attention of the organization's recruiters. She is flown across the country for the school's strange and rigorous entrance exams, where, once admitted, she will be taught the fundamentals of persuasion by Bronte, Eliot, and Lowell--who have adopted the names of famous poets to conceal their true identities. For in the organization, nothing is more dangerous than revealing who you are: Poets must never expose their feelings lest they be manipulated. Emily becomes the school's most talented prodigy until she makes a catastrophic mistake: She falls in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, a seemingly innocent man named Wil Jamieson is brutally ambushed by two strange men in an airport bathroom. Although he has no recollection of anything they claim he's done, it turns out Wil is the key to a secret war between rival factions of poets and is quickly caught in their increasingly deadly crossfire. Pursued relentlessly by people with powers he can barely comprehend and protected by the very man who first attacked him, Wil discovers that everything he thought he knew about his past was fiction. In order to survive, must journey to the toxically decimated town of Broken Hill, Australia, to discover who he is and why an entire town was blown off the map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the two narratives converge, the shocking work of the poets is fully revealed, the body count rises, and the world crashes toward a Tower of Babel event which would leave all language meaningless. A brilliant thriller that connects very modern questions of privacy, identity, and the rising obsession of data collection to centuries-old ideas about the power of language and coercion, &lt;i&gt;Lexicon&lt;/i&gt; is Max Barry's most ambitious and spellbinding novel yet.</description>

  <description>Although Scott Carey doesn’t look any different, he’s been steadily losing weight. There are a couple of other odd things, too. He weighs the same in his clothes and out of them, no matter how heavy they are. Scott doesn’t want to be poked and prodded. He mostly just wants someone else to know, and he trusts Doctor Bob Ellis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the small town of Castle Rock, the setting of many of King’s most iconic stories, Scott is engaged in a low grade—but escalating—battle with the lesbians next door whose dog regularly drops his business on Scott’s lawn. One of the women is friendly; the other, cold as ice. Both are trying to launch a new restaurant, but the people of Castle Rock want no part of a gay married couple, and the place is in trouble. When Scott finally understands the prejudices they face–including his own—he tries to help. Unlikely alliances, the annual foot race, and the mystery of Scott’s affliction bring out the best in people who have indulged the worst in themselves and others.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this highly anticipated sequel to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling &lt;em&gt;The Gentleman’s Guide to Vice and Virtue&lt;/em&gt;, Felicity Montague must use all her womanly wits and wiles to achieve her dreams of becoming a doctor—even if she has to scheme her way across Europe to do it. A must-have for fans of Mackenzi Lee’s extraordinary and Stonewall Honor-winning novel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year after an accidentally whirlwind grand tour with her brother Monty, Felicity Montague has returned to England with two goals in mind—avoid the marriage proposal of a lovestruck suitor from Edinburgh and enroll in medical school. However, her intellect and passion will never be enough in the eyes of the administrators, who see men as the sole guardians of science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then a window of opportunity opens—a doctor she idolizes is marrying an old friend of hers in Germany. Felicity believes if she could meet this man he could change her future, but she has no money of her own to make the trip. Luckily, a mysterious young woman is willing to pay Felicity’s way, so long as she’s allowed to travel with Felicity disguised as her maid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of her suspicions, Felicity agrees, but once the girl’s true motives are revealed, Felicity becomes part of a perilous quest that leads them from the German countryside to the promenades of Zurich to secrets lurking beneath the Atlantic.</description>

  <description>During Sarah Smarsh’s turbulent childhood in Kansas in the 1980s and 1990s, the forces of cyclical poverty and the country’s changing economic policies solidified her family’s place among the working poor. By telling the story of her life and the lives of the people she loves, Smarsh challenges us to look more closely at the class divide in our country and examine the myths about people thought to &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; less because they &lt;i&gt;earn&lt;/i&gt; less. Her personal history affirms the corrosive impact intergenerational poverty can have on individuals, families, and communities, and she explores this idea as lived experience, metaphor, and level of consciousness.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Smarsh was born a fifth generation Kansas wheat farmer on her paternal side and the product of generations of teen mothers on her maternal side. Through her experiences growing up as the daughter of a dissatisfied young mother and raised predominantly by her grandmother on a farm thirty miles west of Wichita, we are given a unique and essential look into the lives of poor and working class Americans living in the heartland. Combining memoir with powerful analysis and cultural commentary, &lt;i&gt;Heartland &lt;/i&gt;is an uncompromising look at class, identity, and the particular perils of having less in a country known for its excess.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He'll love him in any lifetime.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neil isn’t a ghost, but he feels like one. Reincarnated with all his memories from his prior life, he spent twenty years trapped in a child’s body, wanting nothing more than to grow up and reclaim the love of his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an adult, Neil finds there's more than lost time separating them. Joshua has built a beautiful life since Neil’s death, and how exactly is Neil supposed to introduce himself? As Joshua's long-dead lover in a new body? Heartbroken and hopeless, Neil takes refuge in his work, developing microscopic robots called nanites that can produce medical miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Joshua meets a young scientist working on a medical project, his soul senses something his rational mind can't believe. Has Neil truly come back to him after twenty years? And if the impossible is real, can they be together at long last?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Any Given Lifetime&lt;/i&gt; is a gay romance by Leta Blake featuring reincarnation and true love. This story includes some angst, some steam, and, of course, a happy ending.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;I Knew You’d Be Lovely&lt;/i&gt; comes an empowering and disarmingly funny memoir about grief and illness—and the wit and wisdom it takes to survive it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a child, Alethea Black drifts between her father, a brilliant mathematician who is also her best friend, and her mother, a frank and outspoken woman on fire. After her father’s death, Alethea is left unmoored, a young woman more connected to life’s ethereal mysteries than to practical things such as doing laundry or paying taxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, just when life seems to be getting back on track, she’s suddenly racked by crushing fatigue, inexplicable pain, and memory loss. With her grasp on reality fading, and specialist after specialist declaring nothing is wrong, Alethea turns to her own research and desperate home remedies. But even as her frantic quest for wellness seems to lead to confusion and despair, she discovers more about her own strength than she ever could have imagined—and becomes a woman on fire herself.</description>

  <description>It has a dark past – one in which a number of humans were killed. A past that caused it to christen itself “Murderbot”. But it has only vague memories of the massacre that spawned that title, and it wants to know more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teaming up with a Research Transport vessel named ART (you don’t want to know what the “A” stands for), Murderbot heads to the mining facility where it went rogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it discovers will forever change the way it thinks…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Philip K. Dick Award Winner for Distinguished Science Fiction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When she fell asleep, the world was doomed. When she awoke, it was dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of a fever that decimated the earth’s population—killing women and children and making childbirth deadly for the mother and infant—the midwife must pick her way through the bones of the world she once knew to find her place in this dangerous new one. Gone are the pillars of civilization. All that remains is power—and the strong who possess it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few women like her survived, though they are scarce. Even fewer are safe from the clans of men, who, driven by fear, seek to control those remaining. To preserve her freedom, she dons men’s clothing, goes by false names, and avoids as many people as possible. But as the world continues to grapple with its terrible circumstances, she’ll discover a role greater than chasing a pale imitation of independence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, if humanity is to be reborn, someone must be its guide.</description>

  <description>Things have never been easy for Oscar, a sweet but disastrously overweight, lovesick Dominican ghetto nerd. From his home in New Jersey, where he lives with his old-world mother and rebellious sister, Oscar dreams of becoming the Dominican J. R. R. Tolkien and, most of all, of finding love. But he may never get what he wants, thanks to the Fukœ—the curse that has haunted the Oscar's family for generations, dooming them to prison, torture, tragic accidents, and, above all, ill-starred love. Oscar, still waiting for his first kiss, is just its most recent victim. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diaz immerses us in the tumultuous life of Oscar and the history of the family at large, rendering with genuine warmth and dazzling energy, humor, and insight the Dominican-American experience, and, ultimately, the endless human capacity to persevere in the face of heartbreak and loss. A true literary triumph, &lt;i&gt;The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao&lt;/i&gt; confirms Junot Diaz as one of the best and most exciting voices of our time.</description>

  <description>Set in an America where half the population has been silenced, &lt;i&gt;VOX&lt;/i&gt; is the harrowing, unforgettable story of what one woman will do to protect herself and her daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the day the government decrees that women are no longer allowed to speak more than 100 words daily, Dr. Jean McClellan is in denial—this can't happen here. Not in America. Not to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is just the beginning.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon women can no longer hold jobs. Girls are no longer taught to read or write. Females no longer have a voice. Before, the average person spoke sixteen thousand words a day, but now women only have one hundred to make themselves heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is not the end.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For herself, her daughter, and every woman silenced, Jean will reclaim her voice.</description>

  <description>The U.S. literary debut of an up-and-coming Pakistani essayist and novelist &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This novel revolves around the last three months of Benazir Bhotto's life -- from her arrival back in Pakistan in October of 2007 to her death in a suicide bombing on December 27th -- as told through the eyes of Ali, a young journalist who is the estranged son of a wealthy landowner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contemporary narrative has flashbacks to the history of Ali's feudal family, Sufi mystics, a warrior clan, and the history of outside British and American interference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Bhutto serving as the centerpiece of the deadly turmoil, Bina Shah reveals the many contradictions of a country that is struggling to enter into modernity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Season for Martyrs&lt;/i&gt; is her US debut, and we have lightning in a bottle with this very, very talented novelist and journalist.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Little Princes&lt;/i&gt; is the epic story of Conor Grennan's battle to save the lost children of Nepal and how he found himself in the process. Part &lt;i&gt;Three Cups of Tea&lt;/i&gt;, and part &lt;i&gt;Into Thin Air&lt;/i&gt;, Grennan's remarkable memoir is at once gripping and inspirational, and it carries us deep into an exotic world that most readers know little about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;One Person Can Make a Difference&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In search of adventure, twenty-nine-year-old Conor Grennan traded his day job for a year-long trip around the globe, a journey that began with a three-month stint volunteering at the Little Princes Children's Home, an orphanage in war-torn Nepal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conor was initially reluctant to volunteer, unsure whether he had the proper skill, or enough passion, to get involved in a developing country in the middle of a civil war. But he was soon overcome by the herd of rambunctious, resilient children who would challenge and reward him in a way that he had never imagined. When Conor learned the unthinkable truth about their situation, he was stunned: The children were not orphans at all. Child traffickers were promising families in remote villages to protect their children from the civil war - for a huge fee - by taking them to safety. They would then abandon the children far from home, in the chaos of Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Conor, what began as a footloose adventure becomes a commitment to reunite the children he had grown to love with their families, but this would be no small task. He would risk his life on a journey through the legendary mountains of Nepal, facing the dangers of a bloody civil war and a debilitating injury. Waiting for Conor back in Kathmandu, and hopeful he would make it out before being trapped in by snow, was the woman who would eventually become his wife and share his life's work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Little Princes&lt;/i&gt; is a true story of families and children, and what one person is capable of when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. At turns tragic, joyful, and hilarious, &lt;i&gt;Little Princes&lt;/i&gt; is a testament to the power of faith and the ability of love to carry us beyond our wildest expectations.</description>

  <description>In a star system dominated by the brutal Vathek empire, eighteen-year-old Amani is a dreamer. She dreams of what life was like before the occupation; she dreams of writing poetry like the old-world poems she adores; she dreams of receiving a sign from Dihya that one day, she, too, will have adventure, and travel beyond her isolated moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when adventure comes for Amani, it is not what she expects: she is kidnapped by the regime and taken in secret to the royal palace, where she discovers that she is nearly identical to the cruel half-Vathek Princess Maram. The princess is so hated by her conquered people that she requires a body double, someone to appear in public as Maram, ready to die in her place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Amani is forced into her new role, she can’t help but enjoy the palace’s beauty—and her time with the princess’ fiancé, Idris. But the glitter of the royal court belies a world of violence and fear. If Amani ever wishes to see her family again, she must play the princess to perfection...because one wrong move could lead to her death.</description>

  <description>1934. Businesses went under by the hundreds, debt and foreclosures boomed, and breadlines grew in many American cities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the midst of this misery, some folks explored unscrupulous ways to make money. Angel-faced John Partlow and carnival huckster Ginger LaFrance are among the worst of this lot. Joining together they leave their small time confidence scams behind to attempt an elaborate kidnapping-for-ransom scheme in New Orleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a different part of town, Curtis Mayhew, a young black man who works as a redcap for the Union Railroad Station, has a reputation for mending quarrels and misunderstandings among his friends. What those friends don't know is that Curtis has a special talent for listening... and he can sometimes hear things that aren't spoken aloud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, Curtis Mayhew's special talent allows him to overhear a child's cry for help (THIS MAN IN THE CAR HE'S GOT A GUN), which draws him into the dangerous world of Partlow and LaFrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gritty depression-era crime thriller is a complex tale enriched by powerfully observed social commentary and hints of the supernatural, and it represents Robert McCammon writing at the very top of his game.</description>

  <description>In modern, beautiful Green City, the capital of South West Asia, gender selection, war and disease have brought the ratio of men to women to alarmingly low levels. The government uses terror and technology to control its people, and women must take multiple husbands to have children as quickly as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet there are women who resist, women who live in an underground collective and refuse to be part of the system. Secretly protected by the highest echelons of power, they emerge only at night, to provide to the rich and elite of Green City a type of commodity that nobody can buy: intimacy without sex. As it turns out, not even the most influential men can shield them from discovery and the dangers of ruthless punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dystopian novel from one of Pakistan’s most talented writers is a modern-day parable, &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/i&gt; about women’s lives in repressive Muslim countries everywhere. It takes the patriarchal practices of female seclusion and veiling, gender selection, and control over women’s bodies, amplifies and distorts them in a truly terrifying way to imagine a world of post-religious authoritarianism.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The end of the world is the weirdest time to come of age.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the end of the world. One minute, people are going about their lives, and the next—&lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;. In the wake of the inexplicable purge, only a handful of young misfits remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it all went down, “Wizard of Odd” Dev Brinkman was seeking shelter from the taunts of his classmates. Goth girl Lucy Abernathy had lost her best friend and had no clue where to turn. And Twinkie-loving quarterback “Marcus” Haddad was learning why you never discuss politics and religion in polite company—or online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if life when you’re sixteen isn’t confusing enough, throw in the challenges of postapocalyptic subsistence, a case of survivor’s guilt turned up to seven billion, and the small task of rebuilding humankind…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one said doomsday would be a breeze. But for Dev, Lucy, and Marcus, the greatest hope—and greatest threat—will come when they find each other.</description>

  <description>An alternate history / historical fantasy / steampunk novel set in the Belgian Congo, from noted short story writer Nisi Shawl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everfair&lt;/i&gt; is a wonderful Neo-Victorian alternate history novel that explores the question of what might have come of Belgium's disastrous colonization of the Congo if the native populations had learned about steam technology a bit earlier. Fabian Socialists from Great Britian join forces with African-American missionaries to purchase land from the Belgian Congo's "owner," King Leopold II. This land, named Everfair, is set aside as a safe haven, an imaginary Utopia for native populations of the Congo as well as escaped slaves returning from America and other places where African natives were being mistreated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawl's speculative masterpiece manages to turn one of the worst human rights disasters on record into a marvelous and exciting exploration of the possibilities inherent in a turn of history. &lt;i&gt;Everfair&lt;/i&gt; is told from a multiplicity of voices: Africans, Europeans, East Asians, and African Americans in complex relationships with one another, in a compelling range of voices that have historically been silenced. &lt;i&gt;Everfair&lt;/i&gt; is not only a beautiful book but an educational and inspiring one that will give the reader new insight into an often ignored period of history.</description>

  <description>At an exclusive school somewhere outside of Arlington, Virginia, students aren’t taught history, geography, or mathematics—at least not in the usual ways. Instead, they are taught to persuade. Here the art of coercion has been raised to a science .Students harness the hidden power of language to manipulate the mind and learn to break down individuals by psychographic markers in order to take control of their thoughts. The very best will graduate as “poets”: adept wielders of languagewho belong to a nameless organization that is as influential as it is secretive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whip-smart orphan Emily Ruff is making a living running a three-card Monte game on the streets of San Francisco when she attracts the attention of the organization’s recruiters. She is flown across the country for the school’s strange and rigorous entrance exams, where, once admitted, she will be taught the fundamentals of persuasion by Brontë, Eliot, and Lowell—who have adopted the names of famous poets to conceal their true identities. For in the organization, nothing is more dangerous than revealing who you are: Poets must never expose their feelings lest they be manipulated. Emily becomes the school’s most talented prodigy until she makes a catastrophic mistake: She falls in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, a seemingly innocent man named Wil Jamieson is brutally ambushed by two strange men in an airport bathroom. Although he has no recollection of anything they claim he’s done, it turns out Wil is the key to a secret war between rival factions of poets and is quickly caught in their increasingly deadly crossfire. Pursued relentlessly by people with powers he can barely comprehend and protected by the very man who first attacked him, Wil discovers that everything he thought he knew about his past was fiction. In order to survive, must journey to the toxically decimated tow nof Broken Hill, Australia, to discover who he is and why an entire town was blown off the map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the two narratives converge, the shocking work of the poets is fully revealed, the body count rises, and the world crashes toward a Tower of Babel event which would leave all language meaningless. Max Barry’s most spellbinding and ambitious novel yet, Lexicon is a brilliant thriller that explores language, power, identity, and our capacity to love—whatever the cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the acclaimed, PEN/Bingham Prize-winning &lt;i&gt;A Naked Singularity;&lt;/i&gt; a shockingly hilarious novel that tackles, with equal aplomb, both America's most popular sport and its criminal justice system.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Paterson, New Jersey to Rikers Island to the streets of New York City, Sergio De La Pava's &lt;i&gt;Lost Empress &lt;/i&gt;introduces readers to a cast of characters unlike any other in modern fiction: dreamers and exiles, immigrants and night-shift workers, lonely pastors and others at the fringes of society--each with their own impact on the fragile universe they navigate. At the story's center is Nina Gill, daughter of the aging owner of the Dallas Cowboys, who was instrumental in building her father's dynasty. So it's a shock when her brother inherits the team and she is left with the Paterson Pork, New Jersey's only Indoor Football League franchise. Nina vows to take on the NFL and make the Paterson Pork pigskin kings of America. Meanwhile, Nuno DeAngeles--a brilliant and lethal criminal mastermind--has gotten himself thrown into Rikers to commit perhaps the most audacious crime of all time. With grace, humor, and razor-sharp prose, De La Pava tackles everything from Salvador Dali, Joni Mitchell, psychiatric help, and emergency medicine to religion, the many species of love, and theoretical physics, as all these threads combine to count down to an epic conclusion.</description>

  <description>For fans of Tina Fey and David Sedaris—Internet star Jenny Lawson, aka The Bloggess, makes her literary debut.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Jenny Lawson realized that the most mortifying moments of our lives—the ones we’d like to pretend never happened—are in fact the ones that define us. In the #1 N&lt;i&gt;ew York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Let’s Pretend This Never Happened&lt;/i&gt;, Lawson takes readers on a hilarious journey recalling her bizarre upbringing in rural Texas, her devastatingly awkward high school years, and her relationship with her long-suffering husband, Victor. Chapters include: “Stanley the Magical, Talking Squirrel”; “A Series of Angry Post-It Notes to My Husband”; “My Vagina Is Fine. Thanks for Asking”; “And Then I Snuck a Dead Cuban Alligator on an Airplane.” Pictures with captions (no one would believe these things without proof) accompany the text.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Although his career as a bestselling author and on &lt;i&gt;The Daily Show With Jon Stewart&lt;/i&gt; was founded on fake news and invented facts, in 2016 that routine didn't seem as funny to John Hodgman anymore. Everyone is doing it now. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disarmed of falsehood, he was left only with the awful truth: John Hodgman is an older white male monster with bad facial hair, wandering like a privileged Sasquatch through three wildernesses: the hills of Western Massachusetts where he spent much of his youth; the painful beaches of Maine that want to kill him (and some day will); and the metaphoric haunted forest of middle age that connects them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vacationland &lt;/i&gt;collects these real life wanderings, and through them you learn of the horror of freshwater clams, the evolutionary purpose of the mustache, and which animals to keep as pets and which to kill with traps and poison. There is also some advice on how to react when the people of coastal Maine try to sacrifice you to their strange god.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though wildly, Hodgmaniacally funny as usual, it is also a poignant and sincere account of one human facing his forties, those years when men in particular must stop pretending to be the children of bright potential they were and settle into the failing bodies of the wiser, weird dads that they are.</description>

  <description>A novel of breathtaking sweep and emotional power that traces three hundred years in Ghana and along the way also becomes a truly great American novel. Extraordinary for its exquisite language, its implacable sorrow, its soaring beauty, and for its monumental portrait of the forces that shape families and nations, &lt;i&gt;Homegoing&lt;/i&gt; heralds the arrival of a major new voice in contemporary fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two half-sisters, Effia and Esi, are born into different villages in eighteenth-century Ghana. Effia is married off to an Englishman and lives in comfort in the palatial rooms of Cape Coast Castle. Unbeknownst to Effia, her sister, Esi, is imprisoned beneath her in the castle's dungeons, sold with thousands of others into the Gold Coast's booming slave trade, and shipped off to America, where her children and grandchildren will be raised in slavery. One thread of &lt;i&gt;Homegoing&lt;/i&gt; follows Effia's descendants through centuries of warfare in Ghana, as the Fante and Asante nations wrestle with the slave trade and British colonization. The other thread follows Esi and her children into America. From the plantations of the South to the Civil War and the Great Migration, from the coal mines of Pratt City, Alabama, to the jazz clubs and dope houses of twentieth-century Harlem, right up through the present day, &lt;i&gt;Homegoing&lt;/i&gt; makes history visceral, and captures, with singular and stunning immediacy, how the memory of captivity came to be inscribed in the soul of a nation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generation after generation, Yaa Gyasi's magisterial first novel sets the fate of the individual against the obliterating movements of time, delivering unforgettable characters whose lives were shaped by historical forces beyond their control. &lt;i&gt;Homegoing&lt;/i&gt; is a tremendous reading experience, not to be missed, by an astonishingly gifted young writer.</description>

  <description>Aisha Un-Haad would do anything for her family. When her brother contracts a plague, she knows her janitor's salary isn't enough to fund his treatment. So she volunteers to become a Scela, a mechanically enhanced soldier sworn to protect and serve the governing body of the Fleet, the collective of starships they call home. If Aisha can survive the harrowing modifications and earn an elite place in the Scela ranks, she may be able to save her brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key Tanaka awakens in a Scela body with only hazy memories of her life before. She knows she's from the privileged end of the Fleet, but she has no recollection of why she chose to give up a life of luxury to become a hulking cyborg soldier. If she can make it through the training, she might have a shot at recovering her missing past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a unit of new recruits vying for top placement, Aisha's and Key's paths collide, and the two must learn to work together--a tall order for girls from opposite ends of the Fleet. But a rebellion is stirring, pitting those who yearn for independence from the Fleet against a government struggling to maintain unity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With violence brewing and dark secrets surfacing, Aisha and Key find themselves questioning their loyalties. They will have to put aside their differences, though, if they want to keep humanity from tearing itself apart.</description>

  <description>After her family is killed by corrupt warlord Aric Athair and his bloodthirsty army of Bullets, Caledonia Styx is left to chart her own course on the dangerous and deadly seas. She captains her ship, the &lt;i&gt;Mors Navis&lt;/i&gt;, with a crew of girls and women just like her, who have lost their families and homes because of Aric and his men. The crew has one mission: stay alive, and take down Aric's armed and armored fleet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Caledonia's best friend and second-in-command barely survives an attack thanks to help from a Bullet looking to defect, Caledonia finds herself questioning whether to let him join their crew. Is this boy the key to taking down Aric Athair once and for all . . . or will he threaten everything the women of the &lt;i&gt;Mors Navis&lt;/i&gt; have worked for?</description>

  <description>A hip-hop retelling of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet that focuses on Tybalt (derisively referred to as "the Prince of Cats") and his Capulet crew as they do battle nightly with the hated Montagues. Set in a Blade Runner-esque version of Brooklyn, PRINCE OF CATS is a mix of urban melodrama, samurai action and classic Shakespearean theater...all written in Iambic Pentameter!</description>

  <description>It is 2140. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waters rose, submerging New York City. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the residents adapted and it remained the bustling, vibrant metropolis it had always been. Though changed forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every street became a canal. Every skyscraper an island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the eyes of the varied inhabitants of one building, Kim Stanley Robinson shows us how one of our great cities will change with the rising tides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And how we too will change.</description>

  <description>Her name is Binti, and she is the first of the Himba people ever to be offered a place at Oomza University, the finest institution of higher learning in the galaxy. But to accept the offer will mean giving up her place in her family to travel between the stars among strangers who do not share her ways or respect her customs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowledge comes at a cost, one that Binti is willing to pay, but her journey will not be easy. The world she seeks to enter has long warred with the Meduse, an alien race that has become the stuff of nightmares. Oomza University has wronged the Meduse, and Binti's stellar travel will bring her within their deadly reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Binti hopes to survive the legacy of a war not of her making, she will need both the gifts of her people and the wisdom enshrined within the University, itself - but first she has to make it there, alive.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old and not-so-openly gay Simon Spier prefers to save his drama for the school musical. But when an email falls into the wrong hands, his secret is at risk of being thrust into the spotlight. Now Simon is actually being blackmailed: if he doesn’t play wingman for class clown Martin, his sexual identity will become everyone’s business. Worse, the privacy of Blue, the pen name of the boy he’s been emailing, will be compromised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With some messy dynamics emerging in his once tight-knit group of friends, and his email correspondence with Blue growing more flirtatious every day, Simon’s junior year has suddenly gotten all kinds of complicated. Now, change-averse Simon has to find a way to step out of his comfort zone before he’s pushed out—without alienating his friends, compromising himself, or fumbling a shot at happiness with the most confusing, adorable guy he’s never met.</description>

  <description>The first novel in a brand-new alternate history series where Teddy Roosevelt is president for a second time right before WWI breaks out, and on his side is the Black Chamber, a secret spy network watching America's back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1916. The Great War rages overseas, and the whole of Europe, Africa, and western Asia is falling to the Central Powers. To win a war that must be won, Teddy Roosevelt, once again the American president, turns to his top secret Black Chamber organization--and its cunning and deadly spy, Luz O'Malley Aróstegui. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a transatlantic airship voyage, Luz poses as an anti-American Mexican revolutionary to get close--very close--to a German agent code-named Imperial Sword. She'll need every skill at her disposal to get him to trust her and lead her deep into enemy territory. In the mountains of Saxony, concealed from allied eyes, the German Reich's plans for keeping the U.S. from entering the conflict are revealed: the deployment of a new diabolical weapon upon the shores of America...</description>

  <description>The popular Beijing Duck House in Rockville, Maryland has been serving devoted regulars for decades, but behind the staff's professional smiles simmer tensions, heartaches and grudges from decades of bustling restaurant life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owner Jimmy Han has ambitions for a new high-end fusion place, hoping to eclipse his late father's homely establishment. Jimmy's older brother, Johnny, is more concerned with restoring the dignity of the family name than his faltering relationship with his own teenage daughter, Annie. Nan and Ah-Jack, longtime Duck House employees, yearn to turn their thirty-year friendship into something more, while Nan's son, Pat, struggles to stay out of trouble. When disaster strikes and Pat and Annie find themselves in a dangerous game that means tragedy for the Duck House, their families must finally confront the conflicts and loyalties simmering beneath the red and gold lanterns.</description>

  <description>Jacqueline Carey is back with an amazing adventure not seen since her New York Times bestselling Kushiel’s Legacy series. Lush and sensual, &lt;i&gt;Starless&lt;/i&gt; introduces us to an epic world where exiled gods live among us, and a hero whose journey will resonate long after the last page is turned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let your mind be like the eye of the hawk…Destined from birth to serve as protector of the princess Zariya, Khai is trained in the arts of killing and stealth by a warrior sect in the deep desert; yet there is one profound truth that has been withheld from him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the court of the Sun-Blessed, Khai must learn to navigate deadly intrigue and his own conflicted identity…but in the far reaches of the western seas, the dark god Miasmus is rising, intent on nothing less than wholesale destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Khai is to keep his soul’s twin Zariya alive, their only hope lies with an unlikely crew of prophecy-seekers on a journey that will take them farther beneath the starless skies than anyone can imagine.</description>

  <description>Henry “Monty” Montague was born and bred to be a gentleman, but he was never one to be tamed. The finest boarding schools in England and the constant disapproval of his father haven’t been able to curb any of his roguish passions—not for gambling halls, late nights spent with a bottle of spirits, or waking up in the arms of women or men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Monty embarks on his Grand Tour of Europe, his quest for a life filled with pleasure and vice is in danger of coming to an end. Not only does his father expect him to take over the family’s estate upon his return, but Monty is also nursing an impossible crush on his best friend and traveling companion, Percy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still it isn’t in Monty’s nature to give up. Even with his younger sister, Felicity, in tow, he vows to make this yearlong escapade one last hedonistic hurrah and flirt with Percy from Paris to Rome. But when one of Monty’s reckless decisions turns their trip abroad into a harrowing manhunt that spans across Europe, it calls into question everything he knows, including his relationship with the boy he adores.</description>

  <description>Leander Weatherford doesn’t want a mage, but he needs one. Enchanted mechanical animals are all the rage among the upper classes, and selling them will save his struggling family business. Enter Jak, whose enchanting ability is second only to his talent for flirting. It’s dangerous to keep such a tempting man close, but Leander can’t resist—in more ways than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jak needs money to continue his aimless life of running. A partnership with Leander provides both income and a lovely diversion. Their masterful creations catch the attention of an eccentric baroness who offers them an enormous sum for an ambitious project—a full-scale mechanical dragon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swept into a life rubbing elbows with nobility, Leander is pleased but overwhelmed. Spending both workdays and evenings with Jak, he finds himself drawing closer to the charming mage. But Jak is hiding a dangerous secret, and the truth could tear them apart.</description>

  <description>Willa Forsythe is both a violin prodigy and top-notch thief, which make her the perfect choice for a crucial task at the outset of World War I—to steal a cypher from a famous violinist currently in Wales. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lukas De Wilde has enjoyed the life of fame he's won—until now, when being recognized nearly gets him killed. Everyone wants the key to his father's work as a cryptologist. And Lukas fears that his mother and sister, who have vanished in the wake of the German invasion of Belgium, will pay the price. The only light he finds is in meeting the intriguing Willa Forsythe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But danger presses in from every side, and Willa knows what Lukas doesn't—that she must betray him and find that cypher, or her own family will pay the price as surely as his has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Read an excerpt by clicking the publisher's link below.)&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Leah Burke—girl-band drummer, master of deadpan, and Simon Spier’s best friend from the award-winning &lt;i&gt;Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda&lt;/i&gt;—takes center stage in this novel of first love and senior-year angst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to drumming, Leah Burke is usually on beat—but real life isn’t always so rhythmic. An anomaly in her friend group, she’s the only child of a young, single mom, and her life is decidedly less privileged. She loves to draw but is too self-conscious to show it. And even though her mom knows she’s bisexual, she hasn’t mustered the courage to tell her friends—not even her openly gay BFF, Simon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Leah really doesn’t know what to do when her rock-solid friend group starts to fracture in unexpected ways. With prom and college on the horizon, tensions are running high. It’s hard for Leah to strike the right note while the people she loves are fighting—especially when she realizes she might love one of them more than she ever intended.</description>

  <description>Three sisters – beautiful, cultured and aristocratic, born into immense wealth during the reign of Queen Victoria. Their dramatic lives are here unfolded in a rich historical biography certain to appeal to fans of Downton Abbey, ‘Georgiana’ and Stella Tillyard’s ‘Aristocrats’.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary, Madeline and Pamela – the three Wyndham sisters – were painted by John Singer Sargent in 1899. For The Times it was, quite simply, ‘the greatest picture of modern times’. But these beautiful, fin de siecle gentlewomen came to epitomize a vanished world. The languor of their pose reflects the leisured, gilded, existence of the late Victorian aristocracy that was to be dealt a deathblow by the First World War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet the lives of these three Wyndham sisters were far more turbulent than their air of calm suggests. Brought up in artistic circles, their childhood was liberal and romantic. Their parents were intimate friends with the Pre-Raphaelites and the girls grew to become leaders of the aesthetic movement. Bowing to convention, they made excellent marriages but found emotional support from others – Mary with Arthur Balfour and the poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt; Pamela with Liberal statesman and ornithologist Edward Grey. Their liaisons shocked society, while the First World War devastated their way of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Those Wild Wyndhams’ is their first ever biography, and is based on the many letters they have left behind – compelling, humorous and brilliantly illuminating. This sparkling debut by Claudia Renton captures them and their age in an unforgettable piece of historical and political biography.</description>

  <description>From the daughter of Ghostbusters star Harold Ramis comes a hilarious and heartwarming account of his life, work, and legacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of us know Harold Ramis as the filmmaker and actor who brought warmth and humor to the big screen in classics like Caddyshack, Ghostbusters, National Lampoon's Vacation, Groundhog Day, and National Lampoon's Animal House. To Violet Ramis, he was best known as an amazing father, confidant, and friend. In Ghostbuster's Daughter, Violet reflects on the life and legacy of her father, providing readers with an extraordinarily candid and insightful look into the man who helped shape modern American comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, endearing, and vulnerable, Ghostbuster's Daughter takes readers into the personal life of an American comedy icon, from his humble roots in Chicago and his ascension into Hollywood superstardom to his personal philosophies on life, love, and filmmaking. While the book serves as a comprehensive biography of her father's filmmaking career, Ghostbuster's Daughter is also an homage to their special father/daughter relationship. Violet weaves anecdotes about her father's unique and devoted parenting style among stories of her own unconventional upbringing, ultimately allowing readers to see a more vivid portrait of the man behind the camera. An incredibly personal biography as well as a charming family story for the ages, Ghostbuster's Daughter is an intimate look at one of America's preeminent comedy filmmakers.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Evicted &lt;/i&gt;meets &lt;i&gt;Nickel and Dimed&lt;/i&gt; in Stephanie Land's memoir about working as a maid, a beautiful and gritty exploration of poverty in America. Includes a foreword by Barbara Ehrenreich. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"My daughter learned to walk in a homeless shelter."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the gap between upper middle-class Americans and the working poor widens, grueling low-wage domestic and service work--primarily done by women--fuels the economic success of the wealthy. Stephanie Land worked for years as a maid, pulling long hours while struggling as a single mom to keep a roof over her daughter's head. In &lt;i&gt;Maid&lt;/i&gt;, she reveals the dark truth of what it takes to survive and thrive in today's inequitable society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While she worked hard to scratch her way out of poverty as a single parent, scrubbing the toilets of the wealthy, navigating domestic labor jobs, higher education, assisted housing, and a tangled web of government assistance, Stephanie wrote. She wrote the true stories that weren't being told. The stories of overworked and underpaid Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in honest, heart-rending prose and with great insight, &lt;i&gt;Maid&lt;/i&gt; explores the underbelly of upper-middle class America and the reality of what it's like to be in service to them. "I'd become a nameless ghost," Stephanie writes. With this book, she gives voice to the "servant" worker, those who fight daily to scramble and scrape by for their own lives and the lives of their children. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; A new novel from the bestselling author of&lt;em&gt; Life After Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; During WWII, Juliet Armstrong was conscripted into service as a young woman, transcribing conversations between an MI5 agent and a ring of suspected German sympathizers. Years later, in 1950 post-war London, Julie can't escape the repercussions of her work for the government, and is pulled back into the life of espionage she thought she'd left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Atkinson's latest novel brings mid-century London to life in a gripping tale of deception and consequences.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Bookseller&lt;/i&gt; follows a woman in the 1960s who must reconcile her reality with the tantalizing alternate world of her dreams&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is as permanent as it appears . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Denver, 1962: Kitty Miller has come to terms with her unconventional single life. She loves the bookshop she runs with her best friend, Frieda, and enjoys complete control over her day-to-day existence. She can come and go as she pleases, answering to no one. There was a man once, a doctor named Kevin, but it didn’t quite work out the way Kitty had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the dreams begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Denver, 1963: Katharyn Andersson is married to Lars, the love of her life. They have beautiful children, an elegant home, and good friends. It's everything Kitty Miller once believed she wanted—but it only exists when she sleeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced that these dreams are simply due to her overactive imagination, Kitty enjoys her nighttime forays into this alternate world. But with each visit, the more irresistibly real Katharyn’s life becomes. Can she choose which life she wants? If so, what is the cost of staying Kitty, or becoming Katharyn?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the lines between her worlds begin to blur, Kitty must figure out what is real and what is imagined. And how do we know where that boundary lies in our own lives?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For fans of Emma Cline's THE GIRLS and Emily St John Mandel's STATION 11, this dark, unsettling and hugely compelling story of an isolated island cult will get under your skin.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GATHER THE DAUGHTERS tells the story of an end-of-the-world cult founded years ago when ten men colonised an island. It's a society in which men reign supreme, breeding is controlled, and knowledge of the outside world is kept to a minimum. Girls are wives-in-training: at the first sign of puberty, they must marry and have children. But until that point, every summer, island tradition dictates that the children live wildly: running free, making camps, sleeping on the beach. And it is at the end of one such summer that one of the youngest girls sees something so horrifying that life on the island can never be the same again.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From debut author Maggie Shen King, &lt;em&gt;An Excess Male&lt;/em&gt; is the chilling dystopian tale of politics, inequality, marriage, love, and rebellion, set in a near-future China, that further explores the themes of the classic &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When She Woke&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;China’s One Child Policy and its cultural preference for male heirs have created a society overrun by 40 million unmarriageable men. &lt;em&gt;An Excess Male&lt;/em&gt; is one such leftover man’s quest for love and family under a State that seeks to glorify its past mistakes and impose order through authoritatian measures, reinvigorated Communist ideals, and social engineering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wei-guo holds fast to the belief that as long as he continues to improve himself, his small business, and in turn, his country, his chance at love will come. He finally saves up the dowry required to enter matchmaking talks at the lowest rung as a third husband—the maximum allowed by law. Only a single family--one harboring an illegal spouse--shows interest, yet with May-ling and her two husbands, Wei-guo feels seen, heard, and connected to like never before. But everyone and &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;—walls, streetlights, garbage cans—are listening, and men, excess or not, are dispensable to the State. Wei-guo must reach a new understanding of patriotism and test the limits of his love and his resolve in order to save himself and this family he has come to hold dear.</description>

  <description>Louise Erdrich, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling, National Book Award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;LaRose&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Round House&lt;/em&gt;, paints a startling portrait of a young woman fighting for her life and her unborn child against oppressive forces that manifest in the wake of a cataclysmic event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world as we know it is ending. Evolution has reversed itself, affecting every living creature on earth. Science cannot stop the world from running backwards, as woman after woman gives birth to infants that appear to be primitive species of humans. Twenty-six-year-old Cedar Hawk Songmaker, adopted daughter of a pair of big-hearted, open-minded Minneapolis liberals, is as disturbed and uncertain as the rest of America around her. But for Cedar, this change is profound and deeply personal. She is four months pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though she wants to tell the adoptive parents who raised her from infancy, Cedar first feels compelled to find her birth mother, Mary Potts, an Ojibwe living on the reservation, to understand both her and her baby’s origins. As Cedar goes back to her own biological beginnings, society around her begins to disintegrate, fueled by a swelling panic about the end of humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are rumors of martial law, of Congress confining pregnant women. Of a registry, and rewards for those who turn these wanted women in. Flickering through the chaos are signs of increasing repression: a shaken Cedar witnesses a family wrenched apart when police violently drag a mother from her husband and child in a parking lot. The streets of her neighborhood have been renamed with Bible verses. A stranger answers the phone when she calls her adoptive parents, who have vanished without a trace. It will take all Cedar has to avoid the prying eyes of potential informants and keep her baby safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A chilling dystopian novel both provocative and prescient, &lt;em&gt;Future Home of the Living God&lt;/em&gt; is a startlingly original work from one of our most acclaimed writers: a moving meditation on female agency, self-determination, biology, and natural rights that speaks to the troubling changes of our time.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He can’t leave his hotel. You won’t want to.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1922, Count Alexander Rostov is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, and is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel across the street from the Kremlin. Rostov, an indomitable man of erudition and wit, has never worked a day in his life, and must now live in an attic room while some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history are unfolding outside the hotel’s doors. Unexpectedly, his reduced circumstances provide him entry into a much larger world of emotional discovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brimming with humor, a glittering cast of characters, and one beautifully rendered scene after another, this singular novel casts a spell as it relates the count’s endeavor to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a man of purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the New York Times bestselling author of Rules of Civility—a transporting novel about a man who is ordered to spend the rest of his life inside a luxury hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The mega-bestseller with more than 1.5 million readers that is soon to be a major television series&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>When Leo, an Italian championship swimmer, and Naomi, a science genius from California, are two of the twenty-four teens drafted into the International Space Training Camp, their lives are forever altered. After erratic climate change has made Earth a dangerous place to live, the fate of the population rests on the shoulders of the final six who will be scouting a new planet. Intense training, global scrutiny, and cutthroat opponents are only a few of the hurdles the contestants must endure in this competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Leo, the prospect of traveling to Europa—Jupiter’s moon—to help resettle humankind is just the sense of purpose he’s been yearning for since losing his entire family in the flooding of Rome. Naomi, after learning of a similar space mission that mysteriously failed, suspects the ISTC isn’t being up front with them about what’s at risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the race to the final six advances, the tests get more challenging—even deadly. With pressure mounting, Naomi finds an unexpected friend in Leo, and the two grow closer with each mind-boggling experience they encounter. But it’s only when the finalists become fewer and their destinies grow nearer that the two can fathom the full weight of everything at stake: the world, the stars, and their lives.</description>

  <description>A collection of four chilling novels, ingeniously wrought gems of terror from the brilliantly imaginative, Joe Hill&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Snapshot&lt;/i&gt; is the disturbing story of a Silicon Valley adolescent who finds himself threatened by “The Phoenician,” a tattooed thug who possesses a Polaroid Instant Camera that erases memories, snap by snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young man takes to the skies to experience his first parachute jump. . . and winds up a castaway on an impossibly solid cloud, a Prospero’s island of roiling vapor that seems animated by a mind of its own in &lt;i&gt;Aloft&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a seemingly ordinary day in Boulder, Colorado, the clouds open up in a downpour of nails—splinters of bright crystal that shred the skin of anyone not safely under cover. &lt;i&gt;Rain&lt;/i&gt; explores this escalating apocalyptic event, as the deluge of nails spreads out across the country and around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Loaded&lt;/i&gt;, a mall security guard in a coastal Florida town courageously stops a mass shooting and becomes a hero to the modern gun rights movement. But under the glare of the spotlights, his story begins to unravel, taking his sanity with it. When an out-of-control summer blaze approaches the town, he will reach for the gun again and embark on one last day of reckoning.</description>

Then, suddenly, on what should have been one of the happiest days of her life, everything she worked for is taken away in one tumultuous moment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the hospital and forced to face the possibility that nothing will ever be the same again, Margaret must figure out how to move forward on her own terms while facing long-held family secrets, devastating heartbreak, and the idea that love might find her in the last place she would ever expect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Walk Away&lt;/i&gt; is Katherine Center at her very best: an utterly charming, hopeful, and romantic novel that will capture reader’s hearts with every page.</description>

  <description>John Scalzi returns with &lt;i&gt;Head On&lt;/i&gt;, the standalone follow-up to the New York Times bestselling and critically acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Lock In&lt;/i&gt;. Chilling near-future SF with the thrills of a gritty cop procedural, &lt;i&gt;Head On&lt;/i&gt; brings Scalzi's trademark snappy dialogue and technological speculation to the future world of sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hilketa is a frenetic and violent pastime where players attack each other with swords and hammers. The main goal of the game: obtain your opponent’s head and carry it through the goalposts. With flesh and bone bodies, a sport like this would be impossible. But all the players are “threeps,” robot-like bodies controlled by people with Haden’s Syndrome, so anything goes. No one gets hurt, but the brutality is real and the crowds love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until a star athlete drops dead on the playing field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it an accident or murder? FBI Agents and Haden-related crime investigators, Chris Shane and Leslie Vann, are called in to uncover the truth―and in doing so travel to the darker side of the fast-growing sport of Hilketa, where fortunes are made or lost, and where players and owners do whatever it takes to win, on and off the field.</description>

  <description>Shaun Mason is a man without a mission. Not even running the news organization he built with his sister has the same urgency as it used to. Playing with dead things just doesn't seem as fun when you've lost as much as he has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a CDC researcher fakes her own death and appears on his doorstep with a ravenous pack of zombies in tow, Shaun has a newfound interest in life. Because she brings news - he may have put down the monster who attacked them, but the conspiracy is far from dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Shaun hits the road to find what truth can be found at the end of a shotgun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen to more in the Newsflesh Trilogy. &lt;br /&gt;©2011 Mira Grant (P)2011 Hachette</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Tara Westover grew up preparing for the End of Days, watching for the sun to darken, for the moon to drip as if with blood. She spent her summers bottling peaches and her winters rotating emergency supplies, hoping that when the World of Men failed, her family would continue on, unaffected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She hadn’t been registered for a birth certificate. She had no school records because she’d never set foot in a classroom, and no medical records because her father didn’t believe in doctors or hospitals. According to the state and federal government, she didn’t exist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she grew older, her father became more radical, and her brother, more violent. At sixteen Tara decided to educate herself. Her struggle for knowledge would take her far from her Idaho mountains, over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she’d travelled too far. If there was still a way home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDUCATED is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty, and of the grief that comes with the severing of the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has, from her singular experience, crafted a universal coming-of-age story, one that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers – the perspective to see one’s life through new eyes, and the will to change it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>He’s the best cop they’ve got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a drug bust turns into a bloodbath it’s up to Inspector Macbeth and his team to clean up the mess. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s also an ex-drug addict with a troubled past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s rewarded for his success. Power. Money. Respect. They’re all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a man like him won’t get to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plagued by hallucinations and paranoia, Macbeth starts to unravel. He’s convinced he won’t get what is rightfully his. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless he kills for it.</description>

  <description>The year was 2014. We had cured cancer. We had beaten the common cold. But in doing so we created something new, something terrible that no one could stop. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The infection spread, virus blocks taking over bodies and minds with one, unstoppable command: &lt;b&gt;FEED&lt;/b&gt;. Now, twenty years after the Rising, bloggers Georgia and Shaun Mason are on the trail of the biggest story of their lives—the dark conspiracy behind the infected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth will get out, even if it kills them.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New Edition found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42286066-orderly-affair" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hospital orderly explores his bisexuality with an adorably geeky lab tech, but can their sparks lead to love outside the closet? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Ian Connolly installs a hookup app to explore his long-suppressed attraction to men, he doesn't expect to connect with anyone he knows, especially not lab tech Callum Price. But from their first scorching encounter, he's hooked. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Callum hasn't had the best luck with love, and he's suffocating under a pile of responsibilities. But when he sees an opportunity to blow off steam with Ian, he takes it. The man is smoking hot, big all over, and sweet as pie. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their chemistry is off the charts, but a relationship is more challenging. Callum remains stubbornly self-reliant, while Ian tries too hard to be his rock. But if Ian can be honest with his family about loving a man, maybe Callum can admit his own truth: He wants a man he can count on, a man just like Ian.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In 2068, androids are an integrated part of human life. Big Brother no longer just watches from the shadows. It’s in every household.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lloyd Salter has OCD issues with noise, mess, and he’s uncomfortable with human interaction. When his ex claimed the only thing perfect enough to live up to his standards was an android, Lloyd dismissed it. But two years later, after much self-assessment, Lloyd thinks he may have been right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SATinc is the largest manufacturer of androids in Australia, including the Fully Compatible Units known as an A-Class 10. Their latest design is the Synthetic Human Android UNit, otherwise known as SHAUN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaun is compatible with Lloyd’s every need; the perfect fit on an intellectual and physical basis. But Lloyd soon realises Shaun’s not like other A-Class androids. He learns. He adapts. Sure that SATinc is aware Shaun functions outside of his programmed parameters, Lloyd must find a way to keep Shaun safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one can know how special Shaun is. No one can know he’s evolved.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;John Scalzi returns with &lt;i&gt;Head On&lt;/i&gt;, a chilling near-future SF with the thrills of a gritty cop procedural. &lt;i&gt;Head On&lt;/i&gt; brings Scalzi's trademark snappy dialogue and technological speculation to the future world of sports.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hilketa is a frenetic and violent pastime where players attack each other with swords and hammers. The main goal of the game: obtain your opponent’s head and carry it through the goalposts. With flesh and bone bodies, a sport like this would be impossible. But all the players are “threeps,” robot-like bodies controlled by people with Haden’s Syndrome, so anything goes. No one gets hurt, but the brutality is real and the crowds love it.&lt;br /&gt;Until a star athlete drops dead on the playing field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it an accident or murder? FBI Agents and Haden-related crime investigators, Chris Shane and Leslie Vann, are called in to uncover the truth―and in doing so travel to the darker side of the fast-growing sport of Hilketa, where fortunes are made or lost, and where players and owners do whatever it takes to win, on and off the field.</description>

  <description>Jean-Pierre "JP" Larocque is a speed demon for the Baltimore Banners. He lives for speed off the ice, too, playing fast and loose with cars and women. But is he really a player, or is his carefree exterior nothing more than a show, hiding a lonely man filled with regret as he struggles to forget the only woman who mattered? Emily Poole thought she knew what she wanted in life, but everything changed five years ago. Now she exists day by day, helping care for her niece after her sister's bitter divorce. It may not be how she envisioned her life, but she's happy. Or so she thinks, until JP re-enters her life. Now she realizes there's a lot more she wants, including a second chance with JP. Can these two lost souls finally find forgiveness and Break Away to the future? Or will the shared tragedy of their past tear them apart for good this time?</description>

  <description>In a corporate-dominated spacefaring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn’t a primary concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid — a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>IN SPACE EVERYONE CAN HEAR YOU SING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A century ago, the Sentience Wars tore the galaxy apart and nearly ended the entire concept of intelligent space-faring life. In the aftermath, a curious tradition was invented-something to cheer up everyone who was left and bring the shattered worlds together in the spirit of peace, unity, and understanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once every cycle, the civilizations gather for the Metagalactic Grand Prix - part gladiatorial contest, part beauty pageant, part concert extravaganza, and part continuation of the wars of the past. Instead of competing in orbital combat, the powerful species that survived face off in a competition of song, dance, or whatever can be physically performed in an intergalactic talent show. The stakes are high for this new game, and everyone is forced to compete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, though, humankind has discovered the enormous universe. And while they expected to discover a grand drama of diplomacy, gunships, wormholes, and stoic councils of aliens, they have instead found glitter, lipstick and electric guitars. Mankind will not get to fight for its destiny - they must sing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A one-hit-wonder band of human musicians, dancers and roadies from London - Decibel Jones and the Absolute Zeroes - have been chosen to represent Earth on the greatest stage in the galaxy. And the fate of their species lies in their ability to rock.</description>

  <description>Clemantine Wamariya was six years old when her mother and father began to speak in whispers, when neighbors began to disappear, and when she heard the loud, ugly sounds her brother said were "thunder." In 1994, she and her fifteen-year-old sister, Claire, fled the Rwandan massacre and spent the next six years wandering through seven African countries, searching for safety--perpetually hungry, imprisoned and abused, enduring and escaping refugee camps, finding unexpected kindness, witnessing inhuman cruelty. They did not know whether their parents were dead or alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Clemantine was twelve, she and her sister were granted asylum in the United States, where she embarked on another journey--to excavate her past and, after years of being made to feel less than human, claim her individuality.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;My name is Amber Reynolds. There are three things you should know about me:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;1. I’m in a coma.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;2. My husband doesn’t love me anymore.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;3. Sometimes I lie.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amber wakes up in a hospital. She can’t move. She can’t speak. She can’t open her eyes. She can hear everyone around her, but they have no idea. Amber doesn’t remember what happened, but she has a suspicion her husband had something to do with it. Alternating between her paralyzed present, the week before her accident, and a series of childhood diaries from twenty years ago, this brilliant psychological thriller asks: Is something really a lie if you believe it's the truth?</description>

  <description>Most of us have experienced what it’s like to know what someone is going to say right before they say it. Or perhaps you have been shocked by the irrefutable phenomena of coincidence, when your life intersects with another’s in the most unlikely way. In gripping prose marked by stark simplicity, &lt;i&gt;Another Place You’ve Never Been&lt;/i&gt; by debut novelist Rebecca Kauffman explores the intersection of human experience amidst the minutiae of everyday life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her mid-thirties and living in Buffalo, NY (where she is originally from), Tracy spends most days at the restaurant where she works as a hostess, despite her aspirations of a career that would make use of her creative talents. Tracy’s life is explored not only though her own personal point of view, but also through the viewpoints of other characters, wherein Tracy may only make a peripheral appearance or even emerge at different periods in her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kauffman subtly exposes the lives of these characters — alongside the presences of spiritually mysterious Native American figures that appear throughout — and gradually reveals the true purposes of both as their paths intersect.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From stand-up comedian, actress, and breakout star of &lt;i&gt;Girls Trip&lt;/i&gt;, Tiffany Haddish, comes&lt;i&gt; The Last Black Unicorn&lt;/i&gt;, a sidesplitting, hysterical, edgy, and unflinching collection of (extremely) personal essays, as fearless as the author herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in one of the poorest neighborhoods of South Central Los Angeles, Tiffany learned to survive by making people laugh. If she could do that, then her classmates would let her copy their homework, the other foster kids she lived with wouldn’t beat her up, and she might even get a boyfriend. Or at least she could make enough money—as the paid school mascot and in-demand Bar Mitzvah hype woman—to get her hair and nails done, so then she might get a boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; None of that worked (and she’s still single), but it allowed Tiffany to imagine a place for herself where she could do something she loved for a living: comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tiffany can’t avoid being funny—it’s just who she is, whether she’s plotting shocking, jaw-dropping revenge on an ex-boyfriend or learning how to handle her newfound fame despite still having a broke person’s mind-set. Finally poised to become a household name, she recounts with heart and humor how she came from nothing and nowhere to achieve her dreams by owning, sharing, and using her pain to heal others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By turns hilarious, filthy, and brutally honest, &lt;i&gt;The Last Black Unicorn&lt;/i&gt; shows the world who Tiffany Haddish really is—humble, grateful, down-to-earth, and funny as hell. And now, she’s ready to inspire others through the power of laughter.</description>
